<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin), on behalf of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, made a statement placing before the House concerns his Committee had in relation to summonses issued on a person involved with the Committee's inquiry into the Australian banking industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have examined the documents presented by the honourable member. In my view the issues involved, as well as being of great importance to the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration in this particular inquiry, have important implications for the House's committee system.</PARA>
<PARA> Although the documents served on the person do not refer specifically to his involvement with the Committee, they do seek to place restraints upon him in general terms in so far as his ability to disclose and use certain information is concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> My understanding of the law is that, even if granted as requested, the orders sought could not expose the person to prosecution on account of what he may say in giving evidence to the Committee. Nevertheless, after seeking advice, I have concluded that the issues are sufficiently important to have counsel seek leave to appear on my behalf before the court when this matter is called on later today to make submissions on the matter of parliamentary privilege. I have accordingly asked that the necessary instructions be issued.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member also referred to the issue of contempt in so far as the witness had complained of what he saw as an attempt to intimidate him. I share the honourable member's concerns that witnesses must be protected. If evidence is forthcoming to support the claim of intimidation, I would naturally give it immediate consideration.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have some concern that the appearance of a Queen's Counsel to argue a case for the Parliament submits the Parliament's rights to the judgment of the court. The Bill of Rights is absolutely clear. The courts cannot under any circumstances prevent the Parliament from conducting its duties, including the examination of public issues, and that is what is at issue here. Whether the Parliament itself makes decisions on how that should be conducted is a matter for the Parliament and the House of Parliament concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I place that on the record because I believe that there have over a number of years been attempts to reduce the rights of Parliament to examine issues and attempts to expand the sub judice rule. I am aware that Westpac Bank itself has said that it may challenge the sub judice rule on the basis that it should not apply where Westpac or other persons feel that it is against their privilege between themselves and their solicitors. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned that this matter may be used as an attempt to deny the Parliament its proper rights in a matter which could well involve very serious allegations which go to the administration and responsibilities of this Parliament. </PARA>

I am very much aware of the rights that the Parliament has and I will go to the barrier to insist that those rights are upheld. The reason that I am seeking leave to intervene in this case today is to specifically put the case before the court about what I feel on behalf of the House about the rights of people who appear before parliamentary committees as witnesses or who may be considering being witnesses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The court ruling cannot have any jurisdiction over what this House or its committees do, and I am sure that the judge who will be hearing this matter will understand that. I think it is sufficiently important, however, in this matter that we should publicly say that-that the reason we are seeking leave to intervene is only for the purpose of our publicly making that point on behalf of the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The object of the Social Security Bill 1990 is to replace the current mishmash and complexities of the Social Security Act 1947 and the more than 100 amending Acts with a new plain English version.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to bring the size of the amended Act to the attention of the Parliament. Comparing it with the explanations which are in these volumes, on a weight for weight basis, one finds that the explanations are greater than the legislation itself. In that regard one wonders whether there is not a further complexity in the Social Security Acts in the explanations that go with them. I am almost reminded of a rewrite of the Bible, but even the Bible did not have the explanatory notes attached to it that this particular legislation has. I am relying on advice from my colleague in the other House that the matter has been explained in clear English-a plainer English version.</PARA>
<PARA> The rewrite of the Act does not involve any major policy initiatives, so we are told, and it does not have any financial impact. It is intended to reflect existing policy, and to make the Act easier to change in the future. It is hoped that it will pave the way for other large pieces of Federal legislation to be written or rewritten in a similar clear English style and format, so that they are more understandable and easier to interpret. </PARA>
<PARA> The first thing that must spring to the attention of honourable members of this House when we talk about rewriting other Federal legislation must be the Income Tax Assessment Act and the associated amendments that are attached to it. If the rewriting of the social security legislation proves a success, I recommend that the rewriting of the Federal Income Tax Assessment Act be the next task to be tackled. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is the culmination of a very interesting experiment to popularise the proposal. An exposure draft was released for public comment in February 1990. Public seminars have been held in each capital city. A legislative working party of the Social Security Advisory Council, led by Professor Terry Carney, has worked closely with the Department of Social Security (DSS) and the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. The end result to date has been welcomed by all the major players. No public or private concern has been expressed by interest groups or media commentators-especially not to the Opposition. However, I suggest that it would take more than a day, a week or a month to digest properly all the pages that comprise the rewrite and the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS) is said to be satisfied with the Bill, indicating that it is uncontroversial and that it contains, at worst, only minor drafting errors. In fact, ACOSS actually supports the Bill. The Welfare Rights Unit, which has particular expertise in reviewing social security legislation, has so far conducted only a cursory examination of the Bill but is persuaded at this stage that it contains no significant policy changes. In fact, that unit has recently established an eight-member working party to conduct a more thorough review. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill comprises 600 pages; the explanatory memorandum is just over 2,000 pages. Any amendments that arise will be brought forward in time for debate in the Senate. The unit has undertaken to forward any proposed changes to the Opposition as soon as they are made available. The Opposition intends in the Senate to refer the legislation to the appropriate committee to allow further time for review. This will also allow any necessary amendments to be caught up with. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the Bill does not contain reference to a recent bilateral agreement with the Netherlands or to the December changes dealing with deeming. I want to deal now with the matter of deeming. Much as the Bill tries to clarify various things, there is still confusion and fear amongst pensioners about the deeming provisions and a lack of simplicity in relation to the implementation and interpretation of the Bill as it stands now. </PARA>
<PARA> On 18 December the Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson, gave the Senate an unequivocal assurance that he would not set a 10 per cent deeming rate on cash and low interest bank accounts held by pensioners and beneficiaries if the rate were not available to people around the country. This clearly meant that the 10 per cent at call, irrespective of the amount, would need to be available from all major commercial banks. Judging from the Minister's statement of 6 February this year, it was evident that none of the major commercial banks had come to the party. </PARA>
<PARA> Because the market was not paying 10 per cent interest on accounts at call, financial institutions were forced to make up contrived accounts to meet the new 10 per cent requirements of the Department of Social Security. None of the so-called special pensioner accounts with the major banks will pay interest on balances less than $2,000. Basically, when this is considered in terms of the relationship between the customer and the bank, it can be seen that it is a flagrant denial of any investor's right to a reasonable rate of return on his funds. Moreover, the ANZ and Westpac banks will not pay interest on the first $2,000, irrespective of the amount invested. On this basis, $3,000 would return a pensioner the grand total in interest of $100 a year. If a pensioner simply kept that sum in Westpac's Advantage Saver cheque account he or she would receive an interest rate of 6.5 per cent, or $195 in interest in a full year. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention also the risk that goes with the marketing of these accounts. In view of the confusion that is rife amongst pensioners at the moment, a pensioner might be persuaded to divide his investment and enter into one of these special arrangements with both ANZ and Westpac, thus denying himself the advantage of having those funds and having $4,000 instead of $2,000 invested without interest being paid and with the deeming provisions then applying. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's disgraceful strong-arm tactics will result in any pensioner who moves money across to the ANZ or Westpac prescribed funds losing about $95 a year. Of course, that amount is doubled if a pensioner has an account in both banks. Yet on AM on 23 August 1990 the Minister, when discussing his scheme to force pensioners to maximise their incomes, said:</PARA>
<PARA>But the truth is, every single person affected by this deeming provision actually finishes better off, more money in their pockets to spend. </PARA>
<PARA>As a result of what has happened in this regard, it is no wonder that pensioners have lost all faith in the Government and these particular deeming provisions. Pensioners are confused and concerned and this results in probably more representations to my office than I receive on any other social security issue. It is interesting to note that on, I think, Monday of this week there was a meeting of concerned pensioners in Melbourne which was addressed by Daryl Dixon. The meeting agreed more or less unanimously that the deeming provisions were not working, that they were not clear and that there was room for some rectification. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area of concern regarding the deeming provisions relates to loans to charitable organisations on which the organisations pay low rates of interest. This has been of particular concern to me as the shadow spokesman for aged care. Entry contributions to hostels were to be exempt from the deeming provisions but ongoing contributions and gifts were not. Many organisations involved in providing hostel accommodation for the aged rely on an ongoing flow of cash by way of loan or by gifting in order just to survive. The resources of these organisations are strictly limited. The importance of interest free or low interest loans being made available on an unrestricted basis is extremely critical to their survival-and these loans are approved under various Acts of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the announcement of the Budget intentions, the Opposition, the Voluntary Care Association of New South Wales and Australian Capital Territory, other voluntary care associations around the country-such as the Lutheran Homes in South Australia-and numerous other charitable organisations have urged the Government not to deny the use of pensioner loans at little or no interest to pensioners needing ongoing care. I said in my speech to Parliament in November last year that we must not, and cannot, afford to restrict support of aged care organisations to the fees of pensioner patients and Government grants. I am pleased to say that following this pressure from the Opposition and from the voluntary and charitable organisations around the country, the Minister has agreed to exempt from the deeming provisions loans and deposits with church or charitable funds if those loans or deposits are utilised for the purpose of capital expenditure. This announcement has been welcomed by all the aged care organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I do understand that the Australian Democrats, who are ever keen to grab some type of publicity and who use special interest and minority groups in this quest, are pressing some aged care organisations to support an amendment which would allow ongoing loans and gifts to be used for recurrent funding of hostels. They are urging these organisations to set out the issues and are pointing out that these organisations will have to close or limit services unless the Government amends its legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> This is really a fairly desperate bid to gain public attention, it is irresponsible, and shows a lack of appreciation and understanding on the part of a political party of the existing conditions that apply to the funding in the aged care industry which, if there is a need for money for recurrent expenditure, can be gained through the entry contribution by diminution over the first few years and by using the interest on those funds. There is also a provision that if a person can pay more of his or her weekly accommodation and rental at a hostel the amount of the funding from the Commonwealth diminishes. As I have said, the Democrats display an abysmal lack of appreciation and understanding of the provisions that already exist. </PARA>
<PARA> Anyone with just a little knowledge of the cost of aged care and the increasing costs facing the country in the future knows that it makes sense for user contributions to be used, in this case to fund capital expenditure-that is, original capital expenditure for the accommodation, renovations or replacement-and for the Government to fund operating costs. It would be a retrograde step for aged care if the Democrats were to get what they want. In any event, if a hostel proprietor wishes to use the interest on ingoing contributions to supplement recurrent expenditure, as I said before, he or she is perfectly free to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats tried to score further political points with their amendment to exempt the family farm from the assets test for family allowance supplement. The decision by the Government to impose an assets test for the family allowance supplement was a Budget initiative which the coalition parties did not oppose. In a letter sent to editors of rural newspapers the Democrats used this particular point in a rather crude attempt to claim all the credit for the coalition's decision to block the introduction of an assets test on family allowance. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition's decision was based on the needs of people who live in poverty-prone rural Australia, a matter that Senator Richardson, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and this Government have not concerned themselves with. Nor have they concerned themselves in a large measure with the rural recession that the Government itself engineered. I need only remind the House of the quote of the Treasurer: `It is a recession Australia had to have'. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Democrats did not make clear was their fundamentally anti-rural bias. If they are really concerned with the survival of the rural sector, why do they still propose to reintroduce death duties for properties worth more than $300,000; introduce a Federal land tax; continue and strengthen the capital gains tax; abolish the live sheep export trade; reduce and ultimately ban intensive animal production; place stricter bureaucratic controls on all areas of agriculture, including land use; repeal the plant variety rights legislation; prevent the privatisation of most government enterprises; reduce the public funding of private schools; and remove individual choice in the education system?</PARA>
<PARA> In that last respect I point out the disaster facing some families in rural Australia, particularly as a result of the wool crisis. I have heard from honourable members on my own side that some families will not be able to educate their children; they will not have the choice of a private or a public school. That should be a matter of great concern to the Government and the Democrats. It is certainly of concern to us. </PARA>
<PARA> This is no centre of the road, keep the bastards honest-as Don Chipp put it-party; this is an outfit determined to fill the vacuum on the left of Australian politics which it believes to have been vacated by the Australian Labor Party. The latest example is its total opposition to Australia's involvement in the Gulf conflict. Unfortunately, this Party will continue to pander to the fears, ignorance and prejudices of those confused and embittered by the Government's massive failure to revive the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> On another social security matter, I would like to bring to the attention of the Minister the advice which continually seems to be given to applicants for the Jobsearch allowance and the unemployment benefit-that they are not allowed to do voluntary work while receiving the unemployment benefit or the Jobsearch allowance. A constituent of mine has recently written to me concerning her daughter. Her position as a shop assistant for a local grocery store was terminated. When she finished work, she applied for and received permission from the local branch of the National Parks and Wildlife Service to do voluntary work, with the aim in mind of proving her ability and working voluntarily until a position became vacant. I want to read a particular passage from this letter that really conveyed to me the fact that this is a person who desperately wants to work, is prepared to play her part in being an Australian and has the incentive to get out and earn. When her position was terminated-and I am not sure what the reasons were; it probably would have been the recession-her employer said:</PARA>
<PARA>If I had three workers with her willingness to work and in fact do the work as well, I wouldn't need any more staff. </PARA>
<PARA>This relates to one of our young people who works and works well. In this voluntary job with the National Parks and Wildlife Service she worked eight hours a day, five days a week doing jobs such as mowing, weeding, cleaning toilets and planting trees-very much demonstrating the community caring aspect. She was contented and happy within herself and looked forward to the day when she could apply for permanent work, starting as a labourer and hoping to work her way up the ladder within the National Parks and Wildlife Service. Her mother wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> During the period she did voluntary work, her bus fares to and from Airlie Beach cost $59, so we, as parents, advised her to apply for Job Search Allowance when her holiday pay finished in order that she would at least have her fares paid. </PARA>
<PARA> However, she was told by Commonwealth Employment Service, in my presence, that she was forbidden to do any voluntary work whilst receiving the allowance, and that she had to apply for two, and only two jobs per fortnight. I was shocked, to say the least, and pointed out that my daughter had shown some initiative by doing voluntary work and that in her opinion she was paying back the government for the pittance she would receive after we, her parents, were means tested. </PARA>
<PARA> The CES worker informed me that she would be unable to apply for her two jobs if doing other work, and if she was found to be doing same her allowance would be terminated immediately. How ridiculous! How long does it take one to apply for a position-40 hours (8 hrs x 5 days)?</PARA>
<PARA>I think we have to conclude that the whole situation is ridiculous. I believe that provided the person remains uncommitted to the business operators applying the voluntary work, provided the unemployed person is using the opportunity for training and continues to look for jobs elsewhere, there should be no reason why Jobsearch allowance or unemployment benefits should be jeopardised or why the current restrictions are imposed by Commonwealth Employment Service (CES). I find the suggestion that a person should be limited to only two applications for positions in any fortnight patently ridiculous; it restricts incentive, which was shown by this young lass and which is necessary to help Australia out of the current economic recession. I have today written to the manager of the CES at the point of contact in my electorate, but I would also appreciate the Minister's comment on this situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention this because it highlights one of the other deficiencies of the social security system. We are addressing a massive social security Bill and its rewording to bring simplicity and clear up a lot of the English expression; hopefully, we will then be able to work with it a lot better. In the two examples I have given-the deeming provisions and Jobsearch allowance-there is no similar simplicity in the administration and delivery of these services. What is needed is a more commonsense application. I have mentioned only two of the programs; I am sure that my colleagues could mention many more programs for income security which are muddled and, in some cases, stupid. The Minister should now address himself to this further simplicity and commonsense approach to the delivery of those services. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, in the Senate the coalition will refer this Bill to an appropriate committee to get further clarification and understanding of it. Hopefully, by the time it passes through the Senate with whatever amendments are necessary, we will have a document from which we can work. I bring those other matters to the attention of the Minister for his attention. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with pleasure that I rise to support the Social Security Bill, as I personally believe it is a cornerstone in the history of our country's social security system. Any legislation which seeks to keep pace with the changing needs of our society and adjust to those needs should be recommended.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As part of the overall reform of our social security system, the Bill before us marks the first time ever that an Act has been almost completely rewritten to enable the more efficient running of the social security system. The 1947 Social Security Act allowed for the consolidation of five welfare related Acts which existed at the time. They were the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act 1908-1946, the Child Endowment Act 1941-1945, the Widows' Pension Act 1942-1946, the Maternity Allowance Act 1912-1944 and the Unemployment and Sickness Benefits Act 1944. This is why the structure of the current Act is somewhat hard to follow. More than 100 amending pieces of legislation have been enacted since 1947 to enable governments and their policies to keep up with social changes. This has led to an Act containing a number of different styles and terms, which have at times been very confusing. </PARA>
<PARA> It was this Labor Government which consequently decided in March of 1988 to review the legislation encompassing the 1947 Act. Following the establishment of the legislation working party, assisted by a small team from the legal branch of the Department of Social Security, the structure and form of the Act was examined and reviewed and the rewriting of the Act into clear English was accomplished. The language contained in this Bill should therefore make the meaning of the legislation apparent and unclouded to the reader. It was obviously not an easy task to rewrite that 1947 Act. In doing so, the drafter has had to attempt to restate the rules in a simpler but equally accurate and precise way. </PARA>
<PARA> Where conflict arose between precision and simplicity, the drafter apparently has ensured that precision prevailed. Consequently some parts of the Act may still be a little confusing at first glance, but the reader aids now provided in the Act should help sort out any readability problems. </PARA>
<PARA> A few examples of clear English in this Bill are as follows: instead of `ascertained in accordance with the formula' the clear English version is `worked out using the formula'; instead of `commence', `start' or `begin' are used; and `pursuant to' or `in pursuance of' is replaced with `because of'. I believe that the rewriting of this Act in clear and understandable English marks yet another step in the much needed reform of Australia's social security system by our Hawke Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> When our Government came into power in 1983, the number of social security pensioners and beneficiaries was at a record level, mainly because of the recession which had begun in 1982 under the previous Liberal-National coalition Government. The Hawke Government then set about to amend the situation and to restructure the social security system to make it more accountable and effective. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1983 the value of almost all pension and benefits payments has increased in real terms. Pensions are now more than 25.8 per cent of average weekly earnings, the highest proportion since 1949. Families needing income support are receiving greater real levels of payment than ever before. All of this has been achieved while simultaneously cutting social security expenditure as a proportion of the gross domestic product from 7.1 per cent to 5.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Labor Government's overall strategy has been to achieve equity in the distribution of economic resources; equity of civil, legal and industrial rights; fair and equal access to essential services, such as housing, health and education; and the opportunity for participation by all in personal development, community life and decision making. </PARA>
<PARA> This Labor Government has endeavoured to maintain and improve real levels of support to ensure the adequacy of social security payments. It has encouraged entry into education, training and employment, and it has attempted to provide major assistance to low income families with children in order to tackle the problem of child poverty. It has taken the Hawke Labor Government to target social security programs to ensure that they assist those most in need and to introduce administrative reforms for greater effectiveness, efficiency and integrity. </PARA>
<PARA> Basically, this Government has had to find an acceptable balance between care and accountability under its social security portfolio, and I commend our present Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) for the work that he has done in achieving these goals. Through the expert management and restructuring of social security policy and administration begun under the former Minister for Social Security, the honourable member for Batman (Mr Howe), we have achieved many of our objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia now has one of the most efficient welfare systems in the world. Unlike systems in the United States and Europe, which are insurance based, the Australian social security system is means tested, targeted to those most in need and funded from general revenue. Achievements of the Hawke Labor Government in social justice policy have included real increases in the value of social security payments and the removal of significant poverty traps. </PARA>
<PARA> Another policy achievement since 1983 has been the closer integration of the social security, education and labour market system to provide better opportunities for people to move from dependence on social security provisions into employment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Social Security has also endeavoured to become more efficient in its administration through the better use of technology and through increased support for staff serving the community. This has led to a number of changes and reforms being made to departmental administration and to social security programs. To aid these reforms, a social security review was established at the end of 1985 to target assistance where it was most needed; ensure greater adequacy of incomes; encourage and assist clients to enter or return to the work force or to provide for their own income security; and develop support for families, particularly those on low incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of issue papers have resulted from the social security review, and action on five of those papers has already been taken. The major reforms as a consequence of these papers have been made basically in relation to families, the unemployed, sole parents and the aged. According to the booklet Reform of Social Security Policies and Administration 1983-1990, put out by the former Minister for Social Security following the 1989-90 Budget, `achievements within the social security portfolio over the last few years have been substantial and noteworthy'. </PARA>
<PARA> These achievements have included `significant increases in the rates of payment of pensions, benefits and allowances and increases in the free areas (to encourage self-help and financial independence among clients)'; `extensions of, and substantial increases in, rent assistance'; `increased coverage of the needs of particular client groups-for example, increased assistance to sole parents and the introduction of the Child Support Scheme and the Jobs, Education and Training program'; `significantly increased assistance to families-Family Allowance Supplement'-the supplement is being paid at much higher rates to many more people than was the old family income supplement; `increased rates of additional pension and benefits, in line with the FAS rates'; `rationalisation of outmoded provisions'; `an increase in the proportion of the labour force who are independent of the social security system'; and `indexation of family payments, rent assistance and the income tax free area'. </PARA>
<PARA> I must re-emphasise that all of these achievements have been accomplished at the same time as substantial restraint in social security expenditure has been achieved. Of particular interest to me and the constituents I represent have been the changes and the reforms to family assistance and child support programs. More people from my electorate claim family allowance and family allowance supplement-related benefits than do constituents of any one other electorate in Australia. Claims for these benefits outweigh claims for any other social security benefits by people in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to say that the Prospect electorate has the Fairfield social security regional office and shares part of the Merrylands and Cabramatta regional offices of social security. The Fairfield Social Security office alone had some 15,828 clients claiming family payments as of 14 September 1990. Consequently, the Government's achievements in the family assistance area are of great importance to my electorate. These achievements include the introduction of benchmarks of adequacy for child payments, brought in in 1989. These benchmarks increased family income support and are, I believe, a key part of the Government's initiatives on child poverty. The combined family allowance and family allowance supplement rates have consequently been set at 15 per cent of the married pension rate for children under 13 years of age and 20 per cent of the married pension rate for 13- to 15-year-old children. Family allowance rates were also increased substantially in July 1989, and all child payments were indexed from January 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> Nationally, some 3.8 million children in almost two million families around Australia benefit from family allowance. When one considers that statistic, it is an enormous assistance going out to those families by this Hawke Labor Government. More than one million children who come from low income families receive extra assistance from either the family allowance supplement or additional pension or benefit payments. Both payments are not taxed. Children of separated parents now benefit from more adequate and regular financial support from non-custodial parents as a result of the introduction of the child support scheme. This scheme helps ensure that the support of children is shared by the non-custodial parent. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important reform which has had a positive effect on low income families has been the significant increases in the rate of rent assistance to help those families since 1983. More than 640,000 pensioners, beneficiaries and low income earners benefit from this rent assistance. As from March of this year, rent assistance will also be indexed twice a year in line with the consumer price index. </PARA>
<PARA> It is reforms like these to our social security system which have really been of benefit to the Australian people. At last, through the efforts and the initiatives of the Hawke Labor Government we have seen rates of payment rise in real terms; incentives and opportunities for self-help enhanced; social security programs more fairly targeted; and administration tightened and improved. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the booklet Reform of Social Security Policies and Administration, the challenge now is to maintain the gains of reform. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>The integrity of and public support for the social security system must be protected, while measures aimed at providing greater effectiveness and administrative efficiency, including improved client service, continue to be pursued vigorously. </PARA>
<PARA> In the limited time I have left, I would like to commend the staff of the Department of Social Security employed in those three offices I mentioned: the Fairfield, Cabramatta and Merrylands social security offices. The statistics I have supplied to the House during this debate highlight the enormous pressure those staff face through the number of people seeking assistance. Like the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), I too have had a number of complaints in this regard, but at the same time I wish to congratulate publicly those staff on a job well done in such extenuating circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that, at times, reform, assistance and help can be given to those staff members to help them put up with the pressure and provide them with the ability to go with the tide as those people come in. The electorate I represent is of such complexity with people from so many nations from all over the world that it certainly provides a challenge to those people working in the social security offices. I believe the reform in the Bill will go a long way towards assisting people to understand and appreciate the social security system itself. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with the honourable member for Dawson that the Bill consists of 600-odd pages and over 2,000 pages of explanatory notes. I found it interesting reading. I also recollect that when I was in another place and another government that was trying to rewrite a separate Act of local government we faced trying times in attempting to bring plain English to fruition. I believe that this Bill is a benchmark in legislation. It is something that governments all over Australia must adopt. We cannot have the people we represent and the people who administer our legislation unable to understand and appreciate what Bills are about and what they mean. Too often we have had misinterpretation because of the language structure of a particular piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> This is 1991 and we can no longer face the twenty-first century as a government unless we are prepared to restructure our legislation to enable people throughout Australia to understand it, and therefore appreciate it and know where we are heading. I commend the Bill to the House. I again commend not only our Minister on the implementation and the finalisation of this social security reform but also all the other people and committees that were involved in a long, intensive and very precise presentation of the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was rather surprised to hear the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), in the context of this particular legislation, the Social Security Bill, go on at some length to trumpet the achievements of the Hawke Government in the area of social security. I would have thought that in talking about the achievements of the Hawke Government perhaps the only thing it will go down in history as having been remembered for is overloading the social security system to an enormous extent. This Government-induced recession that we are experiencing is forcing many thousands of Australians to turn-for the first time in their lives on many occasions-to welfare assistance. The honourable member talks about the Fairfield social security office. I imagine the queues there must be extending out the door and down the street to the extent that they will need to call the police soon to control the crowds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Getting back to the issue at hand, we are talking about a Bill which deals with some important matters. The Social Security Bill is extremely commendable as far as the Opposition is concerned in that it seeks to replace the current complexities of the original 1947 Act and the more than 100 subsequent amendments with a new layman's English version. We would expect-I think the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) has indicated-that this will pave the way for other pieces of legislation to be rewritten in a clear English style and format. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill was released for public comment in February last year. That has made it a very interesting and successful experiment to popularise legislation, to bring it down to earth as it were and to make it meaningful and relevant to the average person. The Bill has the support of the Opposition in that it reasonably fulfils its objectives of making each individual provision as simple and easy to read as possible and arranging the provisions in a logical and easy to follow format. </PARA>
<PARA> However, although the objectives were not to change the existing legislation, I nevertheless believe that the Government has missed an excellent opportunity to update some other aspects of the 1947 Act. Recently a constituent contacted me regarding the fact that she was on the invalid pension and her husband was unable to receive a spouse's pension. In the case of a male invalid pensioner, his wife is automatically entitled to a spouse's pension. In this case, however, despite the fact that she was the main breadwinner for the family before her illness, her husband could only get a carer's pension. The carer's pension requires a report from the doctor giving details of the type of personal care being given to the pensioner by the carer. </PARA>
<PARA> The implication of the comment here on the respective roles of men and women, vis-a-vis who is actually caring for the other, is out of step with society today. My constituent, quite rightly I believe, finds it demeaning to have to go to her doctor to furnish a report regularly when male invalid pensioners are not subject to the same treatment. I find it incredible that in this day and age, when governments across the country have implemented laws to prevent sexual discrimination in the workplace, such a situation can continue to exist within the Social Security Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I wrote to the Minister for Social Security to bring this particular anomaly to his attention and to ask him to seek to remedy the situation expeditiously. I received a reply from the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca), in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I do understand your constituent's concerns that a ``spouses pension'' is not payable to her husband. </PARA>
<PARA>It is true that a number of the provisions of the Social Security Act involve different treatment of men and women. This situation is a reflection of the different community expectations about the role of women in society and the workforce which prevailed when the particular forms of assistance were introduced. </PARA>
<PARA>With the growing participation of women in the workforce, these provisions may seem as inconsistent with the aim of promoting equality between the sexes. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, the Parliamentary Secretary goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government has already introduced a number of changes in recent years to restructure the social security system so that it meets the needs of the 1990's. </PARA>
<PARA>As a result of changes introduced on 1 July 1987 widows Class B pension is gradually being phased out and widows pension and sole parents pension are no longer available to women once their children turn 16. In addition, discrimination has been removed from income support arrangements for sole parents. On 1 March 1989, widows pension and supporting parents pension were merged into a new pension called sole parents pension. This new pension gives the same assistance to both male and female sole parents. </PARA>
<PARA>A new Widowed Persons Allowance which does not discriminate on the basis of age or sex has already been introduced. The Widowed Persons Allowance may be paid for 12 weeks to eligible men and women--</PARA>

<PARA>The Widowed Persons Allowance may be paid for 12 weeks to eligible men and women who are newly widowed and who do not have a child which would qualify them for a sole parents pension. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally he makes this very perceptive comment:</PARA>
<PARA>There is clearly a need to keep the Social Security Act under review and the issue of a ``spouses pension'' will be considered in the context of options for broader redevelopment of income support programs. </PARA>
<PARA>One would need to read that letter with a dictionary on hand and would need to have a fairly detailed understanding of what it is all about, because the answer is extremely confusing. It did not turn out to be terribly helpful at all. We wonder why people are confused. The honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), in his remarks, was pointing to the complexities of the system. Obviously the problems of the system go way beyond semantics. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill before us deals with semantics. We recognise the importance of having clear and understandable legislation, but the sort of problems that we daily encounter in our electorate offices are not so much matters of semantics as matters of practice and principle. This particular instance that I brought to the attention of the House today involving a constituent of mine points out a matter of fairly fundamental sexual discrimination and it really goes very much to the core of the system. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Dawson alluded to some of the changes that have been made to the system. As if the system was not already complex enough, with the changes being introduced and implemented on top of changes, which has gone on and on, it has grown like Topsy to the point where we almost need a university course to understand the social security system. Of course, with the deeming provisions that the Government has inflicted on the community, particularly pensioners, it has delivered almost the coup de grace. Those provisions have totally confused everybody and upset people-to a large extent, unnecessarily. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has been shown that the announced changes are flawed in a number of important respects. I will bring them to the attention of the House, and there are a number of them. The $2,000 threshold is too low to provide pensioners with an adequate level of emergency funds; the flat threshold implies that two can live as cheaply as one, yet the rest of the social security system is totally inconsistent with that because it proceeds on exactly the opposite basis; and the flat rate of 10 per cent is too high and could force pensioners into risky non-bank investments about which they know very little. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to my correspondence and other members' correspondence, the Minister has provided a list of banks which will offer 10 per cent per annum interest. I passed on some of that information to pensioners who had requested it and they found out that there were some ridiculous stipulations. For instance, most of the banks require a minimum transaction of $500. Assuming a pensioner has to pay out a $50 account, he or she would have to then effectively circumvent the law in some way by withdrawing a bigger amount and then re-banking the balance. In other words, that person would have to go to a whole lot of trouble to engage in what should have been a very simple operation. None of the major banks presently offers 10 per cent at call on amounts just over $2,000. Further, there is no announced intention to allow the Minister to vary the interest rate. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard that interest rates are coming down and we have been told they are coming down fairly quickly, yet the Minister has made no mention about reducing the deeming rate of 10 per cent. He indicated that he would keep the matter under consideration, but so far he has not done so. There are a number of important unanswered questions about the deeming provisions, particularly technical questions relating to interest rates. Is the interest rate to be a nominal or an effective rate? What if bank account balances fluctuate around the $2,000 mark? How many forms will pensioners have to fill in? We really do put pensioners to an enormous amount of trouble. </PARA>
<PARA> A case was recently brought to my attention where a pensioner went into her bank to adjust her affairs to comply with the Government's requirements. Even though she had been a customer of the particular bank for many years, for one reason or another she needed to open a new account. She was an elderly lady and she was told that she had to provide all sorts of information in order to score the necessary points to be able to open a new account. It was actually this lady's son who rang me. He said, `My mother is over 80 and she has great difficulty coming to grips with all these changes'. One can imagine the difficulties that this lady faced when the bank asked for documents such as a birth certificate and other things so that she could score 100 points, simply to open a new account at the bank in which she had been a customer for probably 30 or 40 years. So there are enormous complications in the social security system. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation is important because it deals with simplification of language. However, surely the basic concern ought to be with a considerable simplification of the social security system, which has grown to the point where it is almost out of control. People, particularly pensioners who have been affected so adversely by recent changes to the legislation, have great difficulty in understanding what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA> To return to the Bill that we are considering today, I would have thought that the modernisation of the text-that is really all we are talking about, strictly speaking-might have provided the perfect opportunity for the Government to bring the legislation in line with existing social values. I refer specifically here to sexual discrimination. I am not talking about token changes to the text of legislation to avoid genderspeak. We have seen plenty of examples of that in recent times and the approach to genderspeak has gone way over the top. We are nevertheless talking about the need for legislation to treat men and women consistently and equally as they are regarded in society today. I do not believe that that ought to be difficult to do. We need to recognise that men and women are equal under the law and they ought to be treated that way. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that the changes that we are talking about would require a great policy adjustment on the part of the Government. As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security makes quite clear in his letter to me, the Government is committed to ridding the Act of sexual discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that such a basic and commonsense adjustment could have been made in rewriting the Act. I find it incredible that this new, updated rewriting is actually perpetuating the old gender roles that clearly should not have any place in legislation today. I urge the Government to look at rectifying these problems with appropriate legislation as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that one of the advantages of the new format is that it will be easier to make clear changes. Notwithstanding many of the criticisms that can be levelled-and I am sure will be levelled-in this debate at the social security system, we nevertheless do welcome this particular Bill, and in fact we would encourage the Government to embark on a process of rewriting other Acts in a similar fashion in order that legislation can be read and understood easily by common people-such as politicians, I suppose. We are the ones, probably the only ones--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, the legislation before us today is a rewrite of the Social Security Act 1947 and more than 100 pieces of amending legislation that have occurred since then.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The 1947 Act brought into a consolidated form five welfare related Acts that were in existence at that time, they being the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act 1908-46, the Child Endowment Act 1941-45, the Widows' Pension Act 1942-46, the Maternity Allowance Act 1912-44, and the Unemployment and Sickness Benefits Act 1944. </PARA>
<PARA> It might be pertinent to have a look at the nature of our social security system at the time of the consolidation of the Act in 1947. If we go back to 1908, the Invalid and Old-age Pensions Act was passed under pressure from the Labor Party by the Deakin Government. During the period 1941-1949, Federal Labor governments made significant advances in the provision of welfare services. In 1942 the widows' pension was instigated; in 1943 funeral benefits; in 1943 again there was an expansion of maternity benefits; and in 1944 there was the introduction of unemployment and sickness benefits. In 1946 the Chifley Government consolidated many of these achievements by introducing a proposal to alter section 51 of the Constitution to authorise the Federal Government to provide a wide range of social services, which was overwhelmingly supported by the Australian people. So our social security system is very much seen as a Commonwealth role. </PARA>
<PARA> As has been said, in revising the Social Security Act, the opportunity has been taken to put it in plain English terms. I just wish to touch on the concept of the conversion of legislation to plain English. For some time I have been interested in the report of the Law Reform Commission of Victoria entitled Plain English and the Law. In that report the question is posed: why is plain English important? I quote from that report:</PARA>
<PARA>Plain English in legislation is important because it helps members of the public to comply with their legal obligations and to obtain benefits to which they are entitled. Laws and documents should not be drafted on the assumption that a trained lawyer will be available to interpret them. Plain English in legislation is also important because it saves money. Poorly drafted laws impose costs on those who administer them and on those whose conduct they are intended to control. Time is wasted in trying to understand them. Lawyers have to be employed to interpret them. </PARA>
<PARA>That is one of the problems with much of the legislation that is considered here. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested in the byplay that occurred towards the end of the speech of the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford). Again, with due respect to not only the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security, the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca), but also the shadow Minister at the table, it should not be that only our legal colleagues in this chamber are able to understand the type of legislation that we are discussing. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Costello" NAMEID="CT4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HH4">Mr JENKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes! And that is one of the more important aspects of reviewing our legislation: to enable us as parliamentarians to have a greater opportunity for a clear understanding of what it is that we are discussing. In the context of this Social Security Bill, it is important that those at whom these pieces of legislation are aimed should also have the ability to understand what is being considered. Before entering this place I worked in the Public Service. One of the more intriguing aspects of the Public Service is the degree of specialisation that can occur. People become specialists in areas of legislation, and there is considerable compartmentalisation because of that. As people develop-through work experience-a knowledge of the relevant piece of legislation, instead of acquiring a broader knowledge of what is occurring, their knowledge becomes more defined and more focused. I think that is quite unfortunate, because in the conduct of business with members of the public it often leads to what appears to be buck-passing but what is really a matter of referral to somebody who has that expert knowledge. Perhaps if we come to terms with the way in which we couch our legislation there will not be that need, and there will not be that apparent degree of chopping and changing when people contact departments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the report of the Law Reform Commission of Victoria a study by Coopers and Lybrand is referred to. The study, into the type of language employed in forms used by the United Kingdom Department of Health and Social Security, identified a number of varieties of costs that occurred because of the lack of clarity in those forms. Firstly, there was the cost to the Department, which included staff time for interviews, telephone calls, visits, postage, telephone, stationery, travel and subsistence. Then there was the cost to respondents as a result of the additional time spent on the interviews that resulted from the forms, and there were also the costs to employers of the respondents because of the time that was taken away from work in explaining what might have been more simply put in the information given in the forms that were provided by the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that a lot of advances have been made, especially in the Department of Social Security, in looking at the types of forms that are used. Indeed, there has been a great advance in the style of letters which are sent out by the Department. I believe that the Parliamentary Secretary still has an ongoing review of those matters. I think that that is very important, because not only should there be precision when people need to know their rights, but also when a decision is made on the basis of a claim that they put to the Department, that should be explained to them in the clearest possible terms so that they have an understanding of what is really going on. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Law Reform Commission's report a condemnation of the Social Security Act 1947 by the then chairperson of the Victorian Division of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, Mr Chris Loorham, is quoted. In November 1986 he had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Other Parliaments in Australia seem to be able to pass or amend legislation in a manner that is at least intelligible to well educated persons. It is unfortunate that the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia allows legislation such as the Social Security Act 1947 to remain on the statute books which is almost totally unintelligible to anyone. The fact that this Act directly touches the lives of every person belonging to this country gives the Tribunal even greater cause for concern. The current state of this most important Act can only be described as a national disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA>With this legislation we have an opportunity to rectify such a national disgrace. Given the bipartisan comments that have been made in this debate and the comments of relevant community groups during the period of consultation, I think we have had some success in bringing about that type of change in the style of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, much legislation appears to be shrouded in legal mystique-legal mumbo jumbo. Sometimes when there is debate about the relevance of plain English, the legal fraternity argues that because our law is based on precedent there is some danger in plain English. One of the questions that is asked is whether plain English legislation is incompatible with precision. Some relevant comments have been made about that. Often it is not the precision and clarity of the written word that is at fault; rather, it is the lack of clarity and precision of the underlying policy the legislation tries to put in place. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is incumbent on us, as we try to achieve plain English legislation, to understand the need for clarity and precision in the underlying policy. I believe there is an understanding of that need for a clear underlying policy base in the legislation before us today. The problem does not relate just to language. This legislation is a clear example that the problem is not merely a matter of words. In the structure and format of the legislation there is an attempt to make it, in the technological jargon, user friendly. I think that is important. </PARA>
<PARA> If we had taken as a basis the 1947 Act and subsequent amending legislation and tried merely to change the words, we still would have been left with the same problems. Inevitably, it would have been a headache trying to wend one's way through the many pages of the legislation. That is another important aspect of the exercise that has culminated in the Bill presently before the House. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, one of the major achievements has been to lessen the complexity of the policies that are put in place by the legislation. Examples have been cited of the changes that have been made which give some indication of the way in which the legislation attempts to explain better what is intended. For example, the old subsection 158 (1) states:</PARA>
<PARA>The grant or payment of a pension under Part 4 shall not be made except upon the making of a claim for that pension. </PARA>
<PARA>This is to be replaced by the new subclause 48 (1), which states:</PARA>
<PARA>A person who wants to be granted an age pension must make a proper claim for that pension. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that illustrates what has occurred in this exercise and gives one some hope that it will achieve the goal that has been set for this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to talk not only about the change in the legislation but also about the change in attitude in the social security area in the life of the Hawke Government. As a simple illustration, the general philosophy that abounded in the Public Service was that, if somebody wanted to front up to a department such as Social Security to make a claim, that person should have some knowledge of his or her entitlements; it was not the role of the department to explain the opportunities that might be open to that person. Fortunately, there has been a refreshing change in that attitude. Now departments see as one of their responsibilities a requirement to explain fully to potential clients the opportunities available to them. I think it is important that the community should have an expectation that people have a right to knowledge of what is available to them. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been a number of real achievements in the benefits available to the community. There have been real increases in the value of benefits and significant poverty traps have been removed. There has been better targeting of payments, and there have been moves to ensure that relevant payments are indexed. I think we can all remember how in the past welfare and social service payments were used as political footballs. In the 23 Budgets brought down between 1949 and 1972, seven preceded an election by less than six months. In those Budgets that preceded an election by less than six months, the average increase in the standard age pension was $1.04. In the other 16 Budgets, the average increase was 53c-just over half of that election Budget amount. With the indexation of benefits we have moved away from that tinkering with the system. That is another positive step because it moves important benefits away from the direct political arena. </PARA>
<PARA> Another illustration of the vast attitudinal change taking place concerns the linkages between and the integration across different departments and agencies. For example, there is a close integration of the social security system, the labour market system and our education system. Programs such as jobs, education and training, or JET, and Newstart have been very important. It is now seen that income support is not the only thing we should be looking at. We should not think that because we provide an adequate level of income support the job has been well done. If we are trying to move to an active society in which we are able to increase the opportunities that are available to all, we should give assistance across the board. We must realise that some assistance can be even more meaningful than mere income support. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a little disappointing to see that some of the policy changes contemplated by the Opposition include proposals that apparently would lead to the fragmentation of the coordination we have been able to achieve. I refer to the one-line statements the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has made about voucher systems for health care, for example, and other things. I think it was in October 1990 that the Opposition suggested that if it was elected to government it would dismantle the Department of Social Security and use non-government agencies to make payments. That caused a great degree of debate and criticism throughout the community. I do not think it would have led to what was intended; that is, some degree of efficiency and, therefore, some degree of saving in the system. </PARA>
<PARA> It really gives me no great pleasure to note that only three Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries-Portugal, Japan and America-outlay less money than we do on social expenditure; that is, on health education, welfare services and income support. I believe that is not something that one should trumpet. Perhaps, as a society, we need to look more closely at what expenditure we provide and perhaps the level could be greater. It irks me that when we have a debate in the community there is an apparent belief that the impost on the public purse is even greater. I find that most unfortunate. If we are going to have this type of debate let us be fair about it, let us understand what the real levels of expenditure are and let us understand that the public sector is asked to make only a modest contribution in the area of social expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I am pleased to join with all honourable members who have spoken so far in this debate in this place in support of this legislation. I think this is a major step forward. Hopefully, other pieces of legislation will be treated in the same manner. The honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) mentioned the income tax legislation and I totally agree with him that we should be looking at making it more understandable. I conclude with the remarks made by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) when he circulated the pro forma legislation that `Social justice demands that it be an accessible piece of legislation'--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was good to hear the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) getting his last few words in. Mr Deputy Speaker, I accept, on his behalf, the little bit of tolerance you extended to him. Although there is unanimity in the belief that a total review of the Social Security Act is long overdue, especially for the need of its rewrite in plain English, I have to disagree with some of the previous speakers on the other side and say that, even though there are a number of cornerstones in the Social Security Bill which is before us in terms of its revision and, particularly, the rewrite-and one speaker actually referred to it as a cornerstone-in many ways it is actually a roadblock. I will elaborate a little on that point during the course of my remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the major difficulties with any social security legislation which is in place is, of course, the enormous cost to the taxpayer, particularly when these huge benefits are being met by the taxpayer. There ought to be a lot of plain thinking as to whether so much money should be paid out or some other methods should be exercised in order to perhaps reduce the need to pay out so much money in certain areas of social security. </PARA>
<PARA> `Caesar's war' on poverty-and we have certainly heard the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) talking a lot about poverty over the years, particularly with regard to child poverty-is a no-win situation. Charles Murray, writing in his book entitled Losing Ground, asserts correctly that Federal programs, and particularly many social security programs over the past, have not helped but have, indeed, by and large, compounded the welfare problems. Milton Friedman said:</PARA>
<PARA>If you pay people to be poor, they will be poor. </PARA>
<PARA>I mention this because it does not matter how much attention we pay to this or how much we talk about the fact that a great deal of work has gone into revamping and revising this Act that we are debating here today, the fact remains that while these policies exist, as I mentioned earlier and as Milton Friedman said, when one pays poor people to be poor, they will be poor. His blunt assessment may have been based on the facts which show that welfare programs:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . are laced with incentives which encourage long term dependency. Welfare often offers more useable income than many jobs available. </PARA>
<PARA>In my own electorate, people have told me more often than I care to remember that they do not go out and look for work. Of course, some people do go out and look for work, because the newer provisions for receiving unemployment benefits have made it a requirement that people do make a greater effort to find work and they have to certify that in their fortnightly or weekly forms before they get their payment. Some people do take jobs, but they stay in them for only a matter of days because they find that being on welfare payments and receiving unemployment benefits is better for them and they do not have to work. A lot of plain thinking is needed on the part of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) and the Government in this regard in order to overcome these problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is what Newstart is about.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WJ4">Mr WEBSTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are looking at that in other areas of the legislation which is before the Parliament. As we are talking about plain English, it is really plain stupidity to allow this kind of thing to continue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are other areas which I think need attention in order to save funding. Office efficiency is one such area. I note that the Strat plan has been introduced into social security offices Australia-wide and this has certainly been a very good thing; some very good savings have been made. The plan is a good example of plain efficiency-if I can commend positively the Department of Social Security in that regard. In my own electorate, even though the efficiency of the officers and of the people who work there has been good-I cannot complain about the courtesy of the officers in my local offices-over the years there have been some very serious problems with regard to the general office management. I put on record the fact that I have had great concerns about my local offices and I have taken action-which, sadly, has not received the most expeditious attention-with regard to sorting out the difficulties and problems experienced in them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department needs to issue in the offices some plain English rules on good conduct for employees which are effective and which are not rendered ineffective by the fact that the unions operating in those offices have an enormous amount of influence. That influence affects the welfare and well-being of the employees in those offices. I do not want to refer to any office in particular, but I have drawn the attention of the Minister to offices in my own electorate which have very serious problems in this regard. So we do need some plain, straight-out, good, strong actions from the Minister and from the hierarchy in the State in order to come to grips with those problems. I believe, and I hope, that the current action which is being taken will overcome those problems, although we have a great deal of inertia on the part of the local union body. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to highlight the fact that the Social Security Bill, however good it may be now in terms of its having been rewritten and smoothed out in lots of areas, particularly with regard to its terminology, still involves huge payouts. Almost a third of the national budget is devoted to social security payouts. We hear a lot about this Parliament House costing the taxpayer so much money, a billion dollars or a little over, and yet relentlessly we are paying out the equivalent of 25 fully-furnished new Parliament Houses each year just on welfare payments. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to just one aspect of payments. As a result of marriage breakdown, every year we are relentlessly paying out the equivalent of two fully-furnished new Parliament Houses just to prop up families following marriage failure. It can be argued that that is a good thing, and some people might ask what is wrong with that. The criticism is that whilst that payment is equivalent to around $500 per Australian family, paid out relentlessly every year in support of these families that have had marriage failures or similar problems, until recently we have been paying only around 30c or 40c per family per year to stop these problems occurring. </PARA>
<PARA> It always worries me that the Government continuously pays out these huge sums of money in these welfare areas and yet is paying scant attention to allocating funds to stop these tremendous drains on our revenue. For example, why do we not pay $50m towards marriage counselling and marriage education programs? I know there have been increases in the last Budget in this area, and I commend the Government for that, but it is not nearly enough. If we allocated those funds, we would have savings of maybe $300m or $400m. Research shows us that 65 per cent of marriages fail because of benign neglect, not because of malicious intent. We really ought to stop and think about that. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at our communities to see what sort of education programs the Department of Social Security, for example, or other government bodies may be undertaking to stop this marriage breakdown from happening, we find that they are very scant. As I said, until recent years we spent only 25c per family on marriage education. That, to me, was plain stupidity. We ought to stop and think about these areas and, rather than spend a lot of time talking about how good the Act is, we ought to come to grips with doing something to make sure that we stop the horses from bolting in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> We ought to have marriage education programs in our schools for the senior years, for example, so that the pitfalls and difficulties and problems that we have to cope with in marriage, which lead to tremendous social security payouts, are dramatically reduced. That is something the Minister ought to take on for consideration. Whilst he espouses the efficacy of this new Bill because of its plain English and the way it smoothes off some of the edges and so on, he ought to take on board the need for the Government generally to get involved in programs that will encourage more plain lifestyles, that are going to encourage families to stay together rather than find it more attractive to have members leave the household, and so on. I issue that plain and obvious challenge to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the issue of plain living, I want to quote a few points from an article concerning a document produced by the International Consultation on Simple Lifestyle, following a conference in 1980. It issued An Evangelical Commitment to Simple Lifestyle, of nine paragraphs, which I think deserves careful study by anybody. Paragraph 5 is entitled `Personal Lifestyle'. In talking about this simplicity and this call for plainer living it includes a general resolve to `renounce waste and oppose extravagance in personal living, clothing and housing, travel and church buildings'. </PARA>
<PARA> But this betrays no negative asceticism-and when honourable members read it they will find that out. On the contrary, it picks up from Dr Donald Sider's paper Living More Simply for Evangelism and Justice a number of important distinctions. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA>We also accept the distinction between necessities and luxuries, creative hobbies and empty status symbols, modesty and vanity, occasional celebrations and normal routine and between the service of God and slavery to fashion. </PARA>
<PARA>The point is that simple or plain living is not incompatible with carefree enjoyment. I make this point on the basis that it is something that we can all consider, apart from being something that I am commending that the Government might promote in our community. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The principle of generosity is clear too. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Speaker prayed this morning seeking guidance. It is probably appropriate to mention that the article says that in 1 John 3.17 we find:</PARA>
<PARA>If anyone has material possessions, and sees his brother in need, but has no pity on him, how can the love of God be in him?</PARA>
<PARA>That is a pretty good text for us and our Australian communities to take on board bearing in mind the tremendous problems being confronted by the rural industries. We need to take a harder look at all those people around us who are having great difficulty and wherever we possibly can, through our own generosity and practical help, come to grips with their problems and help them in their great difficulties. This article-and this is also relevant to the Speaker's prayer-states:</PARA>
<PARA>Our God is a generous God. If his love indwells us, we shall relate what we `have' (possessions) to what we `see' (need) and take action. </PARA>
<PARA>May God help us to simplify our lifestyle, grow in generosity, and live in contentment so that the demands that are put upon the Government in terms of social security payouts and the huge debt to society, to the taxpayer, may be dramatically reduced. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security Bill does not broach new policy initiatives or new spending outcomes. It basically involves a process of rewriting a number of pieces of legislation to put them into language that people can easily understand and can follow when seeking further information. As such, it is a milestone in the legislative history of the parliaments of Australia, including this Parliament, because at last we have a Bill that ordinary Australians can read and understand, and actually find information in. I am only new to this Parliament so the process of formulating legislation is a reasonably new skill that I am trying to come to grips with, and I have found it increasingly difficult, because I am not a lawyer, to understand a lot of the legalese within which the legislation is written.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am pleased to say that this Social Security Bill is for me the end of a conspiracy that has dominated this nation for 90 years, a conspiracy run and dominated by lawyers-I see my friend the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca) smiling at me, because he is a lawyer-to keep legislation as confusing as possible. In that way lawyers can maintain full employment within the legal profession, because none of the ordinary citizens in the community-and I include myself in that, because by profession I am a teacher and not a lawyer-has any chance of understanding legislation. I think that is the way the lawyers want it to be, because it makes sure that they keep their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> But at last we have broken that conspiracy. This process was initiated by the former Minister for Social Security, the honourable member for Batman (Mr Howe), and was continued by the current Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson). We have a system under which the legislation is written in such a way that a person can find the relevant information without having to seek a whole series of advisers or advocates to put that information into a form that that person can understand. I think that is very important. </PARA>
<PARA> I echo the sentiments that were expressed by the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) and other speakers in this chamber today who have indicated that this process should not stop with social security but should be adopted by a number of other departments and Ministers. The honourable member for Dawson has already mentioned the tax laws, and I wholeheartedly agree with him. They comprise an incredibly complex series of Acts and regulations and most people have no chance of trying to understand them. I suppose that adds to the conspiracy theory-a conspiracy is being engaged in by accountants to keep them in full employment. </PARA>
<PARA> I would add a number of other departments which could pick up this practice that has been adopted by the past and present Ministers for Social Security. I would recommend to my colleagues such as the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) that the process that has been adopted by the Department of Social Security in reviewing its legislation be adopted in reviewing the Austudy requirements. I have been involved in a parliamentary committee of inquiry into Austudy and, although the report of that committee has not been brought down yet, I know that one of the clear impressions that all members from both sides of the House have about the Austudy regulations is that they are extremely confusing, complex and difficult. I am sure all honourable members have had innumerable constituents coming into their offices seeking some clarification of their entitlements and of what the 94 questions on the Austudy form really mean. That is another department that could adopt this strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> Other departments that I think could pick up this process include the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. My office received the immigration regulations a couple of months ago; we almost had to have a moving van to bring them into the office because they were so huge, so complex and so difficult to understand. I think it would help if that Department adopted a rewrite of its legislation to bring together a consolidation of all the amendments that have been passed over the years and to rewrite the legislation into easily understood language that ordinary human beings, not just lawyers, can understand. </PARA>
<PARA> The rewriting of this Bill is very important for a lot of Australians, because the Department of Social Security provides services and support to over one million Australians. Therefore, over one million Australians are reliant on an understanding of the Bill-what it means; what their entitlements are; whether they are eligible for certain things; whether they have breached the guidelines; or whether, when they increase their income in some way or change their financial arrangements, they will be breaching the laws. A lot of people are affected by this legislation, and that is why it is a very important Bill. I think it is probably good that it was the Department of Social Security which adopted it first. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Sciacca" NAMEID="6J4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6J4">Mr Sciacca</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Four million.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ST4">Mr GIBSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Four million Australians? The honourable member for Bowman has corrected me; over four million Australians are affected by social security-which probably makes the Bill even more important. It is important that those people do not inadvertently breach regulations or provisions of Acts because they just do not understand them. This Bill has done a lot to ensure that that does not occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The structure of the Bill is very important. When the Department decided to undertake this redrafting of all its legislation, it had two main aims. The first was to make each provision as simple and as easy to read as possible and the second was to make the arrangement of the provisions in the Act logical and easy to follow. As a result, certain drafting principles were followed so that people could easily turn to the front of the Bill, find out what section they were interested in, what part they needed information on, and find the relevant information very quickly without having to delve right through the whole Bill before they found the section that they were interested in. That has been a very important part of this process. People can now have access to the relevant information without having to spend hours reading through the whole Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of other improvements and innovations in the Bill that I think should be repeated by other departments. First of all, method statements have been used to itemise the steps involved in rate calculations or in determining whether someone is entitled to a social security provision. Tables have been used instead of writing out the formulae and provisions in detail in words. Some provisions are there to set the scene by explaining very broadly how provisions work and examples are listed to demonstrate the complexity of some provisions. And cross-references have been used throughout the legislation to ensure people can find all the relevant bits that might affect them in determining whether they are eligible for social security benefits and what regulations will affect them in the implementation of those social security benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> The language is also very important-not just in the structure of the Bill but also in the removal by the drafters of a lot of very complex words and the insertion of simple words in their place. There are still a few obscure words-I suppose the lawyers could not have them totally removed-but most of the obscure legalese has been removed and replaced with words which are in common usage. That is also very important. </PARA>
<PARA> Most of the complex and complicated series of laws that exist in this country make the following of the law very difficult for ordinary citizens. The Department of Social Security has set the way in removing those things by improving the whole structure of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important feature that the honourable member for Dawson mentioned, and which has also been drawn to my attention, is the fact that the vast majority of community groups and lobby groups involved in the social security industry are very supportive of this rewrite. They believe it has gone a long way towards making their job easier, and hopefully it will reduce the growth industry that we have within the social welfare area of that advocacy industry which has been built up because ordinary people could not follow what the terms of the legislation were and what conditions applied. Perhaps that will mean that that growth industry will suffer some form of decline in future years. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also represents a continuing part of the process of improved efficiency in the operation of the Department of Social Security. I think that is an important issue for us to raise, because, over the last eight years of this Government, there has been an ongoing process of introducing much improved efficiency in the management and operation of the Department of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) raised a couple of points with regard to his local offices of the Department of Social Security. In his view, some of the offices do not necessarily work as efficiently or courteously as they might. All of us as members of parliament have constituents come in to see us from time to time with complaints-some of them quite legitimate-about the treatment they have received in their Department of Social Security office. The fact that occasionally problems do occur is a reflection of the fact that a large volume of people go through that office. However, when I as a member of parliament have a complaint to raise about an office of the Department of Social Security, I contact the manager of that particular office and outline my concern. I have found that that complaint or problem is acted on promptly and efficiently; I get a very good response back. If the Department finds that that particular office is at fault and that something it has done has resulted in some problem for a constituent, it is very quick to rectify the matter, apologise and try to make sure that it fixes the matter up. I have nothing but praise for the Department of Social Security officers in my electorate because I think they do a wonderful job. </PARA>
<PARA> As we have already indicated, there are millions of people involved in the receipt of social security benefits, so of course problems will arise from time to time. The people in that office are busy; they all have a lot of people and issues to deal with; they also have to grapple with a range of language difficulties and literacy problems among the people with whom they are dealing; and, of course, often misunderstandings or misinterpretations by constituents or by clerical staff occur within the Department. But it is important that within the Department of Social Security there is a process in place whereby, if a problem arises where obviously a mistake has been made, officers act quickly and compassionately to fix it, and they do not attempt to stonewall or to try to justify their own inaction in some way which frustrates the needs of the constituent. I think that is very important. As a Federal member of parliament who has a large social security clientele in my electorate, it is extremely important that I am able to have that access and that quick response. So I am pleased to report that my officers do work very well in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point that I raise is that some of the complaints or comments that have been made by honourable members, particularly those opposite, about the Department of Social Security are based more on an ideological position rather than a factual analysis of the situation. The honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) raised the reported suggestions of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) about what he would do to the Department of Social Security should he ever become the Prime Minister of this country. These suggestions were made late last year. The Leader of the Opposition indicated that it would be his policy that the Department of Social Security would be abolished and that much of its services would be privatised or farmed out to the private sector. He based his suggestion that this should occur on some alleged inefficiencies in the delivery of services by the Department of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA> But if one looks objectively at the facts relating to the Department, one finds that there are very few inefficiencies. In fact, the Department of Social Security is one of the most efficient departments in the whole Public Service. I draw attention to the fact that the Department's administrative costs represent only 3.5 per cent of all outlays, and that is an outstanding achievement. That is an indication of very good efficiency, particularly when more than four million people are in receipt of benefits every fortnight. </PARA>
<PARA> The other important thing is that out of 140 million payments that the Department processes each year, 99.9 per cent arrive on time at the correct address. That is a very good measure of the efficiency and productivity of officers in the Department. So, when one hears talk about breaking up this monolith called the Department of Social Security and introducing great efficiencies by privatising, one should really look at what is behind those suggestions and understand that it is a purely ideological position-not one based on any fair and objective assessment of the current services that are provided by that Department. </PARA>
<PARA> I now raise briefly one other issue that has been to the forefront of the attention of the public in the last few months with relevance to social security-although also it is not exactly covered in this Bill-and that is the question of deeming provisions for pensioners, which were introduced in the last Budget and which come into force from 1 March this year. There has been a lot of concern expressed throughout the country about the provisions of deeming, and most of those concerns have been based on a lack of understanding of what the impact will be and of who will be affected. A number of people have utilised this issue to pursue personal political viewpoints rather than an objective analysis of what the effect of deeming provisions will be. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been concerned about that because many comments that have been made, particularly in the Brisbane media, have caused a lot of concern and misunderstandings amongst my constituents. They have rightfully been very upset because they view the deeming provisions as having a much worse impact than they will in reality. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is important that when we talk about provisions such as social security or the changes that may be occurring in that area, we understand who we are dealing with and what impact rumours and shock tactics will have on those people. Most of the people we are talking about are aged pensioners or ill and infirm people. They react very quickly when they think that some major change that will adversely affect them is coming into place. It causes them great fear, hardship and distress, because they have their affairs arranged in a certain way and they fear that if there is a change made it will have some dreadful adverse effect of them. They find it difficult to understand the complexities of a lot of the changes that are introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, some people in the Brisbane media have played on those fears and have spread a whole series of rumours and innuendos about the impact of deeming, which has caused a lot of concern amongst constituents in my electorate. The electorate of Moreton has a significant aged population. It is one of the oldest electorates by age profile in Australia. Therefore, the interests of pensioners are very much paramount to me. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the introduction of the Budget and the announcement of the deeming provisions, I have spent many months discussing these issues with the Minister for Social Security and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security to raise my concerns and the concerns of my constituents and to make sure that their concerns have been looked at and have been addressed. A lot of the concerns of my constituents, in fact 99.9 per cent of them, have been picked up and recognised. In fact, most of them are unfounded because the provisions of the deeming legislation will not affect them in the way that they think. </PARA>
<PARA> The vast majority of pensioners in the electorate of Moreton will not be affected by deeming. In fact they will be financially better off by deeming because they will be earning more money by putting their money in accounts that earn 10 per cent or more rather than leaving it in bank accounts that earn very little money. </PARA>
<PARA> The one issue that has been affecting us in Brisbane is the rates situation. Some people, if they earn more than the income limits, will have some of their pension cut and then may face a loss of rates discounts by the Brisbane City Council or other local government authorities in Queensland. That issue has been taken up by the Government with those local government authorities on innumerable occasions. We have attempted to negotiate a better deal, and the ball is very much in the court of the local government authorities themselves. They have the responsibility to look at their provisions for the introduction of rates discounts for pensioners and to try to pick up those concerns. </PARA>

<PARA> To sum up, I think this Bill is a milestone. I congratulate both the past and the present Ministers for Social Security on proceeding with it, and I urge other Ministers and departments to take up this initiative and to introduce similar improved legislation in their departments so that people in this country have a much better understanding of the provisions of the law. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Social Security Bill. As was made quite clear by the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) earlier today, it is important that whatever Act it may be-the Social Security Act or any other Act-it is made as simple as possible so far as is necessary for the people to be able to interpret it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Dawson referred to the Income Tax Assessment Act, which is a typical example of an Act that we would like to see simplified. I trust that the Government will proceed to update through simplification many of the Acts that we pass in this House and that have existed for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we had better be realistic about this whole matter. We do not accept that the average Australian will be able to interpret the Social Security Bill now before this House. I am just a humble farmer, and at times I am pleased that I am, rather than being a teacher or solicitor, as mentioned by the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson). I find that members with this background become confused at times too. I think one must be logical in looking at the interpretation of an Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that any more people are going to read this Act, simple as it may be. People generally feel that an Act is difficult to interpret. So they go to their local member, solicitor, accountant or minister of religion and say, `What does all this mean?'. We are supposed to know and to pass it on, and that is reasonable when we come to think about it. </PARA>
<PARA> I rose to speak today for one principal reason, and that is my concern about the confusion this Act creates in the mind of the average aged person, as has been very well outlined by the honourable member for Moreton. There is confusion in people's minds about an Act that changes twice a year because it is catching up with the consumer price index. Every time the Treasurer (Mr Keating) brings in a Budget there are changes to the Act and there are changes by way of regulation that people have difficulty in interpreting. </PARA>
<PARA> I worry about the effect that changes to social security and other legislation may have upon the health of aged people and the confusion created in their minds. Average Australians work for a lifetime and they pay their taxes. They believe that when they retire they will have the satisfaction of knowing that they have a superannuation or social security scheme that they will be able to depend upon. When people are young and working, and in middle life too, they tend not to worry about their health, but when they are older they are concerned that their health will stand by them, and in most cases it does. </PARA>
<PARA> When people get to their sixties and seventies little things begin to happen. They get rheumatism, heart problems and other more serious complaints. So it is that the older people get the more they worry about their future. They wonder how they are going to be cared for-by their family, if they are lucky enough to have one, or by the Acts that are passed in this Parliament and in the various State parliaments. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate that I am very concerned. No matter what we say about our electorate offices, basically they are social security offices. In my area Taree is the centre of a growing population of aged people and every day there would be five, six, seven, eight, maybe more, people coming into my office and saying, `I am in trouble with my social security; how does this deeming provision or this other provision affect me?'. </PARA>
<PARA> I have put out a simple booklet, and even the social security people agree with it, setting out what all types of pensioners are entitled to. Thousands of people in the community, including members of senior citizens groups and the Returned Services League, come to my office and ask for assistance. We send out thousands of these booklets; people read them and ring up and say, `Thank you'. They come to us and ask a direct question about a particular part of the Act and the way it affects them, and we then have to ring up the manager of the social security office. </PARA>
<PARA> I have four offices in my electorate, and I may say that I receive the utmost cooperation from all of the officers concerned. So we can get an answer from them, but if we have the booklet we can say, `This is a simple interpretation of the Act as it applies at this time'. I say that because amending this Act and making it simple is not curing the problems in the minds of the recipients of social security. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said earlier, the great majority of these people are not going to read the Act, but it will be much simpler for Australian Council of Social Service officials, members of the legal fraternity, accountants, ministers of religion and others who read these things and are supposed to know. It will be in plain English and we hope it will be able to be interpreted. </PARA>
<PARA> From time to time throughout the year the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) has to change some form of social security legislation as a result of pressure being brought to bear by either a community group or honourable members as representatives of the people. These changes are confusing to many people. For example, the social security provisions in the last Budget must have been framed in a terrible hurry. Glaring mistakes were later pointed out by both members of the Opposition and the Government. Even after various Acts have been passed by Parliament, the regulations and certain policies are often changed, especially those affecting the aged. </PARA>
<PARA> I am deeply worried and concerned for the aged who, at that time in their lives, look to play their sport, enjoy a bit of peace and harmony at home and settle back and reminisce. The aged can have problems with their health. We do not want to create any further problems that will magnify this type of change occurring in social security. </PARA>
<PARA> I represent a rural electorate and, as such, I am greatly concerned about the assets test. Personally, I would give every Australian over a certain age an age pension. It would be simple to do it; one would not need today's bureaucracy. We would not need to simplify everything, because if someone had an income above the threshold that person would have to pay the money back to the Government anyway. I heard a couple of years ago that it would cost only another $300m to $400m to actually do this. </PARA>
<PARA> An assets test, once applied, not only creates confusion but is also unfair. I invite anyone to visit country areas, particularly while we are in a recession, and observe the hours that are worked for income, the results of the investment of people living and working on their properties and how those people are affected. These people have spent their lifetimes working and they feel that they are entitled to receive some kind of social security in their latter days. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer specifically to a small farming community in my electorate where there are 11 retired people over the age of 65 to 70 years who before the assets test received the age pension. When the assets test was introduced nine of those people lost the age pension. All of those people own small closed down dairy farms, and that is where they wanted to live. They did not want to go to town, as suggested by the Government, and buy a three or four bedroom home, which would use up their money and where the mother would have to spend her entire day cleaning, even though she might not be able physically to do it. These people wanted to remain on their farms, but in many cases their neighbours had sold out for a fair price and so the valuation of their property precluded them from receiving the age pension. These people were told they could sell their properties and move to town. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) told them at that time, `We will pay you and we will count that as a debt against your assets'. No genuine farmer would entertain doing such a thing with his property. I doubt whether any of these farmers have availed themselves of that opportunity. I believe the assets test is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other examples which illustrate that the assets test is wrong. When constituents come to see me and tell me they are entitled to unemployment benefit or some other form of assistance, I sometimes say to these people-and one must be frank-`Let me go out in the street and bring the fellow driving the grader, cleaning the street or driving the local taxi in here and tell him about your situation, you being an able-bodied person, and ask him whether he is prepared to pay you'. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the test of social security. People believe that governments pluck money out of the air; they do not. Somebody has to pay. Those working today, the productive community of Australia, are paying this money to allow the disadvantaged and those in need of help in the country to draw a payment of some kind. I am not against paying or helping anybody who deserves help. I will fight and battle, as I do every hour of the day within my electorate, to try to get these people assistance. This is the truth of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I have people who come to me and say, `Bruce, I will give you an instance of somebody to whom I offered a job and he wouldn't accept it. Would you put him in?'. I have never put a person in in my life. I have said to those people, `You can go to Social Security'. The Department even accepts anonymous letters and we can name a particular person if we wish. I certainly will not put people in; I am not a telltale-tit. But that is the way it is. </PARA>
<PARA> We had better have a look at ourselves because we are in a bad recession. We are very close to a depression, if not there already. We have entered the door of a depression. There are people who come to our offices to see us. Somebody said to me the other day, `It doesn't pay for me to work. I have a wife and so many children'. In other words, that person has no incentive to work because of the income that he is receiving from various forms of social security-the family allowance, unemployment benefit and rent assistance. He says that it does not pay him to work. I warn the Government that if that is going to be its policy it should look at this very closely. It will not bring employment back in this country. If it goes too far with its social security system it will want an army of bureaucrats to be able to control and supervise it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Social Security Act is similar to our Family Law Act. One-third of married Australian families today are separating. What is happening with some of the children and the lady who is left behind? They apply for taxpayers' money to live on. If it is a genuine case we do not object to that. Our Family Law Act is another Act that needs simplifying. It needs more than simplifying; it needs fixing up to make it a little harder for people to marry and then say, `We can walk out next year' and leave their wife with a baby to look after. Is this fair? There is more than just a Social Security Act to simplify and look at. The Family Law Act also has to be looked at to see that it is fair. </PARA>
<PARA> These breakdowns are actually being accepted today. We had better look at the reason why they are happening. We had better toughen up a little because there are problems emerging. Let us look at the child support scheme. We supported it. I thought it was a great idea, whereby the Department of Social Security and the Australian Taxation Office were going to cooperate and the father of the child was going to be brought to bear. He was going to be the one who had to accept the responsibility to keep his family, his wife, and particularly the children. But there is something wrong with the administration of our child support scheme. Also in our offices almost daily we have wives coming in who do not have support. They say, `I have written to the Child Support Agency and told them the address of my husband, where he is working, where he can be found, where certain documents can be given to him, but nothing happens'. </PARA>
<PARA> Is the problem that the Department is understaffed? The Minister had better have a look at it because I do not think that system is operating properly. I cannot condemn any particular part of it except that it is not operating. When we ring the Department we get cooperation. Once I read in the newspaper that somebody, perhaps from that Department, said, `Unless a member for Parliament makes representations on an issue concerning a wife or family we are unable to do much about it'. </PARA>
<PARA> The child support scheme generally is a problem. One problem cropped up the other day that was not directly associated with this Bill-it was about aged care and the decision of the Minister to stop paying, on an assets test basis, a subsidy for people who reside in a hostel or nursing home. That decision affected hundreds of thousands of Australians. A pensioner who sold a house two years prior to coming to live within a hostel would be assets tested. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure I am correct in what I am saying. We never realised when the legislation came before the House that it had such implications. Fair enough; the legislation is there. Nursing home and hostel committees have approached me and said, `Would you take this up with the Minister and point out the deficiencies, because we are concerned about it.' Every resident of hostels now have to be investigated. This results in more confusion in the minds of those poor aged people who have finally found a place in a hostel and are being cared for within that hostel. These are the problems with assets testing. </PARA>
<PARA> Austudy has been talked about here today. This Bill might not be directly concerned with it, but it is wide-ranging legislation. If a farmer owns a property and his income from the property is small-it is small today, as the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) has said time and time again; it has predicted farmers' incomes-the value of the assets he owns are counted in the test for eligibility. His real estate, stock and plant are used for assessment, not the return that he has. This is grossly unfair, but it is predictable because of the assets test on these things. </PARA>
<PARA> The further the Government takes social security, the further it subsidises A,B,C and D, the bigger the mess that it is going to get into. It is not that I am saying there are not deserving cases; there are. But governments have to think about legislation and know the direction that they are going in so that they can legislate properly to account for those people. </PARA>
<PARA> I appeal to the Government once again. I say to it, `For goodness' sake, in fairness look at the assets test; see the decent Australians who have worked to produce, to export and to keep the economy of this country going. See that these people are not penalised under Acts of the Parliament where they should not be penalised.' I believe that is very important. </PARA>
<PARA> In concluding, I think that Social Security should extend its public relations. It is not easy for its officers, but they should get around the countryside and have meetings with the recipients. They should make themselves available to answer the recipients' questions when the senior citizens' committees get together. I have received cooperation in my electorate from the Australian Taxation Office and I would suggest to officers of the Social Security Department that they ought to do these things to provide this growing number of people with this opportunity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was very interested to hear what the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan) had to say, in particular, about assets tests-he did not get on to income tests, but that is the other side of the test on social security provisions within Australia. Certainly the suggestion that the honourable member mentioned that Australia should really give everyone the pension, as they do in England and in a number of other countries, has been put to me. But, of course, the experience in those countries is that the pension, because it is being given to everybody, is usually so small that supplementary pensions, which are assets and income tested, are needed. All a government is doing in cases like that is taking taxes off everybody-higher taxes than are needed, because obviously it has to give everybody the pension-and giving them back to every person in the country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the Government's move of encouraging private superannuation and the private sector to take over the management and investment of those funds so that in the future people retiring will have an adequate income is a much more constructive way of going about it and helps the aim of national savings as well. </PARA>
<PARA> My purpose in rising today is to talk about a group of aged pensioners who, I think, are being forced by circumstance into paying full cost for operations in hospitals. I have here an advertisement from the West Australian newspaper of last Saturday headed, `Why wait 2 more painful years for a joint replacement?'. It shows an aged pensioner on a frame, obviously in distress, and it says:</PARA>
<PARA>Now there is no need to suffer because of long waiting lists at public hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA>We have heard about these long waiting lists for a long time, especially at election time, so I thought I would investigate this a little bit further. I called the number that was on the advertisement and received a brochure. I would like to read to the House the conditions that apply to the people who might be eligible under what they call the `priority-op' plan. The first condition reads:</PARA>
<PARA>You must be an aged pensioner on the maximum rate. </PARA>
<PARA>We are not talking about somebody with a lot of money-we are talking about an aged pensioner, obviously one without a lot of assets. The second condition reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Your financial circumstances should be such that you are unable to pay for the treatment from your private means. </PARA>
<PARA>This effectively rules out people with private health insurance. The third condition reads:</PARA>
<PARA>You must own, or be paying off a home. </PARA>
<PARA>When pressed on this, the organisation responsible said a pensioner would have to substantially own the home, so effectively, a pensioner would have to own his own home and be a maximum-rate pensioner. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, you would recognise that the target group of the priority-op plan is, indeed, Medicare patients. The literature that is put out shows that the plan is targeting Medicare patients who, according to the literature, cannot be accommodated in a public hospital. When I went into this a little bit further, I found that the cost is $11,000. There is no up-front fee, because obviously the organisation concerned is going to take out a lien on the house and take it out of the estate later on. I draw a parallel between that situation and what the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan) said about the farm situation, where the farmer was asset rich but income poor, yet because of the assets test, the Department of Social Security said that if he were paid a pension it would come out of the farm. This is a very similar situation. </PARA>
<PARA> But $11,000 plus 10 per cent per annum after 10 years is $25,900, and after 15 years is $41,700-so it rises quite dramatically. I point out that, by contrast, a Medicare patient would pay nothing. We are talking about $11,000-stretching to $41,000 after 15 years-compared to nothing for pensioners who take up their rightful entitlement of getting that operation done under Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious that the scheme itself is diametrically opposed to the principles of Medicare, which include access to this sort of treatment. Obviously, the advertisement plays on the fears of the elderly and there is a perception in the community that there are long waiting lists for hospitals, that the public hospitals are full and that somehow Medicare is to blame. </PARA>
<PARA> The facts are that when we look at the hospitalisation rate in Australia, we see that 21.8 per cent of our population goes through our hospitals every year, that is 3 1/2 million, and that is the highest in the world. So our hospitals are doing a great job. In fact, they are very efficient at putting people through them. The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) average is 15.3 per cent. If we achieved that rate we would have one million fewer Australians going through our hospitals every year. We would not have these schemes being promoted because obviously there would be no waiting lists if we were to achieve the OECD average. Those figures are from the OECD publication Financing and Delivering Health Care. So Australian hospitals are efficient. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing to remember is that of all the people treated in public hospitals, half are privately insured. The thing that, I think, is not widely understood-certainly by the promoters of this plan and State Governments, although they should-is that the Medicare agreement does allow public patients to be treated in private hospitals. I have a copy of the agreement. Clause 4.4 of the Medicare agreement between the States and the Commonwealth says:</PARA>
<PARA>The State may enter into arrangements with private hospitals, other States, the Northern Territory or recognised hospitals in the Australian Capital Territory for the provision of care and treatment, which is unavailable or cannot be provided within the recognised hospital system. Where such arrangements exist eligible persons will be charged in accordance with clause 9. The State Minister shall supply to the Commonwealth Minister particulars of any such arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 9 states that Medicare patients cannot be charged above the schedule fee. In actual fact, the treatment must be free to the patient. That being the case, if there are, as we are led to believe, empty hospital beds and there is a demand, as indicated by the advertisement in the West Australian newspaper for age pensioners last Saturday, the question is: why are the States not making full use of the Medicare agreement?</PARA>
<PARA> In South Australia that is done. In South Australia public patients are treated in private hospitals, but this does not occur in any other State. Obviously, the State governments have that option open to them. You would agree, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the private sector can make these beds available at lesser cost than can the public sector. That is obviously because the private sector hospitals undertake no training-there are no training costs for private hospitals-there is no research done in private hospitals, and there are no standby or emergency facilities in private hospitals. All of those facilities are very expensive and they are all carried by the public hospitals, but not by the private hospitals. Also, if we believe the rhetoric, private hospitals should be cheaper because they are run more efficiently. There is nothing wrong with State governments contracting out to get private hospital beds for public patients, for Medicare patients, for the age pensioners who are the target of the advertisement that I mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> The other reason why, obviously, this is not done is that medical specialists will not treat public patients in private hospitals. There is a medical embargo against that treatment, and that is for two reasons. Firstly, more people will drop their private health cover if they can get treatment straight away. The reason why a lot of people have private health cover now is the fear that they will have to wait a long time for operations. But if that fear was removed, the numbers with private health cover would go down. That really means that the medical specialists and the surgeons cannot bill public patients directly. Therefore, the pool of people to whom they can send bills diminishes. So those are the two reasons why the private sector is not involved in treating public patients. The age pensioner in the advertisement which I mentioned is a glaring example of that. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, as I say, this is being used to force a lot more people than would otherwise be the case into private health insurance, because private health insurance actually works in reverse to normal insurance. A person takes out more insurance and ends up paying more. In every other class of insurance, if a person takes out more insurance he ends up paying less, should he need to claim. </PARA>
<PARA> The family hospitals proposals really are a natural extension of what I call an evil scaremongering campaign. People on this side of the House are getting sick of Medicare being blamed for waiting lists, when that agreement specifically allows the State governments to expand the number of beds available to all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not criticising the family hospitals in this advertisement for their treatment or their care. The Western Australian Government should move to end these schemes by ensuring that beds are available. I put it to the House that that would be a better investment of Western Australian taxpayers' money than some of the investments that the Western Australian Government has entered into. It seems to me that this Federal Government has been upholding Labor traditions very strongly. Certainly, Medicare is one of them, but we are not receiving the support that we could from some of our State Labor counterparts. If this is to be overcome, then obviously State governments have got to have a good look at themselves. They are the only ones who can overcome this by entering into the agreement-clause 4.4 of the Medicare agreement between the Commonwealth and the States-to make those beds available in the private sector. That will not overcome the ban by specialists, but that is something this Government will have to address. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I think that the senior citizens and the age pensioners of this country in particular, and Australians generally, deserve better from State governments. They should be supporting the Federal Government in its attempts to make sure that access to medical treatment is made available to all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question that could well be asked in providing for those less well-off in this country is what we can do to make their job easier, and what can be done to enable more of our resources to be used in the direct provision of needs and less in administration. The answers to these questions lie in the Bill before us today, the Social Security Bill, and I want to make sure that I refer to that aspect of the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Through this legislation, the Government has provided that our basic social security framework, which allows us to provide for our friends and neighbours in need of government assistance, has been overhauled to facilitate easier use of the Social Security Act to solve the complex problems posed by today's social structure. In an increasingly complex society, plain English is what people want, and that is precisely what people will get with this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> This step builds on other important social initiatives of the Hawke Government in the retirement incomes policy, the social justice strategy, the introduction of family allowance supplements, and the indexation of social security payments, to name just a few. Against the background of social reform, however, it is disappointing to see the track record of honourable members opposite in regard to how they would provide for those in need of government assistance. It is ironic that, while the rewrite of the Social Security Act makes a great step forward in social reform, the Opposition would take the provision of assistance right back to the Dark Ages, with all and sundry being able to act as agents when handing out benefits, and no doubt taking their slice of the pie along the way. </PARA>
<PARA> While it may not be the aim of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) to walk and talk with the animals, his ownership of an animal wishing to go in separate directions at the same time shows that he clearly shares at least one trait with the famous Doctor Dolittle. </PARA>
<PARA> In contrast, it is the Government's intention to remove any conflict in direction in the social reform area, and since 1983 we have proceeded down that track. Our aim of introducing greater equity in the provision of social security is unsurpassed in Australia's history. </PARA>
<PARA> When speaking in the House last week in the debate on one of the taxation Bills, I referred to the tirade we have heard from the Opposition in recent months about the Government's package of taxation measures and how the Opposition would vary it if it had the chance. I said then that if anything was ever clearer, it was that the average Australian is very lucky that those opposite do not have that chance. That reference applies just as strongly to the changes to the provision of social security mooted by the Opposition. I use the word `mooted' because, as with all the ideas to come from the Opposition recently, this idea was one announced by the Leader of the Opposition at a doorstop interview. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Opposition a question that has been asked many times before: is the idea to contract out provision of social security benefits Liberal Party policy? It may be Liberal Party policy to use this contracting out of social services as a means of subsidising its planned revamp of the tax system, but a quick analysis of wage scales and related benefits shows that most people currently receiving benefits will be the losers and not the winners under this type of social security system. It would be a system designed to fill the pockets of the rich rather than the poor. If it is not Liberal policy, then just what is?</PARA>
<PARA> While members of the Opposition try to work out their real social security policy, Australia's social security recipients need to know where they stand, and that is an important point that seems to have escaped the Opposition. Australia's age pensioners, our struggling families, and all those in need of government assistance, need to be able to plan their future. Similarly, just because somebody is no longer working, whether it be through redundancy or retirement, it does not mean that his or her independence should be removed. This Government recognises that and has acted accordingly through some of the measures I have already alluded to. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me first address the issue of retirement, and the associated needs of independence and dignity. To unite these linking themes, the Government has introduced the most comprehensive package of measures for retirement. This was a necessary step for Australia to prepare for the new challenges that face us into the next century as our population ages. For although Australia still has a relatively young population, between now and the end of the century the proportion of the population aged 75 and over will increase dramatically. This will mean a rapid rise in the demand for age pensions and high growth in the need for services to support the aged. </PARA>
<PARA> To be able to meet this rise in demand and to ensure that an acceptable standard of living can be maintained for those people in retirement, it is vital that every opportunity is provided to encourage and reward people for planning now for their retirement. Through the statement Better Incomes: Retirement Income Policy into the Next Century, Australia will be well placed to face these challenges ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the centrepieces in the statement's drive towards greater independence in retirement is the emphasis on superannuation. I quote from that document:</PARA>
<PARA>It will be possible to meet the needs of an ageing population better by increasing the level of saving and by expanding labour market opportunities. However, future generations will probably expect higher levels of income and services. Consequently, a flexible and sustainable retirement income policy which delivers fair and adequate incomes needs to build on the twin pillars of the age pension system and private savings such as superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA>This statement clearly outlines the Government's strategy on the question of retirement incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> Changes announced in the Budget improve superannuation arrangements which will mean that more Australians can save for their retirement, with assistance from the Government. Particular attention has been given to providing better employment and retirement savings opportunities for women. These changes build on the 3 per cent superannuation benefit that was awarded to Australian workers as part of the Government's accord with the trade union movement. We have now seen the availability of superannuation extend to far more workers than was ever the case previously. </PARA>
<PARA> Historically, superannuation was seen as a sole privilege of the wealthy and some white collar workers only. Today, with the expansion of the industry-based schemes and the improvements to the portability of superannuation, the number of workers who now belong to a scheme has escalated quite dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also recognised the difficulties faced by women due to their high level of participation in part-time work. Award-based superannuation has been identified as an important method of providing superannuation coverage to the majority of women. The Government will continue to support extensive occupational superannuation to all employees and for improvements in the schemes in conjunction with the union movement through future wage rounds. Several other modifications have been announced to make superannuation more available and attractive to women. </PARA>
<PARA> In addressing the part-time situation, people employed for as little as 10 hours a week will now be able to contribute to personal superannuation schemes and receive tax deductions for contributions. This has been reduced from 25 hours a week, which was the previous minimum requirement to be able to contribute to superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> Other initiatives aimed at giving these people further independence in retirement have been the decision to allow people to continue contributing to personal superannuation schemes for up to two years while outside the paid work force. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other advances made by this Government in the superannuation area. Those advances have had one aim in mind: to make superannuation no longer the domain of the rich but to make it accessible to all Australians, thus reducing our social security bill for the aged in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> When we talk about social security and the objectives of the legislation before us today, we talk about social equity and providing some assistance to those who are ill able to provide for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government also recognises that the problems of those in need of social security assistance cannot be solved by money alone. It takes the right mix of policies. This was precisely the thrust behind the introduction of the family allowance supplement (FAS). </PARA>
<PARA> Under eight years of Liberal-National Party rule, there had been created a mindset whereby people had no incentive to join the work force and could gain greater government assistance by staying in receipt of social security benefits and the associated concessions for medications and the like. Through the family allowance supplement, the Government has turned this around. </PARA>
<PARA> As at 29 January 1990, 183,622 Australian families were in receipt of the family allowance supplement, ensuring that 445,236 eligible children of FAS families were provided for while a regular income was being earned to add substantially to the family structure. I might add that the amount of assistance these thousands of families receive through FAS is quite substantial. For instance, a family with one child under the age of 13 would still be eligible for some FAS while the combined taxable family income remained under $20,756, with the maximum rate being $53 a fortnight. A family with two children under the age of 13 and another between 13 and 15 would still be eligible for FAS while the combined taxable family income remained under $28,780, the maximum rate being $183.30 a fortnight. </PARA>
<PARA> Such families would of course be eligible for family allowance of $20 a fortnight in the first instance and $60 a fortnight in the latter. The only other condition applied to families when determining eligibility for FAS is a flat assets test of $347,500. Families that meet the income test criteria and fall below that assets test limit will receive the full benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> I am proud to say that, as at 19 December 1990, there were 2,728 families in receipt of family allowance supplement in areas serviced by the two Social Security offices in my electorate of Oxley. Put another way, that is just under 3,000 families who are being encouraged to remain in the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> If I may digress just a little, Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to use this opportunity to put on record my appreciation of the work done by the management and staff of the Social Security offices at Ipswich and Goodna in my electorate and their understanding of the complex array of cases they deal with on a daily basis. That is another face of social security. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members opposite seem to forget that there is more to social security than just finding a suitable person to dish out the money. Given that we have not heard any more from the Leader of the Opposition since the good doctor gave his last doorstop interview, we will have to assume he still has in mind to go about providing social security in the same way as one sells newspapers. For the Opposition's benefit I will repeat what I said earlier in regard to the provision of social security: there comes with the responsibility to provide for people financially the need to recognise the different aspects of social security, and that is something that neither the milkman, the newsagent nor any other agent would be able to do. </PARA>
<PARA> Evidence of the Government's recognition of this can be seen in the commitment made to maintain the benchmarks of adequacy in family payments. Specifically, these are to maintain the total value of family payments, that is, the first child rate of family allowance plus FAS, equivalent to the married rate of pension for children under 13, and 20 per cent for children aged 13, 14 and 15 years. These benchmarks were achieved in July 1989 and the Government accordingly increases the rates of FAS each January by the amounts necessary to ensure that the 15 and 20 per cent benchmarks are maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> Put simply, the rule of thumb when initiating and revising social security policy is to keep in touch with the targeted group. This is precisely what the Government has done through the changing of FIS, formerly the family income supplement, to FAS, the family allowance supplement, in December 1987. This step has resulted in a more than fourfold increase in the number of families in receipt of FAS from 46,000 at the introduction of FAS in December 1987 to 183,000 in December 1990, an increase of which the Government can be justly proud. The Government has also made a continuous effort to increase the awareness of the FAS program and results from a FAS evaluation show that 79 per cent of potentially eligible families were aware of the program. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has undertaken a range of measures to ensure the policies implemented are those best suited for the intended beneficiaries and that those people have every opportunity to take advantage of those benefits. Some of these activities include: extensive publicity used in a wide range of outlets from television to milk carton advertisements; Social Security regional offices developing an extensive range of publicity and information material for schools, hospitals, employers and other community organisations; and market research to improve the quality of information products and publicity strategies. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the anticipated turnover of the FAS client group, a great deal of importance has been placed on continual and regular outreach programs. As proof of the benefits of the constant feedback that comes to the Government through our ongoing analysis of the state of play in social security to make the task easier for families in need of help, since 1988 the separate family allowance and FAS claim forms were combined into a single document. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the question: how would one derive such information under a system where assistance was not being provided by one central agency? How many butchers, bakers and candlestick makers, for instance, would need to get together to determine the effectiveness of a particular benefit? As honourable members opposite are left trying to work out the answers, I regret to give them some more bad news. </PARA>
<PARA> Through the united effort of a national social security system, the Government has been able to maximise the take-up of benefits by pensioners and beneficiaries who make the transition into the work force. Terminating beneficiaries and pensioners are advised of possible eligibility for FAS as a matter of course. In the case of an ex-beneficiary or ex-pensioner who is eligible for FAS and who claims within six weeks of being cancelled for pension or benefit, FAS is backdated to the payday following the last receipt of pension or benefit. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for St George for his question. I know that all members of this House and indeed all people in this country are very interested in this question, and properly so. I am pleased to inform the House that I have received a letter from President Bush concerning the Soviet proposal which was put to Iraq this week. That letter gives an indication of the content of the Soviet plan and of the United States view of it. I do not propose to go into the details of those matters. The Soviets have asked that the details not be made public. The United States has respected that request and so will we. Clearly, it would not be helpful at this delicate stage to canvass the issues in detail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The President has said publicly that the Soviet proposal falls well short of what would be required to bring the war to an end. Having seen the details of the Soviet proposal to the extent that they are in President Bush's letter, I understand the President's concerns. The proposal may be capable of modification, but as it stands there are elements of it which pose very real and practical problems for ending the conflict in accordance with the United Nations resolutions.</PARA>
<PARA> Equally, it is clear from President Bush's letter that the United States, like Australia, continues to seek a peaceful end to the crisis in accordance with the United Nations resolutions if that is at all possible. Obviously, no cease-fire proposal can be accepted which does not include quite specific and concrete steps for its implementation.</PARA>
<PARA> I want to say that it is clear that the United States war aims continue to be as spelt out by President Bush throughout this crisis, which are those mandated by the United Nations Security Council resolutions. There is no doubt at all that the coalition would respond to an immediate and unconditional Iraqi withdrawal. It is quite clear that the ball is now at the feet of Saddam Hussein. Saddam Hussein's unwillingness to undertake such a withdrawal remains the single obstacle to peace in the Gulf.</PARA>
<PARA> I know that I speak on behalf of all members of this place in saying that I can only urge that Saddam Hussein fulfil, and immediately fulfil, the demands and requirements of the United Nations Security Council resolution.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="984" SPEAKER="Dawkins The Hon J.S." NAMEID="9E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="FREMANTLE" MINISTERIAL="EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Petrie for his question. I am, however, surprised at the reluctance on the part of the Opposition to engage in debate about this or many other matters for which I am responsible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me preface my reply by indicating the way in which the Commonwealth currently funds Australian schools. The first point to bear in mind is that we do not fund schools directly; we do it by way of grants to the States, which then pass on those funds to non-government schools, or use those funds themselves in respect of their own schools.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth funding for government schools in that respect is $686m; for non-government schools, specifically for their running costs, it is about $1.1 billion, and other grants to the States for either government or non-government schools add up to about $600m, making a total of $2.4 billion.</PARA>
<PARA> The reason the Commonwealth engages in this program is to try to assist those schools which are in greatest need. Therefore, the greatest amount goes to those schools which are in greatest need.</PARA>
<PARA> It is a fact that the Opposition has proposed a complete change to those arrangements and has decided to propose the introduction, which has been brought up by others, of a voucher scheme. It is interesting that after Question Time yesterday a spokesperson for the shadow Minister for education said that there was no such thing as a voucher proposal. He said that it was only an option being monitored, attempting apparently to distance himself from the Opposition Leader's proposal.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me go back to what the Opposition Leader said in his Norman Cowper Oration on 15 February:</PARA>
<PARA>This would see the Commonwealth cease paying specific grants to the States altogether in such areas as education and health. The payments would instead be made directly to individuals, perhaps in the form of a service access card or voucher, as the Americans have called it. The access card would then in turn be used by individuals to buy services from State governments or from private sector providers.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Government would cease paying the States, which is the way we currently fund the schools, and instead would make a payment to individuals which they could use at their choice to buy the services or to make a contribution towards their kids' education, at either a government school or a non-government school.</PARA>
<PARA> Assuming that the $2.4 billion was to be divided amongst all the schoolchildren, that would lead to a voucher worth about $800 a year. However, we have to remember that in the first place the grants would have been withdrawn, so the nongovernment schools would have lost their grants from the Commonwealth and would have to put up their fees to compensate. Then, of course, there would be a voucher for $800.</PARA>
<PARA> Once we take into account the voucher plus the fee increase, we find that in category one the parents of the kids at those primary schools would be ahead to the tune of $222 a year. In other words, they would have fee relief to the tune of $222 a year, whereas the majority of kids in non-government schools, the half million of them who are in category 10 schools, would experience fee increases of $675 a year, or $1,289 if they were in secondary school.</PARA>
<PARA> That is more than a doubling of the level of fees currently charged in respect of those schools. That is, the parents of half a million kids would experience under this kind of proposal fee increases of between $675 a year and $1,289 a year. It might suit the House if I table this document, which gives further details of those points.</PARA>
<PARA> Just to reinforce the point: the schools which would do best out of this are those schools in category one, such as Cranbrook School--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The schools which would do best from this proposal are schools such as Scots College, Sydney Church of England Grammar School, Abbotsleigh and, in Victoria, Melbourne Grammar, Geelong Grammar, and so on. Those schools which would do worst out of it are the schools which currently receive most from us, that is, the most needy schools. Biala Special School, Inala Rudolph Steiner School for Curative Education, the Autistic Children's Daycare Centre in Randwick, and the Dame Pattie Menzies School for Intellectually Handicapped Persons would be the sorts of schools that would lose most in terms of Commonwealth grants. Those are the schools that are providing more expensive services to kids whose needs are greatest. Yet they would get their grants ripped off them and in return the parents of children at those schools would get a voucher which would go nowhere near covering the fee increase necessary to compensate for the lack of support from the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>

This Government had to take the decision to slow it down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a result of the decisions we have taken in this last year, with successive reductions in interest rates, with the move that will take place to build up stocks in this country, and with the flowthrough into the pockets of those in employment of the benefits of the tax cuts from 1 January, by the end of this year Australia will come out of its recession. But it will come out of its recession because this Government, as distinct from those opposite, has been prepared both to take the necessarily tough economic decisions to put this country in a better place to face the challenges of the future, and, as well, to do that with a compassionate face and ensured that for those who are out of work firstly there is a range of training and retraining programs, which the Opposition would abolish, and secondly there is the commitment to continue unemployment benefits indefinitely, as distinct from what the Opposition would do-that is, abolish them after nine months.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday the Governor had this to say in an address on the economy and the likelihood of a pick-up:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>But it is achievable and activity should begin to pick up during the second half of 1991, aided by the substantial reductions in interest rates that have occurred in 1990, the countercyclical workings of fiscal policy, the eventual turnaround of the stock and housing cycle, and the improvement in inflationary expectations.</PARA>
<PARA>I most heartily concur with those sentiments in the way they have been expressed. As you will recall, Mr Speaker, I did answer yesterday part of the question put to me today in relation to the impact of a $3 billion reduction in spending on the economy, saying that the Government was not going to counter that cycle within fiscal policy by seeking to cut outlays further.</PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the Opposition's policies which have been proposed to the Government as prescriptions for a recovery would not produce a recovery. We have now gleaned from the Leader of the Opposition that this, to date, is his manifesto: the double taxation, with State and Federal income tax, of individuals; a consumption tax on all goods; vouchers for health and education; and no wages policy to keep costs and inflation under control.</PARA>
<PARA> That means there would be two brand new taxes: State income tax and a consumption tax levied on all goods. This is the Liberal Party at its taxing best. Education responsibilities would be transferred from government to individuals, as my colleague has just demonstrated. In health there would be an income blow-out for doctors, letting them charge what they could get away with through a voucher system.</PARA>
<PARA> These are all the notions of the visiting professor, the fellow who visits issues. He wafts in and out of the issues, never fleshing the proposals out. We know he is a professor, but what we have learnt lately is that he is just a visiting professor-visiting issues without saying what he stands for, and all on the pretence that he is not really a politician but some sort of commentator putting views for public debate rather than having clear responsibilities to articulate a policy, to explain how vouchers will work for doctors or for education, to explain how the double taxation of income will produce lower tax or to explain what rates there will be under a consumption tax.</PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition is a one-dimensional person. He says his expertise is on the economy, yet his sole contributions are on consumption tax and double taxation. On everything else-on foreign policy, education and health-he has simply blundered around. There was his soup kitchen proposal for pensioners to send them down to the Matthew Talbot Hostel to get their pension cheque and a bowl of soup.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable gentleman has not been around here long. I would say to him what I said the other day. I do not recall being asked questions over the past 7 1/2 years as to whether I or the Treasurer should be congratulated for the indisputable fact that there are nearly 1.6 million Australians now in work who were not in work when we came to office, and that that has occurred under a range of policies which gave employment growth to Australia four times faster than those opposite gave it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact is that because of our policies, compared with the level of policies and level of employment that those opposite had in place when they were in office, those Australians are in work. Under us, to the tune of 1.6 million more people are in work than when we came to office, because the range of policies that we have had-our fiscal policy, our wages policy and our monetary policy-has produced a rate of employment growth which is, as I say, four times faster than it was under those opposite. Unfortunately, we had reached a position in this country where, as a result of the growth that had been generated, we had a level of expenditure-this is a simple indisputable fact; we are all part of it-which was rising twice as fast as our level of production. If we were going to have a proper concern for the honourable member's constituent-and for every single Australian--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What is the response of the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel to allegations levelled at the Department of Defence by Senator Newman that it has increased its spending on external consultancy work by over 800 per cent over the last three years?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="991" SPEAKER="Bilney The Hon G.N." NAMEID="RE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="KINGSTON" MINISTERIAL="DEFENCE SCIENCE AND PERSONNEL" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RE4">Mr BILNEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are few people in this House who pay as much attention to the important issue of defence as the honourable member for Oxley. Senator Newman's claim that we have increased consultancy expenditure in the Department of Defence over the last four years reminds me of the old adage: there are lies, damned lies and statistics. Her calculations are based on a false figure for the base year that she uses, which is the financial year 1986-87, and she quotes a figure for external consultancies of that year of $2.559m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> She has been told twice, on 19 December 1989 and 19 July 1990, that that figure is false. It excludes major items such as consultancies performed for computing, for capital procurement-which in the Department of Defence runs at over $2 billion a year-and for the old Office of Defence Production, which has since been abolished. After the authority to commission consultancy work was devolved in 1985 the detailed figures were not held centrally, so the figure that she is using for that year is simply not comparable with subsequent years. She knows that, and still she persists in distorting the facts.</PARA>
<PARA> The reliable figures, which are available, are those from 1987-88 through to 1989-90, and in that period consultancy expenditure rose by 83 per cent. That is a tenth of what Senator Newman says is the case. That 83 per cent figure is not small, but honourable members will appreciate that Defence over those years, like the public sector generally, did take its share of reductions in personnel and has sought, very wisely in my view, not to retain expertise in-house simply for the sake of it.</PARA>
<PARA> In line with modern management practice and in a drive to get the most value for the budgetary dollar, Defence does commission outside experts to perform specialist tasks. Many of those are related to the new capabilities with which we are equipping the Australian armed forces. Many of them are related to our emphasis on environmental responsibility, which I am sure members would want to see pursued rigorously.</PARA>
<PARA> It is particularly deplorable that the items which Senator Newman singles out in her press release to criticise relate to the area of training and staff development. That work is aimed at improving skills and productivity and it yields very substantial benefits to the nation.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that one of the things that she does single out is a consultancy of $19,000 to develop a survey questionnaire on attitudes to ethics amongst defence staff. Were she herself to undergo that questionnaire I suspect she would fail it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The hypocrisy of this question is mind-boggling. In case the Leader of the Opposition has any doubt about this, I point out that yesterday I had the opportunity of speaking with representatives of the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Association. They left me in no doubt whatsoever as to the horror they entertain at the possibility of the Leader of the Opposition ever being given the responsibility of government. They are the people-not us here-who analyse closely the alternatives between this Government's policies and the Opposition's policies in the area of social welfare and security. These people are appalled, as they properly should be, by the prospect of having to live under the policies that have been espoused by the Leader of the Opposition.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt who would suffer in this community if that $3 billion expenditure cut was undertaken; it would be the poor and the underprivileged. We have seen the philosophy which underlies the Opposition's approach. My colleague Ministers in the areas of education and health have pointed out what the philosophy of the Opposition is. The philosophy is stark. At least we can give Opposition members credit for this: they do very little to disguise where their sympathies lie. They do not lie with the poor and underprivileged; they lie with the already privileged in this community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the area of health, the Opposition's policies are calculated to enhance the position of the private health funds and the doctors. In the area of education their policies are aimed at looking after those who are already relatively well attended for and best able to look after themselves. If the Opposition were to implement its vicious reduction of $3 billion in Commonwealth expenditure, it would be the poor, including children in poor families, who would suffer. That is why I say that the hypocrisy of the Leader of the Opposition in asking this question is mind-boggling.</PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Leader of the Opposition of what has been done in the area of payments to those most in need. Three years ago, we introduced the family allowance supplement which provides tax-free cash assistance to low income families. I will give an indication of what that means. At present, more than half a million families, including 1.2 million children, are being helped by family allowance supplement benefits or payments or their equivalent in extra pensions and benefits, including family allowances. This involves over $2 billion of Commonwealth funding for children in low income families. We have indexed family allowance supplements and other family payments to the consumer price index and last month they rose again. They rose to $26.50 a week for each child under 13 and $38.65 a week for teenagers between the ages of 13 and 15.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The measure of what we have done is highlighted by the fact that this brings the real increase in payments for children under 13 to 45 per cent. That is a 45 per cent real increase since 1983 and over 110 per cent real increase for children between the ages of 13 and 15.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Work by the Social Policy Research Centre has estimated that over the period 1982-83 to 1989-90, the real income of families with children in the bottom 10 per cent of the income range has increased by 17.6 per cent. That is as a result of carefully calculated, directed, targeted assistance to the sort of people whom the Leader of the Opposition is talking about-not airy, waffly, off-the-top-of-the-head concepts, but hard slogging work done in conjunction with the organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> When we were fixing the benchmarks for assistance in family allowance supplement payments, we talked with the Brotherhood of St Laurence. We asked its members, `What sort of proportion of the basic pension rate should be fixed as a percentage for family allowance supplement payments?'. It was with the specific assistance of the Brotherhood of St Laurence and other organisations that we set these figures. We have brought in these massive real increases in payments totalling over $2 billion, which have led these same organisations to say publicly that these are the most historic moves that have ever been made by any Federal Government in the history of this country to deal with these problems.</PARA>
<PARA> These organisations, including the Brotherhood of St Laurence, are on the public record as saying that about this Government's projects and policies. Against that achievement, we have this hypocritical Leader of the Opposition coming up and asking this question when, at the same time, he is saying he would cut $3 billion off these very programs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Has Australia's approach to the future of sanctions in South Africa been reflected in the outcome of the recent meeting of the Commonwealth Foreign Ministers Committee on South Africa?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="994" SPEAKER="Hawke The Hon R.J.L." NAMEID="YD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WILLS" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable gentleman for his question. As we would all agree, this is an important issue on which this Government feels, quite properly, a high degree of responsibility because Australia, as is well known, led the way in securing the imposition of sanctions, and Australia will take the lead in removing them as it is appropriate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In response to President de Klerk's speech of 2 February, we developed a proposal for the phased lifting of sanctions as the South African Government implements its proposed reforms. We called for a meeting last weekend of the Commonwealth Foreign Ministers Committee to discuss it. Before that meeting in London last weekend, there was a preceding meeting of the front line states in Harare, which indicated-I may say, unfortunately-no willingness to consider any lifting of sanctions at all for the foreseeable future.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans, therefore, went to London last weekend with a fairly stiff job-to bring some of his Commonwealth colleagues around to the Australian way of thinking on this point. I am glad to say that in the event the meeting clearly accepted the principle of phased relaxation of sanctions in response to further developments as they occur. The meeting specified the point at which that process of relaxation should begin-a point which is widely expected to be reached in May or June of this year.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the meeting accepted the Australian proposal that sporting contact should be resumed in those sports that had achieved non-racial unity, in consultation with the non-racial sports bodies in South Africa.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, I have noticed that the Opposition issued press releases a couple of days ago suggesting that this outcome is a defeat for Australian policy. Let me put it this way: the train that was bound for a democratic, non-racial South Africa pulled out of the station a long, long time ago, and that train is fast approaching its destination. It is fast approaching its destination because there were men and women of courage and vision, both inside and outside South Africa. May I say that no-one from this Opposition was ever aboard that train: at every point when the world, with Australia playing a leading role in it, imposed those sanctions to bring South Africa to its senses, we met with opposition from those on the other side of this House.</PARA>
<PARA> Let me point out that in his press release the Opposition spokesman on sport claims that there will be no early resumption of any sporting links because the African National Congress (ANC) `opposes sporting links, even with integrated codes'. Let me say simply that he is wrong on this. The ANC has made it specifically clear to us that that is not its position. Its position is that it is in favour of sporting contact once the internal condition of integration within South Africa is satisfied.</PARA>
<PARA> In another press release the Opposition foreign affairs spokesman said that we had failed to offer President de Klerk any encouragement. That is what he said-that we had failed to offer any encouragement. Interestingly, that is not what President de Klerk says. In the Age yesterday, the President himself-the one to whom the Opposition says we have not given any encouragement-said this:</PARA>
<PARA>`But leading countries in the Commonwealth-</PARA>
<PARA>there is no doubt who he is talking about-</PARA>
<PARA>have taken it upon them to take a stance that also from the Commonwealth there must emanate a new approach towards South Africa.'</PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>`And I think that the debate has started there and I am confident that we can look forward to continued improvements of our international relationships.'</PARA>
<PARA>We are the country that started that debate in the Commonwealth. Mr de Klerk says that he is encouraged by it.</PARA>
<PARA> As the Opposition has been wrong at every other point over all the years, it is wrong again. It is wrong in not associating with the rest of the world in applying sanctions to bring South Africa to its senses. As a result of our actions, together with those of like minded people around the world, that train is pulling into the station of a free, democratic, non-racial South Africa. The Opposition has no credibility. It has never been aboard. When it utters any statements now, it will be treated as it has been over the last two years-as totally irrelevant. That is precisely as it should be treated on this foundationally important issue, on which it has been useless from the beginning and on which it is irrelevant now.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I insist that it is not a dorothy dixer. The honourable member for Burke has a long-standing and legitimate concern with higher education provision in the west of Melbourne.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To go back to the honourable member's question, there has been some suggestion that the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology may be considering pulling out of the Victorian University of Technology which, as honourable members would be aware, is an amalgamation of the RMIT, the Footscray Institute of Technology and the Western Institute. Quite frankly, were that to occur I think we would regard it as a very serious setback for educational provision in Victoria. The Victorian University of Technology, as a concept, is certainly one that has the potential to provide significant improvements in higher education in that State, particularly servicing the western suburbs of Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA> We have put a lot of funds into that. In capital terms, we are proposing to spend something like one-third of the Victorian capital program that was to go into the Victorian University of Technology. We have been prepared to fund substantial growth for that institution at high rates. Frankly, I think that is an indication of our commitment to that institution.</PARA>
<PARA> There is a more general problem in Victoria in that a number of institutional arrangements in the higher education area have yet to be finalised. That has created a particular difficulty for the Commonwealth in terms of making funding decisions. Last year we attempted to reform the process of funding higher education institutions in such a way as to place them on a more equitable footing and to do it in a way that more accurately reflects what each higher education institution does-the nature of the courses it teaches and the cost of providing those courses-rather than on some historical accident.</PARA>
<PARA> In the last set of announcements of the funding for the 1991-93 triennium it was not possible for us to finalise the funding decisions for the great bulk of institutions in Victoria, simply because negotiations regarding amalgamations were still proceeding. The Victorian Government was interested in pursuing some amalgamation proposals and negotiating them with the institutions themselves.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member asked what the Commonwealth's role was in all of this. Of course, the primary legislative responsibility lies with the State and the responsibility for finalising institutional arrangements, in the first instance, lies with the State and the institutions themselves. However, as the funding authority involved, we clearly have a legitimate interest and concern about that. In our annual profile negotiations with the institutions we negotiate as to what each institution will teach and the nature of the courses it is providing, in a broad sense, and we provide funding on that basis.</PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, it is a matter of real concern if the VUT looks like it will fall apart and we are very anxious to see institutional arrangements in Victoria tied up. The Victorian Government has taken some fairly decisive steps recently in order to bring about that result. We are very supportive of those steps and very supportive of the Victoria University of Technology.</PARA>
<PARA> The final part of the honourable member's question seeks a commitment from the Federal Government that it will maintain its commitment to expanding higher education opportunities in the west of Melbourne. I can give that commitment unequivocally, but if the VUT does not go ahead in its proposed form that task will be made that much more difficult. A range of funding decisions which have already been made will clearly have to be reviewed as a consequence.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="997" SPEAKER="Howe The Hon B.L." NAMEID="EH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BATMAN" MINISTERIAL="COMMUNITY SERVICES AND HEALTH" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The examination of alternatives, particularly alternatives that come from those opposite, takes us beyond the proposal with respect to the privatisation of social security and welfare, as the Prime Minister suggested at the time of the last election. One has to remember that the Opposition has been speaking recently about the need for $3 billion worth of cuts, and of course advocated alternative policies at the last election. Essentially, the Opposition argued that not only should there be reductions in expenditure of that order, but also that half of that money should come out of social security-half of it should be taken from those who are most disadvantaged-and something like $800m ought to be saved from those people who are unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So it is no surprise that the Opposition should put forward, as the honourable member for Corio suggested, a proposition that at a time in which there are economic difficulties, at a time in which there is increasing unemployment, the responsibility for that should be shifted from the public sector to the non-government sector; that responsibility should be privatised so voluntary agencies bear that responsibility rather than its being borne by the taxpayer-in other words, we ought to take that expenditure out of taxation, out of the Government's hands, and move it out into the private sector with the result that one would not be able to achieve a degree of efficiency or a degree of fairness, and one would not be able to see any degree of care. Of course that proposition, as were other propositions from the Leader of the Opposition, was a throwaway. It was poorly thought through, and it was careless in terms of those whom it would affect most.</PARA>
<PARA> That, again, is characteristic of the Opposition's proposals. Just last Friday we had another proposal, in a so-called Cowper lecture, to privatise health insurance, and move to a kind of voucher system. Again that was a proposal that was immediately dumped by the Opposition spokesperson, the honourable member for Lowe. There is no sense of loyalty in the Opposition; no sense of any recognition of its Leader. In fact, the honourable member for Lowe stated that it was only one of a number of options. However, rather revealingly in terms of his predecessor, he said that if this option shacks up better than other options, it is the one Opposition members will go for. If it does not, they will go for one of the others.</PARA>
<PARA> We can understand that attitude. Imagine facing a situation and having that nightmare behind you-the Shack collapsed policy; you are grappling with a policy anticipated by the Leader of the Opposition, but he is wrong and you are not going to shack up with him. We can understand the problem. Fundamentally there is a difference between this side of the House and that side of the House, and basically it is about responsibility-about responsibility at a time in which one ought to see perhaps some care rather than the kind of crocodile tears that we see from the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA> In the same interview, the member for Lowe said that what the Opposition would like to do-referring, no doubt, to health, but any other social policy would do-is have a policy under which if people are worse off, they are worse off by choice. That is essentially what it is about. It is about not taking responsibility. It is essentially privatising responsibility and moving responsibility back to these people who are most affected, those people who deserve some concern. Every time this Opposition raises a social issue, it is to ridicule, to cajole, to avoid responsibility.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The test of a government-and again I would say the choice is clear-is not the good times. It is not the time when people can see the growth of the 1 1/2 million jobs; it is the time when there is rising unemployment, there is difficulty, there is recession. Again the contrast is clear. Every year that we have been in government we have done something to improve social security payments, to improve things for those who are most in need.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We should look at the performance of those opposite. Every year that they were in government they reduced expenditure and cut into the payments that were designed to provide support. Against their inability to form social policy, we on our side of the House have a commitment to build not only a social security system in terms of a safety net that produces benchmarks, standards, indexation and cover, but also a social security system with links beyond social security and Medicare in an effort to ensure that the training programs and opportunities are there for people to get their foot back onto the ladder and get back into the work force.</PARA>
<PARA> What we as a political party are about is not only equity; we have been about opportunity. What those opposite are about is inequity-not only burying people, but essentially saying, `You are there and it is your own responsibility'. Those opposite are not about equity; they are about inequity. It is time they acknowledged it, and that is why the Leader of the Opposition will never make any shakes in terms of a leader of a major political party in this Parliament.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an important matter to bring before the House and one that certainly has not been answered in any way by today's Question Time. It is not always recognised or understood that when Paul Keating assumed the role of Treasurer here in Canberra he brought as riding instructions one foolscap page of economic policy and a raft of social policies-people policies, if you like.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These people policies and the consequent institutions required for their implementation blew his first Budget into deficit by approximately $7 billion and the three subsequent Budgets into deficit by an additional $19 billion. The Treasurer chose to justify this massive injection of unearned income into the economy by blaming the deficit on the previous Fraser Government. The tragic fact is that he has battled with the economic consequences of that decision ever since. </PARA>
<PARA> Combined with his correct but unresearched decision to deregulate the Australian financial system, the Treasurer called up a maelstrom that, although reasonably slow in its gestation, has now unleashed upon the Australian community in unparalleled fashion a full blown recession, if not depression. </PARA>
<PARA> Treasurer Keating has been unique in Australian history not only for his arrogance, but also for almost constantly having the Australian economy performing in the opposite direction from that of the rest of the developed world. Throughout his stewardship, developed world economies have been buoyant and yet have experienced low interest rates and low inflation. However, having overinflated the Australian economy, the Treasurer felt obliged to hose it down. But again he did so with no understanding and little knowledge. Defying established economic theory and more particularly historic experience, he applied the single blunt instrument of high interest rates. In other words, having built an economy on debt, he made that debt so expensive that the economy has collapsed. </PARA>
<PARA> Before this debate is over-in fact it has happened half a dozen times through Question Time-a Government speaker will claim that the Government's economic policies have created some 1.5 million jobs. Yet, in support of my argument, a simple division of the number of those jobs into the foreign debt of this nation will show that the debt is equivalent to approximately four years wages per individual per job. We have had a debt led recovery and an interest rate led recession, hardly an example of economic expertise. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a brief and dispassionate history of the Australian economy under the world's best Treasurer. We have heard it many times. The purpose of my matter of public importance (MPI) today is to try to get the Government, and more particularly the Treasurer, to understand the human consequences and tragedy that have resulted from this incompetence. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures on unemployment are more dispassionate statistics. They tell us that in the last 18 months the number of unemployed in this country have grown from 483,400 to 767,700-an increase of 284,300 people, or 58.8 per cent. The Treasurer comes into the Parliament every day to rationalise those figures and to explain, `They're really not too bad'. We can put any interpretation we like on 700,000 people being unemployed, but for the individual who becomes unemployed it is an absolute tragedy. As politicians, even collectively, we do not meet the 700,000, but we do come into contact with large numbers. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the debate of the past has centred upon the intractable long term unemployed, the individuals I am meeting today are the long term employed who have just lost their jobs. What strikes me most in interviewing these people is the absolute confusion and despair that is so evident in their faces. Many have become ill; most have dropped their bundle completely because they cannot visualise the future; many are angry that their unemployment is the result of the actions of a government whose words they trusted and for which many of them voted. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government, which is so intent on defending itself and telling us that it is not really happening, spends no time defining the future-and today was no different. The last speech on this subject, which the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) seemed so proud of, had nothing to say about the future. It gave these people no vision; it gave them no encouragement. They talked about handouts, yes, but not the future direction. </PARA>
<PARA> No doubt some would seek to lay the blame with heartless employers. Let me tell honourable members the true story related to me by a State parliamentarian colleague of a discussion with a businessman in his electorate who wept as he described the dismantling of his work force, forced upon him by the recession. The employer did not weep for his business; he wept because he had to dismiss a long-serving and loyal work force which in fact he saw as his life's work. This is just one example that I know of personally. It is happening in thousands of small businesses around the nation. Human resources, well trained and coordinated as a team, are being ripped apart by the recession we had to have, or the Treasurer's earlier inflationary policies that we certainly did not need. The Government has a debt for jobs policy-and that is what it is: borrow the money anywhere we can get it; create the jobs. That debt for jobs policy is falling apart, and it is a national and human tragedy. </PARA>
<PARA> The wording of this matter of public importance is on the desk of every honourable member. Its meaning is clear. It is an attempt to get those on the Government benches to understand how their ill-directed and ill-conceived economic policies are hurting individual Australians. It is to tell them that the thousands of empty shops and small factories that we see for the first time in 50 years are evidence not only of bankrupt businesses but also of lost jobs right through the chain that has supplied those businesses with goods and services. It is to tell them that when builders go broke they go broke because people can no longer afford to buy a badly needed home and are therefore living in sub-standard accommodation or paying excessive rent. It is to tell them that when farmers' incomes are reduced to the negative by high interest rates it is their kids who lose the opportunity for higher education. The purpose of the matter of public importance is to try to tell the Government those sorts of things. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to tell the Government that people experience ill health, marriage breakdown and many other undesirable social consequences as a result of the Government's induced economic pressures that now exist in our community. I would like to call upon the Government backbenchers to stop serving up their Ministers dorothy dix questions aimed at covering up this disaster and, as coalition backbenchers certainly did during the Fraser Government, ask those Ministers the searching questions that identify the extent of the economic problems of their constituents. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask honourable members opposite to demand that their Ministers put responsible government ahead of political rhetoric and tell Australians the truth and provide policies for the future of Australian families. Government members were put on notice of this matter of public importance but, sadly, they show the arrogant disregard of their Treasurer by their absence from the chamber today. For the record, there are four Government members in the Parliament at this moment and not one an official Minister. They might be excused for avoiding some speeches of a more political nature, but they have a total responsibility to participate in a debate that deals directly with the difficulties of their own constituents, that deals directly with the human tragedy of the Government's deliberate recession-the one we had to have. My colleague the honourable member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey) is to expand considerably on individual cases of personal tragedy and I trust that some Government members who may be listening at this moment might consider those examples worthy of their attention and return to the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> The final plea I make on behalf of individual Australians in regard to this Government-induced recession is that the Government recognises not only the existence of the recession but also its magnitude-not only the outdated statistics but also the personal effects and fears that now exist in our community-and that its policies have created this situation and its solutions, if it has any, are not working. Hand-outs are a temporary solution. Most Australians want the pride of employment and the security of an affordable home. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday, during Question Time, Government Ministers demonstrated just how out of touch they are with the community. In search of political advantage, the Government delivered an orchestrated attack on remarks made last week by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) which were aimed at focusing the debate on solutions to the Government's failure. The remarks by our Leader could be best summarised by saying that the coalition puts the value and individual needs of people ahead of institutions and that we believe that if financial relief is directed to the individual they will spend it more wisely to the general economic good. </PARA>
<PARA> Minister after Minister stood to defend the institutions of their departments. Even the matter of public importance was structured to this end. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) put an impassioned case for disadvantaged schools but did not say one word about disadvantaged students or their parents, and today he has rambled on again trying to back up and protect his ridiculous position, ignoring completely that governments traditionally do not hand out dollars in round figures but target, in all these policies of individual help, those most in need-a basic plank of coalition philosophy. But then, of course, his ignorance is such that he still subscribes to the socialistic belief that all the poor live in the same suburb-a not surprising misconception when one remembers his patrician upbringing. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday, the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) defended Medicare and attacked the Opposition but provided not one word of advice-as he failed again to do today-on how he will overcome the personal sufferings of individuals on hospital waiting lists, which he now admits exist. The only certainty is that he will not let them occupy those empty beds in those hated private hospitals, any more than the Minister for Employment, Education and Training was prepared to simply pay Austudy to those who chose to attend a private university-perhaps for the reason that they could not get into a public one because there were not enough places. </PARA>
<PARA> Last night, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) showed some integrity in admitting that his policies had contributed to the disastrous financial situation in the wool industry. But when will the Treasurer wind down the tinted windows of his Commonwealth car and recognise that winning the argument is no solution to saving the economy and reinstating the hopes and aspirations of typical Australians?</PARA>
<PARA> When will the Treasurer recognise that the Australian people are entitled to know they have a future? When will he get up here and talk about how he is going to fix things, not just stand up here and deliver his usual insults and refuse to answer questions? When will he recognise that institutionalised labour markets, like other institutionalised marketing systems, have developed to the benefit of the institution, not to the benefit of the people? Put succinctly, when will the Treasurer and this Government give the people a go? When will they stop putting their political survival ahead of the survival of the people? When will they provide Australians with practical policies for the future? If they do not do it soon there will be a complete and utter degradation of the confidence of ordinary Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> Already in my farming electorate I am being told by travellers and others, `I go to places and people are doing nothing. They don't know where to turn. They've dropped their bundle; they're in a vacuum'. If that is to be Australia's way under the Government then we have a real disaster on our hands. Only the people of Australia will fix it and the Government has to give them the encouragement and the assistance to do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to contribute this afternoon initially by suggesting that what we have heard from the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) is a slightly different method of presentation of what is a substantially similar theme. We have seen the quiet approach, the heart-rending, not a dry eye in the House, type of approach in relation to the problems of rural Australia and so on as if there is no recognition on behalf of anyone on the Government side that the recession which Australia presently is in is not causing difficulties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member went to some great pains to implore the Government to give consideration to future directions and future policies and not simply to rely on some of the policies of the past. I would like to cover those specific issues that he has raised in the same quiet, gentle manner in which he approached this matter today, without getting hysterical and without trying to gloss over some of the facts that might otherwise cloud an issue so significant as this. </PARA>
<PARA> The first thing I want to do is suggest to him that I, representing an area of the Illawarra region, am pretty well suited to talk about problems of unemployment, to talk about problems created by governments and to talk about issues of great moment with ordinary working class folk in this country. In 1982-83 I can remember the fact that through the policies of those opposite the Illawarra's unemployment rate rose to the order of 16 to 18 per cent. I can remember that youth unemployment was of the order of 30 per cent, directly caused by the policies espoused by those opposite and, incidentally, directed by the present Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) when he was an economic adviser to the then Treasurer, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). </PARA>
<PARA> I can also remember that since 1982-83, when structural changes have occurred in the Illawarra, we have seen an improvement in the position only because of what this Government has done. We have seen, for example, the unemployment rate go down to 8.4 per cent-still higher than the national average-but a lot better than it was during the structural devastation that was imposed on the industrial heartland of Australia by those sorts of policies. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also heard concern about interest rates and about the problems associated with the person trying to borrow to buy a better quality home. I remind the honourable member for O'Connor-I am sure he recognises that this is the case-that since February of last year, 13 months ago, the Government has released the economic brakes, in terms of interest rate policy, by six percentage points-the big six. What has that been reflected in in terms of what the banks have passed on in terms of mortgage rates? Interest rates have decreased by 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 per cent-2 per cent at best if we are prepared to take a five-year fixed mortgage and then go to something else in the market place. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that as late as today, Mr Will Bailey from the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd was talking about the fact that there is still room for a further 1.5 percentage point fall and that that will come by the middle of this year. I ask people like the honourable member for O'Connor, and obviously the honourable member who is going to follow in this debate: if people have been impeded from borrowing money because of interest rates where do they stand now in terms of housing? Where do they stand now in terms of borrowing money to invest in productive capacity in this country? Where do these people stand when it might well be demonstrated that the banks are running a secondary monetary policy in this country, trying to second guess the Government and its advisers? Because of decisions taken by the banks in the past, they have seen themselves burned and burdened with massive debts because people borrow massive amounts of money not to put into productive capacity, unfortunately, but simply to jump on the assets bandwagon. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the honourable member for O'Connor to perhaps give some consideration to how governments-whether it be this Government or even a government of the conservatives-would approach that same position. Would a conservative government try to stop people borrowing? Would it try to stop credit being made available and, if so, what does it say now when employment is down and we are trying to create jobs by hopefully seeing banks being prepared to lend for creative enterprises-job generating creative enterprises-in this country? What is the answer in a situation like that?</PARA>
<PARA> The other fundamental point which needs to be made right at the outset is the question about policies and the future and what this Government stands for and has stood for in the past. It has been oft said in this place in debate on the question of the economy that wages policy, fiscal policy and monetary policy are all important. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of wages policy-and I know the honourable member for O'Connor and others will probably say that this is repetitious and that they have heard it before, but it is a fact and they cannot escape it-this Government has a wages policy. It has an accord with the trade union movement. The last increase that was passed on based on the consumer price index figure for the September quarter of 0.7 per cent is an appropriate response to conditions at the present moment. It is not irresponsible; it is appropriate. Yet there are those on the other side of the House who suggest it is otherwise; they say it is not appropriate. Why would they not say that?</PARA>
<PARA> If we turn our attention back to the 1983-87 period, we recall that every time there was a national wage case in this country, who opposed it? There are no prizes for guessing the answer-those who are now on the opposition benches of this place. If there was one thing that those on the opposite side of the House were consistent with, it was their opposition to wages, to wage increases and to the national wage cases. But when they come in here and when questions are directed at various spokespeople about wages policy and employment policy, what are we met with-waffle and nothing more. We got a glib press release put out on a Sunday night-a trick probably learned from a former Premier of New South Wales, one suspects-in which they say that we have got to work 40 hours. Next weekend it might go up to 45 hours; the weekend after it might be 50 hours-who knows? That is the sort of thinking that is coming from Opposition members; it is `back to the future' stuff that we talked about in the past. There is no question but that Australians have to work harder. I do not think anybody in this place would disagree with that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague the honourable member for Canning says, Australians have got to work smarter. That is not necessarily to say that we should go back to working 40 or 45 or 50 hours a week. In certain industries even today, the overtime capacities will see those benefits passed on to average workers in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While wages policy is so fundamental-and we cannot get any idea from members on the other side what they are on about-the other questions concern employment, employment generation and policies there. As was canvassed today in Question Time by a number of Ministers, I think it is important to recognise that at least this Government, through its long history, has taken an active interest in looking at training programs and employment programs and benefits to pass on. Had it not been, for example, for the steel plan, the car plan, the textiles, clothing and footwear plan, we would have been looking at the total loss of those jobs. We would have seen those industries go straight out the door. But we have not seen that; we have seen them return to a profitability. We have therefore seen employment opportunities passed on and improvements made to our overseas debt levels and our balance of payments and our terms of trade, because active plans have been put in place. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no secret within this Parliament and within this nation at the moment that it is this side of the House, it is this Party, which is driving the debate on the future of Australia's economic and industry policy. It is no secret that because of the intellectual rigour on this side of the Parliament, we are debating at great length industry policy, industry statements, economic policy, and we are coming up with needs for future Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for O'Connor threw down the challenge. He threw down the gauntlet to the Government about the future and about not looking backwards. I agree with him and I endorse what he says. This Government is about that process now and I think-no, I know-that come the March statement which is going to be handed down in this place by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and a number of other Ministers, after that rigorous debate from those on this side of the House who have the intellectual rigour to follow it through-not just a throw-away line perhaps on a Sunday night-we will see some positive initiatives in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now address the alternatives. I know that those on the other side of the House will again say that I am being repetitive because this is what the Ministers say in Question Time in response to the nonsensical questions thrown to them. What do we see from the Opposition in terms of alternatives? We see a consumption tax thrown on people that the Opposition is now feigning its concern over as being unemployed. I ask the honourable member for O'Connor: what is his view on that now? Is it somewhat changed? This approach that he adopted today in the debate, this low key, heart on the sleeve approach was very appropriate, and I wonder if the metamorphosis is completely concluded and he is now on the consumption tax bandwagon. Perhaps he could let us know a little later his version of what the rate should be-whether it should be 12 per cent, 15 per cent or 20 per cent. Perhaps he could tell us what we should do about wholesale tax and about sales tax. We will wait for his response on that. </PARA>
<PARA> As he is a former spokesperson on health, we would be interested in his views about the voucher system and obviously the others for education. It is a bit like a tram conductor's holiday-a voucher for this, a voucher for that; a red one for health, a blue one for education, a pink one for something else. We are not quite sure where it is going to end. I raise that issue because I think there are a few important points that need clarification. My colleague at the table, the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), takes a very active interest in these sorts of issues, not just rural Australia. He is probably endeavouring to bring some intellectual rigour to this discussion, but he should stand up in his place and put his views more freely. His views may be of interest to us all. </PARA>
<PARA> The other issue of importance is social security. What have we heard from the Opposition members in terms of how they would look after the poor? Firstly, they will cut $3 billion off government outlays-$3 billion out the door. We have heard previously from Opposition spokespeople on these issues. They say they have concern for the unemployed and the downtrodden and the poor in this country because that is a good line, and it is a good line at the moment. But when it comes to it, who is the Opposition going to get into first? It is those very same people, because the Opposition has it on the record. </PARA>
<PARA> As was said in Question Time today, the Opposition members would have the unemployed go to the Matthew Talbot Hostel to receive their unemployment cheques or to Peat Marwick Hungerfords, where they would line up, go into the marble foyer, sit down on the leather couches and wait for their unemployment cheque to be handed over. We see the privatisation and soup kitchen mentality that arises on the other side of the House. We are concerned that the level of thinking that the honourable member for O'Connor has brought to the attention of every member of this House for consideration might still be permeating those on the other side. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member opposite today showed a great deal of compassion which, as I have said, is rather uncharacteristic but very pleasing to see. I would like to see the honourable gentleman, along with the speaker who will follow and those others who are here listening, take that to the party room and perhaps see whether they can build it into a momentum. They should see if they can get those on their side of the House to give away the silly ideas that occasionally come off the top of the head of the Leader of the Opposition-without following through, and without having to stand the test of intellectual rigour imposed through questioning in debate in this place and, of course, from those outside who have an interest in the matter. If the honourable member opposite is successful there he probably will win over some of the people on this side of the House. Indeed, he might even get an invitation to join one of the groups on this side of the House, but he should not hold his breath on that just yet. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last couple of minutes that I have, I wish to say in a very serious manner that the recession which presently grips this country is of concern to every member of this House, and there is no-one--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, since I have been in this House I do not think there has been a day on which there has not been a debate on the horrific state of the economy. But each time this Government delivers, as its answers, personal abuse, excuses, and a series of platitudes which demonstrate just how out of touch it is with reality. Today has been yet another example of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For the past 15 minutes we have listened to the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin), and we still have not heard any real, positive policy change to deal with future problems. It is time that we focussed on the human face of the tragedy of this recession. Whether I am in urban shopping centres or attending rural crisis meetings, I hear the same comments-`The Prime Minister and Treasurer do not understand our problems. They have no idea of the depth of the problems; they do not care; they are not willing to listen.' I must state for the record that neither the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) nor the Treasurer (Mr Keating) are prepared to come into the chamber and listen now. Is it any wonder that those suffering the effects of this recession feel neglected, and believe that the Government is out of touch with what it is like in the real world?</PARA>
<PARA> Today I wish to tell this House of the personal plight in which decent, hardworking people have found themselves as a direct result of the policies of this Government. Too often these problems are reported as just statistics. The Treasurer may not know the plight of his constituents in Blaxland, as he demonstrated in Question Time today, but let me tell the House about some of mine in McEwen. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, I wish to tell honourable members of the effect that this recession is having in urban areas. The greatest impact has been the number of people who have lost their homes, and the effect that this has had on their daily lives. This has been especially so in outer urban fringe areas such as Craigieburn and Epping on the northern fringe of Melbourne. Those who have lost their homes cannot afford to re-enter the housing market because often one of the partners has been made redundant and is unable to find employment. Rental accommodation in these areas is scarce, so family life is dislocated. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give an example: honourable members should drive down any one of these suburban streets and see the number of homes which are for sale. I know that one of these homes is for sale because its owner, a single parent, was made redundant six months ago. She has not been able to find new employment, and she has had to put her home up for sale because she has fallen behind with her repayments and has no prospects of remedying the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Community health workers report increased demands for emergency relief, and they fear that this demand will escalate beyond their capacity to deal with it. A recent survey conducted in Craigieburn in Victoria shows that there are families whose mortgage payment is 42 per cent of the family net income. Let me tell the House in the words of one family how this has affected them. The wife said: `We had intended our present home to be our first home until we had one child, or maybe two, and then move to a larger home. Due to increasing interest rates, we have been unable to realise our aspirations, despite my return to work part-time between the births of my children, making most of our children's clothes myself, plus forgoing holidays, plus careful purchasing of everyday essentials'. </PARA>
<PARA> In yet another case a mother told me, `I wanted to stay home with my child, but this is no longer an option. We will have to look at night shifts and split shifts to have more family time'. </PARA>
<PARA> Two days ago the member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) detailed the statistics exposing how this recession is affecting small business. Let me tell the House about just one of the thousands in my electorate. Three and a half years ago a family purchased a small business that was a going concern. They upgraded the business with new capital equipment. This business is in a growing area within commuting distance of Melbourne, and was regarded as an exciting and viable venture. Interest rates have forced this enterprise to re-finance. The downturn in the economy has resulted in a loss of trade. Currently it is for sale because the debt burden is just too heavy. </PARA>
<PARA> This business, along with others in the town which are all in the same position, have tried innovative means to stimulate business. For example, they have started market days with pony rides and bands in the street, trying to create a carnival atmosphere. As the owners of this and many other small businesses like it have said, `If someone would come along, look at our books and provide us with a formula to further cut overheads and increase trade, we would use it willingly'. But they have already cut overheads to the bone, and they have done everything possible to create more business. There simply is not the money around because people's disposable income has been reduced. They are consumed by a feeling of helplessness and hopelessness. </PARA>
<PARA> The rural industry has been particularly devastated. Take, for example, the young couple who began farming 12 years ago with an initial capital of $10,000. They gradually built up a successful property through sheer hard work. However, high interest rates, high tax and increasing costs have eroded this farming enterprise. In order to try to hang on to the property the husband has taken on a small contracting business, and has been forced to work as a barman two nights a week at a local hotel. Again, he has little time to spend with his family and is exhausted when he is at home. As he says, `There is nothing more I can do. I have prided myself on my skills, and yet I know I am going under'. </PARA>
<PARA> Another couple, with two children, lived on a 100-acre property purchased some years ago when the off-farm income of the wife was used to help with mortgage payments. The family ran this in conjunction with a larger property. Again, interest rates took their toll, and then the business where the wife was working closed down after 43 years of trading. As a result of the loss of the wife's income, falling commodity prices, increased costs and high interest rates, the farm income was not sufficient to support ongoing living costs and mortgage payments. That family has now separated as a result of living with these financial pressures. </PARA>
<PARA> The tragedy of cases like these is that the rural industry stands to lose hundreds of these young farmers. It stands to lose their skills and expertise, which the industry must have in the future in order to survive. Honourable members should remember that the average age of an Australian farmer today is 57. </PARA>
<PARA> Many counsellors believe that the hidden damage that is being done to family relationships will be more significant in the long term than the forced sales and evictions. There are numerous examples of personal crises ranging from loss of dignity and self-esteem, lack of self-confidence, increased anxiety states, to increased domestic violence. </PARA>
<PARA> Many farmers wives are being left to manage both farm and family while the husband finds off-farm work to sustain the family. The alternative to this is that the wife, especially if she has nursing or teaching qualifications, travels long distances to find employment, while the husband manages at home. In most cases it is the woman who will seek financial counselling, as often the male partner cannot bring himself to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also hundreds of examples in my electorate alone of the family allowance being used to buy the family's groceries. The situation has become so tough and there has been such a groundswell of concern that women have been calling public crisis meetings all over the country. The mushrooming of these groups, formed and attended by women who in the main have never spoken out in public before, demonstrates that they know the only way to draw attention to the extent of their problems is by holding public meetings-to put aside their pride and dignity and to bare their souls. </PARA>
<PARA> The common thread running through all these cases is that all of these people are trying to improve themselves, trying to make a better life for their families and contribute to the economy. On behalf of the thousands of people like those I have mentioned, I ask the Prime Minister and his Treasurer: when are they going to listen? When are they going to try to understand the depth of the problems facing these people? When are they going to pull their weight and do something to alleviate the suffering? As the owner of one business said to me, `All we want is a decent life. It shouldn't have to be this hard'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that every member of this House fully appreciates the pain and the suffering that many people across this nation have suffered over the past 12 to 18 months. Whilst I question the motive behind the matter of public importance that is before the House for debate, I really do not challenge its substance. In my own electorate people in small businesses have been hurting, people have lost their jobs, families have had a lesser capacity to purchase and a lower quality of life in recent times. I think this needs to be accepted, acknowledged and admitted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But that is not the real issue here. The real issue is the alternative. I know that the honourable member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey) spoke with full sincerity, but I ask her to take that sincerity and look at the situation in historical terms. I ask her to compare what this Government is doing and has been doing over the past seven years with what the Opposition parties did between 1978 and 1983. I ask her to look also at what the policies now being enunciated by the Opposition would do. People are hurting now, but it is mind-boggling to think what their lot would be under a Liberal-National Party government. </PARA>
<PARA> It needs to be placed on record also that regardless of the political persuasion of the economic experts, they have said across this nation that tough measures are necessary. In fact, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in January last year argued against a drop in interest rates. He tried to make out that it was some sort of ploy before an election. He was opposing a drop in interest rates. This is something the honourable member for McEwen is now speaking out against, saying that interest rates have hurt her constituents. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe, and certainly it is the strongly held belief of members of the Government, that Australia will be the beneficiary in the long term of the tough measures that have been adopted. It is easy to get out and talk about perceptions and to pick up on what is sometimes described as the bleeding heart issues. What is the true portrait for Australia for 1990, 1991, going through to 1992? I will not make political comparisons. Let us look at the statistics. We see a substantial decline in inflation and interest rates heading downwards. There has been a pick-up in housing commencements, despite the trauma and the hurt. Stocks have run down, and we appreciate how important this is because stocks will contribute to produce growth over the coming year. Despite the critics, there has been an emerging sustainable recovery from towards the end of 1990 and into 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the facts? I know that honourable members opposite do not like it, but the facts are that since 1983 we have had 1.6 million jobs created. That is a growth of 3.5 per cent per year, compared with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) figure of 1.7 per cent. If we compare that with the period from 1978 into 1982-83, when those opposite were in government, there was a one per cent growth. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the inflation rate. For the December quarter for the consumer price index, the rate was 6.9 per cent. From March 1989 into 1990 we have seen a significant downturn in the inflation rate to 5.4 per cent. In the Hawke-Keating period of government the inflation rate has averaged 7.5 per cent. What was it when the Opposition was in government? It was 10.3 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> Let us make some other comparisons over the 12 months to December 1990. The latest OECD figures show an average inflation rate of 7.4 per cent; the United States of America is 6.2 per cent; the United Kingdom 9.9 per cent; and Australia, as we have grappled with an extremely difficult situation, 6.9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for McEwen and the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) raised the issue of interest rates. This Government through its monetary policies has eased interest rates six times just in 1990. Let us look at the figures. Cash rates are six percentage points lower than they were in January 1990. The 90-day bills are now 11.5 per cent. The 10-year bonds have been cut by 2.5 per cent and are now down to 11.56. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With all due respect, the honourable member's own Leader talked about holding them up. If honourable members opposite want to talk about who has caused the crisis for people trying to buy homes and hold them, regrettably it is the banks. These are the same banks that their Leader defends, day by day, whether it be on AM or any other program. We have seen a 6 percentage points drop in commercial rates. What have we seen when it comes to domestic rates? The banks have brought them down by 1 1/2 to 2 per cent. What have they done with the interest rate on Bankcard? They have increased it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is the philosophy of the banks? I know of a businessman who went along to a bank and asked for an extended overdraft. He wanted $10,000. He would have got it on overdraft rates at 16 per cent. What did the bank offer him? The bank would not give him an overdraft on overdraft rates. Instead, he was offered a Bankcard extension. He was offered $10,000 at 24.6 per cent. And some honourable members have the audacity to get up here and blame this Government. This Government has been bringing policies to bear that have forced down the commercial interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> When we talk about the lot of the ordinary worker, let us consider what he pays in tax today, and I cited these figures in the House the other day. Let us compare the record of the Opposition when it was in government with ours, because that is the real comparison. That was the time when those opposite had the opportunity to do something about taxation. In 1980 a person paid tax once he earned over $3,893. Today he pays no tax unless he earns over $5,400. What was the tax rate once a worker earned more than that $3,893? It was 33 per cent. To be correct, the rate was 33.07 per cent. What is our tax rate today? The rate of tax on earnings up to $20,000 is 20 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members opposite have the audacity to talk about what they did and what we have not done. If ever a government has grappled with the tax situation it is this Government. The top level of taxation when the Opposition was in government was 61.07 per cent; ours is 47 per cent once a person earns over $50,000. Honourable members opposite talk about the lot of people, about pain and suffering. Under their Government there was no tax-free threshold for pensioners earning money, whether they were single or married. Under this Government, a married pensioner can earn $8,217 and pay no tax. A single pensioner can earn $9,789 and pay no tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the tax on income, because that is the ultimate test. It is the post-tax situation that determines how much money one has to spend. Back in 1980 a person earning $15,000 paid $3,673 in tax. In 1991 that level has been slashed to just over $1,900. A person earning $35,000 a decade ago paid $13,111.72 in tax; today he would pay $8,799. The same is true for the tax-free levels for the unemployed. Honourable members opposite talk about those who suffer, those in pain. Under the government of those opposite, people paid tax on every cent they got. Under our Government an unemployed married person pays no tax on the first $13,170 of income. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the other advantages we have when it comes to the support system, because that is the difference. What this Government is about is having a double thrust: ensuring that we have a safety net-an income support system-and also that we have a provision of services. But what have we heard Opposition members enunciate through their leader and their spokespersons over recent weeks? We have heard an attack on that income support system and on those services. The Opposition opposes family allowance, family allowance supplements and rent allowances. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said at Question Time today, some 1.2 million children are benefiting from our family allowance supplement. Yet the Opposition opposes it. It opposes the Skillshare and youth training programs that we have put in place. It opposes things such as Austudy. What does it intend to do with that? It intends to privatise it. The Opposition intends to pursue a policy of what is really the healthy and the wealthy against those who are really in need. The Opposition intends to introduce a tax at the State level should it ever come to power in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> As has been pointed out by the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin), it intends to introduce a consumption tax which will bear down very heavily on ordinary people-the people that Opposition members are now crying about; the people that they say are in difficulty. It has been this Government that has tackled the tough problems. It has been this Government which has had the guts to come up with those economic measures-not just for the short term or for the political gain but for the long term benefit of this nation. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, the following proposed work be referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for investigation and report:</PARA>
<PARA> Construction of an Australian High Commission Complex in Islamabad, Islamic Republic of Pakistan. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposal to be referred to the Joint Statutory Committee on Public Works is for the construction of a permanent chancery to replace the present inadequate interim chancery and an official residence to replace present unsuitable leased premises. The construction will be on the site allocated to the Australian Government in 1965 as a perpetual lease. The site is in a prestige area of the diplomatic enclave close to other diplomatic missions, the presidential residence, the National Assembly and the State Administrative Centre. </PARA>
<PARA> The main elements of the proposals are: a two-level chancery building, a two-level head of mission residence, and staff and visitor car parking. The design of the building has regard to climate and local building practices and is based on a simple low-rise building plan. The principal consultants are Australian. However, subconsultants will be generally engaged locally and the construction will be undertaken by a local construction company. Local materials and building technology will be utilised wherever possible, but where imported materials and equipment are required emphasis will be given to importing items of Australian origin. The estimated cost of the proposed work is $7.92m, as at March 1991 prices. I table the plans for the proposed work and I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Vice-Chairman of the Joint Statutory Committee on Public Works, I make this very short statement on this proposal. I do so in the knowledge that the Chairman of that Committee, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), is in the House this afternoon. The members of our Committee will carry out this remit and, hopefully, we will carry it out as well as the Committee has done it in the past. I need not remind the House that the Public Works Committee is the oldest joint committee of the House and in the last two calendar years it has in fact recommended to the Parliament projects worth in excess of $1 billion in each of those calendar years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, I point out to the House, and particularly to the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall), who is at the table, that referrals such as this do pose particular problems for the Public Works Committee. Some of these problems have been highlighted by the Chairman to the responsible Minister, the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus), but I make the point to the House that in overseas references such as this, as a result of the statutory coverage for our Committee, we are excluded from doing the appropriate inspections. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not a case of yet another overseas trip. I only make the point that we already have on the public record some difficulties in construction in Beijing. As I understand it, the cost of the embassy in Beijing has blown out from a cost, which came through the Public Works Committee, of less than $40m to about $80m. In the case of the Expo pavilion in Seville, we have some inherent problems which have in fact led to some questions being put on notice with regard to that particular project. We have some very sensitive diplomatic considerations- quite apart from the budgetary considerations-involved with projects such as the one in Port Moresby, approved recently by the Parliament. Only last week the Public Works Committee considered a project for a new embassy chancery in Jakarta which perhaps will have some problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I make to the House is that without the on-site inspection our Committee is under some strain to make the right recommendations in what are fairly difficult circumstances. I simply ask the Minister at the table to take the message to the responsible Minister, Senator Bolkus, that in future projects like this, if it is not possible to amend the statutory coverage for our Committee, the Overseas Property Group or, indeed, Australian Construction Services should be called upon to make some financial provision for a small subcommittee-perhaps of the Public Works Committee-to look at the matter in more detail. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to implement and give effect in Australian law to the provisions of the Hague convention on the law applicable to trusts and on their recognition. The Bill will provide machinery for identifying which country's law is to govern a particular trust; and will provide guidelines for the recognition of that trust in accordance with that law. </PARA>
<PARA>Background</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The convention was adopted at the fifteenth session of the Hague Conference on Private International Law in 1984 as part of its work in promoting the unification of private international law. As a member of the conference, Australia participated actively in its work on the convention. The convention will enter into force after three countries have ratified it (article 30). Although a number of both common law countries, the United States, United Kingdom and Canada, and civil law countries, Italy, Luxembourg and the Netherlands, have signed the convention, only the UK and Italy have yet ratified it. </PARA>
<PARA> As its name suggests, the Bill deals with the law applicable to trusts and the recognition of trusts. Trusts are essentially an equitable institution which has developed in legal systems based on the English common law-the concept of a trust is generally not used in civil law systems based on the roman law model. A trust may be described as an equitable obligation which binds a person, called a trustee, to deal with some specific property, the trust property, for the benefit of persons, called the beneficiaries, or for the advancement of some specific purpose. In the common law world trusts have been developed to serve a variety of functions, ranging from charitable purposes and estate planning to vehicles of commerce. </PARA>
<PARA> The convention is intended to overcome potential conflicts of laws problems which may arise where aspects of a trust-such as its assets, beneficiaries or trustees-have connections with more than one jurisdiction. If the trust concept is not recognised in one of those jurisdictions, as is the case in civil law jurisdictions, the very existence and validity of the trust may be in doubt. Even among common law jurisdictions which recognise trusts, there may sometimes be different rules for ascertaining the law to govern the trust and its incidents. The convention provides a common regime of rules governing both the recognition of trusts and the determination of which law is applicable to the trust. </PARA>
<PARA> The convention is largely for the benefit of common law countries such as Australia, in that it requires civil law countries to recognise a purely common law institution while conferring benefits on common law countries or their citizens who are likely to be beneficiaries of a trust. There will be no incentive for civil law countries to be party to the convention if common law countries are seen to lack interest in it. For this reason, early implementation of the convention in Australia is desirable, to enable accession in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA>Provisions of the Convention</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The schedule to the Bill reproduces the convention, which is divided into chapters and articles. Chapter I outlines the scope of the convention and defines whether something is a trust covered by the convention. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter II identifies the national law applicable to any particular trust. Prima facie the governing law is the law chosen expressly or impliedly by the settlor, that is, the person creating the trust. Where no choice is made, the governing law is the law of the country with which the trust is most closely connected. These rules will serve to clarify existing choice of law rules, which are far from clear. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter III deals with the extent to which a trust is to be recognised in accordance with the applicable law by states that become parties to the convention. Such recognition involves, as a minimum, that the trust property exists as a separate holding and that the trustee may bring and defend proceedings in his or her capacity as trustee. As a separate holding, the trust property will have a legal existence separate from other property in general and from the trustee's own property in particular. Thus, the trustee's personal creditors will not have any recourse to the trust property, though that property may be held in the name of the trustee. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter IV contains a number of general articles, several of which limit the effect of the convention in particular circumstances, where there are good reasons either for a trust not being recognised at all or for the governing law determined in accordance with the convention being ignored in favour of some other law. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter V contains final articles dealing with signature, ratification, accession, reservations and entry into force of the convention. </PARA>
<PARA>Advantages of Implementation for Australia</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will enable Australia to ratify the convention and, once the convention enters into force, to bring its provisions into force for Australia. The major advantage of the convention arises when property subject to a trust is located within the jurisdiction of a civil law contracting state to the convention. The practical effect of Australia acceding to the convention would be that the true ownership of Australian trust property in the territory of a civil law party would be recognised and respected. </PARA>
<PARA> At present, the law governing a trust with aspects extending over more than one jurisdiction is determined in Australia by common law rules of conflicts of laws. The convention is largely consistent with the Australian common law rules of conflicts of laws. Adoption of the convention would not require amendment of existing Australian statute law and would not cause substantial changes to existing Australian law. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, the convention would not impose new obligations on Australian courts to give effect to fraudulent or otherwise `undesirable' trusts. The convention provides merely for the determination of which law applies to a trust. Moreover, the convention allows precedence to be given to a contracting state's public policy (Article 18), mandatory laws relating to insolvency, succession, transfer of property, exchange controls, protection of cultural property, et cetera (Articles 15 and 16) and exercises of a contracting state's fiscal powers (Article 19). </PARA>
<PARA>Scope of Application of Commonwealth Legislation</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth legislation will apply the convention only to `international' trusts, where the law of a foreign country is potentially applicable, and not extend it to solely domestic or `interstate' trusts to which the law of another Australian State or Territory is potentially applicable. The convention specifically allows a federal state to refrain from applying the convention to conflicts of laws between its territorial units (Article 24). The Commonwealth legislation would not prevent States and Territories from themselves legislating, as some have indicated an interest in doing, to apply the rules of the convention to `interstate' trusts. The Commonwealth legislation is quite simple, merely adopting in Australia the terms of the convention subject to the reservation regarding non-applicability as between Australian States and Territories. </PARA>
<PARA>Commonwealth-State Implications</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Within Australia trusts are generally a matter of State/Territory law and the convention could be implemented in Australia either by uniform State/Territory legislation or by Commonwealth legislation. As the convention has no effect on statute law, has the minimal possible effect on common law conflict of laws rules and is essentially concerned with international trusts, the Government has decided that it would be most simply and conveniently implemented by Commonwealth legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The convention was considered by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in 1987 and the States and Territories have accepted this course of action. It is understood that the States and Territories, or some of them, might later enact legislation to apply the rules of the convention to `interstate' trusts.</PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The choice of law rules in the convention are very similar to the existing common law choice of law rules. The qualifications on recognition contained in the convention may appear to detract from the value of the convention to common law countries, but they were essential in order for the civil law countries to agree to the draft convention and their existence will be of prime importance in persuading such countries to ratify the convention. The convention's value is that it establishes a framework and scheme for recognition of trusts and perhaps also an expectation of their recognition. Its adoption will result in a substantial improvement over the present situation. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Trust (Hague Convention) Bill will have no impact on Commonwealth revenue or expenditure. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill, and I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill amends the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 and the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973. It also amends a number of other enactments, which are, with one exception, consequential upon the amendments to the Remuneration Tribunal Act. The exception concerns certain machinery amendments to the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments are explained in detail in the explanatory memorandum circulated with the Bill. I will, therefore, confine my comments to the more noteworthy of them. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Retirement Act 1988</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 are contained in part 2 of the Bill. Particularly noteworthy are the provisions relating to the calculation, approval and payment of contributions or `premiums' by Commonwealth departments and authorities for compensation cover for their staff. </PARA>
<PARA> Part 2 also contains amendments of a minor policy nature, and amendments designed to restore the original effect of the Act in certain areas. These amendments are mainly technical in nature and contribute to the more effective operation of the Act. Some are of particular assistance to claimants under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission for the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation of Commonwealth Employees, commonly referred to as Comcare, was established in July 1988 to effectively manage the Commonwealth public sector workers' compensation function. Comcare operates under the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. This legislation introduced income related benefits and emphasised Comcare's role in the prevention of workplace injury and disease through improved occupational health and safety practices and the rehabilitation of injured workers. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation also introduced Comcare's premium system, which commenced on 1 July 1989. The premium system is a key element in Comcare's strategy to control the cost of workers compensation in the Commonwealth sector by making agencies financially accountable for compensation costs as well as providing them with incentives to develop effective accident prevention and rehabilitation strategies. The scheme is fully funded. That is, the premiums received by Comcare in a particular year are calculated so that they cover the full cost of injuries sustained during that year over the life of those claims. The premiums are also responsive to changes in an agency's performance from year to year. Managers are financially accountable for the full cost of injuries occurring in any year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill proposes new provisions dealing with the calculation, approval and payment of premiums to improve and streamline these procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> Broadly, the new premium system is similar in structure to the existing provisions of the Act dealing with the calculation, approval and payment of contributions. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently, however, the Act is too restrictive and inflexible to accommodate the financial concerns of both Comcare and departments and authorities. The proposed amendments expand and clarify the existing features of this system and set out the procedures involved in the calculation, approval, review and payment of premiums in a more logical and complete way. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the proposed new provisions Comcare is to reduce a premium if payment is made early or increase a premium if payment is deferred or made by instalment. This will maintain a fully funded scheme and will also enable departments and authorities to nominate methods of payment which are best suited to their needs, whilst providing an incentive for early payment and compensating Comcare for deferred payment or payment by instalment. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the changes to the provisions relating to premiums, which I am confident will benefit all participants, the Bill makes a number of amendments of a technical nature. Currently Comcare may only invest temporarily surplus funds in excess of $100,000 with the approval of the Minister. This is an unnecessarily inconvenient situation. The proposed amendments will remedy this problem and operate retrospectively to the date of commencement of the Act to ensure that past transactions cannot be called into doubt. </PARA>
<PARA> Other amendments included in the Bill are intended to improve the operation of the Act by clarifying certain transitional provisions and correcting some errors and omissions. The need for the amendments has become apparent since the commencement of the Act on 1 December 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, an amendment is included which will ensure that employees who were entitled to compensation under the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act 1971 will remain entitled to compensation under the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 without having to satisfy the liability tests in that Act. </PARA>
<PARA> A further amendment will ensure that employees who were parties to proceedings before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on the day on which the Act commenced, or who incur costs as a result of an appeal by the Commonwealth against a decision of the Commission for the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation of Commonwealth Employees, will be entitled to recover their costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments relating to premiums have no financial implications. The remaining amendments will not have a significant financial impact. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also proposes a number of amendments to the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973 and consequential amendments to other Acts. These are contained in parts 3 and 4 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal function of the Remuneration Tribunal is to inquire into and recommend or determine the salaries of specified categories of office holders, including Ministers of State, senior public sector office holders and the Federal judiciary. The Tribunal comprises three part time members appointed by the Governor-General for periods not exceeding five years. It is particularly important that there is flexibility to appoint Tribunal members with appropriate knowledge and experience, including an appreciation of current industrial relations issues and government administration. Currently, however, a person who has been a member of parliament, a public servant, a holder of a public office or a holder of Federal judicial office is precluded from appointment to the Tribunal for a period of seven years. </PARA>
<PARA> The existing seven-year disqualification period has created difficulties in finding replacement members of the Tribunal with the necessary skills and experience to enable them to operate effectively. Members of the tribunal are required to have regard to the wage fixing principles of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and therefore need to be cognisant of the principles of contemporary wage fixing arrangements. Accordingly, a more flexible provision is required. An amendment is therefore proposed to the Act to reduce the disqualification period from seven years to one year. </PARA>
<PARA> The independence and impartiality of the Remuneration Tribunal must, however, be preserved. It is, therefore, proposed that the reduction in the disqualification period be balanced by the insertion of a new disclosure of conflict of interest provision. The provision will require a member of the Tribunal to disclose any pecuniary or other interests which could conflict with the proper performance of the member's functions in relation to Tribunal proceedings. The provision will reflect the position which, I am sure, would quite properly be taken by a Tribunal member if he or she was in such a position. In view of the changes proposed to the disqualification provision it is desirable to make explicit what might formerly be considered to have been implicit. Such provisions are commonly found in Commonwealth legislation relating to other Federal tribunals. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the amendment the privacy of Tribunal members is, however, preserved. The disclosure is to be made in writing to either the Chairman of the Tribunal or to the Minister, depending on which member is concerned, and not to the parties to any relevant matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also includes amendments to extend the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to determine the recreation leave entitlements of full time holders of certain senior public offices, on the same basis as that of fixed term senior public servants. The amendments follow a recommendation in a special report of the Remuneration Tribunal. Currently, holders of these offices are granted recreation leave but do not accrue an entitlement to a specific quantum. This has the consequence that an office holder who ceases to hold an office is not entitled to be compensated for accrued leave not taken on the basis applicable to Government employees generally. Longstanding practice is to make ex gratia payments on this basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment will facilitate payments to office holders in respect of recreation leave accrued but unused on cessation of office. It may therefore result in some minor cost to the Commonwealth. This cannot be readily calculated, because it is wholly dependent on leave actually taken by office-holders. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments are cast so that the new provisions will operate only where consequential amendments are made to the Acts establishing the relevant offices. The schedule to the Bill makes appropriate consequential amendments to a large number of those Acts. An amendment to the Remuneration Tribunal Act is also proposed to enable the remuneration of the Vice Chief of the Defence Force to be determined by the Tribunal, complementing the provisions of section 9B of the Defence Act 1903. </PARA>
<PARA> Further amendments will clarify the jurisdiction of the Remuneration Tribunal in relation to certain offices in higher education institutions. The Tribunal was given this jurisdiction when the Academic Salaries Tribunal was abolished on the commencement of the Industrial Relations Act 1988. As a consequence of the transfer of part of the jurisdiction of the Academic Salaries Tribunal to the Remuneration Tribunal, some ambiguities have arisen in the relevant provisions of the Remuneration Tribunal Act. Clarifying amendments are proposed to ensure that the original intention behind the legislation is reflected in the Act. </PARA>

The Bill contains minor administrative amendments to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Corporation Act 1985 and consequential amendments; the Dairy Produce Act 1986; the Dairy Produce Levy (No.1) Act 1986; and the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation Act 1987. </PARA>
<PARA>Australian Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Corporation Act 1985</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Amendments to this Act provide for the name of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Corporation to be changed to the Meat Research Corporation. The decision to change the name of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Corporation to the Meat Research Corporation was made at the request of the Corporation. The change was sought because its name was being confused with the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation. In addition the length of the name itself was causing confusion, particularly in the media. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to this Act also bring the Corporation into line with Government policy and the legislation for other rural research and development bodies by confining the Government's commitment to match industry funding for the Corporation to 0.5 per cent of gross value of production. </PARA>
<PARA> Consequential amendments, following from the change of the name of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Corporation to the Meat Research Corporation and the name of the Australian Meat and Live-stock Research and Development Corporation Act 1985 to the Meat Research Corporation Act 1985, are being made to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Corporation Act 1977; the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Policy Council Act 1984; the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Selection Committee Act 1984; the Beef Production Levy Act 1990; the Cattle and Beef Levy Collection Act 1990; the Cattle Export Charge Act 1990; the Cattle Transaction Levy Act 1990; the Exotic Animal Disease Control Act 1989; the Live-stock Export Charge Act 1977; the Live-stock Slaughter Levy Act 1964; the Rural Industries Research Act 1985; and the Sales Tax Assessment Act (No.1) 1930. </PARA>
<PARA>Dairy Produce Act 1986 and Dairy Produce Levy (No.1) Act 1986</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This amendment is required to reflect the inclusion of equal employment opportunity provisions in the Dairy Produce Act 1986, which is the enabling Act of the Australian Dairy Corporation. The amendment will bring the Australian Dairy Corporation into line with existing Government policy on equal employment opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to this Act also provide for the name of the Australian Dairy Industry Conference to be changed to the Australian Dairy Industry Council and for its Executive Council to be known as its Executive. These name changes require consequential amendments to the Dairy Produce Act 1986 and the Dairy Produce Levy (No.1) Act 1986. </PARA>
<PARA>Horticultural Research and Development Corporation Act 1987</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This amendment provides for changes to the commercial role, administrative controls and accountability of the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation. The changes are consistent with provisions contained in the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989, which provides the framework for portfolio research and development. Amendments to the Corporation's functions and powers concern the commercialisation of research and development and powers to join in the formation of a company and to acquire, hold and dispose of real and personal property. </PARA>
<PARA> Arrangements for the conduct of Corporation meetings and the decision making processes are streamlined to permit meetings by electronic means and for decisions to be taken without face to face meetings. Minor modifications are made to the Corporation's research and development plan and program to assist the Corporation to use these documents as more effective budgetary and planning tools. </PARA>
<PARA> The accountability of the Corporation is strengthened by a requirement that commercial activity in which the Corporation has an interest and activities relating to the formation of a company are included in the Corporation's annual report. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes to the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation Act 1987 will increase the commercial flexibility of the Corporation and are consistent with the Government's policy of increased industry autonomy and coordination of research and development. None of the proposed amendments has any significant financial impact. I commend the Bill to the House, and present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Employment, Education and Training Act 1988. Among other things, that Act provides for the Higher Education Council of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training to report to Parliament on the operation of educational profiles and the impact of the higher education contribution scheme. Educational profiles are a mechanism designed to balance the freedom of institutions to manage their own affairs with the need for public accountability. They represent agreements negotiated annually between the Commonwealth and higher education institutions, defining an institution's broad mission together with its teaching and research responsibilities, and establishing its particular areas of activity and specified goals as the basis on which institutions receive Commonwealth funding. </PARA>
<PARA> The Higher Education Contribution Scheme, which came into operation in 1989, requires students and graduates to make a contribution towards some of the costs of the provision of their studies. At the time of the scheme's inception, a provision was inserted in the Employment, Education and Training Act requiring the Higher Education Council, in February and August of each year, to report to the National Board of Employment, Education and Training, and thence to the Minister and Parliament, on the operation of the scheme and its effects on access to higher education and the level and quality of post-graduate research. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill amends that provision by requiring the Council to report only once each year, in March. The need for this amendment is straightforward. Late in 1990 the Board reported that the Council had experienced practical difficulties in reporting in a substantive way in August. At that time of the year, no firm data relating to higher education student enrolments in the current year is available, and the educational profiles discussions with institutions are not undertaken until later in the calendar year. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, the Board proposed that the Council need report only once in each year, both on profiles processes and the impact of the higher education contribution scheme. March was recommended as the most appropriate month. By that time final student enrolment data can be comprehensively analysed and the Council is in a position to comment substantively on the recently concluded profiles negotiations. The Employment, Education and Training Act also provides for the Minister to appoint acting members of the Board and its constituent councils for a period of up to 12 months in the event of a temporary vacancy. </PARA>
<PARA> The intent of the Act was to provide for the circumstances where it is necessary for the Minister to appoint an acting member of a constituent council who is also a member of the Board. Under the legislation as it currently stands, this option is not available to the Minister in all circumstances. The amendments are designed to remedy this deficiency and have no substantive policy or other implications. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I referred earlier to the Opposition's failure to recognise the complete social security picture, and yet another example of that was its failure to support the introduction of an assets test on the family allowance. The coalition's move to overturn the introduction of an assets test on the family allowance has led to a loss of savings of some $57m in 1991-92. This fiscally irresponsible decision stems from pressure brought to bear by assets-rich interest groups. It is a blatant attempt by the Opposition and others to gain political favour with self-interested farmers and businessmen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately, it is the disadvantaged members of our society, not the privileged, who will suffer most from this action. I ask this question of the Opposition: if it is going to persist in directing social security payments to millionaires, where is it going to find the reported $1 billion it claims it could save from social security? Will it cut age pensions or force the unemployed to beg on the streets?</PARA>
<PARA> The family allowance is already income tested. Income alone, however, is not the only measure of a family's ability to support itself, particularly families who have substantial assets and are able to minimise their taxable incomes. Introducing an assets test on the family allowance would have brought it into line with other Commonwealth transfer payments. Pensions, benefits, family allowance supplement and Austudy are all subject to assets tests. The assets test proposed by this Government was generous by community standards. An asset level of $500,000 would not have disadvantaged families in genuine need, particularly as assets would have been assessed net of debt and would have excluded the family home. </PARA>
<PARA> In refusing to support the introduction of an assets test on the family allowance late last year, the Opposition missed a golden opportunity to put real support behind the stand it is taking today down the road of genuine social security reform. In contrast, the Government by its stand at that time demonstrated that it has the courage to take tough decisions while protecting disadvantaged groups in our society. Through its stand, the Opposition clearly reveals its priorities in the social welfare area. </PARA>
<PARA> Then, of course, there are the gross social inequities which would exist under the Opposition's proposed consumption tax. We need only look at the figures to see the enormous gap that would develop between the rich and the poor under the tax regime proposed by honourable members opposite, the centrepiece of which is a consumption tax. Such a tax and its accompanying impact on inflation would have particularly dire effects for low income earners. </PARA>
<PARA> So there we have it: the Liberal rhetoric through its support for the rewrite of the social security framework proposed in this legislation alongside its record in elements affecting the people who make up that framework. One certain thing for Australia's social security beneficiaries from this conflict, though, is that they will all be left a little confused-and well they might be. But they are not the only ones. In a radio interview on 18 October 1990 between Pru Goward and Dr Peter Saunders, Director of the Social Policy Research Centre at the University of New South Wales, Dr Saunders said of the plans of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) to lease out social security services:</PARA>
<PARA>Well I found Dr Hewson's remarks somewhat strange because he talked on one hand about duplication and yet then made comments about the Department of Social Security. And the first thing I think we have to recognise is that the Department of Social Security is not in the business, by and large, in providing social welfare services; it's in the business of paying pension and benefit cheques and therefore the issue of duplication is . . . not in the social security area. </PARA>
<PARA>The President of the Australian Council of Social Service, Merle Mitchell, also had something to say about the proposal in an article in the Australian of 18 October 1990:</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Hewson cannot have it both ways. He cannot advocate greater targeting and time limits on payment of unemployment benefits. </PARA>
<PARA>It would appear that it is not only the Government's view that the Leader of the Opposition is quite a distance from the coalface he referred to so often when expanding on his proposal in interviews at that time. I suggest that if the Leader of the Opposition were to have a closer look at the coalface, he would then see the real benefits of a united and coordinated national social security system. </PARA>
<PARA> The specialists do not like the idea of privatising the provision of social security benefits, the peak social services body does not like it and, given the Pandora's box it would open for the privacy of social security beneficiaries, I do not think they would like it too much either. So while the Opposition continues to advocate that all and sundry should determine eligibility and distribute social welfare, it is hard to see how honourable members opposite can claim to have any genuine conviction about the better provision of services for those most in need. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Social Security Bill 1990 is a major codification of social security legislation. For that reason, it is particularly significant. The Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson, in his second reading speech also made some interesting observations when he said that since 1947 the Act had been subjected to over 100 amending Bills. He omitted to point out that between 1987 and 1988 and up to the present time under the administration of his own Government, and principally under his own administration as Minister for Social Security, there have been, in effect, over 200 administrative and legislative changes to the Social Security Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is it any wonder that many people have great difficulty understanding legislation that is often seen to be out of date and for which it is very difficult to get the most accurate version? Having got that version, one often cannot understand it. Consequently, the Opposition supports the intention of the Government to introduce a piece of legislation that is both easy to read and easy to follow. Using the vernacular, it is said to be simple English legislation. There are a number of points I wish to make about the construction of this document, and I then want to go on to a wider discussion of some of the principles of the Government's policies in relation to social security in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> The review of social security legislation and its incorporation in one Bill of three volumes, while being a considerable reform in that administrative context, will hopefully be of some benefit to officers in the Department operating at the coalface. It should assist some beneficiaries and, hopefully, it will help welfare agencies involved in providing advice. The question I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca), who is at the table, is this: are we to conclude that the Government intends to provide free copies to welfare agencies? On the charging policy of the Australian Government Publishing Service at the present time-in March 1990 the old Act would have cost $43.80-this vast document we are now talking about on the basis of weight alone, which seems to be the basic principle of the AGPS in its pricing policy, will cost at least $100. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not unreasonable to ask the Minister: how can poor, unemployed people who are not the normal beneficiaries of the welfare system-and do not forget we are talking about in excess of four million people who are receiving benefits through the Department of Social Security at present-benefit from this `easy English' version of this vast document which is bigger than a Sydney telephone book?</PARA>
<PARA> Not only should the Social Security Act be reviewed but the entire system of social welfare payments in Australia should also be reviewed with the intention of trying to simplify the mechanisms of delivery to ensure they are more effective. In his second reading speech, the Minister referred to the original 1947 Act. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Act depicted a passive payment mechanism, providing benefits in the form of direct cash payments to clients. It has now become more attuned, because of the many recent amendments, to the changing social and economic environment through its development into a more active piece of legislation that targets individuals and families in genuine need while positively encouraging them toward independence of the welfare system. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members should remember those words: `targets individuals and families in genuine need' and `independence of the welfare system'. Yet during Question Time earlier today the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) asked the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) a very straightforward question. He asked the Prime Minister whether in his discussions with the Brotherhood of St Laurence-which is notable across Australia, especially in Victoria, as being the quintessential organisation involved in welfare at the non-government level-he had asked that organisation which people were in the most abject poverty in Australia. The answer was the 6,000 homeless children under the age of 16 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition went on to ask a very pertinent question of the Prime Minister: `Since you have an annual Budget of about $30 billion, why is it so difficult for you to accurately target 6,000 homeless kids? Is it because they are on the streets with no fixed address?'. The Prime Minister said, `Yes, that could possibly be the answer'. But it is obviously more than that. It simply demonstrates that this vast administrative system, with this telephone book policy document, plus two vast documents, which every office of the Department has to administer and interpret as to whether individual payments should be made, is clearly incapable of identifying and helping 6,000 homeless children, most of whom probably are in Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> I therefore enter the debate with a little degree of cynicism as to precisely what the Government means when it talks about better targeting and achieving greater independence of the welfare system. We have been using words like `greater independence of the welfare system' but, unlike the Australian Labor Party, that is precisely what we mean. We want to keep people out of welfare and from regarding welfare as a crutch to be used forever-or, more precisely, that once one gets into the welfare net it is so difficult to get out. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last two days we have heard Ministers during Question Time talk about poverty traps. Earlier today we heard the Prime Minister suggest-when he was asked questions by members of the Opposition on how he would refer to individual cases of hardship caused by the failure of the Government's economic and social policies and what he would say to those people-`Under the Opposition's social policy you will get unemployment benefits for nine months and then you are thrown to the wolves. Under our policy you can have unemployment benefits more or less forever'. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security cares to study the statistics, as I certainly have, he will see that there is a not inconsiderable number of beneficiaries who have been on unemployment benefits for 10 years or longer. Why is that? Why has the system been so loose that people have been able to remain there? Why are they still getting benefits from the system when they have fallen through the net in the sense that there is a pro-active capacity to assist those people to get back into the work force?</PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the most damming statistics of all are the current figures of unemployment in Australia today. In December 1989 there were 366,666 beneficiaries of unemployment benefits. In December 1990-2 years later-the figure had risen to 506,004. The latest figures of January 1991 reveal that the number has risen to 542,148. So in that short period the number of people on unemployment benefits had risen 7.1 per cent-and we all know that the rate currently is well over 8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Most observers and commentators on this unfortunate situation would add that we have probably not yet seen the worst and that the rate of unemployment may well reach 10 per cent. There is a tendency in certain parts of the community, and certainly in the Australian Labor Party, to simply take the view, `I am all right Jack, I am one of the 90 per cent who has a job, so I do not need to worry about the 10 per cent who do not'. In the present situation of a rolling recession-and that is how it has been rightly described by the Leader of the Opposition-nobody can be sure of their future employment continuity. For that reason, it is absolutely vital that we do not talk only in terms of what we do to help people who are unemployed today, important though that may be, but also have the courage of our convictions to examine precisely why those half a million people are out of work-people who two years ago had some optimism about the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to a press release issued by the Australian Council of Social Service, another organisation which Government members claim supports the Government's social welfare policies-their great concept of compassion and concern. In its release on 23 January this year under the headline `Unemployed Young People: Tough Times, Less Help', Mel Mitchell said:</PARA>
<PARA>There are now 130,000 young people without jobs and not in full-time education. Despite the increased numbers staying on at school, the total number of unemployed young people is almost as high as the worst of the 1982/83 recession and the situation is likely to deteriorate further. </PARA>
<PARA>The release went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The amount of spending on job training for unemployed young people has plunged by more than two-thirds over the last six years. </PARA>
<PARA>The release goes on to say that the programs that have been of the greatest help to young job-seekers are no longer in place. </PARA>
<PARA> The important thing is that the Government's employment policies are fundamentally flawed because it has tried to use, with considerable incompetence, the mechanism of welfare as a substitute for industrial relations policies directed at fundamental reform of the Australian labour market. Together with that, one also has to raise the question of the incompetence of the Government and its inability over eight years to introduce the range of structural reforms which are so fundamentally important. </PARA>
<PARA> I learned only yesterday a most interesting story-that it is cheaper to take wheat from Turkey to New Zealand than it is to take wheat from Australia to New Zealand. It is extraordinary that our nearest neighbour cannot purchase a commodity like wheat from Australia because the costs of our shipping, the costs of getting wheat through the docks and the costs of transportation preclude us from markets with our closest neighbours-and that is just one small example. Transportation and communication are all the same. The years have been going by us and so little, if anything, has been done. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of these structural inefficiencies, today men and women by their thousands are paying the inevitable price. They could well say, `Why me? I had a job; I worked hard; I did what I could and all of a sudden my company has gone bust'. Why is it that a company such as Black &amp;Decker (Australia) Pty Ltd, which on international terms was an efficient operation, has had to announce in the last month that it will close its production in Australia? It is because it can no longer compete. Interestingly enough, the company did not pick industrial relations or wage issues as its principal concern. It said it was transportation. It was those structural problems within the economy which made it impossible for it to be able to compete on world markets. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government tends to fail to realise so often that many of these larger conglomerate companies have subsidiaries all over the world. Often they are competing with each other in markets that should be Australian markets. Every time we lose an Australian market we are losing jobs. If it is the intention of this Government to export our jobs to Taiwan, Korea, Singapore or to any other country, let it be prepared to say to the Australian people that that is its policy. Its failure to address these fundamental issues means that that can be the only final outcome of what it is doing. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation is now critical and the time for change has to be with us. When we look at social policy in the main I ask the Government to consider precisely what it means in terms of delivery of programs as distinct from mere words. There are millions of them in these documents here today. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition believes that there are three fundamental principles which must be at the base of any viable social security policy. Those principles are, firstly, that assistance must be provided in a manner which maintains self-respect in the recipients and encourages and supports their quest for personal independence. The second principle encourages self-reliance by targeting programs carefully and minimising poverty traps. The third principle ensures that all Australians in need receive adequate, timely and appropriate assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> On all of those three counts one can say that the record over the last eight years leaves the Government with much to explain. The realities simply are that the welfare system in Australia, consuming, as I said, over $30 billion provided by the taxpayers of Australia, is no longer capable of delivering the quality of services necessary, especially to those most in need. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of years ago a Committee composed of members of this Parliament, chaired by a member of the Government, tabled a report in this House entitled Fairness, courtesy and efficiency in the quality of service provided by the Department of Social Security.  I was on that inquiry, as was the Parliamentary Secretary at the table. It was interesting to go to the coalface and hear from the non-government agencies and people who had to deal with the Government what it was like to be on the other side of the picture. </PARA>
<PARA> Out of that inquiry we made a range of recommendations which, sadly, ran into all sorts of troubles within the Department and excuses for non-observance. The statement tabled in this House by the Minister on that occasion will stand as an example of how to miss the point. Among the recommendations we made was the need to improve the skills of departmental staff and to insist that all clients of the Department be treated with courtesy and respect, because so often they said that was not the case. </PARA>
<PARA> We emphasised the need to simplify the system and to enhance service delivery. We talked about requiring more accurate assessment of client needs and entitlements before benefits were granted. We talked about improving access for those with special difficulties, such as Aboriginal people, non-English speaking people, the illiterate, the young, the physically and mentally handicapped and those living in remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier in my speech, the fact that we cannot accurately identify 6,000 homeless kids living in Melbourne-having been identified by the Brotherhood of St Laurence as being those most in need-would seriously bring into question the capacity of the Department to carry out that fundamental responsibility. We also talked about the need to establish regional community consultative committees which should meet regularly so there is an interchange between the welfare agencies in the communities, the departments and the Commonwealth Employment Service working with the people who were in need within those specific communities. </PARA>
<PARA> We talked about the need to examine the development of a single application form which would initially screen clients and assist in determining the appropriate category of payments. I hope I am mistaken but when I looked into this matter last year I was told that that question about a common form was all too difficult. I would sincerely like to know why that cannot be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the question of aged people, who are a major component of the delivery cycle of the Department, needs to be considered. I think there is a very strong argument that pensioners should get more sympathetic service. They should be assured of receiving correct information and they should be given the opportunity to deal with their peer group. In this House on previous occasions I have strongly suggested that the Department should appoint mature part-time specialist staff, including retirees, who could assist pensioners, in particular, at regional offices of the Department so that they would feel that they were dealing with people who had some empathy with their problems. Time and time again we are told that when dealing with a young person of 19 or 20 there is a gulf between a pensioner or an older person which simply cannot be bridged in so many cases. These are merely a range of the sorts of issues which have yet to be addressed and which cannot be adequately solved simply by the production of a vast tome of the type being debated in the House at present. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some fundamental flaws in this Bill and some things which I think need to be rectified in the future. One of those flaws is that no legislation passed through the Parliament since the last Budget in August 1990 has been incorporated in the Bill. For example, the deeming provisions for the payment of the aged pension have been excluded. Apparently it was too complex to include them in this Bill. I find that odd because within days of the original Bill passing through the House the Department was able to flood the marketplace with forms saying, `Yes, your deeming provision is going to be 10 per cent'. The Opposition said, `Hang on, show us the banks which are selling products which will adequately look after the interests of pensioners in those circumstances'. Hundreds of thousands of old people, 1.6 million of them, are now being forced to have two bank accounts-one bank account for their normal daily activities and another bank account below $2,000, which has to be inspected. </PARA>

I do not think there would be anybody in this House who would not say that that needs to be rewritten. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with the honourable member at the table; it is a bit of a hotchpotch and it needs to be fixed up. The Department of Social Security has done something about it. It is okay for the honourable member for Bradfield to criticise us and to say that the Bill is still six inches thick, that it weighs a lot and everything else. It is all of that, I agree. The fact is that the original Bill was in place from 1947 until now. We have not been in Government for that full time. The Opposition did nothing about it at all. We decided to do something. We decided to rewrite it and the Opposition still criticises us. Sometimes it is very difficult to win with the honourable member for Bradfield.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I accept and welcome the general support we have received from the Opposition for this move. I do not think anybody in the Opposition has in any way criticised the Bill itself. It is not something that is any big deal in the sense that it needs to be looked at clause by clause, because it is simply a rewrite of the legislation. It has been made easier for people to read. The honourable member for Bradfield commented that it will be impossible for ordinary members of the public to read the Bill because it is very complicated even now, and I accept that-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I imagine that question would be up to the Australian Government Publishing Service. But the Minister is looking at possibly supplying copies of Bills such as this to some of the peak welfare agencies, because as the honourable member for Bradfield correctly stated, they can be very expensive. I think it is a nonsense to suggest that we shall have hundreds of members of the public running in wanting to buy a copy of the Bill. That does not happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the major reasons we have rewritten the legislation is that we wanted not only the public but also our staff to benefit. As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, there have been a multitude of changes in the Department of Social Security. As times have changed and the economy has changed, we have had to change the Social Security Act. We have brought in a number of new initiatives that have had to be written up as part of the Act. I could probably go through them at length, but I will not. There are such things as the jobs, education and training scheme for sole parents, the active employment strategy, the disability reform program, and so on. Under the present Government and the previous social security Minister-the honourable member for Batman (Mr Howe)-a lot of reform has been going on in the Department of Social Security. This Bill is one of those reforms. </PARA>
<PARA> Part of the Government's intention has been to try to simplify the rules of eligibility criteria and to generally improve the way that the Department of Social Security delivers its services. A number of operations have been undertaken to ensure that that is in fact the case. This clear-English Bill is just one of the measures that have been taken. I agree with the honourable member for Bradfield on many of the matters that the O'Keefe report mentioned. One of those matters was that we had to make sure that there was access and equity in the way that we delivered our services. </PARA>
<PARA> Only two weeks ago in Sydney I launched the Department of Social Security's second access and equity plan. The Department of Social Security is the first government department to have done so. The plan contains about 100 specific points that the Department will be taking up in the next couple of years to ensure that people of non-English speaking backgrounds, people of Aboriginal backgrounds and people with disabilities are all made aware as to what services are available to them from the Department of Social Security. We have done those things and I think it is most unfair of the honourable member for Bradfield and other members to criticise the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the major complaints that we had, if I remember correctly, related to counter service. In the past we have had massive burn-out rates of people working on the counter, mainly because they were young people and situations sometimes get heated when members of the public are told they may not be eligible for something. But a completely new strategy plan has been brought out. There has been a new job redesign. In most of our offices one will now find there are more senior people on the counters and that they rotate jobs. Generally there has been a vast improvement in that area, and that improvement will continue to occur. So again I state that many recommendations in the O'Keefe report have been brought in. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bradfield sheds crocodile tears for the unemployed. With all due respect, I find that a little difficult to take, given what was said today in Question Time in answer to a series of questions put by members of the Opposition about specific instances of the plight of the unemployed people in their electorates. I find it difficult to believe that the honourable member for Bradfield can equate that with wanting us to cut $3 billion off Government spending. That was exactly the same tack as was taken by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) straight after the Treasurer (Mr Keating) brought down the Budget. The Leader of the Opposition, in his response to the Budget, made it clear that had it been his Budget, he would have cut a lot more-I think the figure was $2 billion or $3 billion-off Government spending. </PARA>
<PARA> I have got news for those on the other side of the House. We cannot cut Government spending and then be able to look after the sorts of people who are on unemployment benefits. Unfortunately, because of the recession at the moment, we understand that there is unemployment and that it has grown quite dramatically over the last six months. This Government has a record which is second to none in the field of generating employment. At the moment, unemployment is on the way up. As the Treasurer and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) have said, the Government expects that unemployment will be curbed in the not too distant future. </PARA>
<PARA> Another thing the Department of Social Security has done in recent times to deliver our services in a more equitable manner is arrange a complete rewrite of social security advice letters, again as part of simplifying what we are doing in the Department. Just the other day I conducted a seminar here in Parliament House with 25 representatives of organisations from throughout Australia-from welfare centres and disability organisations, welfare rights centres, the Australian Council of Social Service, et cetera. These people came up with a number of very worthwhile suggestions as to how we could best improve our communication. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Social Security is not perfect in the way that it delivers its service. It is very difficult to be perfect when we have 17,000 people working for us and paying out moneys to about four million people. One in four people are in receipt of some benefit from the Department of Social Security, including family allowances, pensions and benefits, and so forth. It is very difficult to get it right. About 26 million letters go out; it might even be more than that. So we are talking about a lot of complicated work and about a situation where the Department of Social Security staff do the best they can. There is always room for improvement and those improvements are being made. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very pleased to say that in a lot of areas, particularly in the delivery of services to its clients, the Department is making significant inroads. Only the other day I launched a migrant advisory committee in Adelaide. I will be doing the same thing in Perth and Tasmania. We already have three committees-in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. These committees advise the Department's management and the Minister and me as to how better to deliver services to people of non-English speaking backgrounds and Aboriginals. I am very much aware of the fact that in difficult times we have to be sure that safety nets are there and we have to make sure that the people who deserve income support from the Government get that income support, and we will continue with that operation. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of members spoke today and I will not restrict my comments to the honourable member for Bradfield. The honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins) mentioned the review of the advice letter, and I appreciate his thanking us for it because it is an innovative operation on the part of the Department. In addition to that, in the field of migrant services, in four or five years it will be possible for us, with our technology, to be able to send out letters in the preferred language of the recipient. I think that there is no doubt that the advances in technology and the improvements in our delivery services are getting better and better all the time. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) talked about anecdotal evidence of the person next door who is getting social security benefits but does not deserve to get them. We have all heard those stories. All I can say to the honourable member for Macquarie is that if he has cases of that kind, he only needs to write to me and I will make sure they are investigated. We have computer data matching programs now and all our checks and balances will ensure that fraud in the Department is decreased as much as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Macquarie complained about staffing in some of his Social Security offices. Again, all I can say is that if he has specific problems and specific complaints, he only needs to tell me and we will do what we can. If necessary, we will accelerate the improvements in the way the staff deliver their services. Generally, overall, given such a large department, I do not think anybody really has cause for valid complaint. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) gave a different side of the story when he complimented and gave bouquets to his Department of Social Security offices: namely, at Annerley, Stones Corner-where the manager, Bob Pook, is a very good friend of mine-and Mount Gravatt, in Brisbane. I think that for every story of complaint, we will find a story of departmental officers who deserve bouquets because they do a wonderful job. </PARA>
<PARA> I was a little upset with the honourable member for Moreton, who seemed to suggest that lawyers had a conspiracy in the way that they wrote up Bills. I can assure him I did not do any social security law, but I can tell him this: when I was a student and a school teacher was trying to teach me something, I always thought that there was a conspiracy because I could never understand it. I think the old conspiracy theories can be brought up by everybody. Nevertheless, I appreciated his contribution, and I appreciated the bouquets that he gave. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan), who in my view is a gentleman who sincerely believes what he says, has had a bee in his bonnet for a long time about the assets test. However, I point out that the assets test is something which is now forgotten-absolutely forgotten-as will be the deeming provisions in about 12 months time. </PARA>
<PARA> I accept that a lot of people find these things confusing. There is no doubt about that-any worthwhile reform is always going to be confusing. The deeming provisions will be the same. But when people realise that the only losers will be the banks, that the winners will be themselves and the public of Australia, I am sure there will not be any problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott), in an excellent contribution to this debate, spoke of the fairness and equity of the Government's programs, particularly in the social justice area. As he said, if people need income support from the Department of Social Security or from the Government, the Government will always be there to give them that support. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion I pay particular tribute to the previous Minister for Social Security, the honourable member for Batman (Mr Howe), who was really the driving force behind this clear English Bill. It is something which I know was virtually his baby from the word go. It was only one of a number of reforms that he introduced in the social security area during the period that he was the Minister, and I know that if he could have, he would have liked to see the passage of this Bill through the House himself. I want to thank him particularly. I also wish particularly to thank the First Parliamentary Counsel for the obvious hard work that has been done in getting this Bill together. I wish to thank the officers of my Department who have helped in getting this together, and also all those people who have contributed to the debate on this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that this is one of those more popular measures where we are doing something to make sure that the public can read what we are on about. If they wish to find out whether they are eligible, they can read it in plain English terms, and not in the gobbledegook which unfortunately Parliamentary Counsel in the past has tended to draft. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, I commend the Bill, as did the Minister. I thank everybody who has spoken on it, and I say again it is one of those good things that the Department of Social Security is doing to help its clients. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, we have before the House the Family Law Amendment Bill 1990. I understand the Government will be moving some 13 amendments to this Bill. The Bill has had a somewhat chequered history, having been introduced in May last year, brought on for debate in December with a string of Government amendments, and then withdrawn at the last minute. The comments that I make on the Bill take into account the changes that have been made by the Government amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the reasons for the on again, off again approach that the Government has adopted in relation to this Bill is that it has now engaged in rather extensive consultations with various groups who have an interest in family law, and who will be affected by the changes to be brought about by the Bill. The Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) and his Department, by carrying out lengthy consultations, have endeavoured to produce a workable solution to the dilemmas that arise from that most sensitive and controversial subject-namely, child sexual abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> For the sake of the record, I should point out that I have had some limited involvement in the process of consultation. By a letter dated 3 August last year, I advised the Attorney of a number of concerns I had with the way the Bill, as introduced, was drafted. Those concerns focused on proposed section 70BB, a provision which I will discuss in more detail shortly. I was pleased with the positive response I received from the Attorney-General, in that many of my concerns are being addressed in the amendments that the Government will be moving today. </PARA>

<PARA> The consultation that the Attorney-General has undertaken in relation to the Bill is to be commended. Having buttered him up, I now point out that this stands in stark contrast to the position that he took in relation to the Crimes (Investigation of Commonwealth Offences) Bill, which we debated last week, where it appeared that the Attorney neglected to consult even Federal law enforcement agencies about the changes contained within that legislation. But that was not the case on this occasion, and he and the Department are to be commended. It was one of those rare occasions where a Bill came in, a series of amendments were moved and the Bill was then withdrawn-for the distinct purpose of consultation. I want to place on record my appreciation that that consultation occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill under present consideration attempts to address a number of complex and sensitive problems in the family law area. However, I have a very real concern that in doing so it could well be-notwithstanding the consultations-that in some instances the Bill creates more anomalies than it seeks to overcome. </PARA>
<PARA> Before discussing those parts of the Bill which are a cause of concern, I will give a brief outline of its major elements which can be divided, broadly speaking, into four areas. First, the Bill contains a number of provisions to be inserted into the Family Law Act, which aim to improve the handling of custody and access disputes in which allegations of child abuse are made by one party against another. The genesis of these provisions can be found in the report of the Family Law Council entitled Child Sexual Abuse. The relevant clauses are clause 12, which sets up a procedure for reporting cases of child abuse to State and Territory child welfare authorities; clause 14, which provides that child welfare authorities and other interested persons may intervene in cases involving allegations of child abuse; clause 17, which will limit the number of medical and psychological examinations of children which can be obtained by parents involved in custody and access disputes; and clause 15, which will give statutory force to the Family Court's practice of admitting hearsay evidence of statements made by children to adults about abuse they have allegedly suffered. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, by reason of clauses 5, 6 and 7, the Bill will provide that a step-parent adoption does not put an end to existing custody, guardianship or access rights under the Act, unless the Family Court decides that the step-parent adoption is in the child's best interests. Thirdly, by virtue of clauses 8, 10 and 11, Family Court consent orders or registered child agreements will have no effect in so far as they purport to transfer custody or guardianship to non-parents. Finally, there are a number of miscellaneous amendments, one example of which includes clause 19, which will empower the police, when authorised to arrest a person, to enter and search premises for the wanted person. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions that are of concern to us in the Opposition are clause 12, especially in so far as it puts forward a proposal for the mandatory reporting of suspected child abuse; clause 14, which relates to intervention by third parties in certain proceedings; and clause 15, dealing with the admission of hearsay evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall deal first with the proposal contained in the Bill for the mandatory reporting of suspecting child abuse cases. If we look at the Bill in the light of the amendments the Government will be moving, we see that the reporting procedure essentially is divided into three parts. First, under proposed new section 70ba, where a party to proceedings alleges that a child has been abused or is at risk of abuse that party must file a prescribed notice with the Court. Upon the filing of the prescribed notice, the Registrar of the Court must, as soon as practicable, notify State or Territory child welfare authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, under proposed new subsection 70bb (1), where court personnel, who under the amendments are defined to include court counsellors, welfare officers and registrars of the Court, have reasonable grounds for suspecting that a child has been abused or is at risk of being abused, they must-I emphasise must-as soon as practicable notify the relevant child welfare authorities of both the suspicion and the basis for that suspicion. The obligation to report in that situation is confined to abuse of the type defined in clause 4 which, as amended, means an assault, including a sexual assault or sexual activity defined with reference to the unequal relationship between the assailant and the alleged victim. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, under proposed new subsection 70bb (2), where court personnel have reasonable grounds for suspecting that abuse of a type involving either the ill-treatment of a child or exposure of the child to behaviour which psychologically harms the child, they may make an appropriate report to child welfare authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> So we see that under proposed new section 70bb there is a distinction between mandatory reporting and discretionary reporting, depending on the type of abuse that is suspected to have occurred. In support of a proposal to introduce mandatory reporting, one could say that as a matter of policy it reinforces the law's commitment to the protection of children. Furthermore, it can be argued that a system of mandatory reporting encourages community awareness of the issue and transforms a moral obligation into a legal obligation. Finally, it is sometimes said that a system of mandatory reporting may serve a general deterrent function. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, critics of mandatory reporting point out that legislating for such a procedure avoids the real issue of the need to provide adequate follow-up resources and procedures. The approach in Victoria of universal voluntary reporting has been applauded by many for increasing community awareness and responsibility whereas the system proposed in this Bill, in my view, places undue emphasis upon court personnel. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, experience in jurisdictions that have mandatory reporting has undoubtedly shown that quite often baseless reports can be made. I know that the Attorney-General has agonised over this and that is why I try to put arguments both for and against. Both of us have practised in this field, and I know that others in the House have shared what the Attorney and I have encountered, clients who make allegations or against whom people make allegations-allegations which, frankly, after investigation have been found to be utterly baseless. It is a very sensitive and very personal area which is difficult to follow up and even more difficult to prove. </PARA>
<PARA> There is the well publicised example of the Butler-Sloss inquiry into the Cleveland cases in England, which recommended that the relevant mandatory reporting system be abolished. In the case of M v. M, a report of which can be found in volume 12 of the Family Law Reports at page 606, the High Court of Australia acknowledged this very problem. At page 610, in a unanimous judgment, the Court said that sexual abuse of a child is `an allegation which is very easy to make but difficult to refute'. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, it is arguable that mandatory reporting may discourage parties from seeking assistance and further inhibit the amicable resolution of disputes. Now, as I have indicated, this is quite clearly a complex and sensitive issue, and it is one over which right-minded people may often disagree. However, I am clearly of the view that the arguments against mandatory reporting far outweigh those in favour. There are others who take the same view. In an article by Prue Innes in the Melbourne Age of 6 December 1990, Ms Innes, who I am led to believe is a highly regarded journalist in this area, quoted a leading family law specialist as saying that many practitioners object to mandatory reporting `because it takes away what has always been the totally sacrosanct nature of confidential counselling'. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, I have strong reservations about the approach adopted by the Bill in so far as it attempts to split mandatory and discretionary reporting according to the type of abuse alleged to have taken place. Quite often it may be that court personnel will not be in a position to ascertain the exact nature of the suspected abuse and, therefore, there may be some doubt as to whether it falls within the mandatory or discretionary limbs of those provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Law Council of Australia has expressed a concern with another aspect of these provisions. There is little indication in the Bill as to what role the Court should take in these sorts of cases. Once a report has been made to the relevant child welfare authority there is no prescribed procedure in the Bill for the results of any investigations carried out by the welfare authority being in some way remitted to the Family Court. In this respect it is obvious that the making of such allegations and any subsequent investigations will have a very significant impact on the Family Court proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, the Law Council has suggested that reports should, in the first instance, be made to the Court rather than directly to child welfare authorities. If that path is followed, the Law Council argues, the Family Court judge will be in a position to make appropriate directions as to the conduct of the proceedings. The Law Council points out also that such a procedure would allow for some appropriate vetting of such reports. I would appreciate hearing the Attorney's views on these matters. It seems to me that the Law Council has put forward a very plausible case in support of its proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two aspects of the drafting of proposed new section 70bb that I find somewhat curious. If we look at proposed new subsection (3), taking into account the amendments the Government will move, we see that court personnel need not `notify a prescribed Child Welfare Authority that a child has been abused, or is at risk of being abused' where they believe that the authority has previously been notified about such abuse or risk of abuse. The subsection then goes on to say that, notwithstanding this dispensation a member `may notify the Authority of his or her suspicions'. </PARA>
<PARA> If we contrast that drafting with proposed subsections (1) and (2) we see that court personnel, in the relevant situations mentioned in these subsections, are obliged to notify child welfare authorities of `his or her suspicion and the basis for the suspicion'. I emphasise the words `and the basis for the suspicion'. Perhaps there is a drafting error with proposed new subsection (3) and after the word `notify' there should be the words `of his or her suspicion and the basis for the suspicion'. </PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect which troubles me relates to proposed new subsection (5), which provides that where a notice has been given under proposed new subsection (3) the person may disclose `other information' which the person thinks the child welfare authorities should be aware of. If the child welfare authority has already, firstly, been notified of the suspicion and, secondly, notified of the basis of that suspicion, I ask: what other information is it envisaged will be disclosed under this provision? So in the committee stage of the debate we will be moving a number of amendments to proposed new section 70bb to address the concerns I have just raised. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to clause 15, which seeks to introduce a new section 100a into the Act to expressly allow the court to admit hearsay evidence of statements made by children to adults about abuse they have suffered-or are alleged to have suffered. The proposed section is not confined to oral communications and when we look at the definition of the relevant word, `representation', we see that it includes an express or implied representation, whether oral or in writing, and a representation inferred from conduct. Making inroads into the rule against hearsay evidence is, to put it mildly, a very serious matter. The Law Council has strong reservations about this provision. In its submission on the Bill it said:</PARA>
<PARA>Regarding clause 15 the Law Council has concerns that this provision may create dangers in the Court making the decision on ``Evidence'' which has hitherto been regarded as unreliable. The dangers of this probably outweigh the extension of the present rules which did permit some hearsay evidence. </PARA>
<PARA>In its report on child sexual abuse, the Family Law Council noted that the law on whether evidence can be given of statements made outside the courtroom by children is in a very uncertain state. In some cases the courts have been prepared to admit such evidence, but the basis for doing so is unclear. The Council went on to recommend that the hearsay rule should not apply to exclude evidence of statements made by children on matters relating directly to their welfare. In making this recommendation the Council relied heavily upon the 1985 report of the Australian Law Reform Commission in which it was said that first-hand hearsay evidence should not be excluded if it is the best evidence that a party has available to it. </PARA>
<PARA> The expression `first-hand hearsay evidence' refers to evidence of a representation by a person who witnessed the facts referred to in the representation. The Law Reform Commission also recommended that if such an exception were to operate it would be desirable to have a provision whereby the party who intended to adduce such evidence should give appropriate notice to the other party. Furthermore, it was said in the Commission's report that the admission of such evidence should always be subject to a power of the court to exclude such evidence, if it would be unfair to admit it. </PARA>
<PARA> A perusal of the draft Evidence Bill contained in the Commission's report shows that proposed section 100a is drawn in very different terms and does not embody the safeguards that were built into the provisions recommended by the Commission. The recommendation of the Family Law Council implicitly adopted those safeguards and, accordingly, without those safeguards we are concerned with the change that proposed section 100a would bring about. Whilst I acknowledge that in some cases it may be desirable for hearsay evidence of this type to be admitted-particularly in light of the fact that, ordinarily, the Family Court will not grant leave for children to give evidence-it appears to me that proposed section 100a does not provide the appropriate solution. For these reasons, we will be moving an amendment in the committee stage which seeks to delete clause 15. </PARA>
<PARA> I now deal with clause 14, which inserts a new section 92a to provide that in any proceedings in which an allegation is made that a child has been abused or is at risk of abuse, five categories of persons are entitled to intervene, as of right, in the proceedings. Those persons are: a guardian of the child, a person entitled to custody of the child, a person responsible for the daily care and control of the child, a prescribed child welfare authority and, finally, the person who is alleged to have abused the child. Under the provision, when such persons intervene, they will have all the rights, duties and liabilities of a party to the proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three reasons why this provision causes me some concern. First, as the Law Institute of Victoria has pointed out, the categories of persons entitled to intervene do not include persons who have been granted access to the child. In its submission on the Bill, the Law Institute suggested that it may be desirable to have a subclause to the effect that anyone with a legitimate interest in the welfare of the child should be able to intervene in proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the proposed section is drafted in very different terms to existing provisions in the Act which deal with the intervention of third parties in proceedings-notably, section 92. Indeed, the Law Council of Australia has argued that the proposed section may not be necessary at all because under section 92 there is already adequate provision for third parties to intervene in appropriate cases. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly-and this is related to the preceding point-unlike section 92, under the proposed section it will not be necessary for the court to grant leave for the intervention and the court is given no express power to make the intervention, subject to specific terms and conditions. So, once again, we will be moving amendments in the committee stage which are designed to address these concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, whilst we have concerns about some provisions in the Bill, overall we are supportive of the changes that will be brought about by it. We support the principles underlying the Bill and for this reason we will not be voting against it at the conclusion of the second reading debate. However, during the committee stage we will be moving a number of amendments designed to address the concerns that I have raised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), has pointed out, honourable members have had a long period of time in which to become familiar with the Family Law Amendment Bill, now before the House. More importantly, the community and those who are interested in this area have also had the opportunity to have input into it. I believe that the Bill now before the House, together with the amendments which will be moved by the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), represents a step forward in a particularly difficult area of family law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although the amendments have a few purposes, their principle purpose is to define precisely the circumstances in which personnel of the Family Court of Australia must report incidents of child abuse to the State authorities. This particular point is an extremely important one and is vital both in the interests of children and the smooth operation of the court. The legislation was first presented in May last year and now, almost a year later, we are fully debating it. That is a process which, given the Government's history in relation to family law, is to be commended. We have a longstanding history of attempting to gain bipartisan support for amendments to the Family Law Act, and I certainly welcome the comments of the shadow Attorney, who has had the opportunity to consult with the Government. He still has a few particular difficulties with some of the sections of the Bill, but certainly there has been ample opportunity to improve, and I believe that it has been improved, the nature of this particular Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I direct my remarks, firstly, to the question of mandatory reporting, which is very much the crux of the Bill. In the original legislation an obligation was imposed upon court personnel to report suspected incidences of child abuse to State authorities. Child abuse was defined as an assault which was an offence within that particular State or Territory, a sexual assault or ill-treatment. This obligation was to be in no way mitigated by the normal confidentiality which attaches to court officers, particularly court counsellors. The original legislation went to the extent of saying that a failure to report an incident would become a criminal offence and provided that a $6,000 fine was to be imposed on court officers who failed to report an incident of child abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> This mandatory reporting requirement I believe caused some concern amongst practitioners within the Family Court, particularly court counsellors, and certainly I would suspect that the idea of imposing a criminal penalty for failure to report would also have caused considerable concern. However, I believe these matters have largely been addressed, although it has to be borne in mind that the Bill in fact has to come to grips with almost a clash of two fundamental principles. The first principle is that the rights and welfare of children are to be paramount and, given our community obligations towards children, there should be a greater degree of care exercised towards the rights of children than is owed by the community generally towards adults. </PARA>
<PARA> This is particularly so in relation to official agencies such as courts and government and welfare agencies. Agencies of this nature generally owe a duty always to act in the best interests of children. Under the general law, the basic duty towards children is enforceable against parents, either through the criminal code of the State or through various child welfare laws. So the starting point is that parents obviously have an enforceable obligation to care for and protect their children. Also under the general law this obligation extends to other classes of people who act in the position of parents from time to time-the most obvious example being teachers. They owe a higher duty to the care of children than does maybe the rest of the community.</PARA>
<PARA> What we are now grappling with is the extension of those general law principles beyond parents and people in a similar position to parents to a wider class of people. This particular amendment impacts mostly on the position of court counsellors. Under the general law, people such as court counsellors, doctors or teachers may through their work become aware of potential examples of child abuse, but there is no obligation upon them to act on those suspicions. Often they will do so, but there is no legal obligation on someone to report what they suspect to be a case of child abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> The debate which this Bill goes directly to is whether this duty to act, to report or take some action to overcome the child abuse, should be made an enforceable legal duty. It is a debate which has been canvassed in other areas. It has been canvassed in relation to the medical profession and it has also been canvassed in relation to the teaching profession. Generally speaking, in the balance of community interest it has been held that the interest of the child and making sure that children are properly cared for impose a sufficient duty that there should be a greater obligation upon doctors and teachers or whomever to report a particular incidence of child abuse. I think that that would now be almost the standard position throughout the country; it certainly is in relation to the general law in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill attempts therefore to extend that expansion of duty towards children in the area of court personnel, and I suppose particularly court counsellors. Under the Family Law Act court counsellors will in many instances come into contact with at least allegations of child abuse, if not other direct evidence of child abuse. The Family Law Act itself is predicated on the basis of counselling and mediation being the basis of the resolution of conflict, with the court supposedly coming into play only in more difficult or intractable cases. Any dispute involving the custody of children must go through a counselling process, and in that sense court counsellors are in a unique position to make judgments as to the welfare of children, and also in a unique position in relation to becoming aware of potential incidents of child abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> Traditionally, officers such as court counsellors have had an obligation of confidence with their clients, and in that sense that obligation is similar to obligations owed by doctors to their patients or solicitors to their clients. This duty of confidence is the sort of second principle which is clashing with the first principle of care and protection for children. The law has often recognised the obligation of confidence; however, it has never been an absolute obligation and certainly law in various jurisdictions has pegged that back where there are greater public policy grounds or a greater community goal in order to breach that confidence so that the information can be gained in order to combat that social problem. </PARA>
<PARA> It is therefore important that we tread warily in this area. It is understandable that court counsellors and those involved with that profession should be wary of amendments imposing mandatory obligations upon them. As I have pointed out the Government has in fact done that but it has given ample time for consultation. Generally speaking the Act as it is now to be amended is supported by the profession and by court counsellors. </PARA>
<PARA> This new amended legislation maintains mandatory reporting; however, it more narrowly defines situations where that will occur. It limits it to serious examples of assault-that is, criminal assault that would be an offence under the law of the State or Territory-or cases of sexual abuse. The other category which in the first draft was known as ill treatment is now no longer a matter which must be reported. </PARA>
<PARA> To complement those limited areas of serious abuse which must be reported under this Bill, there is also scope for voluntary reporting and that is enhanced by the provisions of the Bill which specifically remove any impediment that may exist through the ethics of the particular profession or any other legal obligation which states that the confidence between the counsellor and the client should never be broken. </PARA>
<PARA> The shadow Attorney-General still expressed some reservations on mandatory reporting, but indicated that there would not be a vote forced on that particular question. However, I believe that mandatory reporting is justified and it is justified on the overriding ground that we do as a society have an obligation to children and making sure they are protected. If as a society we are to be serious about child abuse, if we are going to take action to combat it, it is essential that people who have the opportunity to gain information when they have reasonable suspicions that child abuse is taking place go that one step further and report it, and make sure that there is at least an investigation of their suspicions. </PARA>
<PARA> That is all the Bill does. It does not attempt to prejudge matters; all it says is that where there is a reasonable suspicion of serious abuse, it must be reported to the relevant State welfare agency so an investigation can then take place. I think, on balance, that no reasonable person could argue against that. There may be some argument about confidentiality, but on balance we would have to conclude that the care of children overrides that other consideration. It is also important that reporting be mandatory because a mandatory provision underlines our commitment to children, as does this amendment further by adding to the Act itself a clause which states that the welfare of children must be the paramount consideration in custody and access disputes. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to note that the Bill as it will be amended by the Attorney-General has the support of the psychological profession. I have in front of me a letter from the Australian Psychological Society, which states in part:</PARA>
<PARA>The proposed legislation presents no conflict with our code of professional conduct as the rules covering confidentiality allow for exceptional circumstances-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, for confidence to be breached. The letter goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Psychologists must respect the confidence of information obtained from persons in the course of their work as psychologists. They may reveal such information to others only with the consent of the person or the person's legal representative except in those unusual circumstances in which not to do so would result in clear danger to the person or to others. </PARA>
<PARA>That makes it quite clear that the profession itself recognises that there are cases where confidence must be breached, and it sees no conflict between this Bill and its own code of professional conduct. </PARA>
<PARA> Similar statements of support have been elicited from those directly involved, that is, court counsellors. The Attorney-General's office made contact with the various registries of the Family Court throughout Australia. While there are still some concerns in some of the registries about the need for this provision, the overwhelming opinion coming out of the court registries is that the new Bill as it has been amended is worth while and has the support of those practitioners who will be immediately impacted by the passing of this legislation. That is also an extremely important point to note. </PARA>
<PARA> The shadow Attorney-General mentioned two other points. He expressed his reservations about the clause which allows the court to accept hearsay evidence. Again, I can accept his genuine concern about this. Allegations of sexual abuse are notoriously easy to make and difficult to prove. But, by the same token, we cannot allow legal rules such as the laws of evidence to provide an overwhelming barrier to the tackling of child abuse. The issue of child abuse is just far too important to allow the rules of evidence to stand in the way, provided that there is always a discretion in the judge to make a judgment as to that particular evidence and as to the weight that should be given to that evidence. Therefore, that safeguard in terms of the position of the accused is guaranteed. </PARA>
<PARA> I accept that the admission of hearsay evidence is a difficult issue. It is an issue which jurisdictions other than the family law jurisdiction have had to grapple with; it has been grappled with by the various State governments in terms of their own criminal laws in relation to child abuse. Again, the decision here about the admission of hearsay evidence-which really does no more than reflect an existing court practice in any event-is consistent generally with stances taken by various State governments in the question of child abuse, so it is nothing extreme or trailblazing in that it is consistent with action taken in other jurisdictions. </PARA>
<PARA> The shadow Attorney-General also indicated that he would be moving an amendment in relation to parties who are able to intervene in child abuse cases. In particular, I note that his amendment will add to the classes who can intervene, as well as give a general statement that any person reasonably interested or necessarily interested in a child can intervene. I have no particular problems with that. I do not believe it takes anything away from that new section of the Act, and I will not address the matter further. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I believe that the law in this area is difficult. However, the Attorney-General, through this piece of legislation, has adopted a very rational approach and has allowed ample time for consultation. That has occurred, and the Bill will be amended as a result of that consultation. The end result will be a piece of legislation which tackles a difficult area and will improve the position and the rights of children. If that is the end result of this legislation, I believe it is deserving of our full support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to speak in support of the Family Law Amendment Bill 1990, because I feel, as I am sure everybody in this House does, that any legislation that is brought before this House in support of the family and in particular the protection of children should be given top priority in view of the deep concerns expressed in the past not only by me but by other members of the House on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, we know of the deep concern in the community with regard to a lot of the operations pertaining to the Family Law Act. This concern is not necessarily concern about the Act itself, because many if not most of the provisions in it are very good. The Act was originally debated on the occasion of its introduction and was voted on in a bipartisan manner. But many areas associated with the Family Law Act cause a lot of concern, particularly with regard to counselling. I am very glad that the Senate has agreed to an inquiry. I hope that this may even become a joint inquiry into the matters that are concerning a lot of people in the community-indeed, many of my own constituents. </PARA>
<PARA> There is ample evidence to indicate that child abuse in many forms is common in our society today. It is essential to identify typical symptoms associated with any form of child victimisation and to establish the means with which to deal with them. Indeed, honourable members will recall that I have introduced into the present Parliament a Private Member's Bill to eliminate the payment of medical benefits in certain instances of abortion. The killing of the innocent unborn child for social and economic reasons and for gender engineering is in any thinking person's mind the ultimate in child abuse, and I would encourage all honourable members to think very deeply about and heed the cry of the innocent unborn. But I do not intend to say any more on that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> It is essential that every assistance be given to promote early detection of abuse and protection for those who are unable to adequately verbalise their experiences. These traumatic experiences rob children of their childhood. Any changes in legislation that can be of assistance to reveal instances of child abuse must be commended in view of the alarming incidence of child abuse in this country. I commend the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), who is at the table, for his efforts in this regard and for the way in which this Bill was brought into the House and let lie on the table for others to comment and deliberate on it. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken on many occasions in the House on amendments to the Family Law Act. I now return to the observations that I made on some of those occasions. This legislation is before us today because, increasingly, Australian men and women do not hesitate to tear up marital commitments, to shirk marital obligations and abuse their former spouses, and in particular their children, either by neglect or by physical abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think that there is any sinister conspiratorial attack on the family unit in what is being proposed in this legislation, although I do not doubt that those ideologically opposed to the traditional family will experience some satisfaction over this situation. Rather, it is the natural and necessary response of law makers acting prudently to achieve justice for the weaker parties, in particular, children. </PARA>
<PARA> Today we will put in place legislation that will further determine the nature of the family and bring further stability and safety into the marriage relationship, particularly with regard to children. </PARA>
<PARA> I find the whole situation that surrounds child abuse very disturbing. I do not think that we have reflected fully enough on the implications of the situation for the role of the family in this area. I think the Attorney-General will know what I am talking about in that regard. We certainly seem to be oblivious to the continued erosion of those intangible bases of human relationships in marriage-the family and society, which this Bill both reflects and produces. Whilst we are discussing a Bill which is tremendously important with regard to the protection of children, we still have some very glaring areas in our community where we are neglecting the causes of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last 16 years before I became a member of parliament I was fully involved in the area of criminology and in dealing with the younger members of our New South Wales community who found themselves in confrontation with the law. I had quite an intensive 16 years in my dealings with those younger people. That experience revealed to me that this country is now awash with pornography. There is ample evidence to show that this very fact alone is the cause of a lot of child abuse within marriage and without marriage in our society today. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, I remember seeing not so long ago an interview with Ted Bundy, the sexual abuser and murderer of 28 women and girls in the United States. In an interview the night before he was executed, he said that within the prison where he was, and indeed in every prison in the United States, there was not one sexual offender, including himself, against children or women who did not feast on hard core pornography. </PARA>
<PARA> I remember in my earlier years in this Parliament bringing to the attention of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and others over and over again the need to come to grips with this particular problem confronting our community. There have been many petitions and letters to the Prime Minister and others protesting about the fact that this country is now awash with pornography. </PARA>
<PARA> Every sexual offender who came into my custody had a history of involvement in hard core pornography. It is all very well for us to stand up in this House and be swollen with pride over the fact that we are coming to grips with this problem-indeed, it is absolutely necessary that we do come to grips with it-but we also have to be able to say that we have done our utmost to make sure that the causes of this problem are fully dealt with and that we have a clear conscience. We should not be running around trying to find statistics and arguments which cast some doubt on the case I am putting forward, because it is right. We only need commonsense to understand that what I am saying is a fact. </PARA>
<PARA> Today we are involved in the political chore of regenerating our cultural capital in possibly the most significant area of social relations, the family. Can there be any doubt that the social security blow-out and the educational, health and employment problems which arise out of marriage breakdown are a threat to good government? These things are a threat to good government. </PARA>
<PARA> On the one hand, if we do not have high moral values and strong stable families in our society, it does not matter how good our economic situation is; the nation will continue on the road to decay. On the other hand, if we do have strong moral fibre and a government that does everything in its power to ensure the stability of the family, to see that families stay together and that all the resources needed to keep them together are in place, it does not matter what sort of economic situation we are confronted with, what our balance of payments might be, or whether we experience great depression or recession; we will still survive as a nation. History has shown that over and over again. </PARA>
<PARA> I make a plea to the Government and to the Attorney-General, who is at the table and who has a portfolio of tremendous influence, that these concerns of many Australian people-indeed, many people throughout the world-are taken account of. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think there can be any doubt that much of our marital breakdown, child abuse and child poverty could be prevented if we nurtured the values represented in this legislation. We need to take a great deal of notice of these very concerning problems. That is why we have this legislation before us. It is not just a reaction to irresponsible behaviour by certain citizens or an invention on behalf of the weak. It is also an attempt to set before our citizens what is right and what is wrong. I want to emphasise and acknowledge that. </PARA>
<PARA> It champions certain values which we all believe are crucial to the good of our community and its individual members. It is crucial that we come to grips with the problem in this area that has been hitherto inhibited by the secrecy provisions of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> It is our duty to alert the Australian community to what is gradually but surely occurring in Australia. There is less compassion, self-sacrifice and self-discipline in human relationships. There is more and more bureaucratic intervention in those relationships, and this too is not helping the stability of the family. Family values can be concentrated on and children can be made secure in the family situation. It is very sad that intervention is necessary in this instance. It is not that I think that this Bill is not needed-it is needed today. But it is very sad to think that such a Bill is needed and that we have to make provisions for this kind of attention in the society in which we live. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to say too much more other than to remind the House that it is so important to take on board all the issues that are confronting families and the reasons why we are experiencing difficulties with the enormous number of marriage breakdowns. When we look at the Budget outlays we see, as I mentioned in a speech earlier today, enormous expenditure on social security payments as a result of marriage breakdown-about $2 billion-and yet very small amounts being allocated by the Government for marriage education. One can search throughout the country and one will find that there are not too many programs going on in schools that prepare young people for the problems and difficulties associated with a stable marriage. </PARA>
<PARA> I read a statistic once which indicated that only six couples out of every 100 seek any guidance at all prior to going into marriage. We know that the complexities of modern-day living and budgeting and all sorts of other problems are part and parcel of the reasons why we have this Bill here in front of us today. The breakdown of marriage is a result of tremendous conflict arising in families, on many occasions through ignorance. People just have not had the necessary education and understanding prior to going into marriage. </PARA>
<PARA> The resources for people to obtain help even after marriage are very limited, even though there has been an increase in recent years by the Government. So I commend to the Attorney-General, who is at the table, that we give a lot more attention to the reasons why, sadly, we have to bring this kind of legislation into the House. I commend to the Attorney the views I have expressed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been reflecting on the statistics cited by the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) on how many people seek guidance prior to marriage. I admit to seeking guidance prior to my marriage because I was to marry a Catholic. I went to a Catholic priest and, unfortunately, he wanted me to join the club and I refused. So the guidance did not extend beyond a nice cup of tea and `Thanks very much, but no thanks, I won't join the club'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think there is a maturity in young people which leads them to seek their own counsel in some ways and to make their own decisions. Having made a decision, when a marriage breaks down everyone has a huge expectation that the Family Court can solve the problems. What I would like to do is make some remarks about the specifics of the Family Law Amendment Bill and also make some more general statements that reflect upon the maturity of the Family Court-and I do not mean that in critical sense but to acknowledge its existence since 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important aspect of this amendment, of course, is the mandatory reporting of child abuse. I know that the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) has worked hard to satisfy all of those concerned. Especially I know some court counsellors in Brisbane who are a little concerned that they may be subject to criminal liability if they refuse or fail to report child sexual abuse. The Attorney-General has persisted, quite rightly, to ensure that every reasonable effort is made to encourage people, counsellors especially, to inform the relevant authorities where they believe a child is in danger. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the means the Attorney-General used to get around the original impasse were to narrow the definition of `abuse' so that there must be a reasonable belief that an actual assault or sexual abuse has taken place. There we find that the counsellors are satisfied that they have the full protection of the law against any sort of action against them, but they are also satisfied professionally that matters of a delicate nature are kept private between them and their clients. However, if the matter is so desperately awful, as now defined here, then they are liable to tell the proper authorities what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make some more general remarks about the Family Court. I had a conversation only the week before last with a woman who was my guide and interpreter in Japan; I spent 10 days there with a delegation. She told members of the delegation that she had been divorced 10 years ago in Japan. The rules in that country, as she related them-and I think she was probably accurate-are that, as a consequence of her leaving her husband, she had no rights whatsoever to a share of his or her property, if they both owned it, or to any maintenance. Fortunately for her they had no children, but she would have had no rights to maintenance from the husband had she had children. </PARA>
<PARA> I think sometimes we ought to sit back and give ourselves a bit of a pat on the back for how far we have extended these rights to men, women and children under the Family Law Act. Japan is a well developed and economically extremely powerful nation in which it appears to me-and I could not verify whether these rules are standard today in Japan, but they are as far as my guide and interpreter was aware-that women have very few rights to be maintained after they leave the marriage. There is a form of social and legal pressure to keep families together, but it is not one we would support at all, and it is one that I am sure has brought many women and many children in Japanese society to a desperate state. </PARA>
<PARA> We have gone down the right path and, having gone down that path, we are now chipping away at the important but lesser questions. Inevitably this sort of debate, however important, is burrowing away at the edges. But we should not forget that the perception of many of our constituents out there is a long way behind this. A fellow and his second wife who came to see me last week were both of the opinion that because this chap had remarried he no longer had to support his three original children, who were aged 11, nine and eight or whatever. They had a definite mindset that he could leave that first family behind; he had remarried, he was going to look after the two new kids, and that was his responsibility. I had to remind him-rather gently, because he was a big bruising sort of bloke-that he had five children to look after: three through an original choice and set of circumstances and two more through some new circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Probably one of our greatest needs-still, after 16 years-is to get more Australians to understand what the Family Court can do for them and does not even attempt to do, and to sort out, usually for the male but often for the female, that their responsibilities for children are ongoing once the marriage breaks down. </PARA>
<PARA> In that context, very broadly speaking, let me make some remarks about an issue that has arisen in the Family Court in connection with something called family mediation. It seems to me that the Family Court, after 16 years, has reached the level of maturity where people have settled into their roles the judges are satisfied that they have a place in society equal to that of a Federal Court judge and so on, people have a good career structure, and all is well. But sometimes I believe that when people get too settled they start to look for new ideas that are not warranted, that are basically nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been an almighty debate in some sections of the Family Court recently about this new and what I might call trendy notion of family mediation-as if the Family Court has not been involved in alternative dispute resolutions since 1975. Court officers, deputy registrars, counsellors and so on have been involved in mediation for 16 years, and there have been some proposals from the Court that the Government ought to spend an enormous amount of money putting in a whole new infrastructure to do with family mediation. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not quite know where that idea came from, but I do note that in the Family Law Council annual report of 1989-90 there is a section devoted to family mediation. I will read a section of it; perhaps this is an indication of where the idea came from-I do not know. Under the heading `Family mediation' the report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Mediation, particularly family mediation, is a fast developing area of alternate dispute resolution. Having examined arbitration in detail, the Council resolved at its June 1989 meeting that an examination of family mediation should be undertaken, with a view to developing policy on family mediation. </PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>To examine family mediation as a method of dispute resolution, with a view to developing policy on family mediation, with particular attention to-</PARA>
<PARA> - research and evaluation</PARA>
<PARA> - qualifications and training</PARA>
<PARA> - legislation</PARA>
<PARA> - desired models and practices of mediation</PARA>
<PARA> - funding. </PARA>
<PARA>People have been sent far and wide to study what the Canadians, and no doubt the west coast Americans, do when they mediate. So far as I am informed by officers of the court, they have by and large come back with a new language and a new way of interacting, touching, feeling and being at home-a holistic approach. But at the end of the day they basically do the job that counsellors and deputy registrars have been doing in the Family Court for 16 years. We do not need to spend any more money involving those officers in a new program that would simply make the language a bit more west coast American. </PARA>
<PARA> I obviously have a very definite and prejudiced view on this but, nevertheless, there comes a time when a court ought to be acknowledged as doing its job correctly and for those who find that it is not totally fulfilling maybe they should move on and go somewhere else. But the court does a good job. It does not need to spend a great deal more money on this business of family mediation. It already does the job of mediation. It already helps counsel people before they get to a judge. The `hit rate' is about 95 per cent. Very few cases go through the court because deputy registrars second-guess what the judge will tell a couple. The deputy registrar will say, `Listen, you will get X, Y and Z out of the judge. So either accept that or go away and make a compromise, and do not take the cost of going before the judge'. </PARA>
<PARA> On another level, when it comes to handling children, counsellors do an excellent job. Couples must go before the counsellor and decide for themselves how they should handle future maintenance, care and custody of their own children. So full marks to the Family Court. But to those members of the Family Court who are feeling a little run down by the whole terribly difficult business of solving family disputes: I do not think there is a great need to introduce a whole new notion of mediation. It has been a central part of the Family Court for 16 years, and I know that sensible people within the Court will start to move back now to their real work and get over this trendy fascination they have with whatever comes out of the west coast of the United States. </PARA>

Recognising the human complexities in the legislation, I understand why the legislation has taken so long to be finally debated in Parliament. I listed myself to take part in the debate so that I could speak generally about the Family Law Act, its bureaucratic intrusion into the family structure and the subsequent effect that has had on our national morality.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been married to the same person for 33 years. I believe I am somewhat experienced in marriage, if only to defend it. I recollect driving in my car somewhere before I came to this place, and I am sure I heard on the radio the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) delivering a report of a committee that looked into the Family Law Act. I do not know why, but I remember that speech. However, I am deeply concerned that Parliament goes on finding legislative solutions to the business of marriage. I use the word `business' advisedly because, perhaps unfortunately, marriage has gone past being a tradition. In this day and age it is a form of contract, and it is a pity that there is not a third party to the contract, namely, the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> With the social security structures and so on that we have today, the nation as represented by the Government has an important interest in the viability of marriage. I have a greater interest: I just think that marriages should survive. I am not sure that in recent times we on both sides of politics, having taken a bipartisan approach, have done much for the survival of marriage. We have made it too easy for people to escape from marriage. </PARA>
<PARA> I quote my mother in this place quite frequently. She was a great advocate of women's rights. Her views were a bit limited by today's standards. She just thought she should be able to own half the family home. Indeed, she campaigned so vigorously for it that, after the family grew up and my parents shifted to a duplex which my father thought would provide both accommodation and income, he put her in half and he was sent a bill for gift duty. He was nice and angry about that. Times have changed, but that was her view. Yet in later years she viewed with great concern the way we were starting to make it too easy for people to escape from marriage. </PARA>
<PARA> She said, quite openly, that she could list occasions, as I certainly could for different reasons, when, for instance, in an argument a marriage seems to becomes irretrievable for a brief period because one just cannot agree; it is an issue of gigantic proportions for that period in a marriage when one argues with one's spouse. But, as my mother pointed out, in those days the woman did not leave home for anything short of a beating. I am not saying that was a good situation, but women did not leave a marriage because, unfortunately, they had nowhere to go. I do not support that position either. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not support that situation, but I ask the honourable member to listen because the reality was that a lot of marriages survived happily because, as many of us know, that apparently irretrievable and dreadful argument of the night before often achieved minuscule importance the following morning. There is no doubt that in those days when my mother battled to be half-owner of the family home women were not in a good position. In the circumstances I have described, the fact is that women were frequently locked into violent marriages-and that was not good.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In attempting to address a real problem, we simply said to the community, `If you want to escape your marriage, we will pay you. The simple act of walking away from a marriage can make you a pensioner'. Of course, women deserted their marriages in droves. We also brought down the Family Law Act, which again was done with the best possible intentions. I remember a newspaper in Western Australia that did nothing else but report on the seamier side of divorce cases. The newspaper was called the Mirror, and it was a dreadful publication. It ran headlines like, `Bert caught in Digby's diggings'. That was when one party to a marriage had to prove that his or her spouse had committed adultery. That was a ridiculous situation and should not have happened. </PARA>
<PARA> But we did not find some sensible common ground, because we then said, `There is a no fault situation, you can break the contract'. There was nothing wrong with that: many marriage contracts today are not covered by any religious significance. But children always came in between. The great problem is that the legislation has never properly paid attention to the children. The legislation concentrated on the breakdown of marriage because the adults could not get on. </PARA>
<PARA> We then come to some other peculiar conclusions-for instance, that the wife is quite clearly the best person to have the children. We have all these proceedings, including those carried out by the Child Support Agency, to make sure that the assumed breadwinner, the male spouse, will pay for the support of the children. I doubt that there is a member in this House who at some time has not had a very distraught father come to him to explain the circumstances of his wife leaving the marriage, going to live with someone else and pursuing him with a vigour and vehemence to support the children. </PARA>
<PARA> I am totally committed to the position that people who have children should be obliged to keep them. That is why I mentioned it. Maybe it is time parents had a contract with the Government-the only other body that can do this-saying that they will do that when they get married. Maybe honourable members would say that that would be another reason why they would not bother to get married. Basically that is the only other choice we have. </PARA>
<PARA> We offer that freely as a government without questioning whether the people could have stayed together and kept their contract. More importantly, we sort of say, `You go away, you take the kids, here's some money'. We employ people to go around and pick them up in a motor car. We have an easily discoverable number that people can call to have someone come and get them. </PARA>
<PARA> Once a person is taken out of the marital home a marriage is generally irretrievable. Perhaps we should be leaving them in the home to try to sort things out and do what would have been done prior to all this legislation-that is, ring up mum. It was an interesting situation in those days when the only solution other than having some bureaucrat take a person out of the family home was to go home to mother. When a person rang up mum the first thing that person got was counselling, and for free. Sometimes that counselling was a little brutal because mum said, `I told you never to marry that fellow'. But frequently the marriage survived. I think that was good. Parents had a great interest in the viability of marriage. One of the reasons was-I say this without any brutality-because they did not particularly want the children coming home to mother, because they had their own economic problems. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other sides to this matter. I think I have mentioned them in this place before. My mother just happened to be one of 13 children. It was not a matter of great significance that one night my mother and father talked about two of my mother's brothers- they were Irish-Catholic, sixfoot six and 18 stone-who had gone around to discuss the family situation with her sister's husband who was apparently not treating her very well. I am sure his performance would have improved after the discussion. </PARA>
<PARA> I am saying that the family took all those levels of interest in keeping marriages together, frequently very successfully, until we politicians came along. We had good reason; we had these examples, minimum though they might have been. The same applies to child abuse. We are going to have to be terribly careful with our administration in this area. This also applies to domestic violence. I say this for the sake of the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), who is getting all a-twitter on the other side of the House. They are the minority in our community; they are not the majority. </PARA>
<PARA> I feared deeply the creation of the domestic violence bureaucracy. As I said in an earlier discussion today, institutions become self-supporting. The people who have the job become more interested in finding domestic violence than preventing it. We have to be terribly careful as politicians that we do not do things that eventually destroy the initiative and the institutions of our community. I am worried in general terms that we have already done that with the Family Law Act as it is today and with the supporting parents benefit, notwithstanding the fact that I would never take it off the statute books. </PARA>
<PARA> Someone has to stand up every now and then and say, `This is not going as well as it should'. One of the most dramatic situations that is brought to me as a member of parliament by members of broken families relates to custody of children. It represents a huge difficulty for legislators simply because, as I said, we are the first line of defence. When a marriage contract is broken there is only the Treasury to support the children until other arrangements are made. Then we go through this legal process of tugging and pulling as to who might have custody of the children. I know that someone will stand up in a minute and quote statistics showing that there is a large percentage of those cases. That is never in dispute because the spouse, and possibly the breadwinner, has just left. Clearly in that situation I argue strongly for what happens today. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a lot of custody cases where both parties are clearly to be found. They are both around. Yet we have to have a legal process for the custody of the children. It appears to me that in an age when we no longer differentiate between the sexes-we no longer suggest that women or men are better than each other-it would be much simpler if the law provided that the financial responsibilities for children simply resided with that individual who had the financial resources to do it. Once neither has it that is quite a different issue anyway. If, for instance, that is the male partner, until such times as they would draw from that right they are the custodians of the children. Having stood back from that, having said, as some might, `I don't want the kids', then the process of the law should demand of them that they provide sufficient money to keep them, presumably in the hands of the other partner. </PARA>
<PARA> If both partners want to demonstrate the financial ability to support the children without any government involvement then I guess the courts have to decide who could do it best. I just do not see why we suddenly and always have to say that the children must go to the female and the husband must pay and we will pursue the Child Support Agency to get the money. I know that is the way we do it but I do not believe it is right. I think it is too simplistic on the one hand but creates a lot of problems for government on the other because generally the person who ends up with the children then becomes dependent on government assistance, notwithstanding the new and improved means of getting some money from someone else. Honourable members should remember that the original Family Law Act simply said that in setting maintenance the courts would take account of all the welfare one could get. In other words, `Please bludge on the community first, having broken your marriage contract, and then go off and see whether there is anything necessary to be paid from those who created the family in the first place'. </PARA>
<PARA> These are just comments that I wanted to make. As I said, we are trying harder in the area of child abuse. I do not think there is any doubt that there is child abuse. The Opposition has expressed concern as to when, in the hatred of a broken marriage, allegations of child abuse will be made, purely for reasons other than that there was child abuse. I think that is a matter of great concern. No-one should suggest that it will not happen and that it has not happened. Of course, it will happen. Just as children who learn to live with one parent in a broken marriage are told day after day all that is wrong about the other parent and are brainwashed to hate that parent-we know that happens-equally, a very young child could be convinced of almost anything. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know how one sorts that situation out, in other words, how one differentiates between reality and fantasy. But it is the sort of thing we have taken upon ourselves by poking our legislative nose further and further into the family. We have certainly contributed to more marriage breakdowns; the statistics support that without any further comment. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members opposite should go and look at the statistics when the Act was first brought in. The then Attorney-General got to the front of the queue, but after that people came in their thousands. I am not saying that is necessarily wrong. I am saying that we as legislators sometimes have to test our acts of generosity to ensure that the end result is beneficial to the community. `Beneficial' does not just mean that we pay someone some money; it means that we should try to maintain the family unit and we should do a lot of things to make sure that other people in the community who are trying to maintain their family unit are not being taxed into a position where financial pressures break up their marriage. These are the sorts of things that can happen. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not here trying to say that all things should change. I am here to utter a word of caution. I am not sure that our attempts as legislators in the field of marriage-I am not blaming either side of politics, myself included-have been very productive for the survival of marriage. I think marriage was more successful under some of the old rules when it was a family responsibility, not a responsibility of the courts. </PARA>
<PARA> At that time, the broken marriage was a straight-out financial responsibility of the immediate family and they knew it. Families certainly put a great deal more pressure on prospective bridegrooms, as I recollect. I certainly had to explain how I could keep my future wife in the manner to which she was accustomed. Nobody took any risks with me, simply because they knew that the only other persons in the community who could support my wife and our possible offspring were her parents. All of that parental interest has been reduced purely and simply on the grounds that it does not matter much any more; the responsibility will go back to the Government. We should think very carefully when we legislate in these areas so that we do the right thing. We should realise that some of the more established principles of our community may make for a better way to handle the situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before debating the Family Law Amendment Bill I must say, having listened to the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) and the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster), how glad I am that we in my Party are on this side of the House. I could not stress that fact too much. Just two hours ago in this House we had a debate on plain English and I think you, Mr Deputy Speaker, were in the chair when I was speaking in that debate about having legislation put into plain English. I can honestly say that the Family Law Amendment Bill before the House-particularly when we look at the legal ramifications of the wording of it-is possibly another area we could address in future regarding plain English.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I join the other speakers in commending Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) for bringing this Bill before the House. The Government proposes to move 13 amendments to the Bill. I noted that the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), in speaking on behalf of the Opposition, trivialised the fact that there were going to be 13 amendments moved by the Government. What he did not say and what I would like to have reported in Hansard is that a number of those amendments are to substitute the word `Minister' in place of `Attorney-General', so if we are going to trivialise amendments in this important Bill, let us be honest and factual. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Kooyong also spoke about mandatory reporting. A number of other speakers have also spoken on mandatory reporting. As the Attorney-General would know, this is an area of concern where I too disagree-except that I believe mandatory reporting should occur in all cases of child abuse. I do not believe we should have civil action to the extent that it was first placed in the legislation when it was introduced into this House on 16 May, but I do believe we should have mandatory reporting. </PARA>
<PARA> I stress that because I have unfortunate statistics that the honourable member for O'Connor did not have. Even though there are no national figures available-and I am ashamed to say that-about instances of child abuse, I do have figures supplied by the New South Wales Department of Family and Community Services. Those figures show that one in 11 children born in New South Wales in 1987 will be reported and confirmed as abused children by the time they reach the age of 16. Further statistics released during the child protection week last year show that in 1989, of the 18,427 new notifications of child abuse received, 10,001 were confirmed. Of those complaints, 24 per cent were of physical abuse, 23 per cent of sexual assault, 21 per cent of emotional abuse and 3 per cent of neglect. Those statistics are harrowing. The reason I back those statistics up is that I believe that through legislation, reporting should be made mandatory. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether we like is or not, these statistics reinforce the fact that child abuse is widespread within our community. In gradual recognition of this, over the last 10 years, child protection authorities throughout Australia have developed and implemented a variety of intervention programs for the prevention and control of child abuse. I am pleased to say that government agencies have now established specialist police, education, health and welfare services to provide assistance to victims and their families. </PARA>
<PARA> Both the Commonwealth and the States have now produced reports, established committees and held inquiries into child abuse. Legal reforms have been implemented in many States and funds have been provided to self-help groups. I am pleased to say that as governments and the community became increasingly aware of the prevalence of child abuse, there was also recognition of the problems child abuse posed for our legal system, which allocates family law matters to one court and child welfare matters to another. It has become evident that there is a need to foster and maintain a cooperative approach between courts and all other agencies involved in child protection matters. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to give an example of one problem which arose as a result of overlapping jurisdictions of guardianship, custody and access law and child welfare law and the lack of a cooperative approach between jurisdictions with regard to child protection. In New South Wales there is a mandatory legal requirement for doctors and teachers to notify the Department of Family and Community Services of suspected cases of child abuse. Once notified, the Department of Family and Community Services begins an investigation and gives the child or children immediate protection. If necessary, the Department begins a legal process in the New South Wales courts under New South Wales law to give the child or children necessary long term protection. For the victim, the Department procures the best available help, support and counselling. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been the case in the past that despite the Department of Family and Community Services having taken legal action in the State courts under State law to protect a child following notification and substantiation of abuse, the Family Court of Australia, acting under Commonwealth law, in custody proceedings before it involving that child has granted the perpetrator access to the victim. I do not mean to imply that the Family Court did not care whether the child had been abused or that the Court did not consider the welfare of the child. It was more the case that if the parties to the proceedings did not direct the Family Court's attention to action taken in the New South Wales courts, there was no legal procedure for the Department of Family and Community Services to intervene to draw the court's attention to action the Department had taken. Nor was there a mechanism whereby the Family Court could check as a matter of course whether action had been taken against one of the parties in the New South Wales courts for child abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, allegations of child abuse made by one party against another in custody and access disputes presented difficulties for the Family Court as it had no set procedures for handling such allegations. </PARA>
<PARA> These issues to which I refer were canvassed in the Family Law Council's 1988 report on child sexual abuse. The report was the product of a committee established in November 1985 to examine and report on cases involving allegations of child sexual abuse. The 1988 report's recommendations included that the Family Law Act 1975 should be amended to provide more explicit recognition of children's needs for protection against abuse; the hearsay rule should not apply to children's statements; notification of abuse should be made to relevant State or Territory child welfare authorities by legal practitioners, Family Court counsellors and others; and limits should be placed on the psychological and psychiatric assessment of children for purposes of litigation. </PARA>
<PARA> As is evident from the amendments in the Bill before the House, the Government has been largely guided by the recommendations of the report by the Family Law Council. The amendments are designed to complement the administrative arrangements established recently by the Family Court to process cases involving allegations of child abuse, and to overcome other remaining difficulties with the handling of child abuse allegations. There is to be a legal protection for a registrar or court counsellor who notifies a child welfare authority that a child has been abused, or is at risk of being abused. The amendment also provides that the registrar or counsellor is not liable in civil or criminal proceedings, and is not to be considered to have breached professional ethics or any standard of professional conduct. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill before the House also contains a section to provide for State and Territory child welfare authorities and other interested persons to intervene in cases involving alleged child abuse. I believe that this section will overcome the problems I alluded to earlier arising from that lack of cooperative approach between courts and other agencies involved in child protection matters. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like in passing to refer to clause 15. I do so because the Opposition has already indicated that it will move to delete that clause, even the amended one. I say shame. I repeat it-shame! Clause 15 provides that evidence of a child will be admissible-even though we are going to amend that-in proceedings in the Family Court, despite the rules regarding hearsay evidence. The court, as originally intended, would give such weight, if any, as it thinks fit to such evidence. Further, the evidence may be oral or in writing or inferred from the child's conduct. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that this amendment, based on the new recommendations of the Family Law Council, is very important. Evidence of a child in cases where abuse is alleged would appear to be of particular relevance. Of course, the court would give evidence such weight as it sees fit. There is a growing body of academic authority which submits that small children do make dependable witnesses, especially in cases of abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 17 provides that the Family Court must give leave before a child is examined by a person in order for that person to give evidence about that child in a case. This section effectively limits-and thank goodness it does-the number of unnecessary medical and psychological examinations of children obtained by parents involved in custody and access disputes. This amendment deserves support for the obvious protection it extends to children who, all too often, become pawns in bitter custody and access disputes before the courts. </PARA>
<PARA> I also address my comments to other aspects of this Bill which are worthy of the support of this House. </PARA>
<PARA>At present there is a requirement that a notice be published in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette whenever the Minister-in the original Bill it was the Attorney-General, but we are amending that-approves or revokes the approval of an organisation as a marriage counselling organisation, to which grants of financial assistance may be made. Clause 3 amends subsection 12(7) of the Family Law Act to require notification in an annual directory of approved marriage counselling, marriage education and family mediation organisations, rather than notification in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette. The new directory will ensure that the public will have better access to information on marriage and family counselling services. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that we have that in the Bill because, as the honourable member for O'Connor stated, we no longer have the opportunity extended to us whereby, with a marriage breakdown, one can go back to mum. I am glad that in the facts he presented when speaking to the Bill he acknowledged that not every couple has a mum. I hope that in turn easier access to information will lead to easier access to, and greater use of, the services themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Under existing provisions of the Family Law Act, a person may apply to the court for an order transferring custody or guardianship of a child from parents to another person, and if the parents consent to the order being made, the order may be made without appropriate scrutiny of the suitability of that person to have custody or guardianship of the child. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 8 of this Bill will require the parties now to attend a conference with a court counsellor or welfare officer who will then prepare a report for the court about the guardianship or custody arrangements proposed by the parties. The purpose of that report will be to advise the court whether the parents are making an informed decision, and whether any appropriate custody or guardianship arrangements are proposed. This amendment not only protects the interests of the child, but also reinforces the concept that the primary and continuing responsibility for a child should remain with the natural parents. </PARA>
<PARA> For similar reasons I also strongly support clause 10 of this Bill, which provides that an agreement registered with the Family Court has no effect to the extent that it purports to confer rights of custody or guardianship upon a person who is not the parent of the child. The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that child agreements are not used to transfer legal custody or guardianship of a child, except between the parents of a child. </PARA>
<PARA> Arrangements for the transfer of custody or guardianship of a child to non-parents should be subject to scrutiny by a court before they are given legal effect under the Family Law Act. It is presently the case that child agreements are registered without having been scrutineered by the court. Proper scrutiny can only be ensured by requiring the parties to apply to the court for a custody or a guardianship order, instead of registering a child agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Family Law Act confers jurisdiction on the Family Court and certain other courts to determine custody, guardianship and access questions in relation to a child. To an extent, that jurisdiction depends on the child being a child of the marriage, and by definition a child ceases to be a child of a marriage if the child is adopted by a person who is not a party to the marriage. Such an adoption takes the child out of the Family Court's jurisdiction and thus Family Court determinations regarding custody, guardianship and access rights cease to apply to that child. This situation causes obvious problems where a step-parent adopts a child, thereby terminating the custody or access rights of the child's natural parent. That is, the adoption is used as a device to exclude a parent who has, and is, exercising access rights in accordance with a Family Court access order. </PARA>
<PARA> The Family Law Council report of 1986 entitled Cinderella Revisited: Rights and Responsibilities of Step-Families identified such problems and made recommendations regarding the most appropriate way of establishing guardianship and custody rights and responsibilities for step-parents vis-a-vis their stepchildren. The recommendations included that, in any decision made regarding changes to the legal status and relationships of a child in a step-family, the welfare and interests of the child should be paramount and the wishes of the child, where expressed, should be taken into account; step-parents' custody and guardianship rights should not arise automatically on marriage but only on a court order. </PARA>
<PARA> Clauses 5, 6 and 7 of the Bill before the House clarify the effect that a step-parent adoption has on custody, guardianship and access rights under the Family Law Act. They make it clear that in the case of a step-parent adoption the Family Law Act continues to apply to the adopted child, thus continuing the access rights of natural parents, unless the Family Court has granted leave for adoption proceedings to be commenced. Clause 6 of the Bill provides for the Family Court to give leave in appropriate cases. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to say, too, that this Bill makes socially desirable and much needed amendments to the Family Law Act of 1975. In commending the Bill, again I reiterate that in all States of Australia, except Victoria and Tasmania, the parliaments and the courts have provided through legislation mandatory reporting of suspected child abuse or child ill treatment. I do not believe that the people with that responsibility, whether they be doctors, teachers, lawyers or whatever, have their professional integrity impinged on in any way by being obligated to report if they see a case such as I have just described.</PARA>
<PARA> It is our duty as adults to protect all children, and by that I mean children from birth until the age of 18. We must make sure that this legislation before the House is built on and that it continues to be amended to meet society's needs. Most particularly, we must make sure that we do not have to come to this House time and again to report abuse cases. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a sense I regret that this debate on the Family Law Amendment Bill will be interrupted within seven minutes, and the contribution I shall make may therefore be somewhat terse, unless I continue my remarks tomorrow. I have a number of simple points I want to make. My qualification for speaking in this debate is that in 1980 I chaired the one and only substantial parliamentary inquiry into the Family Law Act. I am pleased, therefore, that the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) in introducing this Bill commented that in the past there had been a bipartisan political approach to family law matters and that he was introducing the Bill with a view to its lying on the table and for consideration to be given to amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We know that since the Attorney-General did that, the Bill has been the subject of amendments proposed by the Opposition shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), and by the Attorney himself in incorporating many of the proposals put forward by the shadow Attorney-General. It is a sensible outcome to a very difficult issue, which has been canvassed by other speakers. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue of mandatory reporting and the requirements for reporting, particularly where the Commonwealth is involved in reporting child abuse to State authorities-under our constitutional arrangements the States tend to deal with these matters-raise the very vexed question of jurisdiction, referred to earlier by the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio). The question of jurisdiction is not new. When those of us on the Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act looked at the matter of jurisdiction, we were anxious to see that these questions were addressed by the Commonwealth and the States. We sought referral of powers and clarification of matters through the courts. We made recommendations in relation to those matters. So far as I have been able to observe, those jurisdictional questions are still with us, even if sometimes their boundaries shift. Where those problems arise, enormous personal difficulties occur for the parties involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue I want to put clearly before the Attorney, however, does not relate to the legislation and the compromises that are involved; it relates to the very issue of the division of responsibility in relation to family law and the family law counselling service and the State responsibilities-the State courts that have jurisdiction, particularly in advance of any matrimonial cause arising. When the Joint Committee looked at these matters it made a number of recommendations in relation to the way in which counselling ought to be undertaken. I think the Committee's recommendations, which have been largely ignored, ought to be reviewed again because they were sensible in terms of addressing the question of resources and where those resources ought to be most appropriately placed. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned when the Attorney was in the House earlier, and he recalled from his own experience much the same facts, that this has been exponentially a growth area of Commonwealth expenditure. When I practised in the matrimonial causes area as a young solicitor, before the Family Law Act was put in place, there were some three judges and one acting judge who dealt with family law matters in the matrimonial causes jurisdiction in New South Wales. I have not done a recent count as to the number of Family Court judges and all the additional staff. Much of that increase may well be related to the increase in divorce. We can bring in all sorts of arguments in relation to these issues, but the fact is that enormous resources are being put into this task. The resources that were previously at the disposal of the old matrimonial causes jurisdiction and the Children's Court were rather minimal. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Joint Select Committee looked at these questions it found that the people who were more likely to find children at risk, the people who were more likely to be dealing with situations in which they could counsel for reconciliation rather than for divorce, were the courts of State jurisdiction. They were the old Children's Courts, the courts that might first have to deal with a child that had come to the attention of welfare authorities. They were the same Children's Courts that might first have a claim by a woman for maintenance from a husband who was not assisting. </PARA>
<PARA> So at the State level we had people who were more likely to become aware of difficulties in a family situation and be able to positively assist. Yet enormous resources have been placed by the Commonwealth in developing a court counselling service, a service that is jealously regarded by the Family Court as its own. It is the Family Court that gives the court counselling service its work, sits in the same building and sees it as its own creature. What we needed was a body that was much more able to relate to the other services. This is a problem of jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> The Joint Select Committee report dealt with that matter in a very positive way, and there are recommendations in that report that have still not been positively addressed. For me, the inquiry was a case study in the way in which a parliamentary committee asked to look at these matters found that its report was later being reviewed by the professionals in the area-the advisers and family law counsellors. Anything that they did not like got swept off the agenda. I am glad that we have a new parliamentary committee about to commence inquiry in this area. I hope that the recommendations of that committee do not face the same fate that we saw in regard to many of the recommendations of the Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act in 1980. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise the question of the standard of public debate in Australia on important issues. I will take as an example what has happened over the last few days on the matter of health policy. On 15 February, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in the Sir Norman Cowper Oration looked at the issue of the division of financial responsibilities between State and Federal governments and canvassed a number of ways of solving that problem. I remind the House that the Leader of the Opposition has supported the initiative of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in having a thorough review of these relationships. This was quite a serious speech and in the course of it the Leader of the Opposition said:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>A more radical alternative which has been raised by both the Centre for Independent Studies and the IPA would be to see the Commonwealth cease paying specific grants to the States altogether in such areas as education and health. </PARA>
<PARA>He then canvassed the suggestions of those people regarding vouchers. That is the context within which this supposed debate has occurred. One will notice the tentative nature of those alternatives and the fact that they were identified as alternatives which were being put forward by outside bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> If one is going to try to have a sensible debate on these matters one has to contend with certain elements of the press. On Tuesday, 19 February, the Sydney Morning Herald carried the headline `Libs go back to the `50s with health vouchers' over an article written by Pilita Clark. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Opposition is considering a radical free-market health policy which would see Medicare abolished and replaced by a voucher system administered by the Department of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA> The plan is being examined in the Leader of the Opposition's office where it has attracted the strong interest of some of Dr Hewson's more influential advisers and a number of senior Liberal MPs. </PARA>
<PARA>One can see how that has been built up. `Libs go back to the `50s with health vouchers'-that is a very balanced report of what Dr Hewson said! There was then enormous fuss: Government Ministers created a nonsense in the House. The following day the same writer, Pilita Clark, said, `Opposition support for health vouchers wavers'. This is the support she herself had built up the previous day. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government moved yesterday to make maximum political capital from revelations-</PARA>
<PARA>revelations by whom?-</PARA>
<PARA>that the Opposition was considering . . . And Opposition sources confirmed that preliminary costings of the voucher system . . . showed it could add up to $3 billion to the health bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Where did she get that from? They do not exist. The same paper has a supposed report `From The Gallery' by Mike Seccombe entitled `Shadow health is a sickly position' which is what I can only describe as a vicious, malicious and prejudiced attack on the shadow Minister for health, the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods). It is a disgraceful piece which should not be there. In the same edition of the Sydney Morning Herald, there is a special piece, again by Pilita Clark, entitled `Unhealthy state in the Coalition's health policies'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Pilita Clark reports that the Coalition is still struggling to develop a workable health policy, despite its latest proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>The article says `its latest proposal'. I thought it was a proposal from the Centre for Independent Studies. The unbelievable bit is that she goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The resultant headlines, which blared that the Opposition was heading back to the 1950s, provided an instant sense of deja vu for anyone . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Which resultant headlines? The headlines of the Sydney Morning Herald the previous day are the headlines that blared. So one can see how these things build up. A perfectly sensible and rational discussion arising out of a bipartisan attempt to look at Federal-State relations is built up by the press. Of course, one cannot expect anything better from Ministers in the House, but I do expect something better from a serious newspaper. </PARA>

<TITLE>Dump in Brisbane</TITLE>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ST4">Mr GIBSON</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Moreton)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(7.35)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are facing a situation today in Brisbane where, once again, the Liberal administration of the Brisbane City Council has shown its complete contempt for the people of Brisbane and their needs by its decision on 5 February to agree to the positioning of a dump at Rochedale. One might think that I should not be raising an issue such as this in Federal Parliament, but it is a very important issue to me as it will affect enormously many residents in my electorate because the dump will be located only 800 metres from very large housing sections in my electorate. Therefore, I think this is a very important issue which I need to raise on behalf of my constituents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are many very valid reasons why this dump should not be there-none of which the Liberal administration of the Brisbane City Council took any notice. We now have a situation where one of the largest dumps in the world-a dump which will be 194 acres in size-will be located in a rural residential area, within 800 metres of the large suburban residential sections of Wishart, Mansfield and upper Mount Gravatt. This dump is simply too large. It will be the only dump servicing the whole of Brisbane. Every four minutes trucks will come past large residential areas to off-load their material at the dump and it will have enormous implications for the lives, lifestyles and health of many residents in my electorate of Moreton. The dump will be used for commercial, residential and industrial waste-and can include toxic and hazardous substances. Yet it is situated only 800 metres from densely populated suburbs. I think it is a disgrace that the Brisbane City Council Liberal administration has agreed to the location of this dump in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many reasons why it is a totally unsuitable site, and I will list just a few of them. Firstly, there will be the problem of noise from the dump-large heavy vehicles will be working from 6.30 a.m. to 6.30 p.m. every day. Large vehicles will be driving past, as I have said, every four minutes through densely populated areas to off-load their material. So people will be disrupted by noise. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the people of my electorate will be disrupted by odours coming from this dump. The decomposition of material in the dump will pollute both the local water table and the local air. The local water table is a very important issue because the area south of the dump is a garden farming area which produces a lot of fruit and vegetables for the markets of Brisbane. The dump site will lead to poisoning of the water table which is used by those local farmers in the Rochedale area to water their crops. That could lead to some quite adverse conditions for those farmers as well as for the people of Brisbane. The poisoning of the water table will also lead to the pollution of Bulimba Creek and, subsequently, the Brisbane River, and that also has some serious implications. </PARA>
<PARA> Another issue is the spreading of odours, dust and other pollutants by the wind. Surface wind analysis has indicated that for 50 per cent of the time those high density population suburbs in my electorate-the suburbs of Mansfield, upper Mount Gravatt and Wishart-will be directly exposed to smells and air pollutants emanating from this site. The pollutants will include dust, odorous substances and toxic contaminants. A massive increase in heavy truck traffic will occur in the area. The Pacific Waste Management proposal states that a large truck will enter the dump every four minutes from Monday to Friday and every 4.8 minutes on Saturday and Sunday. This will make driving more difficult, increase noise and dust and lead to a deterioration of roads in the area. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision of the Brisbane City Council to allow the dump to be situated in Rochedale was a scandalous decision and an abuse of its power. It ignored the massive level of complaints from local citizens that this dump was not suitable for this site. The only good thing that will come out of this decision is the fact that after the next City Council elections on 24 March Rochedale will be represented by a Labor alderman by the name of Mr Phillip Reeves, who will ensure that the needs and conditions of the people of Rochedale ward will be better looked after. Hopefully, this decision will be reversed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Along with the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton), I wish to draw the Parliament's attention to the gross distortion of the coalition's discussion on health policy options. The headline in today's Sun-Herald newspaper reads, `Health hazard-Hewson's scheme falters under fire'. That is a total misrepresentation of the facts. All Victorian readers of the newspaper, having read the article and the headline, would have the impression that the shadow Minister for health, the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) had put forward definitive and costed health policy options. Nothing could be further from the truth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This misleading headline has emerged from the obvious bias and lack of research by the Sun-Herald correspondent, Sue Dunleavy. The Leader of the Opposition presented a speech to the Australian Institute of Political Science on Friday, 15 February, in which he canvassed a range of policy options. It was a carefully thought out speech in which he put forward some of the more radical alternatives which could bring about a better Australia. One such idea concerned the financial arrangements between the State and Federal governments. He suggested that the Commonwealth cease paying specific grants to the States in such areas as education and health, but in specific terms he suggested:</PARA>
<PARA>The payments would instead be made directly to individuals, perhaps in the form of a service access card or voucher as the Americans have called it. The access card could then in turn be used by the individual to buy services from State governments or from private sector providers. </PARA>
<PARA>This seems a fairly sensible and thoughtful idea which has been canvassed by a number of thinking political commentators over the years. The thrust of the Leader's remarks was in the context of State and Federal relationships, and not specific health funding. </PARA>
<PARA> The Sun-Herald correspondent then developed a thesis based on health funding costings which have absolutely no basis in fact. The bias of the article shows through quite clearly in the suggestion that the Opposition had a costed health policy option involving voucher payments to individuals which would cost $1 billion. Sue Dunleavy was assured on two occasions that no costings had been done, and she was also assured by the Leader's office that there was no costing being commissioned. </PARA>
<PARA> To further compound her already erroneous statements, she intimated that the Leader had a preferred health voucher option. The Leader of the Opposition has made it quite clear, since announcing that a health seminar would be held, that he and the Party would look at all policy options to overcome the chaos that the current Medicare scheme has inflicted on all Australians. The shadow health spokesman, the honourable member for Lowe, also confirmed that there were no costings of the voucher option in existence, but that it was one of a number of health options being considered. </PARA>
<PARA> This initial article by Sue Dunleavy was used in the Medicare matter of public importance discussion yesterday and was quoted as authoritative evidence that a voucher system would cost $1 billion. The Government has used these incorrect reports to launch an unsubstantiated attack on the Opposition in relation to education and health funding. The whole sorry state of affairs shows the Government's own inadequacies in defending its poorly performing and costly Medicare scheme. This article reflects poorly on the SunHerald and its correspondent, Sue Dunleavy, because of the way in which the coalition's discussions on health matters have been grossly misrepresented and distorted. </PARA>

<TITLE>Wetherill Park Business Mail Delivery Centre: Public Telephones</TITLE>
<SPEECH PAGE="1055" SPEAKER="Crosio The Hon J.A." NAMEID="7T4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="PROSPECT" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7T4">Mrs CROSIO</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Prospect)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(7.43)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 10 May 1990 in my first speech before this House I mentioned the problem of inadequate postal facilities within my electorate of Prospect-a problem that has been a cause of concern for my constituents for quite some time. I am pleased to report that as part of the ongoing program for the development of Retail Post, Australia Post now is developing a business mail delivery centre at lot 202, Victoria Street, Wetherill Park.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is a specialised facility. The Retail Post program is being developed at three levels-retail activities, such as stamp sales and normal post office transactions; business centre activities, involving the reception of volume business postings, mail pick-up and delivery for businesses, and 24 hour access private boxes; and the delivery centre function, covering the delivery of mail to all delivery points in the area. Wetherill Park is to be a combination of business centre and delivery centre, and will provide facilities for the reception of mail from surrounding businesses and for the delivery of mail within its area. </PARA>
<PARA> The building is being erected at an estimated cost of $1.1m, and is expected to be operational by the end of June 1991. There are currently about 22 delivery staff and five night sorters at the Smithfield post office, and all of these staff will be relocated to the Wetherill Park delivery centre. In addition, consideration is now being given to the transfer of delivery staff from Fairfield, creating much needed room in that particular facility. The counter services will remain at Fairfield and at Smithfield. </PARA>
<PARA> Some Smithfield post office staff will be relocated to the business centre, but it is anticipated that additional staff will also need to be employed as this is a rapidly developing industrial area. Because of the increasing need for postal facilities in the area, a retail service and private box facility will remain at Smithfield, even when the business centre is fully operational.</PARA>
<PARA> Although praising the action that has now been taken, it has been brought to my notice today that although the Smithfield post office originally had four telephone booths for use by the public, two were taken away some time ago and the other two were removed some four weeks ago. Upon investigating where those public telephones had been moved, I was informed that they were relocated to a shopping arcade which, I might add, is locked at night. We have no public phone facilities available in the immediate Smithfield shopping centre area following the removal of those telephones by Telecom Australia. I understand the telephones were removed at the request of Australia Post, which no longer wanted them at that location. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe consideration should be given to providing facilities for the people. People stranded at the Smithfield shopping centre will not have a public phone available. After inquiry I was told that there are two telephones in the immediate vicinity. When I asked where, I was told there was one at the Mobil service station and another at the Returned Services League club-half a mile away. I hope no-one breaks down and has to try to get into the club at half past two in the morning, wearing shorts and sandals. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another phone, I was told, 400 metres away, at the corner of Brennan and Stimson Street. Anyone who has measured that as 400 metres certainly needs to start again with his ruler. I was then informed that there was another one 800 metres away, at the intersection of Hassall Street and The Horsley Drive. That is some mile and a half away, in the old measurements, from where the original public phones were situated. How it can be said that that is 800 metres never ceases to amaze me. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe Telecom, in relocating services like this, must take into account the facilities that need to be provided for the public, no matter what Australia Post says. I know many homes now have phones; I know they are available. But what do people do at 2 o'clock or 3 o'clock in the morning when they need a public phone, and they go to a post office because that is where they think a phone is-and that is where the phones have been since this particular post office was built in 1972-only to find there are no phones? Then, of course, they are told not to worry because there are phones provided in the arcade for the benefit of the public-an arcade which, I stress again, is locked up every night. I cannot see how the public can benefit from a public phone which is not available to them from 6 o'clock at night until 9 o'clock in the morning. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise again the issue of the notorious Westpac letters. Legal action in three countries has been initiated by Westpac against the Sydney Morning Herald, the Age, the Canberra Times, Australian Broadcasting Corporation Television's 7.30 Report, ABC Radio's PM, a former Westpac foreign exchange dealer and his family, the Foreign Borrowers Association and its spokesman, Mr John McLennan. All have been restrained from publishing the letters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Aggressive newspaper advertisements by Westpac have threatened the population at large for disclosure. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration inquiry into the Australian banking system was blocked from undertaking any discussion of the letters. Senator McLean was prevented from tabling the letters in the Senate. Yet, there has been no denial of the allegations contained in the letters. </PARA>
<PARA> This saga has raised two issues of national importance: first, the contents of the letters themselves and their allegations of malpractice on a grand scale with major implications for Westpac and the banking system; and second, and more importantly, the subversion of the national Parliament by its being prevented from fulfilling its proper function. The Constitution guarantees the freedom of parliamentary debates from question in the courts. This privilege was established by the House of Commons in 1688 by article 9 of the Bill of Rights, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>That the freedom of speech and debates of proceedings in Parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court. </PARA>
<PARA>Article 9 also prevents proceedings in parliament being used in evidence in a legal action, with limited exceptions. A chief justice of the High Court of Australia, Sir Harry Gibbs, has stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . a member of Parliament should be able to speak in Parliament with impunity and without any fear of the consequences. </PARA>
<PARA>Section 16 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 makes it clear that while the courts might issue injunctions to prevent disclosure of documents by the public, the Parliament is immune. This immunity extends to committees and expressly extends to the presentation of documents to the House. </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding this fundamental right, the House can restrict itself and decide that the sub judice convention could curtail debate. It is a matter of balancing the wider public interest against the need to ensure that juries are not influenced and that parties in court proceedings are not prejudiced. It is the practice of the House, in applying the sub judice rule to civil matters, to do so only if the court proceedings have been set down for trial or are on foot. In this case, there are proceedings but no jury. Former Speaker Snedden commented in 1976:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . judges of the courts do not regard themselves as such delicate flowers that they are likely to be prejudiced in their decisions by a debate that goes on in this House. </PARA>
<PARA>It might be argued that the Westpac letters ought not to be disclosed in Parliament because of legal professional privilege, but Parliament is not bound to observe any such claim. Professional privilege prevents a letter from a legal adviser being used in evidence without consent. Parliament is outside the bounds of this claim of privilege. In any case the Privileges Act 1987 prevents the letters, if they are tabled or if anything is said about them, from being used in evidence in court. There are no substantial arguments on the grounds of either the sub judice rule or legal professional privilege which would justify the House refusing the tabling of the Westpac letters. There are compelling reasons for allowing it. Parliament's integrity as an institution is at stake and there is a public interest in Parliament being free to consider the issues raised by these letters that far outweighs any public interest consideration in keeping them secret. </PARA>
<PARA> The Constitution, the High Court, the Parliamentary Privileges Act, the advice of the Clerk of the Senate, precedent and the overwhelming interests of the people of Australia demand that no member should be prevented from tabling the Westpac letters. To prevent their tabling would show that Westpac is being protected and this House is being subverted. I therefore seek leave to table the two Westpac letters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Late last year, in November, I attended with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) the opening of the Melton campus of the new Victoria University of Technology (VUT) in the west of Melbourne; it was one of the most exciting days-in fact, probably the most exciting day-for the history of higher education in the west of Melbourne.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is with some sadness that I refer to a question that I asked the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) in the House today about the proposed development of the Victoria University, and in particular the antics of the board of the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, commonly known as RMIT. </PARA>
<PARA> The VUT is based essentially on a merger between RMIT and the Western Institute and the various campuses that make up those two bodies. The result of the merger, with both partners playing principal roles, has an exciting future as Victoria's fifth university. Unfortunately-and it was well covered in an article in the Australian Financial Review yesterday on page 25-there has been a breakdown in the negotiations about the formation of the campus, which seems to be based mainly around the views of the board of RMIT, which seems to think that in some way the status and the profile of RMIT will be jeopardised by continuing with the plan to be part of the VUT. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to take a couple of minutes of the time of the Parliament to make very clear a couple of things. First of all, I thank the Minister for his unequivocal commitment today, in the answer to my question, that the resources and the continuing support for the development of higher education in the west of Melbourne remain the highest priority for the Government. In fact, I think the Minister mentioned that some 40 per cent of the allocation for higher education in Victoria in the coming financial triennium is to this university. That is a message that ought not to be lost on the board of RMIT. </PARA>
<PARA> RMIT is desired as a partner in the VUT, but I would suggest that the board is being just a little bit too precious about itself in the negotiating position that it is adopting at the moment. The fact of the matter is that already students have flocked to the VUT; the enrolments this year have far exceeded even optimistic expectations. As I mentioned before, the opening day with the Prime Minister at the Melbourne campus was an exciting time. Some 700 or 800 people present saw something transformed from paddocks to a university. People are voting with their feet to come out of the city and join the new university. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to suggest to the members of the board of RMIT that they should think deeply about their position. As I said, I think they are being a little bit too precious about their status and view of themselves. The Government's very clear message is that the resources will go to the west, there will be substantial resources, and they will mean a lot. The RMIT can be part of that or it can elect to be something else. </PARA>
<PARA> I know there are a number of other options. For instance, I personally, being a person who grew up in the north and west of Melbourne, am greatly attracted to a merger of places such as the Phillip Institute of Technology, the Broadmeadows College of Technical and Further Education and the Western Institute as a university for the north and west of Melbourne. I see many options with the current proposed structure. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate the view that I would like to see the current proposal go ahead, but I make it very clear that, no matter what RMIT decides, the Victoria University of Technology in the west will go ahead, will succeed and will be the prime focus of higher education on that side of Melbourne. That is where the resources will be. I do not think there is much future being a loner in the central business district in Melbourne and occupying some of the best buildings that could be available for redevelopment of Melbourne's central business district. I do not think that that is the place where RMIT ought to be leaving itself as these things unfold. </PARA>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to urge the board of RMIT to take note of the students, who have said that they want to be part of the VUT, and suggest that the board move very quickly to finalise this merger. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to address the issue of the Eastern Freeway extension and the Ringwood Bypass in Melbourne. I have been approached by the joint mayoral committee of four councils-Box Hill, Doncaster and Templestowe, Nunawading and Ringwood-the last two of which are in my electorate of Aston. The Government's delaying tactics in making a positive statement to enable the construction of the Eastern Freeway extension to proceed are causing great concern throughout the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. An independent review panel has recommended that this new road should be built.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The support of the community is quite clear. Petitions containing thousands of signatures have sought the extension and public opinion polls have shown that about 75 per cent of residents support the extension. All four councils support the extension and the bypass. I myself took part two years ago in a referendum run by Nunawading Council in which 66 per cent of residents supported the construction of these roads. </PARA>
<PARA> Although it has been reported that the Federal Government was prepared to make $130m available for the construction of the Eastern Freeway extension, the indication from a recent media release by the Federal Minister and a statement by the State Minister for Transport is that construction will not proceed and that a report on public transport as a possible alternative to the freeway extension is to be prepared. Until such time as the public transport review is completed, the funding of the freeway construction must remain intact. </PARA>
<PARA> Both the Federal and State Ministers for transport have intimated that public transport has not been considered or addressed in the reports on the freeway extension that have been prepared to date. This is simply untrue. The review panel has referred to public transport on a number of occasions and has clearly indicated that the freeway extension is necessary both in its own right and as a requirement to enable existing and new public transport facilities to be expanded. The freeway extension is part of an integrated effective transport infrastructure. The panel's final report is clear that there is a need to provide additional road capacity before the development of public transport, a view supported by many other reports. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been over 50 reports during the last 30 years. All review panels and inquiries have supported the construction of these two roads. We now seek an immediate Government statement supporting the freeway extension. The construction would create jobs now, reduce the accident rate and benefit travel time and travel and transport operating costs. The mayoral committee is opposed to another final assessment being carried out on the Eastern Freeway extension; however, if this is to proceed, then the committee believes it should be on the following basis. The committee should be involved in the development of the brief, the committee should be fully involved during the assessment--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I rise in response to the contributions in the adjournment debate tonight by the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) and the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin), specifically in relation to their claims about the standard of debate, particularly of the health debate, that has been going on in this House over the last couple of days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Mackellar in particular berated the media for what he suggested was inaccurate reporting or interpretation of the Opposition's position on the health policy, such as it may be. He claimed that the Government was speaking nonsense on the matter and that he did not expect anything better from Ministers, although he expected better from the media. That is the quote that I wrote down at the time he was speaking-I hope that it is accurate. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore I want to comment on the debate that has taken place in the House on these matters in the last couple of days. In particular I refer to the matter of public importance which was raised by the Government yesterday, notably to remarks made by the shadow Minister for health, the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods). He made a comment about the drug erythropoietin which seemed to be in parenthesis, therefore indicating that it was some form of statement or quote from the Government or from a Minister who was not specifically named. It would be assumed that it was said by either the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) or myself. The quote about the drug erythropoietin was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>It is too expensive. Don't worry about the fact it saves lives or allows mothers to see their children grow up. It is too expensive. We will make sure that it is blocked out. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to make it very clear that in terms of standards of debate it is a nonsense to insinuate that a Government Minister made such a statement. This allegation should be justified and substantiated. As far as I am aware, the Minister for Community Services and Health did not say anything like that and I certainly have never said anything like it. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue of erythropoietin needs to be put in place if we are to talk about standards of debate. This kidney hormone is of use in the treatment of anaemia associated with chronic renal failure. It is currently available to patients on a clinical trial basis only. The sponsor company, Janssen-Cilag, is charging patients or health authorities for its use. In June 1990, after a previous rejection in February 1989, the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee-which is not made up of Ministers and bureaucrats, but of properly qualified doctors and experts, people who know their job in the field of pharmacy and pharmacology-recommended that erythropoietin be recommended for general marketing once outstanding quality control and product information issues were settled. </PARA>
<PARA> The product information document proposed by the company was considered unacceptable by this expert panel of Australian medical people. In order to save time that might be lost through protracted negotiations on individual points, the document was rewritten by the Department of Community Services and Health and returned to the company for comments. After extensive negotiation with the company, the final document was approved. </PARA>
<PARA> Although most quality control issues have been resolved, there are two outstanding problems in the sterility and toxin content areas. As the product may be given directly into the blood volume of the patient, sterility is of utmost importance, particularly for people who are suffering from the very serious condition of chronic renal failure. Similarly, ill patients should not be given excessive amounts of bacterial toxins. These are issues that the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee is most concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA> As Minister, I take its advice and will not allow the marketing of that product in Australia until those experts are satisfied. I do that to protect Australians. The company was formally requested to provide answers to sterility issues in April 1990-10 months ago. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KJ4">Mr STAPLES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. As I was saying, the company was formally asked to provide answers to the sterility issues in April 1990, but there has been no reply despite numerous requests. The latest information from the company is that its manufacturing facility in Belgium has been so busy that it has not had the time to respond to the questions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we are talking about standards of debate, honesty and accuracy in this place, let us get down to some of the facts instead of the bluster. The questions that have been asked of the company are no different from those which would have been directed to any manufacturer of a drug purporting to affect sterility. Janssen-Cilag is well aware, or should have been well aware, of the issues to be addressed as they are set out in the NDF4 guidelines and the company has had much experience in this field. Again in September 1990 the company was asked to take action on this matter or to include an appropriate warning on the label, but so far there has been no response. These are major safety issues with a drug for people who are very sick. These issues must be resolved properly before marketing can be permitted. </PARA>
<PARA> Today in this country we face a process of which we are seeing more and more. It is being aided and abetted by the standard of debate-particularly in the health area-by those on the other side. We are seeing a process of drug evaluation by press release and, clearly, judging by comments that were recorded in Hansard yesterday, by unsubstantiated innuendo. The honourable member for Lowe should check his statements for accuracy because he is not doing his party any credit in the health policy area and he is creating a problem in drug evaluation processes in this country. It is not good enough just to get a cheap press release. He must get the details. I hope that the standard of debate in that regard will be lifted. </PARA>
<PARA> In drawing to a close I make this comment: it is becoming more and more a feature of drug evaluation issues in this country that programs are subverted and attempts are made to subvert evaluations by press release, media campaigns and letter writing campaigns before the drug has been properly evaluated. I make the point-and I will reiterate it in a letter to manufacturers and the Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association-that if this sort of process continues, I will have to consider very seriously issues of commercial-in-confidence. If people want to persist in pushing these sorts of approaches out in the public and hide behind commercial-in-confidence issues within the subject of their applications, they have to be very much aware that the Government will not be prepared to have the proper drug evaluation processes of this country subverted in that way without being able adequately to respond and to assure the Australian population of the highest quality and safety of their pharmaceuticals. </PARA>

<PARA> The Government is considering an application for funding under the Development Import Finance Facility (DIFF) for a project which involves the supply of equipment and technology for the manufacture of environmentally friendly (non CFC) refrigerator compressors in China. The Australian exporter proposes to supply equipment based on US technology, for which it holds a manufacturing licence.</PARA>
