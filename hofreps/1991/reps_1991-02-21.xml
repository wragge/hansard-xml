<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I informed the House that I had concluded that issues raised by the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin) on behalf of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration were sufficiently important to have counsel seek leave to appear on my behalf in the Supreme Court of New South Wales in an action taken by Westpac Banking Corporation against a witness before that Committee, Mr J. R. McLennan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now advise the House that counsel representing me appeared in the proceedings and, following that intervention and discussions between counsel representing Westpac Banking Corporation and me, assurances were given to the court to the effect that, first, any injunction which Westpac Banking Corporation seeks against Mr McLennan seeking restraint on him will be qualified to exclude disclosure or use of documents by him to the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration and, second, Westpac will not seek, without first giving notice to the Speaker or the Australian Government Solicitor in Sydney, any order for production of any document on such terms as might preclude Mr McLennan from producing the document to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration.</PARA>
<PARA> I now table the memorandum supplied to me by counsel and will have it incorporated in Hansard.</PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA</PARA>
<PARA>PARLIAMENTARY PRIVILEGE</PARA>
<PARA>MEMORANDUM</PARA>
<PARA>Westpac Banking Corporation has commenced proceedings in the Supreme Court of New South Wales against John Ross McLennan seeking orders restraining him from disclosing certain information claimed to be confidential to the plaintiff, including information contained in documents, and other ancillary orders. An interlocutory application in connection with the matter was listed for hearing today before the Honourable Mr. Justice Powell at 2 pm.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr McLennan has made a submission to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration in connection with its Inquiry into the Australian Banking Industry. The Speaker of the House of Representatives was concerned to ensure that submissions should be put to the Court so that no orders were sought which might be construed as breaching the privileges of the House of Representatives. These privileges arise under Section 49 of the Commonwealth Constitution and Article 9 of the Bill of Rights, 1688 and are amplified by the Parliamentary Privileges Act, 1987.</PARA>
<PARA>We were instructed to seek leave to appear amicus curiae before Mr Justice Powell on the instructions, through the Australian Government Solicitor, of the Speaker of the House of Representatives, to put submissions on the question of parliamentary privilege. After Senior Counsel had announced our appearance, and sought leave to put submissions to the Court amicus curiae, Mr Stephen Charles QC, who appeared for the plaintiff, Westpac Banking Corporation, handed up some proposed orders which contained the following:-</PARA>
<PARA> ``1. Pending the determination of the proceedings or earlier further order, the defendant be restrained from disclosing or using the plaintiff's confidential information, being the documents and the information contained in the documents referred to in the Schedule hereto (``the plaintiff's documents'') other than to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, or any representatives thereof.''</PARA>
<PARA>None of the other orders which it was proposed that the Court should be asked to make today required Mr McLennan to take any steps which would preclude him from producing any documents to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration.</PARA>
<PARA>During a short adjournment of the application, while the Court disposed of a part heard matter, Mr Charles gave us further assurances the text of which will be set out below. We were then instructed that, subject to making a statement within the Court setting out the assurances we had been given, we should seek leave to withdraw our application to be heard amicus curiae.</PARA>
<PARA>When the Court resumed, Senior Counsel made the following statement to the Court containing the assurances we had been given:-</PARA>
<PARA> ``Mr Charles on behalf of the plaintiff Westpac Banking Corporation has informed me:-</PARA>
<PARA> 1. That any injunction which the plaintiff seeks will be qualified in accordance with the qualification contained in paragraph 1 of the draft Orders presented today; and</PARA>
<PARA> 2. That the plaintiff will not seek, without first giving notice to the Speaker of the House of Representatives or to the Australian Government Solicitor in Sydney, any order for the production of any document on such terms as might preclude the defendant from producing the document to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration.</PARA>
<PARA> In those circumstances I have been instructed, for the moment, to withdraw my application to be heard amicus curiae.''</PARA>
<PARA>Thereafter we withdrew from the Court.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> We the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth of Australia, do humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government will consider the plight of the father in the Family Court.</PARA>
<PARA> Fathers, according to the Laws of Australia, should have equal rights to their children, in both custody and access applications before the Family Court. Immediate amendments to the Family Law Act should be implemented for inclusion of parental rights as distinct from children's rights. It should be made possible for fathers to obtain a fair deal in the Family Court and be able to continue involvement in their siblings upbringing at all times throughout every stage of their children's development, thus being in the best interest of the children themselves; without incurring exorbitant legal costs and manipulated by many of the legal profession.</PARA>
<PARA> Access Orders from the Family Court should be implemented without delay and at no cost to the non-custodial parent, thus eliminating denial of access. We humbly urge Parliament to direct the Family Court by way of immediate legislation to jealously guard visitation rights and become more liberal with them.</PARA>
<PARA> We further do humbly seek that a private members bill be introduced on an urgent basis to consider the plight of Mr John Zabaneh, a fellow citizen and a father of four young children whom he had no access to for nearly five years despite that he had obtained unenforceable orders from the courts. John Zabaneh has been denied any input in his children's development and upbringing and has little or no knowledge of his children's progress and wellbeing.</PARA>
<PARA> As this matter is of human-rights nature, or paramount importance, it is specially requested that this petition be read to Parliament assembled in full. And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.</PARA>

<TITLE>Rights of the Child</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. that ratification of United Nations Conventions, such as the above, by the Federal Government, without Parliamentary debate or consultation with the people through a referendum, is a gross abuse of the Australian Constitution and is contrary to democratic principles;</PARA>
<PARA> 2. that the Convention's philosophy of parent/child relationships is based on a false premise and embodies the totalitarian principles of State ownership of children;</PARA>
<PARA> 3. that the Christian principle of parental authority is essential for the proper functioning of society, but phrases in the Convention implying parents' rights are virtually meaningless, with escape clauses permitting the widest of interpretation;</PARA>
<PARA> 4. that Articles 12 to 16 giving children the right to seek, think, say and be whatever, wherever and with whom they wish violates the common sense of any normal parent;</PARA>
<PARA> 5. that some Articles contradict other Articles and imprecise wording adds to the confusion by providing loopholes for the protection of paedophiles and certain types of child traffickers;</PARA>
<PARA> 6. that some of the proposed rights are inappropriate for immature child minds and have no logical connection with the protection of children from abuse or deprivation, such protection being already provided by existing Australian laws.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore request the House to legislate or provide for:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a twelve month Moratorium on the ratification of the Convention to enable the people of Australia to discuss and examine in detail the 54 Articles;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a referendum to follow the Moratorium, seeking public approval before ratification of the Convention.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs, I present the Committee's report entitled You have your moments, a report on funding of peak health and community organisations, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HH4">Mr JENKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since the 1950s, the Commonwealth has funded organisations to operate national secretariats in the community services, health and housing areas. In the intervening period there have been a number of internal and interdepartmental reviews resulting in various changes, including transfers of responsibility from central control in the Department of Administrative Services to program departments such as the Department of Community Services and Health. However, there had not been a full and critical review of national secretariat funding administered by the Department of Community Services and Health. This inquiry is the first such comprehensive public review of this funding program by the Parliament. It comes at an appropriate time at the end of the 1980s when a new range of consumer representative organisations has emerged and, in some cases, received funding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The organisations considered by this inquiry are representative bodies set up around a common interest. Some are concerned with a specific issue, such as the Australian Cystic Fibrosis Associations Federation, some represent broad constituencies in particular program areas, such as national shelter in the housing sector, and some have interests which extend beyond the Community Services and Health portfolio, such as the Australian Council of Social Service, which deals with social security issues, amongst others. </PARA>
<PARA> They are often groupings of organisations whose grassroot members are consumers, parent and service providers. Their national secretariats' main activities include the following: information dissemination, consultation, policy development, lobbying government and bureaucracy, public awareness, public education, and public debate. The advantage of proximity to government, the Parliament and the Federal bureaucracy has led to many of these organisations being based in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee found that there is a vital role for such organisations in the community. Most importantly, they give disadvantaged people an opportunity to comment on and influence policy and programs which affect them. This assists government to take broad community needs into account in decision making. On occasions their obligation to represent their constituents brings them into conflict with government, hence the title of the report, You have your moments. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the view of the Committee that the community needs organisations which can challenge government and the bureaucracy. This report sets out to provide a constructive, accountable environment in which such criticism and possible disagreement can take place. Since the members of the funded organisations are people who, in the main, have low disposable incomes, a degree of Commonwealth support is often necessary. The $6m spent on national secretariats is a small proportion of the total community services, health and housing budget which assists the community to deal with issues in a mature, considered, democratic, open and informed way. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no need for overall funding to be significantly increased, but two points should be made. First, the freeze imposed on funding levels for some organisations needs to be lifted to allow annual indexation. Second, there needs to be flexibility to support new representative organisations which may emerge from time to time in areas of need. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee in its report encourages organisations to continue to explore their potential to raise income themselves through various means, including membership fees and subscriptions, publications, sales, fund-raising and corporate sponsorship. Such income should be taken into account and set in funding levels, but without creating disincentives. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall, the Committee found inconsistencies, inadequate accountability and a lack of strategic approach in the past administration of national secretariat funding by the Department of Community Services and Health. The most striking inconsistencies concerned grant amounts, which vary enormously and inequitably. Other specific shortcomings include: a lack of competitive advertised selection process for funding; uncertainty about funding approval from year to year; absence of a review-evaluation process to determine whether continuation of funding is warranted; and inadequate support for seed funded organisations. In part, these problems are due to funding having been provided through two departments and numerous programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's report suggests a framework of funding to supersede the previous ad hoc approach. This has the following elements: firstly, equitable distribution of national secretariat funding between the community needs addressed by the Department's programs; secondly, separate funding of organisations representing consumers and non-profit service providers where necessary, although combined organisations are preferable; and, thirdly, three categories to define the roles of organisations and determine the level of funding they require. These are: summit organisations, which have a leadership and coordination role across a range of areas; umbrella organisations, which represent broad constituencies in particular program areas; and satellite organisations, which are concerned with a specific issue. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the Committee's priorities is to ensure that only organisations which are authentic representatives of broad community constituencies are supported. Organisations should, therefore, satisfy certain requirements. They should have democratic election processes; be controlled by an elected governing body and executive rather than by paid secretariat staff; have good, regular communication between the membership and leadership; and avoid fixed political allegiances. </PARA>
<PARA> In examining funding arrangements, the Committee concluded that a major overhaul is needed. In particular, secretariat funding needs to be isolated from funding for programs and projects and there should be standard, indexed funding levels with limited scope for variations. </PARA>
<PARA> The main cost item is salaries. The model recommended by the Committee allows for an executive officer plus a maximum of six staff for summit organisations, an executive officer plus three staff for umbrella organisations, and one full or part-time employee plus secretarial assistance for satellite organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> To give organisations some security for planning and staffing, funding should be approved for several years at a time. The Committee has suggested four years. Terms will be punctuated by annual accountability requirements and a major evaluation towards the end to determine whether funding should continue or cease. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Committee has recommended the consolidation of the existing seed funding program. Funding is provided for several years to enable the organisation to become financially self-sufficient. This is an excellent cost-effective way to encourage community development. The program needs enhancement in several ways. These are set out in chapter five of the Committee's report, as follows: it should be advertised annually and all new applicants for secretariat funding should apply through this process, including any which may qualify for ongoing funding from the outset; approval should be notified six months in advance; both the timing of approval and the Department's support should be geared to achieving financial self-sufficiency during the funding period; and links with larger, established organisations should be encouraged. </PARA>
<PARA> This inquiry is part of a general process of increasing accountability of expenditure of public funds. Community organisations, as well as government, are coming to terms with greater accountability requirements by developing better ways of measuring performance against stated objectives and defining their roles more clearly. This report aims to assist this process and has been completed in a short time frame to enable its conclusions and recommendations to be taken into account as part of the Budget process for the next financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> The reference was adopted on 24 July 1990, and advertised in all major metropolitan newspapers on 4 August. The Committee received 66 submissions and conducted in Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne public hearings at which 37 organisations gave evidence. It would not have been possible to complete the task in the seven months time frame without the cooperation of the Department of Community Services and Health and, in particular, the assistance of a departmental officer, Mr David Hobbs, whose knowledge of the Department's operations and programs was invaluable. The efforts of the Committee secretary, Bjarne Nordin, and support staff, Shirley Hunter, in the conduct of the inquiry and in ensuring the timely presentation of this report are acknowledged and greatly appreciated. Likewise, I place on record my appreciation of the interest and diligence of the members of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I trust that the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) finds the Committee's report constructive and acts on its recommendations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to commend the Chairman of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs, the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Harry Jenkins), for the time and effort he has put into the report, You have your moments, and commend also the secretariat staff. It was only last Wednesday that we actually approved this report and I am quite surprised to see it so soon presented to the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I hope the recommendations of this report will be taken up because there is a greet need for a greater accountability in the so-called peak organisations-community organisations that receive funding from the Government. Up till now there has been a very ad hoc way of looking at these organisations and they have, in fact, not been subject to any review. The 30 or so peak organisations that have been receiving funding have been going on from year to year and expecting a continuation of that funding. </PARA>
<PARA> If these recommendations are taken into account there will be year by year examinations of the accountability of the organisations plus a four-yearly review of the principles on which they are funded. There should be much more representativeness from the grass roots, as these recommendations include recommendations that the organisations look at their grass root membership and see that has a truly good chance of getting on to the executive and making their voices heard, because one of the dangers that we heard of in these organisations is that the executive itself takes on the responsibility of making decisions and does not necessarily go back to the grass roots to find out what, in fact, the members would like. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also important that the funds that are available from government go to the organisations that need it most. For that reason, included in the recommendations is the suggestion that only those organisations that do not have access to professional funds should get money from the Government. I think everybody would agree that those organisations that have access through their membership, who have large salaries, should not also be getting large funds from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I want to state that I do have disagreements with some of the recommendations in the report and I do not support recommendation 16, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recommends that all grants should be indexed and that they should be indexed against Average Weekly Earnings and the Consumer Price Index for salary and other components respectively.</PARA>
<PARA>We disagree with that. We do not believe that these organisations should be separate from the rest of the community, which does not have this guarantee of being tied to the consumer price index and average weekly earnings. It is locking in organisations with grants. That is not appropriate and, as I said, is not usual for other organisations in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The second recommendation I do not agree with reads:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recommends that adherence to relevant awards should be a requirement for funding and that DCSH should monitor organisations' practices to ensure that award wages are paid.</PARA>
<PARA>We do not agree that this is appropriate for these organisations because sometime in future it may be possible to break the nexus between these types of things. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this House calls on the Government to undertake that in the event that Australia ratifies the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, reservations will be lodged to safeguard the inalienable rights of parents, in particular insofar as those rights concern freedom of expression (Article 12), education (Articles 13 and 28), religion (Article 14), freedom of association (Article 15) and privacy (Article 16). </PARA>
<PARA>Ratification has in fact occurred since this motion was placed on the Notice Paper. This House has been denied the opportunity to debate such a United Nations convention and I am determined to move the motion notwithstanding the fact that the ratification process has been gone through by the Executive. </PARA>
<PARA> Pope John Paul II once said that children are, `that precious treasure given to each generation as a challenge to its wisdom and humanity'. Children throughout the world are vulnerable and to a large degree they are powerless. It is for this reason that the international community has worked towards securing increased protection for children. That work started with the Geneva Declaration of 1924 and has recently culminated in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which Australia ratified on 18 December last. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the aims of the convention are quite laudable. Had we been in government we would have ratified the convention, but we would have ratified it with reservations to particular articles of fundamental importance to the interpretation of that convention. There are many people in the community who have real and deep concerns about some aspects of the convention. I would not dismiss those concerns in the contemptible manner in which the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) did on 22 November 1989, when he told the Senate that such concerns constitute `lunatic misapprehensions which seem to be current in certain quarters of the community about the impact of the convention'. The Minister went on to say that he did not want to go into the matter in any detail for that `would only give currency to the crazed loons around the place who have congenital misapprehensions of things, who jump at shadows and spooks'. Given that contemptuous attitude displayed by the Minister it is little wonder that many people continue to have very deep concerns about the convention. The Government has done very little to make out its case in support of the convention. </PARA>
<PARA> Naturally, having read the convention as a whole, we are in favour of many elements that most people, in terms of the behaviour patterns that they cover, would be understandably opposed to-child prostitution, child slavery, et cetera. The aims of the convention, taken overall, are laudable, but there are very real concerns in the minds of many citizens revolving around the whole concept of parental control and parental rights over their children before they reach the state of adulthood. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two issues that I want to address this morning. The first relates to the rights and responsibilities of parents and the second to the relationship between the convention and the external affairs power. These are two contentious issues that are commonly raised by people who do have concerns about the convention. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the first issue. The motion I have moved refers to some specific articles in the convention, namely, article 12, concerning freedom of expression, articles 13 and 28, relating to education, article 14, which deals with religion, article 15, conferring a right of freedom of association, and article 16, concerning the rights of children to privacy. </PARA>
<PARA> These articles need to be read in context with other provisions found in the convention. In this respect, I make particular reference to article 5 and the preamble to the convention which expressly recognises the fundamental importance of the family unit and the rights and responsibilities that all members of the family unit, including parents, have. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at articles 12 to 16, we see that unfortunately those articles have been drafted in a way which fails to give express recognition to the importance of parental rights and responsibilities. Parental rights and responsibilities do receive some recognition, albeit in an implied sense, when one has regard to article 5 and also to the preamble. It is this lack of express recognition or reference which caused the coalition in late 1989 to form the view that ratification should only take place subject to reservations being made against these articles. </PARA>
<PARA> It is fairly normal for governments, in ratifying conventions, if they are concerned about particular elements, to say, `We are in favour of the convention as a whole. We don't want to deny the operation of the laudable aims of the convention, but we have some concerns with particular articles. Therefore we will not only sign and ratify the convention, but express reservations as to particular elements within the convention'. It is not only sensible but it is provided for in international law for governments to ratify in that manner-but not this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Many international reservations give express rights and responsibilities to parents. If we look at education, which is referred to in articles 13 and 28 of the convention, we see that article 26 (3) of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that parents have the `prior right to choose the kind of education that should be given to their children'. Similar expressions are used in principle 7 of the UN Declaration of the Rights of the Child, article 13 (3) of the UN Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and article 18 (4) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, in terms of just looking at the law with greater clarity, it has to be borne in mind that rights contained in various international instruments are, of course, interdependent with each other. There is no earthly good in ratifying a convention which would have in part, if not in total, the opposite effect of other conventions one has ratified. The Government has said to me, on the occasions on which I have raised this matter, `Read the convention as a whole, and if you take it as a whole, everything is all right'. It is not, because there is not express reference in the manner that I have just indicated. Furthermore, there is this conflict between elements of other international conventions and this particular one. </PARA>
<PARA> I stress again that the coalition is in favour of the Government having ratified the convention, but what we have stressed all along is that, where it is abundantly clear that elements of the convention run counter to the fundamental beliefs of most Australians in terms of a parent's right to control the education, et cetera, of their children, then that reservation ought to be entered into where there is a concern, and not glibly passed aside or, indeed, in the phrase that I have mentioned from the Foreign Minister, contemptuously cast aside. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be borne in mind that rights contained in various international instruments are interdependent with each other. Given some of the inconsistencies between the convention and other international instruments, it is simply a matter of common sense that appropriate reservations be made to address such inconsistencies so that the provisions of the convention can be read in the light of other international instruments. </PARA>
<PARA> Appropriate reservations that one would make would be similar to those made by the Holy See when it ratified the convention on 20 April 1990. It, too, was concerned about elements of the convention. It, too, wanted to ratify the convention. It ratified the convention and expressed some reservations. It said that it would interpret-and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Articles of the Convention in a way that safeguards the primary and inalienable rights of parents, in particular insofar as these rights concern education (Articles 13 and 28), religion (Article 14), association with others (Article 15) and privacy (Article 16). </PARA>
<PARA>That is an altogether commonsense and appropriate course of action. Indeed, at one stage it seemed that the Government had in mind making similar reservations. One of the problems in studying the actions of this Government is that it is virtually like a collection of human hiccups: we hear a viewpoint expressed by one Minister countermanded by another-because on 7 November 1990 the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs, Senator Tate, advised the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . when the Australian Government ratifies the convention, should it do so, one would find that those same understandings as to the pre-eminent role of the family would be acknowledged. It would be surprising were that not the case . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister would now have cause to be surprised given that, when Australia did ratify the convention, the Government failed to make the reservations of the type contemplated by the Minister for Justice. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to consider the second issue, namely, what intentions, if any, the Government may have to legislate in areas that fall within the purview of the convention. In mid-1989, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner, Mr Brian Burdekin, wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>It is now clearly established that the external affairs power under the Federal Constitution enables the Federal Parliament to legislate to implement treaty obligations such as those to be provided for by the Convention on the Rights of the Child. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us contrast this statement, which is obviously a cause of concern for many people, with comments made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, in the Senate on 22 November 1989. The Minister claimed:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . no Australian law is in contravention of the provisions of this particular convention . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>It is not my belief that there is any intent at all within the Government to legislate federally on child welfare issues based on the authority that a treaty of this kind would give to it . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the Minister on this occasion for the restraint he has shown in this instance. However, there are many others who do not share the Minister's view that Australian laws conform with the provisions of the treaty. For example, a letter from the Attorney-General's Department dated 21 June 1990 said:</PARA>
<PARA>Preliminary consultations-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, with the States and Territories-</PARA>
<PARA>have revealed laws inconsistent with the terms of the Convention. </PARA>
<PARA>In November 1989, Justice Elizabeth Evatt of the Australian Law Reform Commission indicated that, in order to bring Australia's laws into basic conformity with the convention, it may be necessary for legislative action to be taken in many areas, including family law, marriage, children's legal services, social security and adoption. That was in November 1989 and I suspect, in pointing to these areas, Justice Evatt had in mind that Federal and State parliaments should, prior to ratification, review their laws and, where necessary, make changes in order to ensure that prior to ratification Australian laws conform with the provisions of the convention. That was certainly the practice adopted in my time as Minister for Foreign Affairs but, as we all know, it is not uncommon for this Government to first ratify and then to legislate. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a very sensitive issue to some. We in the Opposition have been in favour of ratification, but with the reservations referred to. I have to say on this issue that the Government has been arrogant in its pursuit of ratification and delinquent in not expressing reservations. Such reservations would have been proper; such reservations would have clarified the inconsistencies I have referred to with other international instruments; and such reservations would have underlined a proper concern for parental rights. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), both in his speech and in moving the motion, is seeking to play to an audience of fear and ignorance. It may be that in the twilight of his political career he is reverting to a well tried and tested approach to politics which he learned in his youth in this place during the 1960s, when fear politics dominated the national Parliament. In his speech he referred to various conventions and issues but seldom actually referred to the document the subject of the motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I propose to deal with a number of those clauses he referred to and to set in context those matters that he has in his motion taken out of context. The question of the opportunities and rights of children not only in Australia but also throughout the world is an important issue. The honourable member referred in passing to the preamble. The preamble is important because it sets the tone and the basis upon which all subsequent articles should be read and interpreted. It is worth quoting two sections of the preamble, which clearly put in context those matters that the honourable member for Kooyong has sought to misrepresent:</PARA>
<PARA>Convinced that the family, as the fundamental group of society and the natural environment for the growth and well-being of all of its members and particularly children, should be afforded the necessary protection and assistance so that it can fully assume its responsibilities within the community. </PARA>
<PARA>Recognising that the child, for the full and harmonious development of his or her personality, should grow up in a family environment, in an atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding. </PARA>
<PARA>Those clauses from the preamble clearly give a commitment to the overriding importance of the family as the basis upon which development and protection of the child should occur. Not only has this view been adopted by the Australian Government but it has also been unanimously endorsed by the countries of the world. Within Australia it has received the endorsement of groups involved in church and welfare activity. Let me refer to just a couple. In May 1990 the Age reported the endorsement by the Catholic bishops of the United Nations convention. On 7 May the Age reported:</PARA>
<PARA>The Roman Catholic bishops' conference yesterday strongly recommended that Australia ratify the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The bishops, who are holding their biannual conference in Sydney, expressed `wholehearted support' for recent international moves to overcome abuse of children's rights, including cruelty to and torture of children and the forced separation of families, especially refugees. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the very point of the United Nations convention: it sets out to protect children in less advantaged situations, not only in relatively wealthy countries such as our own but also in those poorer nations of the world where the rights of the young are ignored and abused. But it was not just the Catholic bishops who held that view. The Uniting Church issued a statement earlier in November 1989. The President of the Uniting Church, Sir Ronald Wilson, welcomed the United Nations convention and he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Convention gives strong support to all countries of the world in their efforts to protect children from sexual exploitation, physical abuse or separation from parents. </PARA>
<PARA>As a church leader of some renown in this country, he urged the Government to sign the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. In May 1990 we had not signed, and Sir Ronald Wilson again went to the press. On 9 May the Age reported:</PARA>
<PARA> Sir Ronald, a former High Court judge, who is also national president of the Uniting Church, attacked the `misinformation' spread by groups opposed to the convention . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is that misinformation that the honourable member for Kooyong is peddling here today. He is seeking to play on that misinformation and the concerns within the community which that misinformation has generated. On 9 May Sir Ronald Wilson criticised the Australian Government for not having signed the convention. So we have both the Uniting Church and the Catholic bishops very early in the piece supporting the convention and urging the Australian Government to become a signatory to it. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the convention, firstly, enshrines the pre-eminent role and responsibility of families, and, secondly, makes clear some basic principles upon which the rearing of children, their rights in a civilised community, should be protected. </PARA>
<PARA> It has not been just the Commonwealth Government that has been involved in this process; the States have all been consulted throughout the development of this convention. As the honourable member for Kooyong knows only too well, that convention has been developed over a 10-year period. An entire decade was devoted to the discussion and development of those principles that were unanimously adopted by the United Nations. Every State of Australia was involved in those consultations with the Commonwealth. Every State of Australia agreed that the convention should be supported. I believe that at the time that included a National Party State government in my State of Queensland-a National Party government which was not all that well renowned for respecting civil liberties. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, of course, many other aspects of the convention which clearly demonstrate the protection afforded to children, but in a sensible and controlled manner. There are too many for me to refer to here. I thought I would illustrate just a couple. It might be best if I start with those that the motion specifically refers to. The honourable member for Kooyong has referred to articles 13, 14, 15 and 16. I want to refer to a couple of those because the same sorts of safeguards are built into each of them. Article 13 deals with the child's right to freedom of expression. The very next sentence, which the honourable member for Kooyong failed to relate to the House, says:</PARA>
<PARA>The exercise of this right may be subject to certain restrictions . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It then lists the restrictions, which are:</PARA>
<PARA>For respect of the rights or reputations of others;</PARA>
<PARA>and the next one, which is important:</PARA>
<PARA>For the protection of national security or of public order, or of public health or morals. </PARA>
<PARA>I, along with many people in this chamber, have received letters of concern and phone calls from constituents who believe that the moral upbringing of their children is somehow put at risk by this United Nations convention. Nothing could be further from the truth, for this convention protects those very rights. In selectively quoting and dealing with the United Nations convention, the honourable member for Kooyong and those who have adopted his position in this debate ignore the safeguards that are built in and ignore the intention of the convention to adequately protect the interests of the young people of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, as I said, many countries that have signed endorsement of the United Nations convention. At my last look at the records, 130 nations had endorsed it. They include, just to mention a few, Canada, France, Greece, Israel, Italy, Japan, New Zealand and the United Kingdom. I select those because in some respects they have cultures and backgrounds similar to our own, and in some respects they have governments of a far more conservative persuasion, and in some cases a strongly religious persuasion. Yet each of those countries has signed the convention without qualification, because they understand, as the honourable member for Kooyong should, the intention of the convention and realise the safeguards which have been built into it. </PARA>
<PARA> The other clause which it is important to place on the record is article 5 of the convention, which again restates the importance of the family. Article 5 says:</PARA>
<PARA> States parties shall respect the responsibilities, rights and duties of parents or, where applicable, the members of the extended family . . . as provided for by local custom, legal guardians or other persons legally responsible for the child, to provide, in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child, appropriate direction and guidance in the exercise by the child of the rights recognized in the present Convention. </PARA>
<PARA>That is important because it refers to parental control being provided in a manner consistent with the evolving capacities of the child. I have had people come to me who say that signing this convention will mean that their 13-year-old teenagers will be able to walk the streets, go down Kings Cross, go to whatever shows they like, and do whatever they may wish to do, without any intervention on the part of parents, because this somehow gives them that right. It is a nonsense to suggest that-for two very important reasons. First, the existing laws of the country and the States do not allow it. For any of these things to have an impact, we all know in this place that the laws must first be changed by due process in this Parliament. That is a matter which has been overlooked by those opposite. Secondly, it is nonsense because the convention very expressly points out that it is according to the `evolving capacities of the child'. That is clearly left to the states parties to the agreement to determine. </PARA>
<PARA> Nowhere in the United Nations document can one draw evidence to sustain the quite erroneous and mischievous arguments that the honourable member for Kooyong has put today and which those pursuing that line have peddled throughout the country in recent months. In putting their view, those opposite should talk to the Bishops Conference and the Uniting Church and explain their perverted view of the United Nations convention because it is not a view shared by those religious bodies, nor is it one shared by the rest of the world-certainly the 130 nations which have signed the convention, most without qualification. </PARA>
<PARA> But for the restrictions of time, I could quote chapter and verse other sections of the convention which include similar riders as to the rights that, on reading selectively, might be misinterpreted as giving children some claim over and above the authority of parents and the laws of the state. But I think I have illustrated adequately in the clauses to which I have referred the fact that the convention is designed to enshrine the role of the family. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to say in conclusion that this motion and the debate which has been fostered around it are mischievous. They play to an audience of ill-informed but honest and caring parents. In talking to those honest and caring parents, I am distressed to witness their anguish caused by this mischievous debate. The mover of this motion is, by his actions today in the Parliament, in the same class as those scaremongers who, out of ignorance or malice, misrepresent the United Nations, this convention and the Australian Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion moved by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) which seeks to ensure that the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child safeguards the inalienable rights and responsibilities of parents. In particular, the coalition's concern relates to articles 12, 13 and 28, 14, 15 and 16 which refer respectively to the freedom in expression, education, religion, association and privacy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I had the opportunity to attend the forty-fourth session of the United Nations General Assembly as one of two parliamentary advisers. It was at this forty-fourth session that the Convention on the Rights of the Child was adopted. It was the culmination of 10 years of debate, compromise and effort to establish a standard in the field of human rights, in this instance, children's rights. </PARA>
<PARA> The United Nations (UN) has many failings. We can question its cost, its lumbering bureaucracy, the loss of impact as it strives for consensus, its frequent interference in matters of a domestic nature and its selectiveness of action, particularly in relation to breaches of human rights. We can be concerned that since its formation in 1945, its political make-up has not favoured the democratic private enterprise philosophy that many of us in Australia pursue. </PARA>
<PARA> On this point I note that this session of the UN corresponded to a period of rapid and extreme change in eastern Europe, where people in Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria repudiated their communist regimes and where the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics changed its approach to the United States and her allies. Such radical changes will no doubt bring significant changes to voting patterns and the range of issues pursued. The recent stance of the United Nations in relation to the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq is the first major example of this and provides the UN with a real opportunity to exert a positive role in the area of disarmament, removing oppression and peacekeeping. </PARA>
<PARA> It is difficult for most of us living in Australia to comprehend the concerns expressed by the members of the United Nations at the forty-fourth assembly at the horrible abuse of children in many parts of the world. This convention therefore was not born out of a desire for some sinister form of social engineering, as some attempt to destroy our moral fibre and standards or some insane attempt to reduce personal responsibility or initiative to mediocrity. It was born out of a genuine desire to eradicate the exploitation of children in so many countries where children are treated as no more than chattels, countries where some children are maimed so that they will be physically more conducive to begging, countries where young children of 12 and 13 years of age are sent to war, countries where young girls or eight and nine are forced into prostitution, countries where children are sold for human organ transplants and countries where poverty and child labour offends basic human dignity. </PARA>
<PARA> I can understand the concerns of parents in Australia who have watched the decline of the family in Australia at policies they believe promote an anti-child, anti-family mentality. I can also understand the concerns of the community at the growth of social counselling services, most of which operate with integrity and compassion, but with some who become social detectives with a capacity for overriding and interfering with parents' legitimate and responsible controls and discipline within the family. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I am appalled at the false information which has filtered around the network of our community scaring parents and offending the truth on this issue. One of the most extreme and silly suggestions that we have heard is that the convention will even stop parents removing smelly socks or stale lunches from children's schoolbags. I particularly wish to refer to an advertisement placed through a large number of newspapers in my electorate during the last election campaign. I wish particularly to refer to those articles of the convention on which this concern is expressed. For example, this advertisement reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Parents are not allowed to place any restrictions on what a child sees, reads, hears, is taught at school or experiences in any way. </PARA>
<PARA>It refers to article 13, and I wish to read that from the convention:</PARA>
<PARA>The child shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of the child's choice. </PARA>
<PARA>But it has a second clause. That second clause says:</PARA>
<PARA>The exercise of this right may be subject to certain restrictions, but these shall only be such as are provided by law and are necessary:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) For respect of the rights or reputations of others; or</PARA>
<PARA>(b) For the protection of national security or of public order, or of public health or morals. </PARA>
<PARA>I also refer to another point in this particular article:</PARA>
<PARA>Parents are not allowed to influence in any way a child's view of morality or religion. </PARA>
<PARA>We can go to article 15 of the convention to see what it does say, and it says:</PARA>
<PARA>States Parties recognise the rights of the child to freedom of association and to freedom of peaceful assembly. </PARA>
<PARA>Part 2 says:</PARA>
<PARA>No restrictions may be placed on the exercise of these rights other than those imposed in conformity with the law-</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise `our law'-</PARA>
<PARA>and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, public order, the protection of public health or morals, or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. </PARA>
<PARA>It is this type of misinterpretation or acceptance without question that inhibits, in this country, rational debate and understanding of this sensitive issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition, I believe, and in particular the honourable member for Kooyong have rightly expressed reservations about the interpretation of this convention. My colleague, as I said, has explained these. The family is a network, and a fundamental group in society. It is the unit where children are best nurtured, loved, given affection, develop good relationships and learn how to participate in that society. The family in law has prior rights over any State laws, including those domestic laws enacted as a result of an international agreement. This law cannot be too strong, as breach of that law and errors in the exercise of that law have produced isolated but tragic outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, however, two dangers with the convention which I wish to emphasise in conclusion. Firstly, the ratification of this convention must not become a cover-up for the neglect of children at home or abroad. I have already mentioned some policies which many people consider promote anti-child and anti-family mentalities. Each of us would classify within our own views many of these. </PARA>
<PARA> On the overseas front we see some paradox-some would say hypocrisy-that in a year of the ratifying of the Convention of the Rights of the Child, we have seen overseas aid has been slashed by this Government by $98m. At the same time the Government has increased grants to some dubious international groups, through the United Nations, which support unacceptable population control programs and gross violations of human rights. Secondly, there is the issue of misinterpretation by enthusiastic social engineers, by United Nations monitoring committees, or even, at times, by our own judicial system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government takes the view that Australian laws conform with this convention, with the exception of article 37(C) and its requirement that child and adult criminal offenders be imprisoned separately. Accordingly, Australia has, quite rightly, lodged a reservation to article 37(C). In light of the fact that the Government believes that Australian laws are consistent with the convention it is not envisaged that there will be any changes to domestic laws as a result of ratification. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that the convention provides that parties may make reservations at the time of ratification. The coalition has always maintained that before Australia ratified the convention appropriate reservations should be made in order to expressly respect the rights and responsibilities of parents. I believe that the time has come when this Parliament should have a greater role, particularly in regard to some of these important conventions which cause concern in the community. I believe such conventions should be debated more fully within our parliamentary process before ratification takes place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the few minutes left in this debate on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child I will also try to allay some of those fears expressed by the Opposition today. Some of the misleading statements made in the community since the convention was first mooted concern me greatly. It is a disgrace that in some quarters this has been done to play politics more than anything else. I doubt very much that those honourable members opposite, if in government, would not accept the convention as it stands.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Like other members of this House, I am sure, I have a great respect for the family unit in our society. The family unit is something we have argued in favour of for many years. For example, one important aspect of industrial relations is the provision of proper standards and conditions for people in the work place. When we look at the history of the trade union movement over many, many years we see that it has done a lot to protect families; parents have more opportunities to spend time with their children, and children are not forced into slave labour-as was the case before the trade union movement hit its straps. We see that honourable members opposite now wish to try to erode many of the tremendous things the trade union movement has developed over many years to protect the rights of individuals. </PARA>
<PARA> I was concerned this morning to hear the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) stating on radio what the Opposition would do if, by some great tragedy, it were ever returned to the government benches. Fortunately for the Australian people, I cannot ever see that happening with some of the policies the Opposition is planning at the moment. The very things that the honourable member talked about on radio represented an attack on our families and, of course, the rights of the children in those families. When he talks about trading seven days a week, 24 hours a day, we realise that the people who would really suffer would be the individuals and their families. I think it would be of great concern to us all if that were ever to happen. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the important matters overlooked in this debate is article 5 of the convention. That article is extremely important because the pre-eminent role of the family is recognised. Indeed, the Australian delegation to the United Nations can take pride in the fact that article 5 of the convention was actually inserted at its initiative. This article confirms the overriding role of parents in the development of children and their right and responsibility to provide direction and guidance to children in the exercise of the rights set out in the convention. </PARA>
<PARA> It is often forgotten that we do not own our children; we are probably only loaned our children for a short time. They are always a great source of enjoyment to us. They are not a chattel, as the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher) mentioned before; certainly not. Children are individuals and have rights. We as parents have the obligation to look after them and to try to guide them in the best way we can. In no way is that inveighed against in article 5. Certainly it is not the case that parents can think they own their children. Effectively, they are only on loan to us. It is our right, our responsibility more so, to bring the children up in a society that we believe is a good place for us all to live in. Certainly the convention in no way attacks that responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Two errors have been floundering around in this debate. Firstly, there is the failure to apply correctly the rules of the treaty interpretation that are set out in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which Australia ratified in 1974 and which actually came into force internationally on 27 January 1980, when the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) was in fact the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Of course, the second error is a failure to apply correctly the basic rules of construction of the English language. Those two aspects have been misconstrued throughout this whole debate. </PARA>
<PARA> I realise that I have run out of time, but I have welcomed the opportunity to say something about this matter today and to oppose the motion put forward by the honourable member for Kooyong. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this House:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) is concerned at the enormous growth in the amount of goods stolen from private homes and the apparent failure of police forces to uncover the disposal networks which clearly must exist; and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) calls on the Minister for Justice to establish a special Commonwealth/State task force drawn from the various law enforcement organisations to carry out a comprehensive investigation into the movement of, and subsequent disposal of, the extremely large amounts of goods being stolen from private homes. </PARA>
<PARA>My purpose in moving this motion is to draw attention to the need for far greater levels of resources-and that may mean additional resources allocated to police forces-to be devoted to combating the extraordinarily high incidence, and very low recovery rate, of goods which are stolen, mainly from residential dwellings, in Australia. Unfortunately, statistics are normally a couple of years old when one gets to them, but the statistics for the breaking and entering of dwellings are alarming, to say the least. Ten per cent of the population of Australia are affected by break-ins; something like 1,700 to 1,800 dwellings per 100,000 were broken into in 1988-89. The volume of goods being stolen is enormous. We all hear of minor break-ins where a few valuables are stolen, but an increasing number of break-ins involve the removal from the property of almost its entire contents-a furniture van has pulled up at the house and, in broad daylight, every item in the house has been removed. </PARA>
<PARA> Thousands and thousands of tonnes of household goods, ranging from clothing to television sets to jewellery, are being stolen every week. This cannot be disposed of through non-organised marketing; there are just not sufficient outlets without a proper sequence of events from the person who has committed the break-in to the person who is really making the profits-that is, the person who is fencing and disposing of the stolen goods. </PARA>
<PARA> These are not the sorts of items one will find resold in shops and they certainly are not disposed of, as rumour would have it, at a table in the pub or across the bar. They are being disposed of professionally by networks that are organised for that purpose and that are targeting areas for break-ins and robberies. Accompanying this is a growing degree of violence. For instance, recent headlines in the Canberra Times indicate that there has been a trebling of the incidence of violence and juvenile break-ins in the Australian Capital Territory-not one of the more deprived communities in our society. </PARA>
<PARA> In some parts of Australia, the premium on insurance paid by every householder merely to cover dwelling break-ins is now in excess of $50 a year. Police resources in large numbers are devoted to traffic violations usually of a relatively minor nature, because nowadays traffic violations tend to mean exceeding the speed limit and nothing else, where there is an automatic fund raising exercise for the various State governments. Police resources are also devoted to operations against drugs. I do not disagree with that: however, marijuana operations seem to take up an enormous amount of resources. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a need to deal with the crime which affects the majority of the community in the most difficult way. Those people who have had their homes broken into feel a very significant psychological effect. It is a personal thing. Whilst the difficulty of detection or prevention of individual break-ins is extremely difficult-we just cannot have armies of police going up and down every street- the disposal of the goods that are stolen, given the volume and nature of those goods, should at least be capable of being dealt with. There can be no doubt that the disposal networks have to be highly profitable, highly organised commercial organisations, probably posing as legitimate business. </PARA>
<PARA> Some statistics that I have been able to find-unfortunately, a lot is confidential-indicate that in 1989 burglaries accounted for property valued at $1.2 billion. In anyone's language, that is a very big business and, I would suggest, a highly profitable one. The number of convictions, and the rate of recovery, is extraordinarily low. In fact, it rarely achieves a level above 10 per cent of the total, which means that burglary is not only a highly profitable crime, particularly for those who do not actually carry out the break-ins but sit in the background and collect the money-that seems to be the nature of criminal activities-but is also a criminal activity which has a very low risk of detection. </PARA>
<PARA> Again using figures a couple of years old-and they probably have not changed materially-the number of break-ins of dwellings which have resulted in convictions is well below 10 per cent. If one considers the sentences that are imposed and the way in which the court goes about hearing cases of burglary, one could get the impression that some sections of the courts believe that it is a social ill, not a crime. If someone arrives at their home after having been away for a day and finds that because the burglars could not get the carpets up they are left but everything else has been stolen or carted away-their wedding presents-and the things that they value have been destroyed as a result of the burglars looking for more valuable goods, then that is a personal crime of great magnitude to that individual. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask that the level of resources be increased and that a coordinated task force, and there may well be one in existence, of Commonwealth and State police be devoted to seeking the outlets, the people who buy the goods and encourage the theft-the Mr Bigs. I suggest that to do that adequately there will have to be special funds made available and the Commonwealth will have to contribute. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate: one in 100 Australians will have their homes robbed this year. On average they will lose more than $1,000-I think the figure is $4,000-worth of goods. Some will be totally wiped out. Every Australian will pay at least $50 extra insurance because of this. It is not too much to make a special effort, because theft and burglary affect far more Australians than some of the more publicised areas of police activity-areas to which a great deal more funding is devoted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) is anxious to speak, but he will get his chance in due course. I hope the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) does not think that I am gunning for him because I happen to be speaking on his second private member's motion in a week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not think that someone whose house has not been burgled can really appreciate the magnitude of the problems caused by crimes such as burglary. My wife Cate and I were in that unfortunate situation about 18 months ago, and it is a fairly sickening experience. I know it took Cate quite a long time to get over it, and we did not have much to knock off. I suppose in that respect we were luckier than others. To be subjected to that is a sickening and frightening experience. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Corio said, one in 100 is a very frightening figure. I spent three-quarters of my former life in the courts; and a not inconsiderable time was spent representing people who allegedly or actually had been involved in crimes such as burglary. I do not disagree with the honourable member's motion, but I think it contains a touch of motherhood, and I do not think it really addresses the key issues involved. The honourable member has sought to dissociate drugs from the crimes referred to in his motion, and I would suggest that from my experience--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Scholes" NAMEID="5J4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XT4">Mr RONALDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate that, but drugs are very much an integral part of this social crime, as I think it is probably best described. I do not believe personally that there is an organised network that disposes of a large percentage of household burglary items; they are disposed of in hotels or retained for personal use. To some extent there is a circuit within which those goods are disposed, whether or not it is highly organised, and its members certainly do not come before the courts. That probably supports the motion of the honourable member for Corio when he says that these people are not coming before the courts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think we should appreciate that there are a large number of factors in this. I do not disagree with the honourable member's statements or with the motion as such, but I think we should have a look at the situation in Victoria, for example. The honourable member for Corio is a Victorian; what we are seeing in Victoria at the moment is a sad and sorry sight. The reality is that we can set a task force up; it might come back with a report, go through the House and we will all say, `Hear, hear!'. But, in the end, what really comes out of it? What will be achieved? What I would like to see achieved is what is not happening in Victoria at the moment. The honourable member for Burke will no doubt address this in due course. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the situation in Victoria. We have had a litany of lies and broken promises about the level of policing from Victorian Labor Party Ministers, one of them being Mr Crabb. When Minister Crabb had the job some time ago-I do not know whether he still has the job now-the big claim was that Victoria would have 10,000 police. There are approximately 9,200 police in Victoria at the moment. This was to be the big goal-increase the police numbers and we will save the State. Like so much that has happened in Victoria over the last 12 months, it is lies and further lies. What was claimed has quite simply not happened. </PARA>
<PARA> Take Ballarat, for example. This will horrify you, Mr Deputy Speaker. On the night shift in Ballarat, there are a sergeant, six men and two divisional vans. Do honourable members know the area that they potentially cover? The honourable member for Burke and the honourable member for Corio will know the area that I am talking about. Those police go as far as Beaufort, Skipton, Ballan, Clunes and Lexton. </PARA>
<PARA> I invite honourable members to get out a map of Victoria, look at where those areas are and talk about this motion. Let us talk about what the real problems are. The real problem is that the police in Victoria quite simply cannot get within a bull's roar of solving the problems that the honourable member for Corio has addressed, problems that I fully concur exist. It is an absolute disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA> We have in Ballarat a mini brawl van. Over the last 12 months, there were a large number of trainees in Ballarat. I am sure that they were just put there to calm the troops down for a while. When they were there, the mini brawl van was in use. At the moment, it is sitting idle at night. A sergeant, six people and two divisional vans in an area the size of Ballarat! Mr Max Burnett, who lives in my electorate, is a member of SOLO-that is, Supporters of Law and Order. This is not some right wing organisation, but a group of people who are genuinely concerned about the level of their security. </PARA>
<PARA> Twelve months ago some idiot was trying to break into the house of one of my former legal colleagues. The man breaking in was potentially violent. My colleague, at home with his wife and three children, was told when he rang the police that potentially it would be an hour before someone was there-an hour! Here was this fellow at the front door ripping the fly wire screen off, and my colleague was told that it was going to be an hour before someone got there. </PARA>
<PARA> This motion looks good on paper. I do not disagree with it. But let us get down to the root cause of the problem-to the reasons why there are these enormous crimes and to the significance of the number of crimes being committed. There quite simply is not significant police membership in Victoria. The situation is deteriorating. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to say that after the recently negotiated pay rise-which, mind you, will take 18 months to come into effect-at least we have seen a reversal of the trend. In 1990, 800 recruits were inducted, but there were also 457 resignations and 81 retirements. The Police Academy, the organisation that is training future members of our police force, was closed last year from September until January. The Academy was closed! The homes of a hundred people will be burgled-and that is just the tip of the criminal iceberg-yet the Academy was closed for in excess of three months. I think that is an absolute disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest to the honourable member for Corio that having moved his motion he go back to Premier Kirner in Victoria and say, `Premier, let's do something about the police numbers in this State. Let's get serious about crime prevention'. I will be bitterly disappointed if the honourable member for Corio is not on the front page of the Herald-Sun tomorrow as having attacked Premier Kirner for not doing something about this. If he is genuinely concerned about the problem, as I am sure he is, that is where he will be directing his attention. </PARA>
<PARA> I will support this motion, and I am sure that the honourable members on this side of the House will also support it. But if we are really serious about addressing this extremely important problem, we are going to have to do something about police numbers. My colleague the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), a former policeman-and a very good one too, they tell me-I am sure will address this question further. He is also an excellent member of this House. </PARA>

In my electorate, there is an area called Wendouree-and the honourable member for Burke will know the Wendouree area. People in that area have been trying now for in excess of five years to get an increased police presence. It is a rapidly growing area; it has a significant crime rate, as exists right across Ballarat; and the people have pleaded with the Labor Government to do something about it. But their pleas constantly fall on deaf ears. The Government is not prepared to do anything about Wendouree; it is not prepared to do anything about the state of the police force in Ballarat; and it is not prepared to do anything about the state of the police force in Victoria generally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am running out of time and I want to give my colleagues the opportunity to speak further on this matter. But let us start looking at the root cause of the crimes, the abhorrent crimes, that the honourable member for Corio has quite rightly indicated, both in his motion and in the matters he has raised before the House today.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. I have only about 30 seconds, not the 10 hours which I would need to talk about broken promises from the Victorian Labor Party. There was a promise of one extra sergeant and six permanent men for the Camp Street police station; one additional divisional van; a brawl van, which is sitting there idle at night; an increase in the neighbourhood rural watch program-what better way to address the question of hideous social crimes than to have a rural network, a community network, to stop these people; and the establishment of a police-in-school involvement program. All these promises have been broken; it goes on and on and on. I agree with the honourable member for Corio, but let us see how serious he and his Party are about addressing the real cause of the problem he is referring to.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had intended to speak in support of the motion and I will do so, I guess, in a rather analytical and statistical way. But I suddenly find myself embraced in a debate with the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) over a number of quite spurious claims that he has just made, which I will address myself to in a moment. First of all, I want to say that I am seconding the motion of the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) because I want to add at least my own perspective to this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I agree that there has been an increase in the number of break-ins and thefts from homes, but it is a trend that is not new. It is a trend that has been with us for many years and is almost an endemic part of the problem of crime in society. One myth, though, that does exist and is commonly perpetrated about this-and to an extent I think the honourable member for Ballarat ought to give some thought to this-is that this is all in some way caused by the drug problem. Much of the information coming through from police and other evidence is that in fact housebreaking and stealing and the organised nature of that-and I do not use that term in the terms of organised crime and Mr Bigs and that kind of thing, but the organised and structured way by which goods are stolen and then fenced off-is, in fact, not drug related, but is simply the result of a professional approach to housebreaking and stealing. In many instances we hear this myth that somehow it is crazed druggies running around and breaking into people's homes. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it needs to be understood that, if it is a professional and organised structure, then it requires professional and organised structures to deal with it. For as long as police have been chasing criminals, we in the parliaments of the world have been asking why do they not have more success in these fields. I would put to honourable members that it is because the traditional forms of policing just simply are not able to cope with these kinds of trends without added weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the weapons that have now been added to the police armoury are very significant. They include moves to the money trail and to the freezing of assets-the ability, in other words, to have a look at the financial affairs of people who are making quite substantial sums of money illegitimately. Those records are there and, through the Government's cash transactions legislation and the proceeds of crime legislation that is now starting to evolve in each of the States-I notice that the honourable member for Corio has strongly suggested that there be Commonwealth-State task forces established-these issues can be further examined and moved on. </PARA>
<PARA> I can advise the honourable member, through my experience on the parliamentary committee which oversees the National Crime Authority, that there are in fact-and the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) concurs with me-Commonwealth-State task forces being arranged in a number of areas. I have no doubt that they will reveal some quite strange techniques going on around the place to actually launder and dispose of the proceeds of crime. I think this issue is much more sophisticated than the honourable member for Ballarat might otherwise feel. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I want to go to, though, what I think is at the root cause of all this. The honourable member for Ballarat gave his litany of problems in the region including not enough police numbers-and I do not deny that in Victoria that is a problem, as it probably is in most States. But here I think is where we come to the essential difference between ourselves and the Opposition. In one of my capacities in this Parliament I am a member of the Prime Minister's country task force. That task force moves around Australia talking to people in all different forums and, for at least the last two years, the message has been coming through very clearly to me that there is no more fat in the system and there is no more scope to cut the public sector and the provision of services. </PARA>
<PARA> So, when honourable members on the opposite side of the House come in here and call for an extra $3 billion or $4 billion to be cut from public sector expenditure, what they are really talking about is money for police services, for hospital services, and for schools. Any council we talk to will tell us it does not even have any money for roads. If honourable members opposite accept there is no more fat in the system and yet they come in here and bleat, as they have, about declining police numbers-although at the same time they come in here and say they will cut more money from the public sector-then we have to say: what about these services that honourable members opposite bleat about? Are they talking about transferring money from somewhere else for those services? There is the signal. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in a question, I think it was, to the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe), representing the Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson, described the Government as having a $30 billion welfare budget. I presume, because that is the biggest area of spending, that that welfare budget is where a lot of this money is going to come from. Obviously it is not going to come from police, and it is not going to come from schools and road funds and all these other things that honourable members opposite bleat about. What is the major component of the welfare budget? As they describe it, it is pension payments to retirees, to pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> Ordinary age pensioners are now being described as welfare recipients. So when Opposition members tell the public that a coalition government would cut taxes and government sector expenditure, in a country that already is the third lowest tax paying nation in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, they will have to tell the public that some of the services that government provides will have to be dispensed with, and they will continually be asked which services will be cut. </PARA>
<PARA> This motion draws attention to the problem and recommends that further resources be given to the police and the law enforcement networks to do something about what appears to be an increasing trend in housebreaking and crime. I have no problems with that. However, I ask the House: if it is perceived that increasing police resources is the way to tackle crime, who will pay for it? Obviously it becomes a legitimate part of the tax mix of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Opposition members are very keen to jump up in the debate and make a great play of law and order and the need for more police. That is fine, but they should tell the House where the money will come from. They are the ones who run the debate that too much money is spent in the public sector. They are the ones who want to see more expenditure on defence, more on police, more on this and that, so they should explain where the money will come from to increase these resources. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the claims of the broken promises of the State Labor Government in respect of police resources, in my home town we would love to have more police officers, but where will the money come from and who will pay for them? If Opposition members believe there is more fat in the system and that we can cull some of that fat and find the money to pay it that way, they should identify it. We do not hear too much of that any more. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not hear of Opposition members visiting country councils and telling them there will be no money for roads. I am sure that at least once a week the honourable member for Ballarat tells the councils in his electorate that they should be getting more money for roads, hospitals, police and school teachers but that they will not have to pay more taxes and in fact a Liberal government would cut more money out of the system. That is a nonsense position, a position of populist cant. I am sorry that the honourable member for Corio found himself moving this motion, which is a good one and has substance. He is prepared to say that of course there need to be resources and there needs to be a tax mix to pay for that. </PARA>
<PARA> In their opportunism in supporting the motion those opposite go on with this sort of cant. Let me ask whoever will follow me in the debate-perhaps the honourable member for Moore-to address himself to the question of where in the Opposition's proposal for big cuts in expenditure does the money come from to provide the resources that it says we need. </PARA>

<PARA>The policeman's lot is not a happy one--</PARA>
<PARA> Happy one. </PARA>
<PARA>Those who are fans of Gilbert and Sullivan will recall that particular segment from the sergeant's song in the Pirates of Penzance. In speaking to the motion-and I notice I have a very brief time in which to do so-I wish to say that I have no doubt as to the sincerity of the mover of the motion. I have no doubt that in moving the motion he was acting on behalf of many of his constituents who have been plagued by the terrible, rising increase in crime and criminal behaviour all around the country. </PARA>
<PARA> I must point out why, in relation to this motion, the Government is not sincere in the fight against crime. In the legislation before the House in the present session, the Government has introduced a substantial impediment to the objective of recovering stolen property through its Crimes (Investigation of Commonwealth Offences) Amendment Bill, to which I will refer again later. First let me have a quick look at the motion itself. Clause (1) states:</PARA>
<PARA>is concerned at the enormous growth in the amount of goods stolen from private homes and the apparent failure of police forces to uncover the disposal networks which clearly must exist;</PARA>
<PARA>If we consider this to be factual, and I have no reason to disbelieve the statement, we must ask ourselves, as one famous television professor used to say: why is this so?</PARA>
<PARA> First of all, let us look to the past, to past behaviour, in relation to the question of the disposal of stolen property. In the past, to a large extent stolen property was disposed of locally. In the past there was less sophistication in the level of criminal behaviour; there was less criminal intellect, let us say. There was less mobility of criminal offenders and, above all at that time, it was less lucrative because people had less valuable disposable property to steal in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> There was less emphasis on the rights and the interests of the offender vis-a-vis the victim, and we can all see the sort of Marxian view of society where the criminal offender is seen as a victim rather than the perpetrator of evil or wrongdoing. In the past there was a greater fear of detection by police and a greater fear of the prospect for proper punishment. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the present. There is no doubt today that offenders are more mobile in committing offences. They are often mobile in stolen vehicles-there has been an enormous increase in the theft of motor vehicles. I can give the House a personal example from my days as a police constable in the Western Australian Police Force. We arrested two juveniles for stealing a car, having chased them through a pine plantation in which they half wrecked the motor vehicle. One of them was on the floor operating the pedals, the other one was standing on the seat operating the steering wheel and the gears. When they went before the Perth Children's Court the next day they were let off with almost no punishment whatsoever. One of the two then proceeded to steal a car in the car park of the Perth Children's Court and went home. I believe that particular person was identified in a photograph in the West Australian newspaper during that time when a very observant photographer with a telephoto lens took a picture of him stealing a car in the car park of the West Australian newspaper or close by. </PARA>
<PARA> There is more sophistication in crime today. The high unemployment created by the present Government has resulted in high unemployment amongst young people, and young people are predominantly the higher level of criminal offenders. Of course, because of the high unemployment factor amongst young people-up to 25 per cent to 30 per cent in many communities-there is a higher standard of education amongst offenders, which stands to reason. There are more resources available to criminal offenders-things such as scanners to intercept police messages on their radio networks. It is much more lucrative these days to steal and dispose of stolen property. Things such as video recorders and electronic equipment are far more valuable these days and far easier to dispose of, having been stolen. </PARA>
<PARA> There is far more protection and cosseting of offenders these days. There is far more emphasis on the rights and the interests of the perpetrator rather than the rights of the community as a whole. Overwhelmingly, the most crucial reason is the greater workload being experienced by police forces throughout the country. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to dispel one myth that is contained in the first clause of the motion before us today-that is, the apparent failure of police to do their job properly, which is implied in that particular clause. In 1980 to 1981, when there were 845,923 offences reported to police throughout the country, there was a clean-up rate of 34.91 per cent. In 1988-89 there were 1,410,065 offences reported-an increase of 66 per cent on the previous figure-yet the clean-up rate was still around 30.07 per cent; in other words, a drop of only about 5 per cent in the clean-up rate. </PARA>
<PARA> During the 10 years between 1978 and 1988, police strength rose from 29,441 to 37,875, a rise of only 28.6 per cent. Thus, if we compare the clean-up rate to the rise in the offences reported to police throughout the country and we add the police strength as a factor, we find that there is little statistical evidence-despite the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) trying to pretend that his speech contained it-of failure on the part of policing. </PARA>

<PARA>I move this motion-which is in conjunction with notice of motion No. 4, which I will deal with at a later time-to give this House an opportunity to debate a matter that concerns a most important sector of our community, that is, our senior citizens, our old aged, a sector which we believe has been badly neglected by this Government. Some might say, `Why debate these motions now if the charter has been placed into legislation?'. There is a need to do so, because nothing more clearly demonstrates this Government's attitude towards the elderly than this charter. It reflects poorly on this Government and its social justice policy that in the 2 1/2 years in which I have been the shadow Minister for community services and aged care, any legislation on aged care has been hastily drafted, poorly worded and then guillotined through this House with little opportunity for a full and open debate on what I consider to be a most important issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The subject of the motions is an excellent example of what I have just said. Taken together with the proposed agreements between the nursing home residents and proprietors, the legislation was drafted very hastily, some of it by consultants, I understand, some by departments, and some by a QC, but not, I understand, by the Attorney-General's Department or by the legislative draftsmen. As a consequence of all of this, in spite of the rush to complete the legislation before Christmas, the agreement and the charter still languish in the hands of the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) for a final check at this very late stage on their legality and their constitutionality. </PARA>
<PARA> The draft agreement originally circulated by the Department to peak bodies and interest groups was not the agreement tabled by the Minister. A last-minute change-apparently made by his office-had not been notified even to his own departmental head, which may highlight a problem of insufficient contact and dialogue between the Minister's office and the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> The amending legislation incorporating the Charter of Residents' Rights was actually guillotined through this House in the space of just 40 minutes to meet the Senate deadline for receiving legislation. If this is the commitment of the Minister or the Labor Government to social justice for the aged in Australia, the aged must find that commitment very shallow indeed. One has only to note the manner in which these original documents were drafted. With the permission of the Minister at the table, the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean), I would like to table the charter. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0F4">Mr BRAITHWAITE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is necessary to put that on record to show what our complaints are and to see how sloppy the drafting was. My original notice of motion set out to make the charter worthy of the formerly high standard that has been set in this Parliament's legislation and to provide a clear path for interpretation and to reduce the amount of unnecessary litigation which may have resulted because of the current sloppy drafting-which is now, unfortunately, incorporated into legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not intend to go through the whole 23 clauses, in both this motion and the other one, to explain this sloppiness fully. I just want to take some particular examples of the cooperation we were offering in putting these resolutions forward. For instance, as to the third amendment, we were looking at the matter from several points of view. The main one was to omit from the preamble the words `freedom and' because in some cases every person within the Commonwealth does not have the complete freedom that was being offered in this case. The explanation we give of that relates to convicted criminals sentenced to imprisonment and insane persons legally committed to institutions who do not have the right of freedom. Right from the beginning the charter sets out a right that is not every Australian's right. We wanted that looked at more comprehensively so that it would reflect the proper situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Another amendment we are suggesting is amendment No. (4): that we should omit `A person's rights do not diminish when they move into' and substitute `People's legal and moral rights should not be diminished by reason only of moving into'. Again, the amendment is necessary to clarify the actual meaning. Some people in nursing home situations may, by reason of physical or mental deterioration, lose capacities that they previously had; as for example, the right or capacity to make or revoke a will or to enter into a contract. Unless carefully worded, the charter could mislead residents on issues of this nature. </PARA>
<PARA> I now come to what we believe would be a substantive amendment, amendment No. (8), in regard to the heading `Each Resident of a Nursing Home has the RIGHT'. We wanted to insert the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA>The rights conferred, and the responsibilities imposed, by this Charter are subject to such limits as are imposed by applicable laws and to such other limits as can be shown to be reasonably necessary to ensure that the nursing home operates as a just and supportive community and that harmony is promoted within the community without injustice to any individual. </PARA>
<PARA>The explanation of that is that there is a need to incorporate in the charter some provision that will permit the declared rights of and responsibilities towards residents to be abridged for demonstratively just cause. </PARA>
<PARA> The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms declares that the rights and freedoms set out in it are subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstratively justified in a free and democratic society. Although it was recognised that the interpretation of that qualification would not be easy, it was universally accepted that some qualification on the general rights and freedoms granted to all Canadians was essential if order were to prevail. Some corresponding provision is necessary in the charter to enable the rights that it confers on all residents in unqualified terms to be enjoyed by all. There were other amendments but, as I said, that was the substantive one. </PARA>
<PARA> In amendment No. (12) we sought to incorporate the words `unjust discrimination or victimisation'. Our explanation of that is that at the moment it says, `to live without discrimination'. Discrimination perhaps of itself is not necessarily bad and in some instances is desirable. For instance, in employment, the Australian society discriminates on the basis of efficiency. In some matters we discriminate on the basis of first come, first served. Discrimination in itself is not objectionable. What is objectionable is the use of unjust criteria, such as race, colour or sex, to discriminate in certain situations. That is what we sought to amend in that regard, again just to seek clarification. </PARA>
<PARA> In that same clause, the dot point is a good example of sloppy wording. The whole section sets out to describe what a resident's right is and the point is `to live without discrimination or victimisation.'</PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on in a fresh sentence:</PARA>
<PARA>The resident is not obliged to feel grateful to those providing his or her care and accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not a right. That has nothing to do with the dot point and again demonstrates ungrammatical language when we are trying to set out something that will be clear to interpret later on. In exactly the same way, the seventh dot point, in amendment No. 15 is to read:</PARA>
<PARA>to be treated and accepted as an individual. </PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>Each resident's individual preferences are to be taken into account and treated with respect. </PARA>
<PARA>Is that is a right? It certainly does not really apply to the point in question. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, I am not going to deal with all the amendments, but if we go to our eighteenth amendment again the same thing applies there. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA>to maintain his or her personal independence, which includes a recognition of personal responsibility for his or her own actions and choices. </PARA>
<PARA>Then there is another sentence that really adds nothing to the original right and in fact again could be quite contradictory in some respects. The final dot point, number 18, was changed for the same reason. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not have time to go into each one of those, but I wanted to demonstrate that when we came to this debate we came with good intentions and an eye to the future to avoid the type of situation that apparently is now facing the Government as to how it might deal with the suggested legality of the agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> These charters are an example of how the Labor Government has failed our senior citizens and of the fact that it takes the aged for granted. It also takes for granted those people who voluntarily and professionally give their time to our aged citizens. Volunteers, working together with paid staff, play an invaluable part in providing the best possible care for our frail elderly and disabled citizens in hostels, nursing homes and within the community. But this Government's initiatives and funding cutbacks during the last session of Parliament are putting intolerable pressures on this important and often unpaid sector of the work force. It has taken entirely for granted the efforts of the voluntary organisations and the capacity of the volunteers to extend themselves yet further. </PARA>
<PARA> This is demonstrated by the reduction in funding for nursing home residents; the introduction of geriatric assessment team assessments for residents in hostel care; the abolition of the hostel care subsidy for residents who are not financially disadvantaged; and the residents' rights legislation which introduced the agreement between residents and proprietors in nursing homes. All these measures-and they are certainly not all inclusive-are placing great stress on the voluntary sector and the private sector of aged care. I must caution that Australia cannot do without voluntary workers, yet this Labor Government continues to take them for granted. </PARA>
<PARA> During my time as coalition spokesman on aged care, I have tried to cooperate with all the Ministers involved, as I believe that care of the aged is too important to play politics with. But again I give just a few examples where the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services and this Government have played those politics. First, there was no consultation with the coalition in drawing up the draft legislation on residents' rights. Had we been allowed to participate, I believe that the charter and agreement would have been better worded and the threat of future litigation reduced. Again, I offered the Minister my cooperation in redrafting the charter and agreement to a better standard, but that offer was rejected. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, in the notification of dementia grants by the Minister in January, Government members and senators were given advance notice, whereas coalition members in whose electorates grants were made were notified many weeks later, even though the coalition member would have been closely involved in assisting organisations in getting those grants. Also, it appears to be a policy of this Government and the Minister that when a hostel or other aged care organisation is to be opened in a coalition member's electorate, the Minister demands the right to open the facility and then sends an apology and delegates a Government member to do the job for him, even though that member would have little empathy with the organisation, the community effort involved, or the residents concerned. I say to the Minister, as I did in my letter to him of 18 January-as yet unanswered-that care for the aged is too important for him and his Government to play politics with. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the other occasions on which the Government has taken the aged care providers, both in the voluntary sector and in the private sector, for granted. At the time of the Budget last year, without consultation and pre-empting a review of the care aggregated module (CAM) of nursing home funding, the Minister reduced the hours of care in categories three and five effective from 1 September 1990. He also withdrew the hostel care subsidy for non-financially disadvantaged persons as from 7 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> These measures were estimated to reduce aged care expenditure by approximately $31m but, as I said, the first measure pre-empted the Government's own CAM review and the second retrospectively made a charge on residents and voluntary organisations. This is at a time when admission to hostels has been made subject to geriatric assessment team assessment, which in itself means a greater reliance on the personal care subsidy for all residents. One wonders whether in fact any of the $31m in savings from the withdrawal of the hostel care subsidy will be effected. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us also look at the greater pressure being put on staff and providers, both as a result of the reduction of funded nursing home hours and the need to basically treat only categories one to three in nursing homes and categories four to five in hostels, but without the CAM or standard aggregated module, or SAM, funding that normally goes with it, and with only a personal care subsidy, which is of a much lesser amount. Again, the charge of taking residents, staff, providers and volunteers for granted is only too true. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another point in the agreement on which I have sought a reply from the Minister, both in writing and in a question on notice. I have asked the Minister whether the Little Sisters of the Poor and other such Catholic nursing homes which do not sign the agreement between proprietor and residents will continue to receive funding. In reply to my question on notice the Minister hedged; he talked around the subject, but he still has not answered my question: will nursing homes which do not sign the agreement continue to receive funding?</PARA>
<PARA> I now understand that initial advice given to Catholic nursing homes is that proprietors are under no legal obligation to enter into agreements in the form adopted by the Government and that they should decline to enter into such agreements on the ground that they believe it is not open to them morally to sign agreements in that form. So again the Minister should be asked whether nursing homes which do not sign the agreement will continue to receive funding. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another area which has been left open to abuse and that is in respect of the part that the advocates will play, both with the amendments and in the role of aged care. I have given an example to the Minister in connection with the incorrect reporting and the disclosure to the press of the results of one advocate's inquiry into a nursing home. Again, I have asked the Minister about this and I have not yet received a reply as to what will happen in connection with this type of improper activity of disclosing to the press matters which should be properly addressed by the inquiry within the Department itself. There are some extreme examples but one fallen leaf does not make an autumn, as they say. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to place on record the good relations and communications I have enjoyed in the discussions on both the charter and the agreement with Mr John Barber, of the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation, and Mr Dominic Gibson, of The Accommodation Rights Service. It has been really great.</PARA>
<PARA> It does appear to me that, for those involved in aged care, the Act is administered to distribute funds more for the benefit, the glory and the convenience of the Government and the Department than of the residents for whom the Acts were intended. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have liked to have dealt more fully with the current review being undertaken on Commonwealth-State relations in respect of delineation of roles and duplication of functions. If this is to succeed, both the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services and the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) will have to take a different attitude from their entrenched position that health and, I assume, related health services, not be transferred. In those circumstances one wonders what point there is of going into something meaningful. </PARA>
<PARA> In matters of duplication, it is very important that costs are saved to allow more funds to flow to the aged sector and that those funds be used properly. This is absolutely essential. In that, the devolution question must be raised, not only in connection with funding-because that is only part of it-but also in service delivery, in the assessment, the monitoring and even the industrial awards under which each State functions. This causes a tremendous difference in the CAM application within the funding itself. </PARA>
<PARA> In this regard we believe the mid-term review of aged care will not address those matters properly. The consultancy which apparently has been appointed to assist the Government in these discussions between the States and the Commonwealth would need to have better practical experience of what is the reality than I believe it has. That same consultancy was involved in residents' rights, and there is a lot to be said about the manner in which its service was delivered. What I am saying is that if we are going to address the matter properly, we will need to have a more open approach. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that from 3 March to 10 March Senior Citizens Week will be observed in New South Wales. Perhaps this is an opportunity for all of us in this chamber-the Government and the Opposition-the Department of Community Services and Health, and all those who play a part in delivering services to the aged, to make some observations. </PARA>
<PARA> We should all consider where the main emphasis for aged care should be put. Surely it commences with that senior citizen who has a need and with the necessity to deliver to that individual, that Australian, the appropriate care of the best quality in the most efficient and least costly way. That care must be available equally, and of the same quality, to all Australians, whether they live in Perth, Hobart or in country and rural areas right around the nation. That should be the point from which we commence to devise and develop our policies. That senior citizen himself or herself should be the first priority. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot deliver that quality service if people within government frame sloppy and litigation-prone legislation where there is no certainty. We cannot give that care if local, State and Federal bureaucracies seek to preserve and entrench their positions. A stressed and overregulated proprietor and staff cannot give that professional service to residents. The service cannot be given if volunteers and professionals decide that it is not worth it and their efforts will be in vain. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to oppose both motions before the House. The key question to be asked in responding to the offering of the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) is: why is he wasting the time of Private Members' Business by once again raising the Charter of Residents' Rights and Responsibilities and the agreement between nursing home proprietors and residents?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This legislation has already been debated in detail by both Houses of the Parliament. It certainly looks as though he is blatantly attempting, in a pathetic manner, to bucket the responsible Minister. It is a cheap political stunt designed to create further opposition and needlessly stir up controversy for his own ends. </PARA>
<PARA> All the issues raised by the amendments of the honourable member for Dawson have been previously dealt with by this Parliament, and he is well aware of this. Who is going to thank him for wasting the Parliament's time? Not the people living in nursing homes and hostels who have been waiting for the protection offered by the charter and the agreement for many years. Certainly not the industry-union and consumer groups-who have dedicated years of work. These groups, along with consumers, who are the ones directly affected by these reforms, are supportive of the legislation passed by the Parliament. They will not thank the honourable member for Dawson for trying to undermine their years of work and their commitment to improving the lot of nursing home and hostel residents. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member's position shows a blatant disregard for the basic principles of social justice which are widely recognised and, indeed, demanded by Australian society today. His action aims at denying the rights of residents and those who care for them. The only people who might appreciate the efforts of the honourable member for Dawson are those who would deny people living in nursing homes and hostels their basic rights, including the fundamental right to choose their own doctor. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the doctor of choice, this has been an enforceable standard in Commonwealth funded nursing homes for the past three years. If this has not been a problem for nursing home proprietors and their boards in the past, why is this now a problem for the honourable member for Dawson? I understand that the honourable member has interests in the nursing home industry. Does he afford his residents such a fundamental human right as doctor of choice?</PARA>
<PARA> The Charter of Residents' Rights and Responsibilities is a document which sets the standard for care provided in nursing homes and hostels. It makes the issue clear. Older people and residents of nursing homes and hostels must be treated with respect and dignity. That is the issue that we are debating here. It states that residents are individuals who must be able to continue to make their own choices about what is right for them. These principles are the usually unstated essence of a society which is free from prejudice and is caring, just and humane. </PARA>
<PARA> The philosophy behind the agreement is that it gives individual residents the private right to ensure that they receive care commensurate with their needs, and that this care is of the highest standard. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will remember that before the Parliament considered the charter and the agreement, the Government undertook an extensive process of consulting all groups who had a vested interest in providing residential care to older people. The industry, relevant unions and of course consumer representatives were all extensively consulted. This was a national consultation process which spanned a period of several years. The protracted and exacting process undertaken by the Government to ensure that all points of view were taken into account has resulted in the worthwhile documents ultimately passed by Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> What the honourable member for Dawson has given us now in these two motions is simply a re-run of those that he put forward to Parliament to consider last year. Of the 23 amendments relating to the Charter of Residents' Rights and Responsibilities, he has included four which the Parliament approved last year, and they are amendments 1, 9, 10 and 21. The Parliament rejected the other 19. What he is proposing, therefore, is a nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> That aside, and more importantly, the majority of the amendments to the charter now put by the honourable member for Dawson would place unnecessary caveats and limitations on the rights of residents. These would weaken the position of residents. Signing of an agreement by both the resident and the proprietor will secure the rights of both parties and enable them to take action to enforce their rights on their own behalf. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also a condition of approval that the proprietor comply with the conditions of the agreement, once signed by both parties. If proprietors refuse to offer or sign such an agreement there is a range of options which the Government may pursue, including withdrawal of funding. That said, the decision to take action against a proprietor who refuses to offer or sign the agreement would be taken in the overall context of the level of care and accommodation provided by that nursing home. </PARA>
<PARA> The welfare of the resident is of paramount concern; that is what the charter is all about. That is what the honourable member for Dawson seeks to deny. Let us not underestimate what the charter is about and the detrimental effect that the honourable member for Dawson's proposition will have on the lives of 103,000 frail older people living in the relevant nursing homes and hostels. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me reiterate the basics of the issues at hand here: these documents espouse fundamental human rights as they relate to the provision of care for frail older Australians. They put into practical effect the Government's social justice principles. These principles are not ideals; they are the same rights which each and every one of us take for granted every day, such as the freedom to control one's own life and the right to privacy and dignity, to be treated with respect. That is what the Government is on about, not discriminating against frail older Australians. They are entitled to the same dignity and rights as other Australians. They are not second-class citizens, as the honourable member for Dawson and the Opposition would have them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion, which seeks to amend the hastily conceived and poorly drafted legislation on residents' rights that was pushed through the House, under guillotine, on 20 December 1990. I must say that I have not heard quite as much nonsense in a long time as I have just heard from the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), who obviously has not read anything on the subject on which he has spoken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Banks mentioned doctor of choice. I ask him to look at the proposed Opposition amendments, because he will see nothing at all about doctor of choice. The honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) and I believe very strongly that residents should have their doctor of choice. We have not mentioned, in any shape or form, that residents should not have their doctor of choice. We do not deny residents their rights. In fact, what we are about is giving residents rights. We wish to clarify residents' rights so that they know what they are. The Government's interest in this matter is evident when it puts forward an honourable member who does not even understand what it is that the Government is opposing. We respect the elderly, and we want their rights to be clear. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Banks said that this matter had been fully debated. I remind the honourable member that it was not fully debated because debate on the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Bill was guillotined. That is why the amendments proposed by the honourable member for Dawson were not considered. So much for the comments of the honourable member for Banks. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Banks also said that the elderly must be treated with respect and dignity. He will find no argument with that on this side of the House. We strongly agree that the elderly must be treated with respect and dignity. I would have liked the Charter of Residents' Rights and Responsibilities to have done the same thing for the elderly. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments which my colleague has sought to make to the original charter indicate the lack of thought that went into drawing up the charter. They question not only the competence of those people drawing it up but also the sincerity of the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples). </PARA>
<PARA> If the Minister really thoroughly understood the area of aged care, he would have had concerns about the preamble to the charter that specifies, `every person has the right to freedom'. I will ignore the obvious comment that every person does not have the right to freedom. If every person did have that right, we would not have gaols. I question how the Minister would see this actually applying to nursing homes where approximately 60 per cent of residents suffer from dementia. What would the Minister suggest the nursing homes do with residents with dementia-the resident who thinks it is 1960 and that she is still living on a farm? Would he suggest that she have total freedom to leave the building, to leave the grounds, to be run over by a truck on the road; for the nursing home to be sued by the resident's family for lack of care? It is nonsense. `Every person has the right to freedom.' That sounds good if one does not think about it. That is what the Government is all about-sounding good. </PARA>
<PARA> Have Government members-or the three who are in the House-actually read the Charter of Residents' Rights and Responsibilities and the agreement the Government has trumpeted as proof of its concern for the frail elderly? I will bet they have not. I would be surprised if the Minister had read it, too. If the Minister has not, it is a reflection of the importance that he gives to this document. On the other hand, if the Minister has read the document and approved it, I ask what he is doing as Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services, because it is a hideously worded document. It reflects poorly on the Minister. It reflects poorly on his competence and on his knowledge of the frail elderly who reside in nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA> I will read from the Charter of Residents' Rights and the agreement. However, before I do, let me tell the Government members who are in the House about the document. The charter and the agreement are to go to the residents of nursing homes when they are admitted. Altogether there are 16 pages. The resident is expected to read the document and sign it. Remember that we are not talking about someone in his or her prime, confident and fully in charge; we are talking about an extremely frail elderly person who has been judged by an assessment team to be frail enough to require permanent nursing care. This frail elderly resident, who will have a number of illnesses, is expected to read, understand and sign this document, despite possible failing eyesight, diminished faculties, trembling hands and the enormous fear that dislocation into a nursing home has caused. Let us look at what this resident faces. Paragraph 4.2 on page 3 states:</PARA>
<PARA>The proprietor shall provide to the resident such services, facilities and goods as are agreed from time to time in accordance with Clause 5 and the proprietor shall set out a list of the services, facilities and goods ordered by the resident in a document which shall then be attached to the Agreement and shall be amended from time to time to reflect the changing requirements of the resident.</PARA>
<PARA>My frail elderly will just love that one. Let us look at paragraph 15.1 on page 6. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>The resident may not be moved from the resident's bed location to another bed location in the nursing home except . . . </PARA>
<PARA>(b) on bona fide medical or other care grounds, as provided for in ``Clause 15.3; and/or</PARA>
<PARA>(c) Where the nursing home becomes an exempt nursing home in the circumstances set out in Clause 15.4. </PARA>
<PARA>We can just see a 76-year-old resident, who has just had a stroke, asking a nursing sister who wants to move him to another bed to prove that he falls under 15.3! I would read clause 15.3 to the House except that it contains 20 lines. I would not want to send Government members to sleep. The whole thing is a farce. It sounds good, but in reality it terrifies those people for whose benefit it is designed-the frail aged. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there is a provision for residents to have an advocate read the document and sign it for them; in the first instance, a family member. I can tell the Minister, because I have read the charter and the agreement, and I suspect he has not, that it is not only the residents who will have trouble with the convoluted document; so will the relatives. I would like the Minister to tell me how many relatives does he envisage reading 16 pages and checking up on clause 5, which is referred to in clause 17 (a) (i), clause 21.3, when it is referred to in clause 21.5, and clauses 21.3, 21.3 (f) and 21.4 (e), when they are referred to in clause 21.7?</PARA>
<PARA> Now, the final irony. What about those residents for whom English is not their native language? We have heard nothing from the Minister to suggest that those residents from non-English speaking backgrounds will receive the charter and agreement in their own languages. But perhaps the Minister realises that there is little point as it is incomprehensible in English and there is no need to make it incomprehensible in Italian, Greek or Vietnamese. At present we have 70,000 residents in nursing homes in Australia. This means 140,000 signed agreements-one for the resident and one for the home-and 140,000 times 16 equals 6,160,000. That is over six million sheets of paper that no-one will read. Pity the poor trees. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not just the form of the charter of rights and agreement that is such a mess; it is also how the Government intends to have it administered. From time to time nursing homes rearrange beds so that, for instance, Mr Smith who has arthritis but who is mentally alert is not roomed with three residents who have advanced dementia. The agreement requires that in order to be moved a resident needs to give assent, but people with dementia cannot give informed consent, so the client's advocate has to be contacted. When the advocate cannot be contacted the nursing home has to call in a Commonwealth medical officer to assess the propriety of the move. This has to be done for every single resident that is to be moved. I suspect that if this is needed in order to move three residents with dementia from a four-bed room to a three-bed room, it will not be done and poor Mr Smith will have to go where he is put because rearrangements are too much trouble. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no question that residents in nursing homes should have rights, but this Government does not understand individual rights. If it did, it would not have created such a piece of nonsense as the Charter of Residents' Rights and Responsibilities and the agreement. If it really understood its clientele it would have made the charter and agreement short, lucid and easy to understand. I suspect that this Government has no real concern for individuals. It likes them en masse; it likes to provide a philosophy for the frail elderly, but it does not actually get down there and find out what it is really like to be one of the frail elderly. This Government is great on rhetoric-the rights of the frail elderly, the rights of the disabled. Unfortunately, when one looks below the rhetoric the reality is somewhat different. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what the Government is actually doing for the frail elderly in nursing homes, as opposed to what it is talking about. In South Australia it has cut nursing home hours from an average of 21.6 hours per resident per week to 19.5. At the same time, the frailty criteria for entry into nursing homes has been increased. We now have frailer residents getting a lower amount of care-that is the Government's social justice for you. This means that staff do not have time to actually talk to residents but, rather, spend their time cleaning, feeding and peeing residents. There is no longer time for personal contact. Nurses are quitting the industry because they are tired and because it is distressing to them no longer to be able to give the level of care they once gave. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Minister were really serious about improving the lot of the frail elderly he would not have cut back South Australia to bring it into line with other States; he would have raised other States to the level of South Australia. It is not only the Minister who makes fine, grand-sounding speeches about what he is doing for those under his charge. The Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) also tells us how much he cares for the disabled and how much he is doing for them, while the number of intellectually disabled people who are without activities and who cannot find accommodation increases day by day. Meanwhile, the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services introduces the per capita equalisation scheme so that South Australia is brought back into line with the other States. Some social justice policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The elderly do have rights; nursing homes have responsibilities. But this Government, with more thought for the appearance than for the substance, has chosen one of the most unwieldy ways possible to recognise this. I trust that these amendments moved by the honourable member for Dawson will go some way towards repairing the Government's suspect endeavours in this field. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleague the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) condemned the Opposition's tactics on the grounds that they were designed to delay the implementation of the Charter of Residents' Rights and Responsibilities and the agreement, passed by Parliament in December last year. I feel compelled in the circumstances to remind the shadow Minister for community services and aged care, the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), of the rationale behind the charter and the agreement. These documents put the Government's social justice principles into practical effect. They are part of the philosophy and the framework that should underpin the provision of services and care to older Australians in nursing homes and hostels. These people depend on others for care and support on a daily basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The charter also protects staff and proprietors by indicating that the resident has a responsibility to respect their right to work in an environment that is free from harassment. The agreement makes it clear that residents are to accord proprietors and staff the right to freedom from abuse and reprisal, the right to privacy, to individuality and to complain. The charter addresses both quality of care and quality of life issues, and in doing so emphasises that all nursing homes and hostels have two roles: to provide health care services; and to provide residents with their long term and only place of residence-their home. These documents affirm the fundamental rights of our older Australian citizens to be treated in the same way as any other members of our community. </PARA>
<PARA> What makes the position of the honourable member for Dawson even more untenable is that these initiatives do not confer any additional rights. The intent of the charter and the agreement is solely to ensure that these fundamental and basic rights-to be treated with dignity and respect as equal members of society-are not taken away from people when they enter a hostel or a nursing home. Specific clauses of the agreement call for proprietors to acknowledge and fulfil their commitment to the provision of quality care to older people in an environment which encourages feelings of personal well-being. The agreement between nursing home proprietors and residents will ensure that there can be no mistake, no misunderstanding and no margin for error when it comes to ensuring that the rights of a person living in a nursing home are protected. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Parliament approved the charter and agreement in the last session it provided a clear indication to the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) that it wished to have these implemented. Now the honourable member for Dawson is attempting to stymie the Parliament's intent. To top it all off, the honourable member has used a technically incorrect mechanism to retable the amendments to the charter which he tabled last year. No amendments to the charter can be achieved by the process the honourable member for Dawson has involved us in today-and he knows it. </PARA>
<PARA> We can only suppose, as my colleague the honourable member for Banks has said, that the honourable member for Dawson simply wants to go on wasting the time of this Parliament. He is also confounding the clear wish of the key industry and consumer representatives to have these initiatives introduced as quickly and effectively as possible. Again, the rationale for his action at this time-after the exhaustive and open process undertaken by the Government in developing and bringing these initiatives into law-is at the very least very suspicious and is in basic contravention of the will of the Parliament and the people. The responsible Minister has now embarked on the process of implementing the charter and agreement for the benefit of the residents of hostels and nursing homes and for the benefit of those concerned for, and involved in, their care and welfare. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is planning to take a measured approach to the implementation in 1991 of the charter and the agreement. The principal components of the implementation strategy will include training, support for proprietors and staff, and information to residents and their relatives. With this widespread support and commitment to put the initiatives into effect and with industry and consumer groups continuing to be consulted at key stages of the implementation, what does the honourable member for Dawson really think he will achieve by rehashing old news?</PARA>
<PARA> With the Parliament two months ago recognising the need to protect and promote the rights of our older Australians, it is appalling that the honourable member for Dawson should attempt to reopen the debate on this issue in the manner that he has. Is it not time that the Opposition, and some in the community who provide care to our older Australians, realised that these people are adults, not children; that the care and services provided to older Australians should be in keeping with their adult status; and that certain members of this House stopped wasting the Parliament's valuable time?</PARA>
<PARA> It would be better if instead they turned their energy to assisting to implement the Parliament's will. If they did that, they would also be implementing the clear desires of our older citizens and those committed to giving them the quality of care they deserve. Let us get on with the job of caring for older Australians. </PARA>

<PARA> That this House:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) deplores the brutality used against the citizens of Lithuania and the deaths of 14 persons arising from the use of force by Soviet troops on 13 January 1991;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) condemns the assault by Soviet troops on the Interior Ministry in Riga, Latvia, on 20 January 1991, in which at least four persons were killed and nine injured;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) is appalled by the additional threat of force against the democratically elected Parliaments of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania;</PARA>
<PARA> (4) demands that the Soviet Union, in accordance with universally accepted principles of human rights, desist from the use of military force and violence against the peoples of the Baltic states;</PARA>
<PARA> (5) calls upon the Australian Government, in conjunction with other democratic states, to protest such brutality to the Soviet authorities and in international human rights forums; and</PARA>
<PARA> (6) calls upon the Soviet Government to facilitate the peaceful transition to independence of those Republics which have expressed through democratically elected Parliaments, a desire for self-determination. </PARA>
<PARA>This motion gives the House another opportunity to place on record-I hope unanimously-its very grave concern about the continuing situation in the three Baltic states. The motion gives the House an opportunity to express its concern about the continuing refusal by the Soviet Union to grant independence, sovereignty and other internationally recognised rights to those three countries which, of course, now have elected parliaments. It gives the House an opportunity yet again to express its very great concern, and to express its concern on behalf of the people of Australia, about the continued suppression of civil and human rights in the three Baltic states by the Soviet Union. It gives the House an opportunity to call on the Australian Government to continue with those protests it has made and to encourage it to be more robust, more resolute and more persistent in making its protests against the abuse of both civil and human rights in the three Baltic states. The motion also gives the House an opportunity to encourage the Australian Government, with all the support and comfort that can be given by a resolution of this House, to continue its protests and leave no stone unturned to ensure that at the end of such protests full civil and political rights are restored to the people of the three Baltic states together with their true and full independence. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion that I have proposed is self-explanatory. It seeks to cover both the basic principles involved in this matter and some of the very unfortunate recent events which have occurred in the three Baltic states. Firstly, the motion deplores the brutality which has been committed against the citizens of Lithuania as recently as 13 January of this year when, as honourable members will recall, some 14 persons, and possibly more, were killed as a result of the brutality used by the Soviet authorities against the people of Lithuania. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the motion condemns the assault by Soviet troops on the Interior Ministry in Riga, the capital of Latvia. Thirdly, it expresses the concern of the House not only against those acts of brutality which have already occurred, but also about the continued use of force, threats of brutality and the presence of the Soviet Union which hovers over the three Baltic states, with all the necessary implications that the Soviet authorities will use their regular and persistent brutality in those states to deny basic rights to the people of those three countries and to deny them their full independence. In that part of the motion we draw attention not simply to the brutality which has already occurred-as if that were not bad enough-but also to the continuing threat of further brutality and express our concern about that. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, the motion turns to matters of very great principle, when it expresses the view of the House that the Soviet Union should stop the use of military force and stop the violence against the peoples of the Baltic states. It also then draws attention to the obligation of the Australian Government to protest about that brutality to the Soviet authorities. It was this clause of the motion which was amended in the Senate because the Government expressed its view there that we were already protesting. It is true to say that the Government has made protests; we give it credit for that. Nevertheless, there is a case for the motion saying, as it does, that there is now an obligation on the Government to go further. </PARA>
<PARA> We say that the Government should raise this matter in the United Nations and pursue it there. We also say, as the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has said, that this matter should be raised in all of the human rights and international fora where the Government can raise it, because concrete results will only be achieved if we make it very plain to the Soviet Union that Western democracies will not let up until independence is granted once again to the Baltic states and until the Soviet Union stops both its demonstration of brutality and the threat of the exercise of continued brutality and force in the three Baltic states. </PARA>
<PARA> The other day I had some quite incontrovertible evidence given to me that the peaceful demonstrations and rallies concerning the events in Romania had some considerable effect on the way events unfolded in Romania. In other words, although we cannot claim that the demonstrations that some of us organised and held in Australia about events in Romania were the sole reason why the Ceausescu regime was overthrown, I have been given evidence recently that the actions of the Australian people and the Australian Parliament had a very considerable effect in forming world opinion and, indeed, leading to the changes which took place in Romania. If that can be done with respect to Romania, it can be done with respect to the Baltic states. But it will not be done unless we persist in presenting this case, not only in this Parliament but also in all of the international fora and all of the human rights bodies where we can promote this view. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the Opposition has made a very clear statement of its position on the whole matter. The Leader of the Opposition has said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Soviet authorities must-</PARA>
<PARA>and I emphasise `must'-</PARA>
<PARA>be left in no doubt that Western support and aid for the Soviet Union can continue only if minimum standards of human rights, including the right of peaceful self-determination, are observed. </PARA>
<PARA>Our statement goes on to say-and this is our clear declaration of policy-that the Australian Government:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . should take a lead in strongly pressing the Soviet Union, both in its own right and in conjunction with other governments, as well as in the United Nations and other appropriate international forums, to end its illegal occupation of the Baltic states and restore their legitimate independence and sovereignty. </PARA>
<PARA> So what the Soviet Union must do, and what we must keep telling the Soviet Union it must do, is end its illegal occupation of the Baltic states and restore independence and sovereignty to those states. There is no point in mincing words about this matter. That should be the objective; that is what we are pursuing; and that is what we will continue to pursue on this issue of the Baltic states. </PARA>
<PARA> To return briefly to the motion that I have moved-the final part calls upon the Soviet Government to facilitate the peaceful transition to independence of those republics which have expressed through democratically elected parliaments a desire for self-determination. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a cause which has come a long way. It has had a lot of ups and downs in Australia. Although we give credit to the Australian Government today for what it has done, it should not be forgotten that there are some rainbow warriors on this issue. They come out after the storm, when the sun is shining and when the rainbow starts to show. There is a lot of keenness and enthusiasm when the tide has turned, as it were. </PARA>
<PARA> There was a time, of course, when this country recognised the incorporation de jure of the Baltic states within the Soviet Union. The parties that I am speaking for today, the Liberal and National parties, opposed that very strongly. It should be remembered that one of the very first acts of the incoming Fraser Government in 1975 was to undo and set aside for nought-and that is what it deserved-that recognition of the incorporation of the Baltic states in the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very appropriate that today the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), who was then the Minister for Foreign Affairs, should be in the chamber while this motion is being debated. I say with all sincerity, and it is something that everyone could say objectively and agree with, that it is very greatly to the credit of the honourable member for Kooyong and the Government of which he was part that one of its very first acts was to remember three groups of very oppressed people. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is a very prosperous country, although it has at the moment severe economic problems. What we as Australians forget far too often is that there are people who do not have the same good fortune as we have and who do not have not only the same economic prospects as we have but also those most elementary and basic rights that we have-those civil, political and human rights that we grow up with and assume as part of our second nature. Many people do not have those rights and continue to have them denied to them. We forget that far too often. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for that reason that I say that it is very much to the credit of the Fraser Government and the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, the honourable member for Kooyong, that a very early action of the Fraser Government was to set aside at nought and cancel that quite improper and disgraceful recognition of the incorporation of three independent countries within the Soviet Union. For our part, we never had any truck with that recognition and it is good that we can put it behind us. </PARA>
<PARA> It is good that the Labor Party has now seen the error of its ways-I do not want to trade on the political aspects of this at all-and can now join us in a bipartisan approach to this issue, because it concerns fundamental issues on which there should be no division between us and on which there should never have been division between us. That division should never have been there. </PARA>
<PARA> We are in favour of bipartisanship where it can acknowledge very basic principles to which we can all subscribe, and surely this is one-the interests, rights and liberties of the people of the Baltic states, and their right to conduct their own affairs and to run their own country. This motion seeks no more than that-the right of the people of the three Baltic states to have their own countries and to exercise sovereignty over those countries. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the reason why we move this motion once again; it is not the first time that such a motion has been moved in this Parliament. I hope that this motion will be passed by the Parliament, if not today, then as soon as possible and that it will be passed unanimously, because it seeks to pick up-and I think it does emphasise-all of those essential features of the three Baltic States of which we must keep reminding ourselves: first, they are still in a position of oppression; secondly, they are being denied their basic civil, political and human rights; thirdly, they are being denied that most elementary and basic right of all, the right of sovereignty, the right of people to conduct their own affairs and rule themselves. What we say to the Soviet Union is, `Wake up to yourselves; go back to your own country; leave the three Baltic states alone-they are not part of the Soviet Union; you have enough problems in the Soviet Union itself to occupy you for the rest of your likely life. Concentrate on those and leave the people of the three Baltic states to run their own affairs'. That is what we say to the Soviet Union. We hope that the Labor Party today will join with us in sending that message to the Soviet Union. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I am pleased to have the opportunity to support this private member's motion, which, I might say, was very eloquently moved. It is similar to one which I supported last year in this House, and it is in tune with the Lithuanian, Latvian and Estonian communities that live in my electorate and with whom I have been able to confer on these issues regularly, most recently on Friday of last week when I was privileged to share the celebrations held by the Lithuanian community on the seventy-third anniversary of their country's declaration of independence. Last month I was honoured to be invited by the Latvian community to address a rally on the steps of the South Australian Parliament House to protest recent Soviet repression in the Baltic republics in general, and Latvia in particular.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It needs to be noted that the views of these communities are very similar to those of the representatives of the Ukrainian Government and the Ukrainian Republican Party. Very recently, I had the honour to host a delegation from the Ukrainian Republican Party visiting Adelaide and my electorate office. I should also add that the motion contains some sentiments which are very similar to those that I expressed in a personal letter to Mikhail Gorbachev. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be surprised to hear that I await a reply to that letter. </PARA>
<PARA> This motion has been moved at a most appropriate time, when many of us in the West are coming to see very clearly that the President of the Soviet Union-as the former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom said-is not a man with whom we can always do business. Recent events in the Baltic republics and also in the Ukraine, Moldavia, Georgia and the other minority nationalities in the Soviet Union have confirmed that Gorbachev's clean break with the past has not been so clean and that he is maintaining some old Soviet and Russian habits. </PARA>
<PARA> The threat and the actual use of force and violence in the Baltic Republics are all too reminiscent of past tsarist behaviour and more recently of Soviet repressive behaviour, as in the case of East Germany in 1953; Hungary in 1956; Czechoslovakia in 1968; then in 1980-81 with proxies used in Poland. This was not only true of the fact that this repression is very similar to those that I have just mentioned, but also that it has occurred at a time when the West has had its attention diverted elsewhere and has thereby not acted as decisively as it might otherwise have done. </PARA>
<PARA> This motion might also have called for the diplomatic recognition of the Baltic republics, particularly Lithuania, where I believe the case is very well made. It is clear that it very difficult to do that at a time when the West is engaged in peacekeeping operations in the Gulf and one of the legal bases for these operations has been produced by United Nations resolutions. In the event of our taking action in the Baltic area in a way that we might were moral considerations the only ones weighing with us, the Soviet Union could make life extremely difficult for us in the United Nations. No doubt this is one of the issues that has weighed heavily with Washington. In any case, I should add to my Lithuanian friends in Adelaide, Moscow has, all too clearly, retained effective control over the destiny of Lithuania and this makes recognition in a de facto or de jure sense very difficult to undertake. </PARA>
<PARA> We should not be fooled by the rationalisation that the Moscow Government has sought to give, that the repression that occurred in Lithuania was the result of deviant actions undertaken by local military forces. It is quite clear that the central government was responsible for the military build-up in the Baltic area, and it is, after all, President Gorbachev who is the Commander-in-Chief of the Soviet Armed Forces-and he gave his explicit approval for the build-up two days before the crack-down in Vilnius; and he expressed only regret, not condemnation, for the killings that occurred on 15 January. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague opposite says, absolutely disgraceful bully-boy tactics were used. Clearly, once again they are the go in the Soviet Union and are used by Russian dominated forces with respect to minority nationalities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Government has already made plain its views on this most recent instance of Soviet repression in minority nationality areas. In media statements by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), and by the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Dr Blewett), and most recently in the statement to which the mover of the motion referred, that by Senator Evans on 22 January. In that statement, Senator Evans made clear the Government's condemnation of the use of force by the Soviet Government, first in Lithuania and then in Latvia, and said that the Government's concerns had already been conveyed to Moscow. </PARA>
<PARA> But we should note that this motion urges that we continue with these protests-and I am wholly in agreement with the mover, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. BROWN)-and that we should be prepared to put aside our previous faith in Mikhail Gorbachev as the great reformer of the Soviet Union. It is quite clear that he has lost his zest for reform and is now throwing in his lot with the old guard. We should take more note of Eduard Shevardnadze's resignation speech, in which he suggested that the Soviet Union was going back down the route to dictatorship. Of course, he has been credited by the old guard, who are coming back into control, with having lost eastern Europe. </PARA>
<PARA> The Soviet Union is reverting to a dictatorial regime, and it is quite clear that we need to send a message to Mikhail Gorbachev. When we have cleared up this unfortunate little mess created by another dictator, Saddam Hussein, in the Gulf area, our voice should become louder and louder, and the inhibitions caused by considerations of realpolitik become lessened. We have some methods by which we can exercise leverage on Gorbachev. The first lies in the fact that the forces that have been unleashed by the early glasnost and perestroika reform programs are still in place, notably in many of the republics. The strongest of these is, of course, Boris Yeltsin, who is leading a very strong program of political opposition to Gorbachev, and among other things has called on Russian ethnic soldiers in the Baltic republics not to be part of the use of force. </PARA>
<PARA> The second kind of leverage we have is as a result of the breadbasket case condition that the Soviet economy now faces, which had led it to agree to East Germany joining West Germany, and both of them remaining in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) alliance, in exchange for a pot of West German gold. We should use any aid programs adopted with respect to the Soviet Union as a mechanism for applying leverage on it to reduce its repression and to assist in the development of independent and democratic republics, particularly in the Baltic area, but also in other areas of the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not here just to condemn Soviet activities, but also-as the motion quite rightly says-to support this movement towards democratic and independent Baltic republics. These were incorporated in the Soviet Union as part of a deal with Hitler at the onset of the Second World War. Stalin never consulted the Baltic peoples on this. Now that they are being asked what their opinion is on this matter, they are giving it the overwhelming thumbs down. Even the Soviet Union's Congress of People's Deputies last year declared the Nazi-Soviet pact to be both illegal and immoral. </PARA>
<PARA> From March of last year, democratically elected governments in all three states declared their independence from the Soviet Union, amidst overwhelming displays of public support for these actions. Lithuania recently conducted an independent plebiscite on the issue, which produced a 90 per cent positive vote in support of independence. Such acts, I might point out, for what it is worth, are entirely consistent with the Soviet constitution, the seventy-second article of which declares every state's right to secession. I note that on 3 March Estonia and Latvia will also be holding their own plebiscites. These are consistent also with the final acts of the 1975 Helsinki Conference on European Security and Cooperation, which declared the right of all participating nations, including the Soviet Union, to self-determination. </PARA>
<PARA> The central Moscow government knows it cannot win this argument with the Baltic peoples by persuasion, and it has banned all plebiscites in the Soviet Union not conducted under its own auspices. It will be conducting a ballot later this year on 17 March on a new Soviet Union treaty, which it is clearly going to rort very heavily, in the hope of being able to use it as a legitimacy for its continued occupation of the minority nationality republics.</PARA>
<PARA> The Baltic, Georgian and Ukrainian republics have refused to participate in the plebiscite. I note from today's paper that Moldavia has also said that it is not going to be party to this fraudulent plebiscite. </PARA>
<PARA> The Soviet Union is the last great European colonial system and I am sure that its continued existence meets with the disapproval of my colleagues on this side of the House. Some may even concur with the description used by a former American President, who was not always popular with all of us, that it constitutes an `evil empire'. It is clinging, much as did the British, the French, the Belgians, the Portuguese and other European colonial powers in the early post-war years, to its empire. Most of them had the good sense to realise that eventually they would have to get out. The British and, to a lesser extent, the French, the Belgians and the Portuguese, did get out, often retaining good connections and good relations with their former colonial territories. The Soviets seem determined to have the last great European colonial empire and to ensure that their relations with their former subjugated colonial peoples will not be good, will not be harmonious and the break will be as nasty as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the message of this House, which we are about to convey, and its firm and clear condemnation of that kind of behaviour by the Soviets will play its part in persuading the Soviet Union to behave otherwise. The message to the Soviet Union is: `Get out now, while the going is still relatively good, and cut your losses.' There is not much to be gained by staying and that which is to be gained will be quickly evaporated by the struggle involved in the repression of maintaining those gains. </PARA>
<PARA> If, as Boris Yeltsin claimed yesterday, Gorbachev's aim is to preserve the system, is to maintain the system, and no longer to reform it, the time has come also for him to go and we should be doing nothing to delay his departure.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I fully support this motion put to the House so incisively by my colleague the shadow Minister for communications, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. BROWN). Inasmuch as the Soviets have effectively controlled the Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania since 1940 during World War II, this will give honourable members some indication of how fiercely the fire of independence burns in the hearts of people in those still captive nations. Now the Soviet empire, crumbling under the weight of secessionist movements and economic disaster, has lashed out in a desperate effort to retain control of the Baltic states.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although the President of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, stated as recently as 23 January this year-as reported in the Sydney Morning Herald by Robert Haupt-that `the gains of perestroika, democratisation and glasnost were, and still remain, lasting values guarded by presidential power', nevertheless, while the Western democracies were pre-occupied with events in the Gulf, the USSR cynically used its troops to restore Soviet control in the Baltic states of Latvia and Lithuania in the belief that no-one would take action or take notice. </PARA>
<PARA> However, as the Gulf crisis moves to a resolution, the Soviet position regarding the Baltic states appears to be increasingly untenable, especially given growing world concern about the brutally repressive measures used by the Soviet Union, particularly in Lithuania. </PARA>
<PARA> International measures taken so far appear not to have had a great deal of effect upon the Soviet Government. There have been protests from many countries, including Australia. The European Community, in protest against Soviet violence, deliberately postponed a meeting on economic cooperation with that country and it was recently no doubt a factor in the postponement of the US-USSR summit. Stronger action certainly seems to be required to ensure that President Gorbachev fully realises that the use of military force against the small but fiercely independent nations cannot be tolerated. </PARA>
<PARA> The Lithuanian people have clearly demonstrated their current and continuing determination to again have full and proper independent status. This was clearly shown in a recent plebiscite when, despite the duress applied by the occupying power, 84 per cent of those eligible to vote turned out defiantly to cast their ballots in what resulted in over 90 per cent of the voters favouring independence. </PARA>
<PARA> Since then, Iceland, on 12 February, became the first nation since the current crisis to recognise Lithuania as an independent state. This is a courageous precedent and a fine example to be followed, hopefully by the rest of the world. I call upon the Australian Government to move to the same position as soon as possible in accordance with the motion now before the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the last four days we have witnessed what can only be described as a shameful attack by the Government and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) on the Opposition and on the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). Why do I say shameful? Because what we have witnessed is an attempt to distort and, indeed, stifle debate through wholesale misrepresentation of what those who disagree with the Minister have said. The Minister has tried this tactic before and has failed, and he will fail again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Before discussing the impact of this sordid tactic, let me first demonstrate the hypocrisy of the Minister for Employment, Education and Training on this matter of public debate. In a speech in November last year, the Minister made the following extraordinary statement:</PARA>
<PARA>In Australia today there is an urgent need for robust discussion on education.</PARA>
<PARA>Did honourable members hear that? The Minister wants robust discussion. He then said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I cannot help asking myself, where are the other views?</PARA>
<PARA>So the Minister wants to hear other views. He then had this to say-and this takes the cake:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . why is it that any such comment from the other side is nearly always reactive . . . </PARA>
<PARA>So the Minister wants those opposed to his policies not to be reactive but to initiate debate. Let me say that there is an army of people opposed to his policies. Then, with breathtaking innocence, he asked:</PARA>
<PARA>What are the causes of this comparative silence?</PARA>
<PARA>Well, Minister, I rise today to say that the education debate in this country has been damaged by the shameless misrepresentation of views and bully boy tactics which have characterised the Government's approach. I have no doubt that some have been intimidated. I recall the vicious attack on Professor Caro last year when he questioned the amalgamations process. I recall the Minister's description of those who gave critical testimony to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training as `malcontents'. The Minister's tactics failed then, and they will fail now. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition was doing exactly what the Minister called for. He was initiating debate. The Leader of the Opposition made it abundantly clear that he was not announcing policy but simply drawing attention to alternatives which have been suggested in public debate. His comments on vouchers were couched explicitly as a reference to radical proposals suggested by others-specifically, the Institute of Public Affairs and the Centre for Independent Studies. In his speech he warned:</PARA>
<PARA>Some in the media will undoubtedly be tempted to run away and say he is making policy on the run. I'm not. </PARA>
<PARA>The Leader of the Opposition went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>It is essential that political leaders be able to raise issues and stimulate effective debate in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>Let there be no doubt that after eight years of the Hawke Labor Government such a debate is long overdue. Last year the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training had this to say about higher education after eight years of Labor Government:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the central consideration in reforming higher education must be the quality of the education which students receive . . . The preoccupation with the way the system operates, rather than what is intended to achieve, has excluded these issues from the agenda of debate. </PARA>
<PARA>A committee headed by a Labor senator blew the whistle on a Minister more interested in bright ideas and grand plans than in their impact on quality. Who can forget the Minister's gross over-reaction, or Senator Aulich's timely response? Senator Aulich said:</PARA>
<PARA>I will not be bludgeoned into silence . . . The Minister ought to come out of the bunker and participate in an exchange of ideas. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what someone on his own side thinks of the Minister's love of public debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us turn to schools. In the wake of November's Special Premiers Conference, the Labor Premier of Queensland, Mr Wayne Goss, used three words to describe the Minister's performance: `Incompetent and arrogant'. What more can be said? From the Minister I offer his own statement to the November conference to which I have already referred. I quote the Minister's own words:</PARA>
<PARA>Our schools are in crisis . . . there has never been a greater questioning by parents, teachers and employers of where our schools are going. </PARA>
<PARA>Last week in a media release he repeated this claim and added, `The morale of teachers has never been lower'. If this is the legacy that the Minister and his Labor predecessors have left us after eight years in government, then he would do well indeed to heed the calls of Senator Aulich and come out of his bunker. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has long recognised the worsening crisis of confidence in our schools. There are solutions to this crisis. The Government has failed to adopt them. Indeed, it has opposed them at every turn. There are two alternative strategies to address this crisis. One is the Government's. It is a strategy based on strengthening centralised regulation of schools-government and non-government schools. It is a strategy based on centralisation of industrial relations and the creation of mega-unions in education, as elsewhere. There is another strategy which could be adopted, a strategy of genuine micro-reform in education, a strategy to enlist the motivations, the interests, of those whom the schools are there to serve-the parents of Australia and their children. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's parents are clearly not satisfied. Many have sought to exercise their right to choose a school by moving their children from government schools to the non-government sector. The Government has, frankly, tried to make this exercise of choice as difficult as possible, as difficult as it has dared. But as for the parents of government schoolchildren, they also have a right to choose. They have a right to be able to choose their child's school. They have a right to proper comparative information about the standards of educational achievement of their children, for they care about the quality of their children's education more than anyone else. Under the Government's strategy they are shut out. They are told, `Stand aside; the bureaucrats and the unions will take care of the schools; you stay out'. </PARA>
<PARA> For two days running in this House, the Minister has derided the right of parents to choose their school. Ultimately, the parents of this country will demand a proper say in the schools that their children attend. It is the children of the most disadvantaged parts of this country who will benefit from this change. The teachers will benefit, for instead of relying on the union muscle which has failed them, they will have the support of an involved and caring community of parents behind them. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the debate on schooling that Australia needs, and out of this debate community confidence in schools can be restored, the morale of teachers can be lifted, and opportunities can be opened for all Australian children to have the quality of education to which they are entitled. </PARA>

<TITLE>Housing-Unemployment Benefit</TITLE>
<SPEECH PAGE="1115" SPEAKER="O'Neil Mr L.R.T." NAMEID="DE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GREY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DE4">Mr O'NEIL</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Grey)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(12.39)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to draw to the attention of the House the need for urgent changes to be made to the legislation concerning the 12-week suspension incurred by people on unemployment benefit when they move to areas of low employment. As all members present would be aware, most rural and country areas of Australia would be classed as areas where prospects of employment are low. My electorate of Grey in South Australia is such an area. I am being inundated with calls from people who have been advised to move to country areas where accommodation is more readily available, there are shorter waiting lists and where, in most cases, the accommodation is less costly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Accommodation is at a premium in metropolitan areas. For example, I have been advised that there is a minimum waiting period of six years for State government housing in metropolitan Adelaide. Private rental accommodation is at extremely high levels. The money diverted from the family budget for private rental could be better utilised for everyday essentials, especially where there are small children involved. Consequently, when a person on unemployment benefit is advised that there is cheap government housing available in country regions, that person will automatically seize the chance to better his or her family's living standards by moving house. </PARA>
<PARA> Any person living on a tight budget is continually looking for ways to stretch his or her limited income. These people are not indulging in life's luxuries but are battling on a daily basis to make ends meet. This is not the first time I have voiced my concern on this issue. I previously brought this matter to the attention of the Department of Social Security and as a result of my inquiries a small note was placed in the right hand corner of the unemployment benefit form lodged by applicants. This note is inserted just prior to question 6. Question 6 asked: did you change your home address? The note appearing in small print states:</PARA>
<PARA>Moving to an area with lower employment prospects could mean no payment for 12 weeks. If you are thinking of moving, check with the CES first. </PARA>
<PARA>The addition of this note has not reduced the high incidence of people approaching me for assistance when they are subsequently cut off from the unemployment benefit. The majority have moved to the country after being advised by the State government authorities that housing is readily available for themselves and their families. The note is not readily notice- able and can be easily missed, especially by the long term unemployed who fill out this form on a regular basis and who would tend to skip over the addition of a small note. </PARA>
<PARA> This situation is not unique to my electorate as discussions with my colleagues indicate that it is a widespread and thoroughly terrible situation throughout all country regions. I have had a number of cases brought to my attention where the suspension of unemployment benefit has been applied. One such instance was that of a young couple, both in their late teens, who were residing in the metropolitan area, sharing private accommodation with other young couples. The people with whom they were sharing were taking part in nightly alcoholic and drug abuse sessions. As they did not want to join in or be involved in any part of these activities, they needed to extricate themselves from this high risk situation at the earliest opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> Upon application for State government accommodation, authorities advised the young couple that immediate housing was available to them in Whyalla. After travelling to Whyalla and preparing to move into their new home, they were then advised by the Department of Social Security that their benefits had been suspended. This placed them in severe financial difficulty. Their only other alternative was to move back to the metropolitan area, with the prospect of obtaining accommodation virtually nil, or moving back into the potentially dangerous situation from which they had removed themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> A further instance, and one very similar to an appeal won last year, was that of a married couple. The couple's decision to move to another area was based on the husband having been in trouble with the law. The man and the woman were unable to cope with the stress of their situation and the woman was placed under medical care for a nervous condition which was a direct result of her husband's circumstances. The couple were advised by their medical practitioner and a specialist to move away from the area. A request for a transfer through State housing was made. The couple were advised that there was no vacant alternative accommodation in the metropolitan area but immediate State housing was available in the country regions of the State. </PARA>
<PARA> Bearing in mind the medical advice received and with medical certificates to back up the advice, upon applying for unemployment benefit an immediate 12-week suspension was applied to the couple's unemployment benefit. Their only alternative was to move back to the metropolitan area or to wait for 12 weeks for recommencement of benefits. No State government accommodation would be available to the couple in the metro- politan vicinity. The cost to relocate to the country had exhausted the family's limited budget and private rental in the metropolitan region was costly. The suspension of benefits for a 12-week period could very well have seen this man reoffending in an attempt to provide essentials for his family. </PARA>
<PARA> These are only two instances of the numerous complaints that I have encountered regarding this legislation. I can fully appreciate the need for control regarding the payment of social security benefits to genuine job seekers. However, I feel that a person's individual circumstances when moving to another area must be taken into account. Many are not even aware that by moving they risk the loss of their benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> Many people find themselves unable to obtain employment in the competitive job market, yet are continually seeking work. The plight of the homeless is one we as a government are addressing, yet we penalise a person who, by finding accommodation, reduces his job prospects. It is interesting to note that a significant number of appeals are being overturned. The main reason the tribunal is overturning the suspension of benefits is that individual circumstances are not taken into account from the first instance. I firmly believe we must ascertain the reasons behind a person moving to an area before making harsh decisions regarding that person's social security benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> It must also be borne in mind that not everyone understands that the right to appeal exists under the Social Security Act. Many families accept the first decision as final. I am aware that the recent amendments to existing legislation will alleviate some of the problem areas. However, the real issue, the real crux of the problem, has not been addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation is causing hardship to a great number of unemployed people who, for numerous reasons, are moving to new areas. Many families who are affected by the rule are already significantly disadvantaged. The need to assess each case on its individual merit is vital if we as a government are genuine about helping those people in real need. It seems to me quite ironic that, when we have in today's society this huge drift of people from country and regional Australia to the metropolitan area, we are not addressing this huge problem. </PARA>
<PARA> If there is housing available in country and regional areas and people can utilise that housing, surely we have a responsibility to assist people to acquire adequate housing and take into consideration the housing needs of people. I am pleased to see that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) is at the table. I hope that he takes on board some of the things that I have raised here today. It is a genuine problem; it is a genuine concern. I think this House has a responsibility to house properly and adequately those people that are in genuine need of housing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A plague has been visited upon this country. It stretches from east to west over 2,000 miles or more from the east coast of this country through Victoria and South Australia, right across to Western Australia. It affects the lives and well-being of more than five million people. It is presided over by a line of Labor State governments. The plague that I am talking about is a level of financial incompetence and mismanagement unparalleled in Australia's history. It is large even by world standards. All of this on top of the failed economic policies of the Hawke-Keating Labor Federal Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have seen the demoralisation of the people in Victoria by the Cain-Kirner Australian Labor Party (ALP) Government with the collapse of the Victorian Economic Development Corporation, the Victorian Division of the National Safety Council, Victorian Equity Trustees, Workcare, the Pyramid-Farrow Group and the Tricontinental royal commission. The State Bank of Victoria-the fifth largest bank in Australia, with over four million cheque and savings accounts, 12,500 employees and with net assets of $1.8 billion-ended up being sold to the Commonwealth Bank for $1.6 billion. There is a State debt at last count in excess of $34,000m and growing. </PARA>
<PARA> In Western Australia, of course, we have seen a long progression of financial mismanagement by the Burke, Dowding and Lawrence Labor governments. We now have a royal commission into Western Australia Inc. Under the terms of reference the royal commission will inquire whether there has been corruption, illegal conduct or improper conduct into a number of financial debacles in that State. I could run through those terms of reference but they are widely known to the public and the public is aware of the financial mismanagement of that State. </PARA>
<PARA> We now have in South Australia mismanagement by the Australian Labor Party President, Premier Bannon. A royal commission has been set up to inquire into the workings and operations of the State Bank of South Australia, which has non-performing loans of $2.5 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to address a couple of comments that were made in the Australian Financial Review of Monday, 18 February 1991 about this debacle in South Australia. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . SA Treasury officials have confirmed that as far back as three years ago, after investigations in late 1988, they alerted Premier John Bannon to potential problems within the State Bank of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>I now quote the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin)-`the outspoken Stephen Martin', as he is described in the Australian Financial Review:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . despite being a politician of the same colour-</PARA>
<PARA>and I presume that that is a faction-</PARA>
<PARA>as the SA Labor Premier-believes that Bannon has to accept the blame for the downfall of his $15.4 billion State bank. </PARA>
<PARA>I quote the honourable member for Macarthur again:</PARA>
<PARA> Bannon has already said the problem was he wanted the bank to be at arm's length from the Government. But you should never be at arm's length when you are dealing with the people's money. </PARA>
<PARA>This gives a clear indication of where the blame for those non-performing loans should rest. </PARA>
<PARA> Why raise these points at this time? The Federal Parliament should have a record of the lack of competence of the Hawke ALP Government and the State governments of Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia, particularly in the financial area, so that future generations will understand what went wrong in Australia during the Labor Party's reign in the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA> One might say that the Hawke-ALP Government has no role to play in this issue; but it does. I want to read to the House the words of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) when he made his second reading speech on the Commonwealth Banks Restructuring Bill 1990. He was referring, of course, to the Commonwealth Bank's purchase of the State Bank of Victoria. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is Australia's fifth largest bank with extensive liabilities overseas, and a loss of confidence in it would have threatened the very stability of Australia's financial system. </PARA>
<PARA>I want honourable members to note carefully the following words of the Treasurer:</PARA>
<PARA>This was a situation which the Commonwealth Government could not allow to occur. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Commonwealth has accepted the responsibility and could not allow a State bank to get into a situation where people lost confidence. It is an acceptance by the Federal Treasurer that he does have a role in the State banking institutions of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> People will ask, and will continue to ask, `Why must I suffer because of the incompetence and financial stupidity of various ALP governments throughout this country?'. It has had a dramatic effect throughout the length and breadth of this country, particularly in those three States that I have mentioned-Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia-with unemployment figures increasing on a daily basis, industries and businesses closing, and higher bankruptcies than we have seen for many, many years in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I think what we need to do is to look at what has happened. What has happened is that the economic policies of this Government have created only one growth industry in this country. The growth industry that I am referring to is in the insolvency and legal professions. There is quite strong growth in those areas, as people try to attend to the problems of an economy which has been severely damaged by the economic policies of the Hawke-Keating Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The royal commissions are in full flight in each State that I have mentioned: in Victoria, there is a royal commission into Tricontinental; there is now one in South Australia, a royal commission into the State Bank; and, of course, in Western Australia there is a royal commission into WA Inc. The legal fees, particularly for a Queen's Counsel at those royal commissions-and there will be plenty of them-can reach as high as $1,100 per day. The second ranking legal advice to those royal commissions could run to at least $1,000 a day. Honourable members can see the additional expense that is being caused by the Labor governments in those three States and the impost on those States and the people who reside there. </PARA>
<PARA> The receivers and liquidators throughout the length and breadth of this country are thriving at the moment because of the difficulties in which people are finding themselves as a result of the failed policies not only of the three State governments but also of the Federal Government. The bottom line in this plague, in all of these financial debacles, is that Labor governments cannot manage people's money. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For some years the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation has been afflicted with a series of bungles which have not only seriously embarrassed the ministerial head of the CSIRO, but also had the effect of causing a dramatic loss of morale amongst employees of Australia's premier research organisation, the CSIRO.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The latest bungle concerns the imminent decision by the CSIRO to relocate the 15-member staff of the Division of Tropical Animal Production at the CSIRO's Davies Laboratory at Townsville out of the tropics to Brisbane. The particular reason given by the CSIRO for this proposal is lack of resources. Put simply, the CSIRO claims that it does not have the money to operate its Division of Tropical Animal Production in the tropics. Not only is this claim false, but it illustrates an almost total lack of leadership on the part of the CSIRO at its highest levels. </PARA>
<PARA> The disadvantages of the proposed decision by the CSIRO to abolish the Division of Tropical Animal Production at Townsville are many. The loss of contact with industry in tropical regions in turn leads to reduced understanding of the severity of the problems in tropical regions. Future contact with advisory services would be reduced. This, in turn, would lead to reduced application of results of research. </PARA>
<PARA> At a time when Australia's primary industries are reeling against the onslaught of unprecedented economic adversity, the decision to abandon a permanent tropical animal research facility in the tropics is incomprehensible and unforgivable. More than half of the national cattle herd is located from Rockhampton north. The cattle industry of northern Australia constitutes one of the nation's best economic assets. The maintenance of this asset, with support from research and development, and the application of that research, is of paramount national importance. </PARA>
<PARA> Townsville has been the centre of tropical animal research since the CSIRO established the Davies Laboratory in 1962. Its early pioneering work covered a variety of research, including the effect of animal production through improved pastures in a tropical environment. Shortly after it was established, one of the leading research scientists, Mr Les Edye, and other scientists at the laboratory, were responsible for the development of new legumes, many from South America, which, through pastoral improvement, have dramatically increased cattle production in the tropics. I believe that they have added hundreds of millions of dollars to the value of the cattle industry in northern Australia. In addition, the scientists at the CSIRO laboratory in Townsville have conducted extensive research into improving calving and growth rates of cattle, mineral nutrition and the use of tropical legumes as feed supplements. </PARA>
<PARA> The success of the research work of the Division of Tropical Animal Production at Townsville has brought international renown to its research scientists, particularly Dr Jim Hogan. Their expertise is unmatched elsewhere in Australia. CSIRO research staff at Townsville have a highly productive record of collaborative research with the Graduate School of Tropical Veterinary Science and Agriculture at James Cook University in relation to beef cattle production. The skills and facilities of both organisations have complemented each other and have led to the efficient use of research funds and resources. This link will now be severed. In addition, staff at James Cook University and the CSIRO have been involved in the presentation of scientific lectures-in their fields of research expertise-to graduate students undertaking master of science programs in tropical veterinary science and tropical agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA> Research carried out at the Davies Laboratory in Townsville has been used to advantage by Australia's near neighbours who reside in countries with climates and conditions identical to that found in tropical Australia. CSIRO staff also assist with the supervision of research projects undertaken by graduate students, and a number of them hold honorary positions within the university. If this policy decision to disband the division at Townsville is pursued, then this expertise would be lost. </PARA>
<PARA> The loss of the Division of Tropical Animal Production from the tropics would also reduce the number of research workers in northern Australia with expertise in animal production. Good research work evolves from the opportunities of researchers to talk with each other and to discuss ideas. Once the scientists from the Division of Tropical Animal Production leave north Queensland-outside of James Cook University, and there will be fewer than 10 scientists involved in tropical animal research who live and work in north Queensland, and probably none elsewhere in northern Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> If CSIRO pursues this bone-headed decision to close down the Division of Tropical Animal Production in Townsville, it will earn the contempt and disgust of the grazing, scientific and academic communities of north Queensland, and it will be conclusive proof that this Government cannot sincerely claim to be genuinely interested in the promotion of research into primary industries in northern Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I make this further point regarding the collaborative research effort at the Townsville laboratories. The CSIRO Davies Laboratory, James Cook University and the Queensland Department of Primary Industries work together in a way which is internationally unique. No other developed country has a similar set of research institutes in the tropics. </PARA>
<PARA> For some years now the Division of Tropical Animal Production at the CSIRO laboratory at Townsville has been starved of funds by CSIRO head office. It has been suggested that this change of policy was introduced because of an emphasis on funding divisions concerned with manufacturing to the detriment of divisions concerned with primary industries. As a consequence, primary industry divisions were required to make good their shortfall from external funds. </PARA>
<PARA> To exacerbate matters for the division in Townsville, Federal Government policy in the late 1980s encouraged all CSIRO divisions to try to obtain 30 per cent of funds from external sources. In plain English, they were required to scrounge around the community, begging for funds to carry out vital research work demanded of them by government, by the CSIRO and by the cattle industry. This situation has now deteriorated to the level where many CSIRO divisions concerned with primary industries cannot fulfil their charter to conduct basic and applied research into major problems affecting Australia's primary industry. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable members are disgusted by the proposed decision to abandon tropical animal production facilities in the tropics, then they would be furious to learn that the Liberal-National parties propose even greater destruction to CSIRO than the public realise. On 30 August 1990, an article appeared in the Canberra Times with the shock headline, `Coalition considers disbanding CSIRO'. The article went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Opposition will consider disbanding the nation's premier scientific research body, the CSIRO, under a new policy review.</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition spokesman on science and technology, Peter McGauran, told the National Science Forum in Canberra yesterday that the Coalition was embarking on a reassessment of the appropriateness of the `current institutional structure' in which scientific and technological research was undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA>The article went on:</PARA>
<PARA>A spokesman for Mr McGauran later said the direction of the review might lead to the disbanding of the CSIRO. </PARA>
<PARA>What a contemptible, irresponsible attitude to primary industry research in Australia. No wonder the people of northern Australia, particularly in the rural communities, academics, and research and technical workers, have lost faith in the Liberal and National parties. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is the only developed country which can carry out tropical research in its own territory. The proposed decision to move the Tropical Animal Production Division to Brisbane goes contrary to every sound principle of academic research management. Australia cannot afford to let this happen. I despair of the lack of imagination and vision evident behind this decision. </PARA>
<PARA> The former head of the School of Tropical Veterinary Science, Professor Rod Campbell, has written to Dr Alan Donald, the Director of the Institute of Animal Production, CSIRO, Canberra, saying:</PARA>
<PARA>It is distressing to learn again that scientists actually working in the tropics, with tropical production systems, are in danger of transfer to Brisbane. Senior administrators seem able to think in one direction only. The Brisbane line mentality is alive and well. </PARA>
<PARA>Madam Deputy Speaker, you are right in what I have heard you say before: the Brisbane line mentality is alive and well. Closing the Townsville site of the Division of Tropical Animal Production and moving it to Brisbane will be explained by those who want it to happen as having the advantage of concentrating resources in one place. But what it loses for Australia is having in situ, on site, a tropical research facility that is unique in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Everything that needs to be done should be done to secure the continued existence of the CSIRO's Division of Tropical Animal Production at Davies Laboratory. These facilities must remain in the tropics where they belong. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I grieve today for the pain, the tragedy and the loss caused by the recession in this country-the recession we had to have, according to the present Treasurer (Mr Keating); the recession engineered by the Treasurer and the Government-as is acknowledged on all sides by informed commentators, not just this Opposition-with the main factor being the 18 months of sustained very high interest rates to January 1990.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I grieve too for the other dreadful legacy of the Hawke Government's economic failure-the vast overseas debt. At last count, this was $156.3 billion in gross terms compared to about $30 billion when this Government came to power-more than a five-fold increase. This debt undermines the living standards of this country and will undermine those of our children too, unless we really come to terms with it. This debt constrains the future development of the country because of the mounting interest bill for servicing the debt-in the order of $50m a day. We have to borrow that to pay the interest. This debt also makes Australia very vulnerable to external shocks like the emerging world recession and falls in commodity prices. </PARA>
<PARA> One measure of the loss caused by the recession is the loss of output. The recorded fall in total national production to the end of last September was already a cumulative 2 per cent. Even if there is a beginning to a recovery in the second half of the 1991 calendar year, that loss of output would amount, over a year, to $8 billion-about the same as a year's spending on defence or what is annually spent on aged pensions. That is the measure of the potential production lost forever because of the ineptitude of the Government's policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The pain and the tragedy of the recession is, firstly, in the destruction of the life's work of many a small business person, with the number of companies going into receivership having doubled over the past year. As a Monash study released in the new year, put it, `The corporate damage attributable to the current recession is devastating', inflicting `a horrendous social cost'. That cost, pain and tragedy is especially in the growth of unemployment, and I want to focus on that. Jobs have been lost over the past six to seven months at a rate of upwards of 1,000 a day. Let the Parliament and the people out there listening to this broadcast really take that on board. Jobs have been-are being-lost at the rate of 1,000 a day. Since the first part of last year more than 250,000 jobs have been lost, contributing to a total unemployment figure of the order of 750,000. The increase in unemployment from December to January, the latest figures, seasonally adjusted, was 26,800. Honourable members can see from that figure that more than 1,000 jobs are lost per working day. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the effect of this recession that the Government has created. Only yesterday, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer, under continual Opposition questioning, expressed their concern and sympathy. They have stood there day after day, continually harping on the theme that since they came to office there has been, until about a year ago, an increase of 1 1/2 million jobs. That is a very good thing, and we all acknowledge that. But now, unhappily, the process is very much in reverse. </PARA>
<PARA> As I expressed in a previous grievance debate as far back as May 1989, and as the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) have stressed in recent days, there has been a heavy price to pay for that job growth. In particular, the five-fold burgeoning of the overseas debt, to which I have just referred, was directly associated with the forcing of the pace of economic growth to provide those jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> While I have been over this ground before, there are other aspects of that point that is continually made by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer that need to be emphasised. The first point is that employment growth has always been relatively rapid in Australia-much higher than the average for the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. For example, in the 20 years from 1968, employment growth in Australia averaged 2.5 per cent per annum, compared to just one per cent for the total OECD-which is, among other things, associated with the very rapid growth in population. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point is that it has not just been confined to the period of office of this Government. Strong employment growth has been evident over the whole period since World War II-in the 1950s, 1960s and the early 1970s. I would like to stress that this was also so under the oft-criticised Fraser Government, with the honourable member for Bennelong as Treasurer. Under that Government it is true that growth in employment was slow at first as the economy was bent back into shape after the destructive Whitlam years. But from 1979 there was strong growth, generating some 530,000 jobs over the period of the Government, to the cyclical peak of September 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> That was robust growth-comparable to that of recent years under this Hawke Government but, of course, never acknowledged by it. It was cut short by the severe 1981-82 drought, the onset of world recession and the wages mayhem led by the metal unions, with plenty of support from the whole gang-the present Prime Minister, then only recently translated from the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Messrs Dolan, Crean, Kelty, Carmichael and the lot. </PARA>
<PARA> Until this current recession, since the coming to power of the Hawke Government there was no such major interruption to growth. That could not be said to be due to the ministrations of that Government. The situation was the same in the United States, the United Kingdom and the world generally: continuing employment growth with a prolonged worldwide upswing in business activity until about a year ago. Since 1983 it has not been peculiar to Australia; it has been worldwide. </PARA>
<PARA> What I think also needs to be recognised is that, whereas job growth under the Fraser Government was soundly based on resource development as its motor force, under the Hawke Government growth benefited in the early stages from the bounce back from the recession, the breaking of the drought and the Fraser wages pause, and then we had this growth on `tick' so to speak. That is, there was a large degree of force-feeding of demand by the Budget deficit. Subsequently, in 1987-88 we had excessively loose monetary policy-admittedly, combined with a strong upswing in the terms of trade-which led to the subsequent dramatic overheating of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point relates to unemployment. The facts are that on average the level of unemployment, despite the job growth, has been higher under this Government than under the previous Government and now is burgeoning at the tragic rate of 1,000 a day, on course to 9 to 10 per cent of the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> Meanwhile, notwithstanding all the pain of the recession, the other legacy of failure-the overseas debt-continues to climb. That is because, as the latest balance of payments figures, which were so lauded complacently but falsely by the Treasurer, make clear, the current account deficit is clearly stalled at the still-too-high level of around 4 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), despite the recession. There is no doubt there was an improvement on the levels of 1989 of about $2 billion per month to an average of about $1.3 billion per month, but it is stalled there. In fact, the latest figure was $1.7 billion. But it is stalled at a level of about 4 per cent. At that level the foreign debt will continue to climb and the country will continue to borrow heavily, going further into hock, at a rate of about $50m a day, just to pay the interest on the existing debt. </PARA>
<PARA> What I would stress is that the ill-judged, sustained high interest rates not only reduced consumer demand, but also affected investment in new and replacement productive capacity, particularly in export and import replacing industries. That means that any significant recovery of the economy will soon run into the same capacity and balance of payments roadblocks as before, repeating the cycle. </PARA>
<PARA> What is required is a consistent, sound monetary and fiscal policy-beginning with a mini-Budget as soon as possible-for lower inflation and interest rates and a competitive exchange rate, along with fundamental reform of the industrial relations system to permit and encourage enterprise bargaining, major and urgent micro-economic reforms especially in transport and the waterfront, and tax reform, particularly the implementing of a goods and services tax. </PARA>

<TITLE>Logan City: Public Transport</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I grieve today for the people of Logan City, whom I know Madam Deputy Speaker also knows, and the fact that here we have one of the largest growing cities in Australia, 130,000 people, with no public transport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Surely any council that had any concern for its citizens would, in fact, investigate the matter and look to the provision of such services. Certainly it is true that there is a State suburban train running through the middle of the city, which in fact helps to perpetuate a situation of division. But what that provision means is that unless people live within walking distance of those train stations, or have jobs on industrial estates that are close to those railway stations, their access to a whole range of services is, indeed, very limited. </PARA>
<PARA> One would have to ask about the implications for a city of 130,000 people who have no public transport-of course, the implications are enormous. It means that, at the very first level, the implications for access to work and access to employment are severely limited. People need to walk, bicycle, hitch rides with people, or buy however many cars are needed in the family to facilitate gaining access to their work. One way in which people sometimes manage is that they get a taxi to a nearby railway station and then go on to work. However, this, of course, meets with a huge outcry from a whole range of citizens who believe that people living in our poorer and less well-served areas should not enjoy the aspects of a taxi service. They fail to consider that, if there is no other means of transport, the use of such a taxi service is vital and essential. </PARA>
<PARA> It also creates barriers in terms of recreation, so that recreation facilities are not always available to the whole range of people within the city. It means that unless one lives close to some of the services that are available, they become virtually inaccessible to one. So we have a proliferation of a number of services. For example, in an attempt to overcome the transport barrier, we have a range of soccer clubs, community groups and other things, all of which provide smaller services for people and which are extremely local. </PARA>
<PARA> But more importantly, Logan City as a whole, because it is also cut in half by the Pacific Highway on the main route from Brisbane to the Gold Coast, is a very divided city. It is not only physically divided-that city has now become socially and psychologically divided. In fact, we have one part of the highway where services seem to have been provided at a much higher rate by the local city council. On one side of the highway we have much better servicing in terms of kerbing, guttering, roads and, indeed, even gardens and gardening, all of which I agree with, and which go to make a much better environment for people to live in. But in the older part of the city we are still waiting for many streets to be curbed and guttered after 20 to 25 years, which seems an extraordinary situation when one side of the city is so well serviced that money can be found for gardens. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as those sorts of factors, transport, of course, also impinges on a whole range of other activities, some of which relate to schooling, training and education. Eighteen months ago we greeted the opening of the Logan College of Technical and Further Education, which was an excellent provision and which was welcomed by everybody within the city. Fortunately, it was placed next-door to a railway station, which was a very worthwhile thing to do. But, unfortunately, yet again, access to the college is limited for very many people in the Logan City area-particularly sole parents, of whom there are 4,000-who want to take advantage of the college and the kind of courses which it offers. </PARA>
<PARA> If they are not car drivers or do not live close to a railway station, then access to the college becomes virtually impossible. So, while the college certainly has no shortage of takers, we would like to see the kind of barriers which lack of transport creates broken down to ensure that the college is open to everybody and that everybody has an opportunity to go there. </PARA>
<PARA> One may ask, `What then does this city council do if, in fact, it provides no public transport for people within the confines of its city and the provision of services such as kerbing, guttering and general road maintenance is somewhat limited and often a scattergun approach is adopted?'. I think there are very many people who, in the lead-up to the elections which are to be held on 23 March, are also asking themselves that question. What we do know is that the Logan City Council has a great propensity for publishing very beautiful and very glossy pamphlets and leaflets about itself. We have lots of large pictures about the Council and about its various committees, but we have never actually been able to quite ascertain what some of them do. </PARA>
<PARA> We saw a pamphlet in relation to a great tree planting project-very worth while, very commendable and very essential. But most of that has not quite come to fruition. In fact, it is quite extraordinary to think that two or three years ago the very same city council rejected a Federal Government grant for the provision of 5,000 trees to the city simply because it came from the Federal Government. It was quite an extraordinary situation. Indeed, Logan City's record on the environment is somewhat to be questioned. As many people may know, there was a toxic waste situation in Diamond Street in part of the city. </PARA>
<PARA> It was only by applying constant pressure to the Goss State Government that eventually action was taken. We did, in fact, see one of the leaders of the demonstrations against a range of State and local government factors to get something done and to get recognition that toxic waste was in fact in Logan City ultimately placed under a medical health Act. Fortuitously, she has now been released, her home has been purchased, she has moved elsewhere and we have seen some realisation of the toxic waste. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout that very early campaign, and throughout the work to acknowledge that there actually was toxic waste, we had the Council actually fighting against the demonstrators and saying it was a nonsense, they would bring discredit upon the city and that what they were saying was actual lies. So we did not actually see any movements there. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, Logan City, historically being a large housing commission and cheap housing area, has also in fact had quite a high level of unemployment. One of the areas people would think the Council would be very active in is the area of job creation. When the Federal Government suggested that Logan City might like to have the only information technology centre in Australia out of the central business district, the Council rejected a three-quarters of a million dollar grant. The mind just boggles. In the same sort of way it was also instrumental in ensuring that the local SkillShare project was moved from the premises where it was because it thought it lowered the tone of the area or some other such thing. It had no recognition of the kind of work which was actually being done by the SkillShare project in pursuing job opportunities and job training for a whole range of people in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> So we can see its record in terms of job creation which would benefit the city in the long term because, of course, if people are working, they are more able to participate fully in the community, they have a larger disposable income and they are more able to pay their rates-which, I might add, are very high in Logan City for what one may question are very, very limited social services. </PARA>
<PARA> We also saw opposition from this particular City Council to a new government building which would provide better services to citizens through the Department of Social Security and the Commonwealth Employment Service. But no; it was opposed to that as well. So I grieve for the people of Logan City, but I also hope that they will recognise the kind of very poor services-in transport, in people services, in a whole range of areas-which have failed to be delivered to them by the current members of Logan City Council and that they will take the appropriate action to ensure for themselves and for the city as a whole that a better deal is had for everybody. I know they can take that action on 23 March. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the opportunity in this debate to raise a matter that has come to my notice in recent times, that is, what many people are beginning to believe is a duplication in the operation of SkillShare, technical and further education (TAFE) and adult community education generally. This is a matter that has been brought to my attention by a number of my constituents-I think principally by those who, as taxpayers, feel that their money should be spent in a way that would give the best results so far as our unemployed people are concerned. I refer not only to the unemployed or the employed, but also to the employer who seeks to get employees with a rather sound knowledge of the work that they are going to do, particularly in manufacturing industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I appreciate, of course, that the Government has fronted the employment situation, particularly so far as the younger group in the community are concerned, by the encouragement of SkillShare and by looking at the problem from a short term point of view. Therefore, I recognise the work that is being done by the organisation. The Commonwealth Employment Service suggests to people that they should avail themselves of the opportunity to go to SkillShare and receive a certain type of education. </PARA>
<PARA> It does seem that there is beginning to be a duplication with regard to the programs of SkillShare, TAFE and adult education generally. It has also come to my notice that even in the case of, say, Sydney University, the private institutions and Sydney TAFE, there is a duplication, even in that higher field, of many of the programs that have been set down by the education departments. </PARA>
<PARA> I appreciate the fact that we are dealing with education in a field that is sponsored not only by the Commonwealth, but also by the State to a very great degree. So far as SkillShare is concerned, it is complemented by the local community business houses, we trust, and by other groups within the community. There are also local committees. In fact, I would like to see many more business houses and other professional people become involved in education schemes for the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter has been brought to my notice because in recent times I have had approaches from SkillShare committees within my electorate which are very short of accommodation. Keeping in mind the fact that the active employment strategy program is to take place from 1 July, which means that it is anticipated that even over one year there will be at least 75,000 people who may avail themselves of the opportunity to participate in SkillShare programs, it is clear that extra accommodation will be needed. </PARA>
<PARA> I have written to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) asking whether it is the intention of the Government to purchase and provide actual accommodation for the operation of SkillShare programs. I am anxious to know this because places like Nelson Bay, within my electorate-and there is no large TAFE college there-are most anxious to obtain accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA> The same problem has been witnessed at Taree, where we have had a somewhat very heated discussion between SkillShare and the greater Taree City Council over the accommodation aspect there. This is because SkillShare is located within a residential area and it needs to expand. If SkillShare is to expand, as intended under the program of active employment strategy, it is necessary for the Commonwealth to realise that the matter of accommodation faces these particular people. </PARA>
<PARA> I say that there is a duplication because, from what I can see, there is a duplication and I believe that there should be a thorough review, perhaps conducted by someone outside the area, but incorporating the local communities that are active-the principals of the colleges, the chairmen of SkillShare, and other people within the community who should be in a position to advise the authorities as to the better way to prevent the duplication. </PARA>
<PARA> We see a certain fragmentation there now, one that will develop more in the future. So I appeal to the Minister to have a look at the situation. First of all, he must realise that it is developing and will continue to develop. Governments should try to find out, by consultation with local people and industry, the direction that the planning should take, from both a Commonwealth and a State point of view. </PARA>
<PARA> I find that the State of New South Wales is now making grants available for some forms of education outside its field. So it is that there is a duplication not only from the programmers, but from both the governments concerned. They have to confer properly, realise the position, and come up with a more satisfactory answer. The whole financial responsibility for this comes back upon the taxpayer. The taxpayer is the person who requires value for the money that is being spent. We see a duplication in many fields of Commonwealth, State and local government. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe this duplication is taking place within the educational field. It is important that these young unemployed-or any unemployed persons-who are undertaking the program not be lead astray in the long term. They should be assisted by way of technical advice and learning different fields, whether it be bartendering, typing, reception work, or anything of that nature. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever changes are made must be in both the short and long term interests of these particular people within the community. SkillShare issues to participants in its program a certificate similar to the one issued by the local TAFE to those who complete a course. The SkillShare program may offer only a smattering of a subject-that is apparently all it is meant to cover. It may advise the student to attend the TAFE after that. </PARA>
<PARA> Some claim that 60 per cent of their people find jobs, but that actually encompasses the people who go on to TAFE, or people who may find only small, part-time jobs within the community. I think that might be a little misleading, having regard to the advice that is given to the public. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not have time to go into this matter in detail, but bearing in mind the economy of this country and our desire to train our young people properly, I appeal to the Government to consider this matter, and interlock this short training period of SkillShare with TAFE, or incorporate them. That is another suggestion-that SkillShare should be located and controlled by TAFE. If there are short term courses available to the public there now, why cannot these programs be incorporated into TAFE itself, on the premises, if the premises are available? This must result in cost savings and be much more successful than what we see at the present time, having regard to the fragmentation and multiplicity of what I believe is actually occurring. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why I say that if Australia is to increase its productivity, if we are to process the natural resources that we have got in Australia, including wool, we must create the programs that will train these people properly and which will ensure that they acquire technical knowledge. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last September, I informed the House of problems existing within the Brisbane City Council area for part pensioners, and the costs they incurred when paying their rates. I would like to remind the House of the information that I presented at that time, which is still current. Full pensioners within the Brisbane City Council receive a 40 per cent rebate on their rates bill. Part pensioners, no matter to what extent they may receive a pension, receive no rebate whatsoever from the Brisbane City Council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last September, I took the opportunity to point out to the House the increased problem that this policy of the Brisbane City Council administration would create, following the introduction of deeming in March this year. Those calls went unheeded by the Brisbane City Council. Yesterday, the Lord Mayor of Brisbane, Alderman Atkinson, had the effrontery in the wake of that to attack the Federal Government, claiming that we had somehow introduced new laws that were going to tax Brisbane ratepayers. Yesterday's Daily Sun had this headline: `Mayor Blasts Feds on New Tax'. The article went on to state that the outraged Lord Mayor would lock horns with the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in Canberra today over the tax which she claimed would send the elderly broke. </PARA>
<PARA> That occurred yesterday. It would have been interesting to have been involved in that discussion, but I followed the course of that discussion today in the Courier-Mail. I noticed that the Courier-Mail reported that the Lord Mayor and the Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson, were working on a compromise to prevent pensioners losing rate discounts. </PARA>
<PARA> I am quite sure that the Lord Mayor had a few of the facts of life explained to her yesterday during that discussion, and had pointed out to her the situation that does exist in the Brisbane City Council, because it is absolutely absurd to suggest that the Federal Government is in any way responsible for what is happening to part pensioners in the area covered by the Brisbane City Council. The Lord Mayor and her Liberal administration have determined that part pensioners will receive no rebate whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> The proof of that matter is not to wait until after 1 March; the proof is to see what the Council is doing now, before deeming is even introduced. One of my constituents has recently suffered at the hands of the Liberal administration's policy in Brisbane. Mr Lettice, a retired pensioner who is 78 years of age, is now in a position where he will have to pay $397.12 more for his rates every year because his pension is reduced by 64c. Because of a 64c reduction in his pension because of other income, he will pay $400 a year more to the Brisbane City Council, and the Lord Mayor of Brisbane has got the hide to come out, only a week or two after that information was presented to her, and claim that the Federal Government is imposing some new tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Lettice, along with hundreds of other pensioners within my electorate, has suffered that additional cost, not because of deeming-because, as everyone in this place knows, deeming has not commenced-but because of the policy adopted by the Liberal administration in the Brisbane City Council. It has nothing at all to do with the Federal Government and certainly nothing to do with the deeming arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation is worse than that because the Brisbane City Council has, in fact, budgeted this year to continue to provide a pension rebate to every one of those full pensioners. So it is planning to give a 40 per cent rebate to all the people who are now on full pensions, some of whom, after deeming commences, will have a lower pension rate but, in fact, a higher personal disposable income because of their savings. The Brisbane City Council is content not only to take money from the part pensioners from whom it currently takes money, but also to make a windfall gain out of pensioners who, in a month's time, are likely to have part of their pension adjusted. To continue to provide the rebate to existing full-rate pensioners would cost the Brisbane City Council not one cent more than they budgeted-not a cent. Yet the Lord Mayor of Brisbane says that the Federal Government is responsible and it is an impost on the pensioner taxpayers and the pensioner ratepayers that has got nothing to do with her. It is squarely in her court. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government has guaranteed to those people in this situation a continuation of the fringe benefits to those current holders of the pharmaceutical and health benefits card. I strongly urge the Brisbane City Council to adopt the same position and provide that guarantee to the pensioners of Brisbane who are currently full-rate pensioners. It will cost the Brisbane City Council not one cent more out of its budget. To fail to do that amounts to the Brisbane City Council's putting its hands into the purses of pensioners and taking money which it never intended to take, which it did not budget to take and which it has no right to take. </PARA>
<PARA> The Brisbane City Council, under a Liberal administration, is trying to make a profit at the pensioners' expense, to have a windfall gain not budgeted for. It then has the hide to turn around and blame the Federal Government. It stands as one of the most brazen political stings we have seen in recent times. It is a real confidence trick. These are the actions of a concerned Lord Mayor in the lead-up to a Brisbane City Council election and why would she not be concerned? She has had a party room revolt over a new dump at Rochedale, massive public discontent about the Council's failure to properly address waste disposal, and now, of course, there are angry pensioners who know she is the one trying to take more money from them. </PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably, the Courier Mail at the end of the story to which I referred continues with the myth that has been perpetuated by the Lord Mayor and by some others, that a group of pensioners are actually going to be worse off by virtue of deeming. Let me put the record straight-the only pensioners who will be worse off after deeming are those unfortunate enough to suffer at the hands of the Liberal Party's policy in the Brisbane City Council area. As has been made abundantly clear by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) and others, pensioners who invest their savings and as a result earn income from those savings and reduce their pension, will have a higher personal disposable income and will continue to receive the fringe benefits guaranteed by the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Those pensioners in Queensland are fortunate enough also to receive the benefit of the senior pensioner card recently introduced by the Goss Labor Government-and an important initiative that was. I might add, in the context of this debate, that the initiative provides for all senior citizens a rebate on their local government rates. The Brisbane City Council, of course, being the largest--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on behalf of retired people whom not all but some Opposition members have been trying to mislead regarding the Government's policy to ease the financial burden on taxpayers by requiring banks to give full value to pensioners with savings over $2,000. People with a lifetime of experience do not lose their marbles just because they are growing older. They are quite capable of appreciating the benefits to the taxpayer-their children and their grandchildren-when they move savings from a savings account with minimal interest to a savings investment account which pays interest of 10 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is not to belittle the discomfort someone can experience when a change is introduced, particularly when the person wishes to enjoy a reprieve from filling in forms after a lifetime of abiding by the laws. Some, too, have more complex investment arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the advantages to all Australians of a government at last tackling the imbalance which will occur as the number of pensioners peaks at the turn of the century while the number of taxpayers funding the pension declines, it is our duty as representatives to ensure that the change causes as little disruption as possible. Opposition members should not make political attacks. They should distribute pensioner information kits; explain the reasons for, and the processes of, deeming; and refer cases of potential hardship to the Minister. They will find that many pensioners wonder why they have never been told that they can keep their savings in an equally accessible account in the same bank but which pays much higher interest. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw the House's attention to some statistics relating to unemployment in my area of metropolitan Perth- the north metropolitan statistical division-which contains sections of the city of Stirling and all of the area of the city of Wanneroo. I raise the fact that the unemployment rate is most strongly affecting those in the age group of 15 to 19 years. In this region there was an increase in the unemployment rate from 2,000 in December 1989 to 3,500 in 1990. This was an increase in unemployment of 111.24 per cent. That gives an unemployment rate for that particular age group of 35.7 per cent which is a national disgrace. It happens to be way above the Western Australian average of 12.02 per cent and way above the national average of 9.3 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That indicates quite clearly that young people are being asked to carry the burden of the Government's economic incompetence. The conspiracy between the trade union movement and the Government's policies is causing youth unemployment to rise in a totally unacceptable way.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I am happy with the comments of the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan); the result might be different. I am concerned about a situation were a young man can work 62 hours for a week and be paid $220. This is the amount being paid to a trolley boy who works for an organisation in Perth called VIP Cleaning Services. Its business address is in Bayswater and its home address is in Inglewood.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is currently in the process, in my view, of exploiting young people. One young man recently told me that he was told that his wage was being reduced from $7.20 an hour to $5.20 an hour. When he complained about that he was told the he could work for $1 an hour or $4 an hour. This organisation refuses to discuss the matter with any of the parents; it refuses to discuss the matter reasonably with any of the young men; and it refuses to discuss the matter with anyone else. In fact, it is interesting that the trolley boys are not covered by an award or a union, which is a great shame. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned that young men are often being taken from one shopping centre to another, at great inconvenience to them, and being paid a very small amount of money. It is clearly a case of exploitation of young people. Incidentally, I point out that it makes the case for having unions and awards very strong. It is a particular concern of mine that we have young people being very grossly exploited. As I point out, for a young man to earn $220 for working 62 hours seems to me to be a very, very ordinary work practice indeed. VIP Cleaning Services certainly needs to lift its game. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to bring to the attention of the House an important event taking place in my electorate this weekend to commemorate national scout week. True to the character of people in the Ipswich and West Moreton area, the local scout association has decided to go one step further than the rest of the country and adopt an international theme for the celebrations, something very appropriate for the scouting movement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As reflected in the breadth of the countries that will be represented, through their consuls, at the opening of scout week on Friday, the scouting movement has developed and come a long way since being formed by Lord Baden-Powell in Great Britain 84 years ago. It was established in Australia one year later. Though many things have changed since the time of that first scout group, the spirit of camaraderie evident in scouting across the globe remains as strong as ever today. Here in Australia there are numerous scouting groups with more than 140,000 uniformed members amongst their ranks and with in excess of another 30,000 lay members assisting the movement. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Ipswich-Moreton area we have 25 uniformed groups with a total membership of about 1,000, plus approximately 500 lay personnel. With so many Australians involved in the scouting movement it is no surprise that most of us either have someone in scouts or have at some time been involved in the scouting move ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Federal member for the Ipswich area, it gives me great pleasure to be a part of the local celebrations, especially given the reliance of regional communities on the qualities and values that make the scouting movement.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure all members of the House will be pleased to know that negotiations overnight in Geneva appear to have paved the way for a restart of the Uruguay Round negotiations. There does appear to have been a long awaited breakthrough to the deadlock on reform of world agricultural trade. Of course, I must say that experience does suggest that we must be cautious in interpreting developments in agricultural negotiations. But, on the basis of the apparent breakthrough last night, there are grounds for optimism that the United States Congress will agree to an extension of the fast track legislation, allowing more time for negotiations to be completed. It seems that all participants are now willing to start negotiating on specific binding commitments to reduce farm subsidies, export subsidies and import barriers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable members will recall that it was the refusal of the European Community to make such an unqualified undertaking, particularly in relation to export subsidies, which led to the breakdown of the Brussels talks and the stalling of the Round. Clearly, if they do in the words of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Director-General, Mr Arthur Dunkel, overcome the biggest hurdle to restarting the Round, then these developments are very welcome. Such genuine movement would, again to quote Mr Dunkel, `demonstrate a collective will to protect the international trading system and put the Uruguay Round back on track'.</PARA>
<PARA> The restart of the Uruguay Round negotiations on this basis also, of course, vindicates the position taken by Australia and the Cairns Group all along and specifically at Brussels. May I interpolate there to say that I think we are all indebted to the work done by the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development in this regard and the very competent group of officials that have supported him.</PARA>
<PARA> The position we have taken in these negotiations under the leadership of the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development is, firstly, that there can be no future reform of world trade that excludes agriculture and that reform of world trade in agriculture must include movement in those three areas of export subsidies, internal support and market access. Of course, success in the agricultural negotiations is absolutely vital to this country and to our farming community.</PARA>
<PARA> Earlier this week the Minister spoke about the increasing damage being caused to Australian farmers caught in this cross-fire of the export subsidy war between Europe and the United States. The Uruguay Round, in the agricultural negotiations, offers the best chance of ending that iniquitous trade war. As I said at the beginning, I am sure that all honourable members will welcome this development and hope that it will be the beginning of the end of this iniquitous trade war.</PARA>

<PARA> A lot of the problems of this country are visited on the exchange rate policies of the former Government, which were exacerbated by the mindlessness of the National Party.

That whole tariff structure-that industrial protection from which we are now trying to extricate Australia, putting the breath of life back into industries that were deadened by the former Government in terms of international competition-was built by the honourable member's predecessor, Sir John McEwen, and the influence of the National Party on coalition governments through the Menzies and Fraser years.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Dr Deeble's paper is the second in a series, and the first background paper coming out of the national health strategy. I would like to put on record my thanks to the Leader of the Opposition for a press release that he issued to the Press Gallery this morning which, frankly, I could not have bettered. He has taken the quotation. I want to confirm that it is absolutely accurate. It certainly makes me sound somewhat statesmanlike in the sense that those who read it will see that I am arguing for political debate on Medicare based on facts, not prejudice. The health care strategy document is totally consistent with what I had to say, and the Leader of the Opposition was good enough to circulate it verbatim to the Press Gallery.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Dr Deeble's paper shows that the fundamentals of Medicare are sound; however, that the medical service demand and supply sides need close attention by the national health strategy. It points to the fact that the number of doctors billing under Medicare increased by 25 per cent. The largest rises were in general practitioners, consultant physicians, psychiatrists and radiologists. The lowest increases were in surgeons, obstetricians and gynaecologists. There has been a very substantial increase in the 1980s in the number of doctors registered to practice and, therefore, billing for Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA> On average, total fees per doctor rose at about the rate of average weekly earnings (AWE) for general practitioners but significantly more specialists. Medical service use per person increased by 23 per cent in the five years to 1989-90, the largest increases being in pathology and other diagnostic services. On the other hand, the average fee for service has fallen by about 11 per cent in real terms since 1984-85, having risen by less than the rates of increase for either the consumer price index or AWE. Therefore, while usage of medical services continues to rise, its effect has been significantly offset by the decreased value of average fees in relative terms. The overall cost of private medical services remained a stable proportion of GDP, 1.24 per cent, over the past six years.</PARA>
<PARA> The paper documents a continuing underlying growth in the number of doctors and the use of medical services, particularly diagnostic services. The doctors numbers problem is the result of training decisions made in the 1970s.</PARA>
<PARA> With the exception of the United States of America, all western European countries have national insurance systems which ultimately have one payer, either the state or employer funded schemes. In other words, while members of the Opposition seem to delight in making something of bulkbilling, the fact is that the principles of bulkbilling are provided for in almost every Western country, with the exception of the United States.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the United States the larger number of private health insurers has led to higher costs in both service delivery and administration. The amount spent on health in the United States is 11.2 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) while in Australia it is much less-8.1 per cent of GDP. In elaboration of that point, the trend in Australia throughout the 1980s was stable; the trend in the United States was for expenditure to move upward as a percentage of gross domestic product, which is why former Governor Dukakis is in Australia looking at the Australian health system as an alternative to the American model.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we look at the amount spent on health per person, the difference between our two countries is even more pronounced. In the United States in 1987, $2,769 was spent on health costs per person compared with $1,294 per person in Australia. In other words, the United States spent more than double the amount on providing health care to each person compared with Australia. Unlike other national schemes, the Australian system puts very little restriction on delivery of health services. Medicare has not altered the basic structure of private practice and that, in many ways, is perhaps the most surprising thing-that we have preserved private practice but at the same time we have retained a stability in terms of health costs which is very unusual for other countries.</PARA>
<PARA> In the United Kingdom, France and Germany, the total level of funding available for medical services is closely controlled. In Canada, doctors' fees are tightly regulated and in some provinces, quantity and price are traded off. Australia is unusual because it does not cap either the supply of services or the demand for them. It is extraordinary in the light of that that Australia has managed to keep its share of health costs down for so long.</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, let me say that this is not to suggest that there are no issues in the Australian health system that need to be addressed. In this paper, Dr Deeble identifies some of the specific concerns. The paper refers to medical services. In the area of services, both on the supply side and on the demand side, there are certain issues that need to be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition raised this issue apparently for ideological reasons, and was unable to give the question of vouchers any policy content whatever. The Leader of the Opposition has remained absolutely silent because he is making an ideological point to the right wing of his own Party. As opposed to that, we are concerned with trends. I believe we have one of the best and more stable health systems in the world. We intend to go through the 1990s with that system leading the world, not wrecked by the ideological prejudices of a rather ignorant Leader of the Opposition.</PARA>

<PARA> I will tell honourable members what we are doing on this side of the House. We are trying-just as Ben Chifley did in his day-to re-establish the basis of Australian wealth, which was lost in the coalition's years of government. When Chifley left to the coalition the governing of Australia, the country had the second highest income per capita in the world. Yet it was down to eighteenth when we took over. So in the 30-odd years of coalition government Australia was taken from second place to eighteenth place. The proper basis of our wealth, the whole postwar trade in goods and services, just passed us by. The whole postwar trade in goods and services, adding value, passed us by when the coalition parties believed we could ride on the sheep's back, and then at a pinch dig up another mound of rocks and flog them to somebody.</PARA>
<PARA> That was the whole basis of the coalition government's policy. It let the whole basis of Australian wealth fall apart. What this Government has had to do is painstakingly put it back together, get the profit share up, fix the exchange rate, free up the financial markets, cut the Budget deficit, and deal with a surge of income which came off the large terms of trade rise and the boom it gave us. We had to try to come out the other side with lower inflation, which we did for the first time and which in 20 years the coalition government was incapable of giving us. Opposition members are supposedly people of business; they are the people who supposedly knew better-until inflation came along with the first oil shock.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Governor of the Reserve Bank had this to say the other day:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In our view there is scope for banking lending rates to come down a little further yet in the wake of the December easing in official interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA>What we do know happens in the banking industry is that it takes a while, after an official easing of rates, for the cost of deposits to migrate down, as some of the deposits are month, 3-month or 6-month deposits, and find their place in a lower rate structure. Gradually those easings have come through. I certainly endorse what the Governor has said. It is also worth recording that every rate reduction has been opposed by the Leader of the Opposition-the professor. He has opposed them all. In February 1990, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Why the sudden urgency? Australians will know that policy is again being manipulated for political ends.</PARA>
<PARA>He said also:</PARA>
<PARA>It begs the question really as to whether it is a political decision.</PARA>
<PARA>On 23 January, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Today's move to begin lowering them is a pre-election ploy. It begs the question of just how much Mr Keating is pushing the pace of interest rate reductions simply to suit his electoral timetable.</PARA>
<PARA>On 1 February, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Everybody knows that this crowd would put interest rates up again if they were to get back into office.</PARA>
<PARA>They have only fallen by five percentage points since. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>In this sense the Treasurer is still forcing the pace.</PARA>
<PARA>He said in March last year:</PARA>
<PARA>The public would be justifiably cynical, particularly in regard to the statement that was made yesterday by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer that after the election they were going to instruct the Reserve Bank to lower interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what we did. Interest rates were lowered. The Leader of the Opposition's comments go on and on all through 1990 into 1991. This is the person who is complaining about the recession and about the costs Australians have had to bear but who for shabby political reasons, shabby political motives, has opposed every rate reduction that the Government has put into place.

Can the Minister inform the House what progress has been made in this area?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1139" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can inform the House that certainly in recent years there has been much concern on the part of all parties involved in the industrial relations process-employers, unions, governments and the industrial tribunals, Federal and State-to achieve a system that had much more flexibility in the labour market at the enterprise level. I can say to the House that developments in that regard over the last two or three years have been very encouraging indeed. We now have a framework for the implementation of a considerable degree of labour market flexibility at the enterprise level, the like of which could not have been envisaged a few years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The means by which that has come together is basically through the introduction of the structural efficiency principle, which has enabled enterprise level flexibility to be put in place by such means as the award restructuring process, which provides for multiskilling; broad-banding of classifications in awards-in the metals award 300 classifications came down to 14; and skill-related career paths. That gives great scope for management at the enterprise level to utilise the work force flexibly and productively in a way that simply was not possible under the previous arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA> There have also been other award variations to allow flexibility at the enterprise level in regard to a whole host of working arrangements such as the spread of ordinary hours, rostered days off, meal breaks, job sharing, shift work rosters, reductions in penalty rates, provisions for part time and casual work, and things of that nature. There is also provision in awards for enterprise flexibility agreements. These agreements are exceedingly important in that they provide the means by which, at the enterprise level, the award variations can be implemented in a way that suits the enterprise's own arrangements. That is a major development.</PARA>
<PARA> This has enabled enterprise agreements to be reached in a vast number of industries. We see that such clauses apply at the present time in timber, clerical, storing and packing, transport, journalism, metals, building, food, entertainment, paint, local government, brewing, gas, and textile, clothing and footwear. All these agreements require endorsement by the Industrial Relations Commission, but there are some other types of agreements that do not require that Commission endorsement; they are called facilitative clauses.</PARA>
<PARA> So the structural efficiency principle has, in a variety of ways, enabled enterprise level flexibility to be introduced in a way that very much increases the capacity for us to get increased productivity and efficiency. That has been supplemented by two other factors. One is the provision for certified agreements, introduced in the Industrial Relations Act 1988. There are 45 such agreements that can go outside award conditions. The other is the wages system, which is now moving to focus much more on the enterprise level. In the current national wage case virtually all parties-employers, unions and governments-are supporting the development of a wages system that allows for wage increases to be negotiated at the enterprise level but within a framework of general guidelines to be determined by the Commission. Assuming that the national wage decision endorses this approach, we will have made a major change in wage determination in this country in a way that further extends labour market flexibility.</PARA>
<PARA> With all of this happening, one would think, listening to the Opposition, that it would be accepting that this is a major change. What we have is continual prattling about the need for enterprise agreements as though nothing was happening. In fact, a whole edifice has been erected through the structural efficiency principle and other changes I have mentioned. With the endorsement of the national wage case completing that process, a whole edifice has been erected which is enabling enterprise level negotiations to take place in a way that has never been the case in industrial relations in this country before.</PARA>
<PARA> We have from the Opposition its spokesman prattling on this morning about how he is going to erect a tent pole for economic policy through the bringing in of voluntary enterprise agreements. While he is erecting a tent, we have erected a massive edifice which is certainly going to do a lot more for enterprise level agreements, flexibility at the workplace and productivity than the Opposition's voluntary agreements ever would do.</PARA>
<PARA> Two other factors should be mentioned about the Opposition's policy. Firstly, with the Opposition's voluntary agreements not having the involvement of the Commission, with therefore no guidelines applying to wages policy, it would have no idea about the wages outcome and no means of controlling that. Secondly, and most importantly, the Opposition's policies would also open the door to severe exploitation of workers who were poorly organised and had poor bargaining power. That, of course, fits with the general approach that we have seen from the Opposition.</PARA>

<PARA> This breaching of the plank which has existed in industrial relations throughout this century, where there has been this basic protection for those who are the least capable of defending themselves, would be a major sea change in industrial relations.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Lowe for his question. As I said in the previous answer I gave, I was referring this morning to the pattern outlined in the Deeble report in terms of servicing and the growth in the number of services. I made the point that the average rate of growth prior to Medicare was about 3.4 per cent and that the average growth in a number of services after the introduction of Medicare was about 3.7 per cent. Effectively the overall rate of servicing varied little prior to Medicare and after the introduction of Medicare. That is an extremely important point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The difficulty with averages is that they mask differences. Particular problems vary on different bases. One of the points that I made, and perhaps could have emphasised more, was that the pattern of servicing will vary across Australia. For example, a member with an electorate in, say, Sydney where there is an oversupply or a very significant number of doctors is likely to find a pattern of overservicing as doctors seek to carry out more services effectively to lift their incomes. I made the point that perhaps to some extent that is understandable in the sense that the position of supply leads people to a situation in which they want to achieve more.</PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, those same doctors have accepted and make use of bulkbilling, but one ought not draw the conclusion that members of the Opposition seem to draw, that is, that somehow the insurance system is related to the rate of servicing. The insurance system is not found to be particularly significant.</PARA>
<PARA> However, there are particular areas where overservicing occurs. The value of the Deeble report is that it illustrates and points out patterns of servicing that are much more serious perhaps than in terms of general visits to the doctor or general consultations. Overservicing occurs particularly in the area of pathology. As I indicated, the figures for general pathology services show a rate of increase not of 3.7 per cent or 3.4 per cent but of 7.3 per cent per annum. For radiology, the increase is 4.8 per cent. The particular area of overservicing that we are concerned about and that Deeble points our attention to is not the whole area of Medicare but the area of diagnostic services. For me that point was important enough to warrant putting some facts in front of the Parliament and the people. In that sense, that was all that was requested of the author of the paper.</PARA>
<PARA> At a press conference it is not unusual for one to be questioned about what one's response will be to the problem of overservicing. In one press conference I simply referred to the situation in other countries. The former Minister for Health pointed out to me as I was approaching the dispatch box that I could have mentioned British Columbia, but in fact I was thinking of Great Britain, which does not have a fee for service system as we do in Australia. It operates a system which at the moment it is experimenting with and which would set a budget for general practitioners so that they have some sense of the financial impact of the services they order.</PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated at the same press conference-I noticed a member of the staff of the Leader of the Opposition there, so he should have had the following reported to him-because the United Kingdom system is not based on fees for services but on a very different system, I did not see that approach as necessarily relevant to Australia. Rather, I saw as being more relevant an approach that emphasised the need for the education of general practitioners and for a greater understanding on the part of the medical profession of the concept of accountability. The fact of the matter is that when one orders a test, one is ordering up, in effect, dollar costs. There is a cost which needs to be recognised.</PARA>
<PARA> In a real sense, in Australia we need to find a way of putting greater emphasis on this point. It might be asked, `How do I draw the conclusion that education might be a significant approach?'. I draw that conclusion from the very clear suggestion in the Deeble report that there is enormous variation between pathologists and other diagnostic groups. General practitioners vary enormously in terms of the number of tests that they order. Perhaps that is putting it more clearly.</PARA>
<PARA> So, in a sense, there are different approaches and in terms of training and in terms of discussion within the medical profession, within the colleges, it seems to me we ought to be able, together, to find a solution to a problem which simply we cannot live with. In conclusion, I would not want to have my remarks this morning or the Deeble report interpreted as in any sense flagging a particular attack on pathologists or any one group. The reality is that all this report is doing is factually saying there is a problem that we need to face up to. Part of the problem is to do with diagnostic testing. There is a number of issues and elements that are behind that situation. We ought to address them sensibly. That is the contrast. We work on the basis of the facts. We precisely attempt to address the problem. We do not throw up ideology clothed as policy. It is not policy; it is nonsense; and, if we go down that route, we do the Australian people no service.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I think the honourable member for Burke would be well aware that the approximate value of Telecom and OTC combined is something like $21 billion. About the largest raising on the Australian share market in recent times has been some $700m. So if anyone-and this includes the Opposition-sought in government to privatise Telecom or were this Government to proceed down that course, we would obviously throttle the Australian share market for years if we were to reach anything like the true value of Telecom-OTC in the price the taxpayers received for their asset being dispensed with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, if the Opposition's policy in that regard were pursued, it would not be achieved. In other words, Telecom would be sold for a great deal less than its worth-and something like that was the experience of the British when they went down that same course. In the process of the attempt being made, two things would happen. Firstly, those elements of the service which are important to the public, particularly the disadvantaged sections of the public--</PARA>

Secondly, the Government of the day would lose interest in capping the charges. Indeed, where these sorts of things have occurred, the Government of the day has lost interest in capping the charges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So what the public could be convinced about in this particular proposition is that the price of the telephone service would rise. Whatever happened to the business community, the price of telephones to the ordinary members of the public would rise. Add to that the Opposition's proposal to impose a 15 per cent tax on goods and services, and not only would it rise in accordance with the lifting of shackles related to privatisation, but it would also rise with an additional 15 per cent-15 per cent on this, just like there would be 15 per cent on food, 15 per cent on clothing, 15 per cent on medicines, 15 per cent on wreaths for Anzac Day, 15 per cent on every element which is a necessity of life in this community.</PARA>
<PARA> The ordinary taxpayer would carry the burden-and this from an Opposition that says time and time again here in Question Time that it is seriously concerned about what is happening to ordinary people in this country. The propositions of the Opposition on the privatisation of Telecom are of a piece with all the other positions that they adopt. What they are about is making a massive imposition on ordinary Australians in defence of ideology, not of sensible policy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I want to start this discussion by congratulating the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) because at last he has come to the conclusion that there are indeed some problems with Medicare. He has been able to bring himself to say this publicly for the first time in his release of the paper by Dr John Deeble that we discussed earlier in Question Time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a whole range of issues. However, I want to say to the Minister, in the best bipartisan spirit: I am glad the light has come into his life, and we will actually help him recognise these problems. We want to be generous about this. We will give the Minister some advice in discussions about how to fix them. We will do our best to solve them in a constructive way. Our aim is not to be partisan just for the sake of it. Our aim is to be bipartisan, wherever possible, for the benefit of Australia. We want to work together to get a health system that is good for all Australians-not just those who can afford it, not just those whom the Government covers, but for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> This morning the Minister released a document which indicated very clearly that there were a number of problems with the Medicare system. The first problem is the question of overusage. We have to ask ourselves whether there is overservicing and overusage of this system. We have been saying for years, from the time of the introduction of Medicare onwards, that there was overservicing. Were we right? Clearly, we sure were! Who tells us? No less a person than the Minister for Community Services and Health. How bad is it? The answer is that it is very bad. The figures show that the services used in Australia between 1984 and 1989 went from 114 million to 153 million-up almost a third. Why was this? It was not because of an increase in population. It was not because of any change to the schedule. The Minister himself says that he does not really know why. </PARA>
<PARA> I guess it is a bit difficult to get all the neurons working at once, so let us give the Minister a bit of a prod. The figures have increased because of a range of things, but mainly because of bulkbilling. The largest increase was in bulkbilled items. The Minister has pointed out in this place many times, with glee, that bulkbilling is increasing rapidly. Around Australia the level stands at about 55 per cent. The State with most bulkbilling is New South Wales, where 75 per cent of general practitioner services are bulkbilled. Where does the most overusage occur? It occurs in New South Wales. Of course, it could just be a coincidence. It could be a chance finding. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to point out an inconsistency between this and the Government's approach to pharmaceuticals. There is a major inconsistency. In August the Minister said that there is a gross overuse of pharmaceutical benefits items. The solution to that, which we agreed with, was to introduce a price signal. That included the $2.50 charge for pensioners. The Minister's press release stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The introduction of a charge on prescriptions for pensioners is part of a program which will make the PBS more efficient and encourage more responsible use of medication. </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer (Mr Keating) himself said that if we do not charge for a service it will get overused. Amazingly, for the first time in most of our careers, we would agree with the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA> I find myself also agreeing with Minister Howe and with the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples). They got it right for pharmaceuticals and a price signal is important, even if it is fully rebatable. The Government should introduce price signals and we would support that perception. Minister Howe keeps on pushing this perception that the levy pays for everything and the whole service is free. That is absolute nonsense. The levy pays for about one-fifth of Commonwealth outlays in this respect. There is an enormous misunderstanding in the community because of that perception he peddles around. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister claims that Medicare costs have been kept down, and I have to say that we are always in favour of keeping costs down. Let us see whether this is true, and, if it is true, how it has been achieved. There is some truth in it. It is a relatively cheap system-cheap in every sense of the word. It has not led to enormous blow-outs, but how has the Government done that? The answer is very simple. To keep costs down it has kept the quality down and kept the access down. It has rationed services. The headline of the Minister's press release says `Howe: Health resources must be rationed'. Further down it says:</PARA>
<PARA>Resources are limited and rationing is unavoidable. </PARA>
<PARA>It is the Minister's press release; they are his words. This is what he believes-that rationing is needed. It is what he has said. If that is what he has said, he should stand up and support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree entirely. The reason people are on waiting lists in this country-they are enormous waiting lists-is due to this Minister and his predecessor, because they have rationed health services and rationed drugs. How serious is the rationing? Is it a real problem? If someone in his own State of Victoria wants to have ear, nose and throat surgery at, say, the Monash Hospital-it is one of the leading centres in Australia-the only problem with having such surgery there is that one waits 23 months, almost two years, for very painful and uncomfortable conditions. There are a whole range of other problems. If one goes to some other hospitals one might be lucky enough to get it done within a year. It is all around Australia; it is not just confined to one State. The problems of this system are all across the whole country.

<PARA> Let me touch upon our position. As I said yesterday in this House, we on this side have no bias against Medicare as such. We realise that Medicare has a number of problems and we are happy to do our best to fix them with the Government, if need be. There is nobody here who is ideologically committed to destroying Medicare. We will look at a whole range of options and see if Medicare can be fixed, and if it can, we will fix it. We are looking at a whole range of options and one of those options is the voucher system. It has some advantages; it has some disadvantages. It is just one of a whole range of options which we are considering. The situation is not as the Government would paint it-that this option is the be all and end all of our philosophy. </PARA>
<PARA> I will also make a few points about my quote that if anybody is worse off, then it is better if they choose to be worse off. The Government seems to be trying to avoid a few basic points. Forty-six per cent of the population at present chooses, on top of paying their Medicare levy, to take out private health insurance. Forty-six per cent of the population chooses to be worse off so that they can have access to private health insurance, and that is how it should be. Somehow the Minister thinks that it is amazing. I must say it is a bit surprising that 46 per cent of the population do still take out private insurance after the way the Minister has squeezed health insurance and the private hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA> The private health system is groaning under the strain. The Minister took out the bed day subsidies and the reinsurance contributions and changed the gap contributions. He took $430m from the private health system and he wonders why the system is groaning under the strain. </PARA>
<PARA> It transpires that the Minister has some rather strange concepts about how our health system works. On the one hand he splutters and spouts over there with the rhetoric that everybody in this country has access to good quality medical care. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1K4">Dr BOB WOODS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; All right, but the Minister does make some very strange comments. I will point out one of the problems he has in understanding this matter. I quote him from an interview on the Walsh Report on 17 June 1990. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Public hospitals are primarily centres for teaching, for research, for treating people who are very sick and who may have obscure and difficult complaints. </PARA>
<PARA>So if one does not have a obscure, difficult complaint, is not going to be researched on, and does not have private insurance, what exactly is one supposed to do? That means that if one has a touch of mild pneumonia or a hip that needs replacing or a need for cataract surgery, one should not expect such mainstream problems to be dealt with in a public hospital; they should be dealt with in a private hospital. Surely even the Minister cannot mean that. That means that 55 per cent of the population cannot have those diseases treated because they do not have access to a private hospital. The Minister has squeezed the private industry so much, and put up the premiums so much that people cannot afford private insurance and they cannot have access to private beds. Those patients just have to grin and bear it. I presume this is a mistake. Even the Minister could not really be espousing that sort of nonsense. I hope that the Minister will take the opportunity to recant on that. I would be delighted to say that even the Minister with his socialist ideology actually would not want that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me look at the ideology. I believe that one of the things that both the Government and the Opposition should be doing is looking at the whole system, free of bias and preconceived ideas, in order to see what gives the best position in terms of quality of care, access to that care and efficient delivery of that care. I think that we would actually agree on those basic principles. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the voucher system is one option and it is one on which the Minister seems very keen for some reason. I can understand that with all the problems the Minister is facing, he would try to grasp at anything. It seems that the Minister is trying to grasp this alternative and palm it off onto us. But this is one option in a whole range of options. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister should be getting away from his blinkered, ideological, socialist approach to Medicare. We should not beat around the bush. One of the Minister's aims is to push the socialist agenda. There is no doubt about his credentials. Let me remind the Minister of a few speeches which he made-a few years ago now but in this Parliament-and which he has never retracted or argued against. He said that the Government could raise $700m per year on death duties and that not taxing deceased estates was `inequitable'. Does the Minister still espouse death duties? Does he still espouse taxing deceased estates? The Minister is trying to push our medical system into a socialist agenda. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an enormous problem with access to services. One of the things that Minister has always claimed is that there is good access because Medicare is a quality service and everybody has access to it. We have looked at the quality of the service. What about the access to the service? It is not just access to hospitals, it is access to a whole range of other areas. In particular, what about Medicare offices? Most people would think that part of the Government's philosophy would be to make Medicare offices accessible so that people do not have to travel very far to get their rebates. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the last few months the Minister has actually closed 13 offices-one would think he would be opening them. A large number of these offices are in the country. He has closed the offices in Leeton and Narrandera, for example. He has closed offices in the electorate of the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith). He has closed offices in Perth. In the case of the people in Leeton and Narrandera who want to make claims, they would have to travel 51 kilometres and 95 kilometres respectively to Griffith to get a rebate or else wait weeks for it to come through the post. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, on top of that, in this time of unemployment, the medical office staff in those areas will either lose their jobs or be forced to relocate, taking their buying capacity out of an already depressed rural area. The Minister claims that he is saving money-about $1m. It is not good enough to save money and to put an extra burden such as this on patients. Closing these offices will be remembered by the electorate, as will the Government's callousness to a whole range of other issues, including kids with holes in the heart. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me cite a case in point. This morning I was speaking with Roger Mee from the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne. I think the Minister is probably aware of the problem here. He may well look a bit embarrassed, because it is embarrassing for the Government. Roger Mee is the head of the cardiac surgery unit at this hospital. It treats 700 kids a year, and we are talking about kids with congenital heart disease-hole in the heart patients and similar patients. Most of those disabilities are life threatening. That unit has the reputation for being one of the best units in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> The Victorian Labor Government-and I remind honourable members that it is a Labor government-says it cannot afford to fund the unit properly because it does not get appropriate funds from the Commonwealth. Fortunately for kids, there is a private foundation which has contributed a quarter of a million dollars for an operating theatre. It is an operating theatre, not extras, that we are looking at. These are basic things here. Let the Minister try operating without an operating theatre-or try operating at all! Costs include $80,000 for sterilisers, $100,000 for monitoring equipment, $100,000 for heart-lung machines-I could go on. It would be impossible to run that unit without that sort of private foundation support. There is a 24-bed intensive care unit, but 10 of those beds are closed because there are no funds to run them. I could go on and on about the hospital. </PARA>
<PARA> This Minister has actually evaluated the situation-he is aware of it. The Minister's Department was supposedly, in October this year, going to announce whether in fact it would fund a grant to this centre as a centre of excellence. There is no question that it should get it. But while the Minister is dithering and delaying and trying to put off the evil day of spending a bit more of our money, those kids are suffering. I call upon the Minister, in the best spirit possible, to announce that grant for those people as soon as it is possible. </PARA>
<PARA> What about Danny Young? I mentioned Danny yesterday. He has troubles because he cannot get an appropriate suit. He has scars as a result of a firecracker accident-scars all over his leg. The treatment is to wear a pressure suit, rather like a wet suit. It stops the scars from being deforming and it stops him from being immobilised later on. The total cost over 18 months is about $4,000. This Minister's Department has said that it cannot afford $4,000 to ensure Danny has a reasonable quality of life. There are hundreds of cases like Danny. It is passing it off. What this Minister says is, `We will pass that on to the States. We will not give the States any money; we will just pass responsibility on to the States'. So either Danny's parents have to raise that money or, sadly, Danny may be immobilised. </PARA>
<PARA> Just a few minutes away from here there is a pensioner, Mr Adam Milanczuk, who has oesophageal ulcers. They have haemorrhaged repeatedly, and it is dangerous, because haemorrhaging in the oesophagus-which is the gullet, in case the Minister does not know-is really a major problem. Every other treatment that he has had has failed. He had a drug called Losec six months ago. It is a new drug. It worked dramatically well. Unfortunately, the ulcers recurred and the Minister's associate Department was actually asked-under Minister Staples in fact-whether in fact he could have another course of the drug. And what was the answer? `No-you can have one course of this drug in your whole lifetime'. Once only, once ever. If the patient haemorrhages, that is just tough. If he haemorrhages and bleeds and dies, what will the Minister do? What will the Minister and Minister Staples do if in fact this pensioner does have another haemorrhage and does die?</PARA>
<PARA> I think one of the things the Minister has to decide is whether he can hold his head up here with the quality of service that he is offering to the community of Australia. We will work together with him constructively to reconstruct a Medicare system, a health system, which gives quality care to everybody, which gives access to everybody, which delivers that health care efficiently, which is understandable and which is not a major imposition upon the pockets of individuals or the pocket of our community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods) referred to the fact that the Government seemed to have discovered that there may be some problems associated with Medicare or associated with the national health system. Of course, he forgets-as apparently the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) had forgotten-that the national health strategy or the review of health care in Australia was announced last November. At the time of that announcement we in fact defined the series of issues that would be dealt with as part of the national health strategy. So, rather than putting our heads in the sand and failing to recognise that there were some issues, we in fact defined what the issues were, and as a responsible Government, we are setting about systematically seeking to deal with those issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Interestingly enough, the opportunity was not taken by the Opposition spokesperson, the honourable member for Lowe, to do any serious analysis of the Deeble report. Rather than spending time on the question of overservicing, which he seemed to think was an important issue, and dealing with the information included in the report, he skipped off into a range of other issues. Of course, the Deeble report is not unimportant, because it systematically looks at the trends in relation to both the supply side and the demand side in terms of medical services fitting into Medicare. He makes the point that there has been an increase in the average use of service of about 23 per cent over the six years of Medicare. After the first two years, the average annual increase equalled 3.7 per cent, compared with the pre-Medicare rate of 3.3 per cent. So rather than being dramatic, as the aggregate figures would suggest, that increase in the trend is not really very dramatic at all. It is a significant trend, and we take account of it, but it is not dramatic. </PARA>
<PARA> More seriously, the honourable member points to the trend in relation to diagnostic services. There the trend not only is more serious but obviously also requires the Government to develop measures that will deal with a much more significant increase. For example, in pathology there was a rate of growth of 7.3 per cent per person per annum, and for radiology there was a rate of growth of 4.8 per cent per annum. Therefore, it is the diagnostic areas that are the growth areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the honourable member's attempt to link all this somehow to Medicare and bulkbilling falls because, essentially, diagnostic services-the main growth areas-are effectively generated not by the general practitioners (GPs) or by the population; in fact, they are generated by the doctors themselves. As Deeble points out, even there we see quite a wide range of practice. That figure represents an average. In terms of the actual referring of people to diagnostic services, something which occurs in an extraordinarily high proportion of GP visits-I think something like 50 per cent of GP visits lead to an ordering up of tests-we see that that varies a great deal from general practitioner to general practitioner. There is something happening here that we need to know more about. Of course, part of the method of the national health strategy will be to pursue these questions given rise to in the various reports in order to understand them more and to understand what we can do about them. </PARA>
<PARA> The interesting thing is that during that period in which there has been some growth of services with all the attendant pressures on Medicare, Medicare has stood up very well. In terms of doctors' fees, the average fee for service has risen 32.8 per cent-less than the consumer price index, and a little less than average weekly earnings. Doctors have had to share some of the restraint worn by the general community. The honourable member for Lowe should understand that because, after all, his political party has opposed every national wage rise that I can remember during our period in government. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an issue, it is an issue about services, and it is an issue which we will have to deal with. The honourable member draws an analogy between Medicare and the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. I suppose that there are some parallels. The fact of the matter is that essentially we finance Medicare through the levy. Australian taxpayers make a contribution to the levy according to their income. On the other hand, the pharmaceutical benefits scheme is funded by taxation. We are talking, therefore, about quite different issues. The real problem, as I suggested before, in the diagnostic area-at which we have to look rather critically-is that it is not particularly related to the clients at all. It is related more to general practitioners who order up these tests in increasing numbers, perhaps without being fully aware of the fiscal impact. </PARA>
<PARA> In what turned out to be a very general speech, the honourable member for Lowe did a number of things. He sought to attack Medicare again. Frankly, I do not understand why the Opposition thinks it is good politics to attack Medicare. I drew the attention of the House to the fact that seven out of every 10 Australians are currently in favour of Medicare. Support for Medicare has been steadily increasing and in 1990 had stabilised at 71 per cent-the same level as it was in 1989. Opposition to Medicare, to which the honourable member for Lowe referred, has reduced to an all time low of 22 per cent. Essentially, only half of Liberal voters oppose Medicare. Only two in every 10 Australians oppose Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the honourable member's reflections on the health system, the same research indicates, in some quite telling ways, a degree of satisfaction with the health system that I think would also be of considerable concern to him. The most telling of all the statistics in the survey, given all the criticism of the public hospital system by the Opposition, is that 66 per cent of those people who have been in a public hospital in the last two years were satisfied with their experience because of the good standard of care, service, treatment and cost. In other words, satisfaction with Medicare arrangements is highest among those people with recent experience of the public health system. That may be a very surprising conclusion, but it is one that is supported by the evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> Only 14 per cent of people express dissatisfaction in terms of waiting periods. Of course, the honourable member for Lowe, like his predecessors, wants to make much of waiting lists. I am surprised about that. When I said to Peter Collins, the New South Wales Minister for Health, that one of the things he might have to worry about was waiting lists, he replied, `Well, you don't have to wait more than three weeks in New South Wales'. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think the figures are very different in Victoria. The fact is that for critical surgery it does not matter where people live in Australia-whether they are in New South Wales or Victoria-if they have an acute need for treatment in a public hospital there is no question at all of a waiting period. Again, a lot of this so-called concern on the part of the Opposition is very much a case of crocodile tears-tears it feels it can exploit for political advantage rather than for any serious purpose. There is no evidence that treatment for serious or traumatic conditions is being delayed. Much of the waiting list time reflects convenience considerations for doctors or patients rather than the unavailability of resources.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The particular case of ear, nose and throat surgery that was mentioned by the honourable member reflects the obvious fact that in some areas of specialty there are more significant waiting periods for discretionary surgery than in others. Of course, orthopaedic surgery is another example of the supply being controlled effectively by the college, and the effect of that control on the supply, as the honourable member knows, is to induce delays and some stacking, if you like, of patients so that very profitable use is made by surgeons of the opportunities available to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Various reflections were made again on the state of the Australian health system. I think that is unfortunate, coming from the Opposition, and I think one ought to correct some of the false impressions that have been created for base political motives. What is really impressive about the health system is that at a time when there has been a great deal of debate about waiting lists and so-called delays-and of course one has to have a concern about those kinds of issues-at a time when that concern is at its height, we have seen public hospital separations rise from 2.5 million to over 2.7 million for the period 1982-83 to 1988-89. There has been a massive increase in the number of people being treated in public hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA> The efficiency of public hospitals is extraordinarily impressive in terms of the improvement in productivity that has been achieved. At the same time as hospitals are becoming more efficient, people are expressing a greater level of satisfaction with the treatment that they are receiving within our public hospital system. I made reference to some of the things for which our public hospital system is renowned. I make no apology for describing our public hospital system as one of the best in the world. I make no apology for drawing attention to the extraordinarily important role that is played by our great teaching hospitals and the standard of excellence, notwithstanding that we are a country which spends only 8 per cent of gross domestic product and maintains very tight controls, which means that we are able to boast one of the finest health systems in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> We are able to find $100m a year for research through the National Health and Medical Research Council so that we remain at the cutting edge. We are able to provide the kind of support for our health system that means that we are competitive in terms of standards. But, most importantly, people that go into the Australian health system, particularly in the public hospital system, will get the very best treatment. It does not matter who one is in Australia, what one's background is, how poor one is or how wealthy one is, one gets the very best treatment out of that system. Indeed, that is something to be very proud of, because we know that the best in Australia is amongst the best in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> That is reflected in the progress that we make in some of the areas of research for which we are renowned. In the area of heart disease, we are able to see an impact from the effort that we have made. In the rate of mortality, we have seen a decline in the number of deaths from 34.6 per cent in 1983 to 32.4 per cent in 1988. One can cite a number of cases. In my own experience, our response to the treatment of HIV has placed us in the strongest ranks in the way we have responded, particularly in being able to link people into our health system and to build a partnership. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by simply saying that the honourable member for Lowe has said that he is not interested in ideology. That is a very important point, and I ask honourable members to mark it. If he is not interested in ideology, why did he say, `What we'd like to do is, if people are worse off, they're worse off by choice'? The honourable member was asked, `Well, in terms of allowing people to look after their own future . . .'; he was asked about going back to the 1950s. That is his model-the Earle Page model. It is a model of ideology; it is not about people. It is about private health, private insurance and private sectional interests. It is not about a response in the interests of the Australian people. The honourable member for Lowe will talk about efficiency and equality, but he will not talk or pursue a path which leads to greater equity. </PARA>
<PARA> Medicare has provided-indeed, it has guaranteed-access to one of the finest health systems in the world. It is popular with three-quarters of the Australian population. Those who in the last 12 months have been in the public health system are extraordinarily satisfied with the treatment that they received. That is good policy. </PARA>

<PARA> Let us look at what has happened to our medical system since this Government came to office in 1983. There has been a drop in private health insurance from 65.1 per cent in March 1983 to 44.6 per cent in March 1990; a consequent decrease in the use of private hospitals, leaving private hospitals with empty beds; and a consequent increase in the use of public hospitals so that there are now long waiting lists for admittance to public hospitals. While private hospital theatres sit empty, there are queues for operations in public hospitals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, except for the Prime Minister. Let us look at what this actually means to people. Let us look at the case of a gentlemen in his seventies whom we will call Mr Smith. I assure honourable members this man exists, but his name is not Smith. Mr Smith was suffering from disabling nocturnal angina. In case honourable members do not know what this is, it means extremely bad pains in the chest; people with disabling nocturnal angina cannot sleep at night. In this case, not only could Mr Smith not sleep; the pain was such that his 65-year-old wife sat up all night with him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Smith's doctor told him he was desperately in need of a coronary bypass. Unfortunately, because of the waiting list in public hospitals, Mr Smith could not get that coronary bypass. He was told that he would eventually get one, but Mr Smith eventually could not wait, so he had to go to the private system. Despite the fact that Mr Smith was paying more than $1,000 a year for private health insurance, he ended up with a bill exceeding $2,000 which he had to pay himself. Do honourable members think Mr Smith was a rich man? Both Mr and Mrs Smith were elderly pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the equity the Minister talks about. This is his sort of social justice. The Government has given us a system where the public pays four times for medical services. We pay through our taxation, we pay through that farce called the Medicare levy, we pay through health insurance and we also pay the gap. No wonder the Bulletin called it a bizarre and irrational system. The Minister must have a strange idea of social justice. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation would be laughable if it were not so serious. It is serious for families with young children who are fighting to make ends meet under a Government which, through its economic policies, has lowered living standards and made life a daily struggle. The Minister talks about equity. Families with chronically ill young children know what he means; there is no equity for them. A large proportion of their budget goes on providing medical services for those children. </PARA>
<PARA> Medical care is a major issue for the elderly. The elderly today are terrified that they will not be able to get the medical care they require and because of this are forced to take out private insurance they can ill afford. The system is in a shambles. It is not even as if costs were being contained. In a press release of 14 February 1991, last Thursday, the Consumers Health Forum of Australia Inc. told us that, for the December 1990 quarter, health costs for the ordinary consumer shot up 6.6 per cent. For the year to 31 December 1990, the Consumers Health Forum tells us that health costs rose by 12.2 per cent. Hospitals are in a state of confusion. Let me read a report from the Canberra Times of 16 October 1990. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> SYDNEY: Sick patients often have to wait days for admission to Australia's major public hospitals and waiting lists for elective procedures also are growing, according to a senior medical academic. </PARA>
<PARA> These problems had arisen because teaching hospitals were facing unreasonable and progressive funding restrictions, said Professor Richard Larkins, professor of medicine at Melbourne University. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The great strain under which the system is struggling is evident in the emergency departments of teaching hospitals in several capital cities where sick patients often cannot be admitted for hours or even for a day or two because of lack of available beds, while whole wards lie closed because of budget problems. </PARA>
<PARA>Have honourable members heard what happens to people who live in the country? An article from the Australian dated 5 November 1990 reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> For many country people a two-week wait to see their local doctor is common, for others a two-hour drive is standard. </PARA>
<PARA>This is equity-we are all equal; it is just that some people are less equal than others. An article from the Age on 18 February 1991, Monday this week, says the following of waiting lists in public hospitals:</PARA>
<PARA>There are now two people waiting for each available hospital bed in Victoria, according to the State Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition spokeswoman on health, Mrs Tehan . . . said January figures obtained under Freedom of Information legislation showed that 26,985 Victorians were waiting for 13,500 beds. In NSW, there were only 21,155 people waiting for 21,000. </PARA>
<PARA>How lucky can one be! Only 1,155 people in New South Wales need hospital treatment and cannot get it. In the public hospital system there is a financial crisis with the majority of hospitals being unable to stay within their budgets. Most public hospitals are coming in $1m to $2m over budget, and nobody knows where the money is coming from. There is a fear that the hospitals will have to absorb the debt and cut costs accordingly next year. </PARA>
<PARA> On the ground, this means that doctors are performing sleight of hand, pushing costs from one section to the other. Victorian hospitals are billing South Australian hospitals for drugs given to South Australian patients who have their operations in Victoria because the procedures they needed were not available in South Australia. South Australian hospitals are refusing to pick up the drug costs. These are the petty actions that occur when a system falls apart. </PARA>
<PARA> Hospitals are desperate for more money. The States say that the Commonwealth is squeezing them. Short cuts are being taken. There is a suspicion that some patients are being pushed into day surgery who should not be. And the reason? The Commonwealth has direct financial input into day surgery-patients go where the money is. The people who suffer are those who are forced to go home when they need post-operative care in a hospital. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister said that only 14 per cent of people expressed dissatisfaction with hospital waiting lists; he can do a lot with statistics. I ask the Minister: what percentage of people who are actually on the waiting lists for hospitals express dissatisfaction? I suggest to him that it would be 100 per cent. The Minister also said that there was a massive increase in the number of people treated by public hospitals. He used this as a very good statistic. I ask him: is it good for a pensioner to be sent home at 3 a.m. because there is no bed for him? Turnover rate does not necessarily equate with good care. </PARA>
<PARA> In a report of the Journal of the American Medical Association in May 1988 Dr Peter Arnold explained what quality means in the context of the Australian health system, and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA> Medicare was introduced to cure inequalities in health services.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is another typical debate here in the House. We are up debating the Government's policy, in the absence of one from the Opposition. The Opposition speakers so far have spoken a lot about waiting lists. If we want to have a look at how well our hospitals are working in this country, what we should really focus on is the amount of people going through them. We have the highest hospitalisation rate in the world: 21.8 per cent of our population will pass through our hospitals this year. No other country comes close. If honourable members opposite want to get stuck into the hospitals of this country, they should just compare their statistics with the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development average of 15.3 per cent. The 3 1/2 million Australians who will go through our hospital system this year would be reduced by a million if we could achieve the OECD rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Who puts people in hospitals? People do not put themselves in-it is the medical profession. We on this side of the House and honourable members opposite have talked about over-servicing coming about from bulk billing. One thing I think the national health strategy should look at is the amount of people going through our hospitals. It is a very efficient system. We talk about hospital waiting lists for public hospitals. I pointed out to the House yesterday that there is no medical reason why public patients cannot be treated in private hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot blame Medicare for that, because the Medicare agreement specifically allows, in clause 4.4, for States to put public patients in private hospitals. But why does it not happen? There are two reasons: firstly, the States by and large have not taken up the offer, apart from South Australia; but, secondly, the mates in the medical profession of honourable members opposite will not operate on them. We all know why-because the doctor-dollar relationship is in question if they do. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members opposite also talked about the resources that were needed in our hospitals. Liberal Party spokesmen on anything talk about resources and particularly about resources in terms of health care. What are they going to do with their $3 billion cut to the Budget? Are they somehow going to give the Australian people all the resources they say are needed in the medical system and still cut $3 billion off expenditure, or are they going to have a magic pudding somewhere from which all of this money somehow materialises?</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members opposite have no credibility when talking about fiscal responsibility, so they should not talk to this Government about resources. The simple fact is that we know from their rhetoric that they could not supply that money. The honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Gallus), who is leaving the chamber now, also talked about doctors in the country, and I know that is a problem. But the fact is that the Government does not tell doctors where to go in this country; the doctors decide for themselves. That really is a problem that the medical profession itself should have a look at. Why is it that our cities are overstaffed with doctors and we have long waiting lists in the country? That has nothing to do with the Government-it has everything to do with the medical profession. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members opposite always have goes at Medicare, but there are a few principles worth preserving in Medicare. The first one is ability to pay. On this side of the House, we seem to think that health care is a right. We should not have to be rich to have good health care. So in our proposal on Medicare, the ability to pay is tantamount. It is one of the pillars of Medicare. In actual fact, we go further. A married couple, with two kids, earning $21,560 does not pay anything. What is that family going to do under the Opposition's system? Will it get a voucher? What happens when the voucher runs out? We just do not know. </PARA>
<PARA> The second principle we talk about is equality of access-and it is in the Opposition's matter of public importance today. Let me tell honourable members about equality of access. It is the charging practices of medical specialists in this country that is the greatest threat to equality of access. There is nothing in Medicare that stops patients going to a doctor. But in many cases medical specialists in this country will not see patients if they are not privately insured-`If you don't have private insurance so we can send you the Bill direct, don't worry about coming to us'. </PARA>
<PARA> We hear a lot of tales about people who are in need of medical attention and who cannot get it. Let us put it on the public record. Who makes the decision in this country as to who gets access to medical treatment? Is it the politicians; is it the bureaucrats; or is it the doctors who decide who gets access to medical care and when they get it? If people are waiting on waiting lists, it is because the medical profession says that they can wait and that the people in the system already are more in need. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice that Andrew was able to get his eyelids fixed up quite easily; and there are plenty of cases where we can point to the fact that in hospitals around Australia today there are people receiving medical treatment who on an objective basis are receiving it prior to people receiving it on need. The case mentioned by the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods), and the case brought to our attention by the honourable member for Hawker, concerning a Mr Smith, may be two cases in point. Why can they not get medical treatment? It is a medical decision-not a political or bureaucratic one. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the honourable member for Hawker not to shake her head; she knows it is true. She had the audacity to start talking about the American Medicare. It bears absolutely no comparison with Medicare in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me tell honourable members about the American system. The highest cause of bankruptcy in America is medical bills. People die over there if they cannot afford medical treatment. That is the sort of system we would experience if we wanted to go to a market system. There are 37 million American people who are uninsured. The honourable member opposite sits there shrugging her shoulders, throwing her hands out. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QG4">Mr GEAR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course she mentioned it. She and the honourable member for Lowe did not make any sense in anything either of them said. We never heard anything about what they would do-only a little bit of a whinge about what they perceive as the shortcomings of Medicare. Each of those shortcomings they mentioned can be treated on their own and the argument which was put up can be shot down-and, indeed, the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) did that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us have a look at private health insurance in this country. There are a couple of things about private health insurance in this country which honourable members opposite should answer questions on, the first of which is the community rating principle. Are they going to keep that or are they going to a real market force? Are they going to be hairy-chested about this free enterprise and get rid of the community rating principle? Are they going to make those funds profit organisations? Currently, the major health insurers in this country are non-profit organisations. Yes, that might surprise those opposite, but it is true and it always has been true. If we look at the efficiency of Medicare when compared with the private health systems, out of every dollar that goes into Medicare, 96c goes to paying medical bills. In private insurance, out of every dollar that goes into private insurance, 86c goes to paying medical bills. That is the measure of efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> All the people of Australia want in a health insurance system is, in general terms, to pool all our risks. We all have different medical risks. Some of us are quite healthy; others need constant medical attention. But Australians want to pool their risks and pool their resources. The health strategy announced by the Minister I think is timely. Medicare has been there for seven years and it is about time we had a look at it again. But not with a view to getting rid of it-with a view to strengthening it; a view to making Medicare work better. The consultation process that the Minister is going through contrasts quite remarkably with the Opposition's. </PARA>
<PARA> I read in the paper the other day about the Opposition's little get-together I think on 20 or 21 March. I had a look at the list of the people who were invited to attend-Bruce was there, the Australian Medical Association was there; the private hospitals were there; the private doctors were there-and there was not a word about consumers. It did not worry about them-let us construct ourselves a health insurance system for the providers. That is what the Opposition is about. There was nothing about the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations, nothing about anything to do with the people who pay for the system, the consumers. Honourable members opposite never said anything about that. There was no mention of them in the paper the other day; and the Opposition gave the list out. The Opposition should have a look at the process of the Minister who is putting up position papers for community input-the people who use the system. That is who it should be designed for-not for the providers as the Opposition is going to do. We know the Opposition's system. (Quorum formed)</PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the Government's decision in the last Budget to recover the costs of marine safety and regulation from the industry that benefits from this regulation. Maritime and safety regulatory functions include ship control and ship safety-related activities, bulk cargo and dangerous goods inspections and the administration of the Marine Council. These functions were transferred to the new Australian Maritime Safety Authority on 1 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> The levy will be imposed on all seagoing ships except those exempted by regulation. The ships that will be exempt are those that are exempt from payment of the existing navigation levy and include commercial ships under 24 metres, fishing vessels, pleasure craft and ships in ballast. The levy will be phased in over three years with full cost recovery in the 1993-94 financial year. </PARA>
<PARA> The present cost of providing these services is currently estimated at $7.1m dollars per year. The formula for calculating the levy is similar to the existing marine navigation levy and is based on a sliding scale which ranges from 2c to 4c per net registered ton, with the rate per net ton being reduced as the ship's tonnage increases. The maritime industry was invited to propose alternatives to this method but no practical alternative was put forward. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also allows the rate of levy to be varied by regulation. However, after the phasing in period has been completed, the annual rate of increase in the levy which may be effected by regulation will be limited to an absolute maximum of 15 per cent. Any actual increase in the levy effected in this way will be related to reasonable cost increases. </PARA>
<PARA> To summarise, this Bill and the associated Marine Navigation (Regulatory Functions) Levy Collection Bill will provide funding to ensure that ship safety standards and the protection of the marine environment will continue to be maintained. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum for the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill sets out the necessary procedures for the collection of the proposed regulatory functions levy and provides minor amendments to other legislation. It provides for the levy to be paid to a collector of customs or an authorised person. The levy will not be payable merely because a ship calls at an Australian port for shelter, repairs or refitting, to take on provisions, to change crew or to land a crew member for medical treatment. </PARA>
<PARA> The levy will not be required to be paid for a ship more than four times a year. Ships exempted by regulation under the Marine Navigation Levy Collection Act 1989 will also be exempted from paying this levy, and I gave some examples of those when introducing the levy Bill. The Bill also allows payment of the levy to be made in person or by post or by a prescribed method. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill amends the Australian Maritime Safety Authority Act 1990 to provide for payments of the levy to be appropriated to the Authority, which provides these services to the shipping industry. The Bill also amends the Marine Navigation Levy Collection Act 1989 to ensure that the procedures involved in paying that levy and the proposed levy are consistent. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, this Bill provides the administrative detail to give effect to the levy. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum for the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a small contribution to the debate on the Family Law Amendment Bill, which was before the House last night. The provisions within the legislation are matters to which I would like to address some particular remarks. Before I do I would like to say a few things in general. Firstly, there is no doubt that the family law field is extraordinarily difficult. It was interesting to read in the summer edition of the Bar News, the journal of the New South Wales Bar Association, a little while ago some remarks attributed to Scott Turow, who many honourable members will recall is the author of two fairly well-known books, The Burden of Proof and Presumed Innocent. He is a person whom Time magazine has described as `the bard of the litigious age'. It is of interest that Turow has stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I do regard the law as a noble calling, but I can't shake the notion that the law is coming up short in its inability to deal with intimate human situations. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a problem, as far as the law is concerned, to try to relate the processes of the law and justice to family situations in any way at all. In particular, it is difficult to deal with cases of child abuse and of matters pertaining to guilt and innocence thereon. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned that in the process of our manifestations within the family law, most of which I endorse, there are still problems which seem to me to be quite fundamentally difficult. For that reason I was delighted to read that the Senate is about to constitute another inquiry into the family law legislation. I say to the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), however, that it is a pity that the members of the House are not participating in that review. It is a field where on past occasions there has been a free vote open to members of the Parliament. I think it is a field which does need to be seriously considered, in so far as there are a number of aspects of the legislation which at this time need consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> The first is in the structure and nature of the court itself. I was one of those who felt very sad at the time the legislation went through that it was not possible for us to be able to persuade each of the States to accept their role within it. As a result, we now have a proliferation of judges, far more than in the days when, long since, I practised law. Then the legislation was administered by relatively few. The old matrimonial causes legislation that was in place in those days did not seem to have anywhere near the involvement of as many members of the judiciary as there are today. In my day in New South Wales there were only three judges, I think, and an acting judge. It seems to me that it perhaps worked more effectively than it does with a multiplicity of family law judges and all their staff in place at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> It could be said that the number of divorces has increased and as a result so too has the workload of the family law jurisdiction, but it still seems to me that there is an enormous cost burden on the community in this jurisdiction. I am not too sure whether it is necessarily the only way in which it can best be regulated. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I have often felt sad that there is a necessity to have this jurisdiction completely isolated from the mainstream of law. I would have preferred that in family law there were a capacity to give those who are justices in this jurisdiction a wider responsibility. At the moment numbers of them sit in bankruptcy hearings, but for those who are in what is an extraordinarily personal field it is a pity that they cannot get into a wider area and perhaps get some balance. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from all that, we know of the risks and hazards to which these judges individually are subjected. I have often felt that if it were possible for them to get out of that informal environment and back to the formal process of the law occasionally, it might help both them and their administration of these intimate matters that are before their jurisdiction if they could perhaps sit back and view personal issues a little more dispassionately. I say that having full mind of the extraordinary complexity and difficulty of administering law in that jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> The third thing I wanted to say is that there are a number of fields in family law that worry me. One that has come to my attention is the problem of custody of children. While this particular legislation deals per se with child abuse, there is a far wider field that needs to be dealt with: that is the general way in which the custody of children is considered. I have felt that it might well be appropriate that before the process under the family law legislation which allows divorce to be achieved after 12 months separation, before any decree is issued by the court, the custody of children should be resolved. If that were allowed, the interests of the children would be seen in a higher frame than they are at the moment. Too often divorce is granted and whatever the realities of the breakdown of marriage, the circumstance of the custody of children remains. I have always felt that in a marriage the responsibility of both parents for the child is such that they should not receive a divorce until such stage as the custodial responsibilities and access to children have been determined. </PARA>
<PARA> In that respect I confess also, as a member of parliament, that there have been many occasions when I have felt that the distribution of matrimonial property has not been equitably considered. It is extraordinarily hard when, as a Federal member, one is approached on this matter by a constituent. I have had any number of cases where I have felt the court has given inadequate consideration to the rights of the man within the relationship. Of course, as a man, it is inevitable that one applies a subjective judgment. But in circumstances where there are assets to which that particular husband will gain access at some future time, assets that come through his family or through an association that is quite outside the marital relationship, assets which have never formed part of that marriage relationship, I have felt that they should not be part of the distribution of matrimonial property. Yet under the way the court functions now, they often are. Once again, the question of the distribution of matrimonial property might also be a factor which should come before the court before divorce itself is granted. </PARA>
<PARA> Those two matters, the custody of children and the distribution of matrimonial property, are extraordinarily controversial. There is no doubt that if the guilt of either party were brought into account, it might have some bearing. It is very difficult, as a member of parliament, to know how and in what way one can correct what in some instances seem to be inequities and injustices to constituents. For that reason I would have hoped that perhaps the House of Representatives would be able to participate in that family law review so that those issues, and other issues which I know are quite difficult in this jurisdiction, could be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to the particularity of this legislation, I want to say several things. The first is that we are all aware of the regrettable increasing incidence of child abuse. Indeed, for some years my wife has had a particularly active role in this field as national president of the National Association for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect, a body called NAPCAN. She has been trying to assist in determining ways by which child abuse can be prevented. In other words, the organisation with which she is associated is not so much there to look at the post hoc situation but to see whether there are ways by which more can be done to create a climate within which child abuse will not happen. </PARA>
<PARA> In that respect, I think it is also worth remembering that more than 90 per cent-in fact it is said to be even as much as 99 per cent-of those people in gaols around Australia have been abused in some way as children. Whatever the percentage, I certainly know that it is a significant majority. Not all the abuse is sexual abuse, although much of it is. But there has been a very large incidence of abuse of those who are today's criminals-in a physical sense, in a sexual sense and, of course, an emotional sense-which has contributed to their appearance before and conviction in the criminal courts. </PARA>
<PARA> In many instances the abuse is perhaps a result of economic pressures on parents. While parents may have excuses, I think that they are difficult to rationalise as children are at least as important as their parents. In the distribution of family property and the custody of children, children are so important that those issues need to be before the courts before a divorce is granted. In instances of child abuse, we need to ensure the maximum consideration of the degree to which a family relationship has broken down so that we might be able to do something to help the children. In the several contributions by the Attorney-General and the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), I know they have expressed that concern. </PARA>
<PARA> The worry I have in regard to the amendments that have been moved, both by the Attorney-General and by the honourable member for Kooyong, is that I think they are perhaps going too far to allay the concerns of the legal profession without worrying about the children of a marriage. I do not think partial mandatory reporting goes far enough. I feel it is important that when any cases of child abuse come to the notice of the court or court personnel, they should be reported to the child welfare authorities in the respective States. Having said that, I am concerned that in the States there is often very little capacity to deal with those reports. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend to the Minister the suggestion by the honourable member for Kooyong that once a report has been made by the officers of the court to the child welfare authorities, the court, in turn, seeks a report back from the child welfare authorities as to the nature of the suspected child abuse. Equally, it is important that at the State level there are adequate resources to deal with child abuse cases, not just to find out whether abuse occurred and indeed not just to punish those who are guilty, but rather to help the children by trying to ensure that they are brought out of that extraordinarily traumatic experience which inevitably is a product of child abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> To me, one of the saddest aspects in this area of social concern is the number of occasions on which my wife Rosemary has spoken in meetings around Australia only to find that people in the audience have approached her afterwards and explained how they were abused as children. In other words, this abuse has been happening for years, but society has done little about it. I am suggesting that child abuse is not just a matter for the courts but for society to try to do something about, as it does have a traumatic impact on the victim which often lingers long after the event. </PARA>
<PARA> Rosemary became involved in this matter because a person with whom she had had an association lost a sister. It transpired that the sister had been abused as a child. The suicide of this girl was the result of the fact that she had never been able to get over the impact of that abuse as a child. That happens in so many instances. So it is not sufficient for us to look just at the legalities involved in this matter; it is necessary for us to try to ensure that there are adequate resources within the State welfare system to help those victims and to provide some psychological assistance to them. </PARA>
<PARA> It is because of my concern that there should be adequate consideration that I strongly commend the process which the Chief Magistrate in the ACT, Ron Cahill, uses. He allows video taping of evidence outside the courtroom in order to ensure that adequate evidence can be taken from children away from all the trappings of the law, in a climate where it might be possible for the children to feel more relaxed. Because I approve of that process, I therefore support clause 15 in the Bill-that is, the degree to which there is to be some modification of the rule against hearsay evidence so that in child sexual abuse cases there can be some lightening of the restraints in the normal evidentiary procedures to allow evidence to be received on the basis that the Government permits in its amendment. I do not accept that that particular clause should be deleted. </PARA>
<PARA> Although I know that the honourable member for Kooyong is reflecting the view of the Law Council and others in that field, it is my own view that it is important that we try to allow the maximum evidence from children so that we can try to determine the truth in such cases. Certainly, trying to establish the sort of evidence that is adequate is extraordinarily difficult, as the Cleveland cases in Britain demonstrated. I stress that in this jurisdiction people are giving evidence to a judge-not to a jury-and a judge should be sufficiently and properly qualified to be able to assess even hearsay evidence given by a child in a case of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my view that clause 15 in the amendment that the Government proposes to submit should be retained. I believe that these changes should be welcomed. I know that the gestation period of the amendments has been long. I know that inevitably clauses within this Bill will be seen as inadequate by many. They will not be seen as addressing the total problem. It is for that reason that I believe it is necessary to have a wider inquiry and I commend to the Attorney-General that the inquiry that the Senate is about to undertake should not just be for the Senate, but for both Houses. This is a matter of tremendous importance to our society and if we are able to overcome some of the products of child abuse, there will be a beneficial effect far beyond the area of family law and into the area of lessening the number of criminals and reducing some of those psychological pressures which regrettably linger for those who have been abused in any way during their childhood. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-Before going to some of the matters of substance raised by the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), which I will respond to in summing up, I must say that this probably has been one of the best debates-if not the best-that I have heard on an issue in my 10 years in this House. It is unusual to be able to say that in this place. I would like to thank all those members who have participated in this debate-the honourable member for Kooyong, the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch), the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster), the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio), the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) and the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will touch briefly on the matters raised by the right honourable member for New England because they are fresh in my mind at the moment. On the question of the family law committee to which he referred at the end of his speech-the idea for which originated in the Senate-I can tell the House that it has been agreed that that will be a joint committee. No doubt the right honourable member for New England may well desire to make a contribution to that committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the Family Law Amendment Bill was introduced in May last year gave people an opportunity to give a lot of thought to this matter. That was probably partly why we have heard a very reasoned debate. I am not saying that one could agree with all that has been said. Some speakers dealt with the Bill very specifically and others covered the matter in a far broader sense, expressing philosophical views about the Family Law Act and families generally, and particularly the breakdown of marriages. Whether one agreed or disagreed with all that was said, there were many genuine contributions made in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been an enormous amount of consultation on this Bill-first, with the various societies in the legal profession, secondly, with the Opposition and thirdly, within the Government. Whilst there is some disagreement and there are amendments which will be moved by the Opposition in committee, at the end of the day I think that whilst we are not in total agreement, we have probably gone about as close as we could in this difficult area, as was outlined by the right honourable member for New England a few moments ago. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to express my thanks to the Attorney-General's Department for the amount of work its staff has done, particularly in consultation which took place just before this debate when there were still some matters about which people were expressing concern. I thank members of my own staff, particularly Keith Holland who had the carriage of this matter in the office. I also thank Sturt Glacken who is on the staff of the shadow Attorney-General. I understand that he is moving on in the near future, but he did work extremely hard on this Bill. There was a lot of correspondence between those two people and I thank them for the effort that they put in. </PARA>
<PARA> The shadow Attorney-General raised many of these issues immediately this Bill came into being back in May last year in order that they could be properly addressed. I must say that the performance of the Opposition was a very satisfactory one in attempting to be extremely constructive. I think it must be noted that that is the case, because it is very rare that one has the opportunity to say that. I am not saying that is always the Opposition's fault. Nevertheless, a little more constructive debate in this place would not do any of us any harm. </PARA>
<PARA> During his remarks the shadow Attorney-General sought my response specifically on some issues. Some of them could be dealt with in the committee stage, but I think I will deal with them now. He indicated that the Opposition would be moving five amendments to the Bill, and these have been circulated. </PARA>
<PARA> I can indicate at this stage that the Government will be accepting one amendment to be moved by the Opposition, and that is the amendment requiring an alleged abuser of a child to be served with notice that the allegation has been made in family law proceedings. That is the amendment to clause 12 on page 5, line 19, which is the first amendment on the list of amendments circulated on behalf of the shadow Attorney-General. That amendment will be accepted. </PARA>
<PARA> The other issues raised by the shadow Attorney-General include clause 12, which is of course the one I think every speaker has touched on. That is the question of mandatory reporting of child abuse. The Opposition has proposed amendments to clause 12 to replace the mandatory reporting provisions in the Bill with voluntary reporting provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the matter which caused an enormous amount of discussion on both sides of the House. I can assure the House that within the Government it was discussed at committee meeting after committee meeting. It was not an easy matter to deal with. In our view the Government's proposed amendments to the Bill substantially narrow the mandatory reporting provisions of the Bill as far as is consistent with the protection of children. I think that has made that issue more acceptable to the Opposition, although today-very late in the debate-the right honourable member for New England expressed some doubts about that. That is an indication, I think, that people who have looked at this matter closely find it very difficult to be too sure which way to go. </PARA>
<PARA> Following the efforts that have been put into it, and on the studies that we have done, we say that that mandatory reporting-to be limited to the most serious categories of abuse-does meet the concerns of people in this area as can best be done. There will, of course, now be no criminal penalty for failure to report. I think that was certainly necessary. Reporting will be limited to abuse coming to the attention of court staff during the course of their duties. So it is true it has narrowed considerably. </PARA>
<PARA> The object of mandatory reporting provisions is to increase the chance that an abused child will be protected in future by having the abuse reported to the authorities who have the necessary statutory powers and responsibilities for investigating abuse, and of course there I refer to the State and Territory child welfare authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> Family Court staff do not have the expertise or the statutory powers to investigate allegations or to determine whether they are to be believed. State child welfare authorities have the powers and the responsibilities for such investigations. Family Court counsellors have been consulted on the amended reporting provisions of the Bill and now generally support the provisions. I must say that the responses from the Family Court counsellors was prompt, and I should also express our appreciation for the way they responded to the need for us to know what their view was. It was extremely helpful in reaching a determination as to which way the Government should go. </PARA>
<PARA> The shadow Attorney-General in the second reading debate referred to a Family Law Council suggestion that judges of the Family Court should vet allegations of abuse before they are sent to child welfare authorities. It is the Government's view that the investigation and determination of suspected child abuse is a matter for State and Territory child welfare authorities and not the Family Court. In any event, the Chief Justice of the Family Court has rejected the Law Council's suggestion as being too cumbersome, and the Government cannot support a procedure which would potentially, in our view-and there is a lot of support for this opinion-delay an investigation where there is a risk of abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> The shadow Attorney-General asked why the proposed subsection 70bb (5) was necessary. The purpose of that section is to ensure that court counsellors may disclose information to child welfare authorities in case conferences with those authorities following the initial notification of abuse. Family Court staff sought the protection of the reporting provisions for those conferences, and the Government believes the provision is a sensible measure. There was a lot of concern on the part of Family Court staff in relation to this matter. I think that that protection should have been given, and that is the reason for that section. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 14 was another matter where the shadow Attorney-General raised some concerns. That is the question of intervention in proceedings. The Opposition has circulated, as one of the amendments that it will be moving in committee, an amendment that will alter section 92A in clause 14 of the Bill in two ways. Firstly, it would make intervention a matter of judicial discretion rather than a matter of right, and it would add to the categories of persons who may intervene-a person, for example, with access rights or any person with an interest in the welfare of the child. The amendment to clause 14, however, is not acceptable to the Government. Section 92 of the Family Law Act already allows for any person to apply to the Family Court for leave to intervene. Thus a person with access rights or an interest in the child's welfare can apply at any time for leave to intervene, the distinction being, of course, that the Opposition wanted that intervention in limited circumstances to be as a matter of right. </PARA>
<PARA> The new section 92a will allow certain categories of people to intervene as of right in child abuse proceedings, and the list of people in that new section 92a has been limited to those who clearly have a legitimate interest in the proceedings. A multitude of parties would make the proceedings longer, more complex, and in our view it is not something that should be done. Of course, it would add considerably to cost. </PARA>
<PARA> People with access rights or with an interest in the child's welfare-and two groups specifically referred to were grandparents and neighbours-should intervene only if they can persuade the court that they can usefully contribute to the proceedings. It is not a matter of the Government and people we have consulted on this issue wishing to exclude them, but it is a matter of importance that they should at least be able to indicate to the court that they can usefully contribute to the proceedings, rather than have the right of intervention automatically. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter raised by the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Kooyong, related to hearsay evidence. The Opposition has circulated an amendment proposing the omission of clause 15 of the Bill which provides that hearsay evidence of a statement made by a child about matters relating to the child's welfare is admissible in Family Court proceedings. In the family law area something that a child has to say about his or her welfare should not be excluded from consideration by the court. It is the established practice of the Family Court to admit hearsay statements of children regarding their welfare so that children will not be drawn into court proceedings by being called as a witness for either partner in a custody or access dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the Opposition has proposed that amendment, I do not think there is an enormous amount of difference at the end of the day. I do not think that amendment is proposed with any great fervour although, clearly, there is a difference between the Opposition and us on this matter. I think it is worth noting that clause 15 does not extend but simply states in legislation the Family Court's existing practice in relation to hearsay evidence because, in fact, that is the position that has been adopted for some time. The statement of this practice in legislation was recommended by the Family Law Council to clear up doubts about the legal basis for what had been a long-standing practice within the Family Court. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's decision to accept the recommendation has been shown to be correct by some recent events in the United Kingdom where the necessity arose for urgent legislation to be passed in order to overcome a recent decision by the court of appeal that there was no legal basis for admitting hearsay evidence of children in family law proceedings. We may well have found ourselves in the position where, although such hearsay evidence has been a practice in this country, because there was no statement of that practice in legislation it may well not have survived. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's amendment to clause 15 will ensure that the judge in each case retains a discretion to determine whether to admit the evidence and to determine the weight to be given to such evidence when it is admitted. I think that gives the necessary protection, without removing the flexibility which I think is necessary in relation to the evidence of children in family law proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing the debate before we move into the committee stage, I again express appreciation on behalf of the Government for the constructive attitude adopted by the Opposition to this Bill. Although we brought the legislation in last May, I think the delay in allowing people the opportunity to consider it has been well worth while. </PARA>

<PARA> (1) Clause 12, page 5, line 19, at the end of proposed subsection 70ba (2) add ``, and serve a true copy of the notice upon the person who is alleged to have abused the child or from whom the child is alleged to be at risk of abuse''. </PARA>
<PARA>The first Opposition amendment to the Family Law Amendment Bill relates to provisions concerning what should be done after an allegation is made that abuse of a child has occurred. Let me make it clear, as it has been throughout the conduct of this debate, that the abuse of children is an evil. It is an evil that we in a civilised society must do as much as we can to prevent and prohibit. It is something that can damage a child for life. All of those who are touched by child abuse are diminished by it. As has been made clear, I believe by speakers on both sides of the House, child abuse is something that Parliament must do its utmost to bring to an end and to protect those who cannot protect themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Child abuse is a primary evil. Unfortunately there are other evils that can be built upon that. It has been known-I am not suggesting that it is common-for allegations of abuse to be falsely made by parties who are in the midst of family law proceedings. That is regrettable because if that practice should go on, to a degree it undermines the seriousness of allegations of child abuse. That is a secondary evil that we must determine to set our faces against as well. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition amendment proposes that where an allegation is made in a Family Court proceedings that a child to whom the proceedings relate has been abused or is at risk of being abused, notice of that allegation be served on the person who is alleged to have abused the child. The person against whom the allegation is made will, therefore, be notified that the allegation has been made. Of course, that is a matter of natural justice in itself, but it is also, if you like, a protection so that if the allegation is falsely made, the person against whom it is falsely made has notice and has the opportunity to come into the proceedings and, presumably, to contest that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed clause as presently drawn sets out a procedure whereby court registrars must notify child welfare authorities of any allegations made by a party to the proceedings that abuse has taken place. The reporting obligation imposed on registrars becomes triggered upon the filing of a prescribed notice by the party making such an allegation. The amendment I am moving is simple: it requires the party making the allegation to serve a copy of the prescribed notice upon the alleged abuser. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment endeavours to give effect to the fundamental premise of the rules of natural justice; that is, people should be in a position to answer any allegations made against them. The form of the notice will be prescribed by rules of the court. It is for the judges to determine the exact content of such a form. For my part, I would hope that such a notice will require the alleging party to give particulars of the material facts relied upon and that it will contain a statement setting out the entitlement of persons under proposed new section 92a to intervene in proceedings. I welcome the indication from the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) that the Government will accept this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA> `(4) Where a person intervenes in proceedings by leave of the court pursuant to this section, the person is, unless the court otherwise orders, to be taken to be a party to the proceedings with all the rights, duties and liabilities of a party.' ''. </PARA>
<PARA>I should also explain that it is not proposed to formally move Opposition amendment No. (5) relating to rules allowing hearsay evidence from children whose interests are affected under the Family Law Act. The shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Kooyong, put the case for the Opposition in relation to that amendment. It has been commented on already by the Attorney-General. Although the proposed amendment stands, we will not be formally moving it because it has been well and truly canvassed already. </PARA>
<PARA> The second amendment the Opposition moves seeks to delete the new section 70bb, which is yet to be moved in its entirety by the Government, and to substitute an alternative section. The alternative section would provide that there be discretionary reporting in all cases that have to be reported pursuant to the section. Those would be cases where abuse has occurred, or is alleged to have occurred. `Abuse' is defined to include assault, sexual assault, involvement of the child in improper sexual activity, or ill treatment. It is a narrower definition of `abuse' and will have less reach than section 70bb will have after the Government moves its amendments because, in addition to that definition, the amendment the Government proposes to move will bring in some element of psychological abuse in relation to notification under that section. </PARA>
<PARA> We propose that in all cases of abuse, as defined, there be a discretion, as opposed to an obligation, to report suspected cases of child abuse. We should make it clear that those who will be receiving notice of abuse are trained persons-persons who will have experience and persons who will be capable of exercising that discretion. For our part, we hope that in every case where the prosecution authorities ought to be brought in or where a child is at risk that discretion is exercised. However, we do not believe that one can arbitrarily draw distinctions between levels of abuse and have different standards of reporting. We believe that those people who are interested, those who have the details, those who have the training, will have the ability to exercise that discretion in relation to reporting. </PARA>
<PARA> The third amendment is an amendment moved to clause 12 and follows on from the change to section 70bb if it is accepted according to our amendment. It is a consequential amendment and stands as part of the package. The fourth amendment relates to clause 14, which seeks to insert a new section 92a allowing for the intervention of interested persons in proceedings which concern allegations of child abuse. Under our proposed amendment, intervention will take place only if the court grants leave. I listened to what the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) said in relation to our proposed amendment in summing up the debate. </PARA>
<PARA> If our proposed amendment were accepted it would not lead to numbers of persons coming into the court and delaying proceedings because a discretion would be reposed in the court whether or not to grant permission in relation to all persons who sought to intervene. The court would be in a position to decide who did and who did not have a particular interest in that matter and the court could, if necessary, exercise its discretion in order to prevent persons with a frivolous or minor interest in the matter from coming in. </PARA>
<PARA> Our proposed section 9a also sets out with some greater width those who would be able to apply for rights of intervention in those circumstances. This would include persons who have been granted access and other persons with an interest in the welfare of the child, as determined by the court. The purpose of this is to avoid hardship in cases which may not fall within the list of categories put forward in the Government's Bill. Under the amendment, it will be up to the court, in deciding whether to grant leave, to determine whether it is appropriate for such persons to intervene. </PARA>
<PARA> The court will be in a position to weigh up the nature of the interest claimed. The court will retain control over proceedings. The court will have the opportunity to hear from all interested parties. The court will have the opportunity to inform itself as best it can and the court will have the opportunity, in the final analysis, to protect the child-which is the object of this whole Act-as is its duty, and to ensure that the best interests of the child are taken into account. I urge the Government to accept the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the reasons indicated earlier, the Government is not in a position to accept these amendments, with the exception of the amendment requiring a party in family law proceedings and who alleges that a child has been abused to serve notice of the allegation upon the alleged abuser. That is the amendment to clause 12, page 5, which was the first amendment moved by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello). That amendment is accepted by the Government but the other amendments are not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposed amendment to clause 12, the mandatory reporting of child abuse, has been very fully canvassed in the debate. I wish to say only that the object of the mandatory reporting provisions is to increase the chance that an abused child will be protected in future by having the abuse reported to authorities who have the necessary statutory powers and responsibility for investigation. As I indicated earlier, that is the State and Territory child welfare authorities. I do not intend to take up the time of the Committee by going into that matter in any more detail because it has been canvassed very fully by all speakers in the second reading debate. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Higgins touched on the matter of intervention in proceedings, clause 14, to which the Opposition moved an amendment. As I have indicated, that is not acceptable. Hearsay evidence, which is dealt with in clause 15, was not pursued, but I would like to make a couple of points on it. It should be clearly understood that clause 15 does not extend, but simply states in legislation, the Family Court's existing practice, as I indicated earlier. The statement in legislation was recommended by the Family Law Council to clear up any doubts about the legal basis for the Court's practice. The Government amendment provides for the judge's discretion to remain as to whether to allow the evidence and the weight given to such evidence. Therefore, with the exception of that one amendment which is accepted, the Government is unable to accept the Opposition's amendments. </PARA>

<PARA>In introducing the Family Law Amendment Bill, I said that I welcomed public comments on it. These amendments come as a result of wide consultation with a number of people individually and with a number of groups, including such organisations as the Family Law Council, the Family Court of Australia, the Law Council of Australia, the Law Institute of Victoria and Family Court counsellors. The first amendment, which is an amendment to the marriage counselling provisions of the Family Law Act, is necessary as the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) has taken over responsibility for the approval of marriage counselling organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment to clause 4 inserts new definitions of `abuse' and `member of the Court personnel' into the Bill. The new definition of `member of the Court personnel' includes welfare officers and Family Court registrars as the Family Court advises that these officers may also become aware of suspected child abuse in the course of their duties. Of course, the new definition of `abuse' spells out what is meant by assault and child sexual abuse and, once again, the definitions are based on the advice received from the Family Law Council on how those terms should be defined. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 3 is amended to make the Bill clearer in its operation in relation to step-parent adoptions. The amendment makes it clear that a step-parent adoption does not put an end to custody access rights under the Family Law Act unless the Family Court has given leave for the step-parent adoption to proceed. Under amendment 4, clause 7 is amended to make the Bill clearer in its operation in relation to step-parent adoptions. The amendment makes it clear that the step-parent adoption does not end the access rights unless the Family Court has given leave for the step-parent adoption to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment No. 5-that is, to clause 8-makes it clear that in any custody access proceedings the courts are to have regard to the need to protect children from ill treatment and psychological abuse. This was a matter touched on by many of the speakers in this debate. This amendment makes consequential amendments to the welfare of the child principle to be inserted in section 64 of the Family Law Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment No. (6), which is to clause 9, ensures that where a court grants leave for the disclosure of information on the whereabouts of an abducted child the lawyer representing the party looking for the child may also have the information. Amendment No. (7), which is to clause 5, is a minor technical amendment to require a notice filed by a party alleging child abuse to file the notice in a form prescribed by the rules. Amendment No. (8)-that is, to clause 12-provides for the notification of abuse to child welfare authorities by court counsellors. Clause 12 will be changed to narrow the scope of mandatory reporting, which has been discussed in some considerable detail. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment No. (9) clarifies the legal protection given to court staff who report abuse. Legal protection will be limited to bona fide abuse reports. Amendment No. (10) is necessary to make it clear that hearsay evidence of statements made by children may be admitted; the court retains a discretion to exclude the evidence. Amendment No. (11) clarifies the drafting of clause 17 of the Bill in relation to the protection of children from repeated medical and psychological testing. The provision will now only apply to proceedings involving allegations of child abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment No. (12) clarifies the drafting of clause 17 of the Bill in relation to the protection of children from repeated medical and psychological testing. The schedule to these amendments is mainly to make technical changes to clarify the consequential amendments in the schedule to the Bill and will include provisions to increase penalties for offences. The Government amendments increase the penalties in line with the current position set by the Crimes Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Companies (Insolvency Assistance) Amendment Bill 1990 proposes to amend the Companies Act 1981. That Act is in the sunset of its life. By virtue of the Corporations Legislation Amendment Act 1990, cooperative scheme Acts, of which the Companies Act is one, continue to operate only in relation to matters arising before the national scheme laws commenced. The national scheme laws, which were passed through this Parliament last year, contain provisions which are virtually identical to those proposed by this particular Bill. By virtue of the amendments set out in schedule 3 of the Corporations Legislation Amendment Act, the corporations law in section 411 now incorporates provisions which this Bill seeks to put into the Companies Act 1981. We are to a degree, therefore, harmonising the past law in transitional phase to the current law which will operate in future. For that reason, the Opposition supports this particular Bill as a sensible change in relation to insolvency which will be conducted under the old laws to speed up and facilitate in practical terms schemes of arrangement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Where a scheme of arrangement is proposed between 30 or more subsidiaries of a particular holding company and between the holding company and its creditors, the court will have the power to order that meetings be consolidated between the holding company and the subsidiaries. Where there are fewer than 30 subsidiaries and there is a holding company and schemes of arrangement are proposed in relation to subsidiaries and the holding company, where the court considers it desirable to do so, it can order consolidation. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of that is that where a group gets into financial trouble and it is proposed that a scheme of arrangement be put into place so that the group as a whole can continue trading in the interests of the creditors, the mechanism to be gone through to implement that particular scheme of arrangement can be achieved through joint meetings rather than by multiplicitous meetings between various creditors in relation to various subsidiaries. Of course, all this came about when the Hooker group of companies proposed to enter schemes of arrangement and it was estimated that some hundreds of meetings would be required in order to bring that scheme of arrangement into effect. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a sensible amendment which will facilitate in large company restructurings the holding of meetings to vote on schemes of arrangement in relation to the whole of the group. For that reason, it deserves the Opposition's support, and the Opposition will support this particular Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> In preparation for looking at this particular legislation, I attempted to obtain statistics on the number of company liquidations that have occurred over the previous years-and these figures are not very easy to come by. It may be, of course, that the Department of the Attorney-General has not kept records of them because company liquidations have gone through in State courts and the Attorney-General's Department has not been able to collate all those figures. But I recommend to the Attorney-General's Department that it collates figures on company liquidations and that it releases them in such a way that they are easily ascertainable and become public in much the same way as bankruptcy statistics become public. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) is quite forthcoming in releasing statistics on bankruptcy, as part of the administration of the Bankruptcy Act. Now that the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) is predominantly responsible for the operation of company laws in Australia, this is something that I would recommend to him; presumably he, like Senator Tate, can take some sort of responsibility for the number of company liquidations which are proceeding through the courts. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures on bankruptcy-and they may give us some estimation of what is happening in relation to company liquidations-are quite horrific. The figures on bankruptcy to June 1990 showed that in the year since June 1989 there was an increase in the number of personal bankruptcies of about 10 per cent. The number of bankruptcies up to June 1990 increased 10 per cent on the number of bankruptcies to June 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> But figures which have been released since June 1990 show a disturbing picture. The figures for the September 1990 quarter showed that there was an increase of 32 per cent over September 1989 quarter. We were coming off a high starting base anyway, but there was a 32 per cent increase in the number of bankruptcies in the September 1990 quarter compared with the September 1989 quarter. Worst of all was the State of Victoria, where bankruptcies increased by 70 per cent in that quarter. </PARA>
<PARA> That will give honourable members some indication of the way in which the Victorian economy has been doubly jeopardised-not only jeopardised by the incompetence of the Federal Labor Government but also having the double whammy of the State Labor Government, which has given rise to a 70 per cent increase in bankruptcies in the September 1990 quarter. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall in Australia, the figures for December 1990 looked even worse. The increase in the number of bankruptcies in the December 1990 quarter compared with the December 1989 quarter was 56 per cent. Fifty-six per cent more people went bankrupt between September and December 1990 than between September and December 1989. As I said before, that increase of 56 per cent was already coming off a high base. This seemed to be more evenly distributed right throughout the States, and it is testament to the way in which the Federal Government's economic policies began biting in the latter part of this year. </PARA>
<PARA> A bankruptcy is not just a statistic. A bankruptcy involves an individual person and an individual tale of woe and destruction. When bankruptcies occur, it means that people who are unable to pay their debts lose control of their financial position, turn over their assets to administrators and have administrators distribute those assets to creditors. For people who become bankrupt, that ends effectively their opportunity to engage in independent business on their own account; they lose the ability to generate credit and they lose whatever savings they may have been able to put together over the years. The family-and many bankruptcies affect families-loses the financial security of the bread earner in the house. On many occasions houses and cars are sold and it becomes a tale of tragedy and woe. </PARA>
<PARA> To talk about the increases in bankruptcy that I have mentioned is to tell in a very shorthand way what is going on out there in the Australian community at the moment. A wave of bankruptcy is surging through the Australian community as the Government's economic policies begin to take effect. I believe that if we had company liquidation figures they would show a similar tale. Honourable members should not think that just because we say a certain number of people went bankrupt in a particular year, that means they were the only people who were affected by the economic recession brought on by this Government; it means that they were the only people who had no opportunity other than bankruptcy to deal with their particular economic problems. Bankruptcy is only the extreme case of what is surging through the Australian community at present. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Treasurer (Mr Keating) says, `This is the recession we had to have', he is effectively saying, `This is the bankruptcy I had to give you', `This company liquidation was my work', `This was my work to give you this liquidation' or `This was my policy to drive the Australian economy into recession'. `This is my policy, and it works,' is what the Treasurer says, `for I am the one who brought this about through my economic policy'. </PARA>
<PARA> I feel sorry for the poor Attorney-General; by changing insolvency laws, he has to pick up the results of the Treasurer's good work in relation to the economy. I must say that the Attorney-General is doing a reasonably good job in trying to pick up, through changes to insolvency laws, what is becoming an all too frequent problem in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe I would go as far as the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell), who nominated the Attorney-General as an alternative Prime Minister. I sometimes wonder whether the honourable member for Kalgoorlie has the best interests of the Australian Labor Party at heart; when he nominated the Attorney-General as a potential Prime Minister, I could not decide on which side of the House he was coming down. But in the near future the Attorney-General probably will have his chance, as the aspiring candidates to take over from Prime Minister Hawke begin to fall one by one. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie only nominated the Attorney-General as part of a quinella, with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), but that Minister seems to have taken a very bad fall recently over the failure of the reserve wool price scheme, and I would think that, as far as the honourable member for Kalgoorlie is concerned, the Attorney-General is the only horse still in the race, with a good opportunity to pick up where the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are beginning to fall. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, since national scheme laws have been put in place-with, I might say, coalition support-so that we now have one corporate regulator, the Australian Securities Commission, which has responsibility for the administration of company laws, the Commonwealth Attorney-General, as the Minister responsible for the Australian Securities Commission, has the responsibility for the operation of corporate and company laws in this country. I suggest that the Attorney-General should be doing whatever he can to ensure that the service which is being offered by the Australian Securities Commission is one which is helpful to corporate operation here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> From time to time I get letters from constituents who are concerned about operation of the Australian Securities Commission. There is, indeed, a lot for the Attorney-General to investigate. For example, recently a letter was passed to me from some accountants who had been paying fees to the Australian Securities Commission as their annual return fees for the 1989-90 year. Although they posted off the cheque for their return on 10 January 1991, that cheque had not been banked by 7 February 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> They followed it up. They rang the particular office-and this was the Hobart office-and found that it had received the annual return and sent it across to Morwell. The cheque presumably was sitting in Morwell in Victoria. Morwell was rung and the accountants were told that the return had been received and was sitting in a tray with many others, but that the staff at Morwell were too busy to attend to it yet. Attached to the return was the cheque which had not been banked. One can accept that in the setting up phase of the Australian Securities Commission, the staff at Morwell is busy; one can accept that it may take them some time to key annual returns into the computer system. But one finds it hard to believe that they cannot remove the cheques from those returns and bank them in the interim. </PARA>
<PARA> I would think that this is something the Government ought to follow up, because that money, standing for 30 days in somebody's tray, has, of course, lost interest; it has lost money for the Government. If the Government wants to ensure that it operates a tight financial system and maximises the returns that it has, it should not leave cheques which have been paid to it sitting in people's baskets. The Government's organisations should be banking cheques as soon as they are received and putting that money to work. That is something that the Attorney-General might be able to investigate to see whether in fact the Australian Securities Commission is doing whatever it can to ensure that it runs an efficient system in relation to financial operations. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that when the Australian Securities Commission settles down and is fully operational, and when it has all of its teething problems out of the way, it can give Australia an efficient, clean and competent regulation of all of Australia's companies laws. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a lot to be done. Certainly over recent years there has been concern in the Australian community that compliance with corporate laws has been optional for some companies. There has been a justifiable concern that Australia's corporate regulators perhaps have not done all that they could have done to protect those who have invested in companies and those creditors who have dealt with companies. I know that the Australian Securities Commission is turning its attention to that, and it needs the support of government in the area of enforcement. </PARA>
<PARA> But enforcement, which is a subject for another time, is not the be-all and end-all of companies regulation. Enforcement no doubt is very important and it is a very substantial part of the work which must be done, but an awful lot of simple regulatory work has to be done in relation to operating a proper corporate system. It is a question of getting returns in; of putting them on records; of creditors and lenders being able to access all those things; of keeping company charges down; and of banking the charges when they come in. All of those things must be attended to for the sake of running a clean and efficient system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General, having had the support of the Opposition in introducing that national scheme, now stands before the Australian people as the person responsible. The buck stops on his desk in relation to the operation of that corporate system. I appeal to him to watch very carefully the Australian Securities Commission in its infancy and to make sure that every effort is made to iron out any of those defects which may occur. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, this Bill is but a very small part of that whole system-indeed, a part of that system which looks backwards rather than forwards. But, in so far as it looks backwards to harmonise laws and to bring in what should be a more efficient and more effective procedure for introducing schemes of arrangement in relation to holding companies and subsidiaries, it is a step forward, it is a measure that is worthy of support, and it will be supported by the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Companies (Insolvency Assistance) Amendment Bill has as its objective the creation of a new power for a court to order meetings of creditors of a group of companies on a consolidated basis with a scheme of arrangement that will have the effect of transferring assets, property and liabilities to the holding company. This consolidation will reduce the total number of meetings to a manageable size.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I read with interest the second reading speech of the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy). He pointed out that the need for this legislative change was bought about some time back in relation to the Hooker companies. They faced a difficulty in that they had to convene some 500 separate meetings of creditors right across the nation because of the complex connection or, one might say, the interrelationship between the 90-odd companies that made up the Hooker group. I welcome the legislation, and I believe it is another example of this Government acting responsibly to address problems in the corporate area. </PARA>
<PARA> I noted the concerns expressed by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) about bankruptcies, and I can understand anyone being concerned about the blow-out in their number. But I would like to bring to the House's attention another aspect that confronts those who do get into difficulty in business, and in doing so I refer also to the creditors, the shareholders and ultimately the employees of those businesses. I draw to the attention of the House the present procedures that exist for the appointment of receiver-managers and ultimately the activities of liquidators. </PARA>
<PARA> I argue strongly that we need to restructure the present system, to have a hard look at the existing law, to take up some of the recommendations that appear in the Harmer report of 1988 and to change radically the present procedures used for the appointment of receiver-managers and ultimately liquidators by the courts. </PARA>
<PARA> As most people appreciate, if a creditor believes that a company is in real difficulty it will go to the court and petition that court to have a receiver-manager appointed. Most times the appointee is recommended by that major creditor. I believe the system in principle is a good one in that, if a firm is in trouble because its directors face difficulty or the economic circumstances are such that they cannot handle the problems before them, there is value in bringing in an expert. That is the key to my contribution: the bringing in of an expert. But the information brought to me and the number of cases brought to my attention demonstrate over and over again that the people appointed as receiver-managers have no competency, no expertise whatsoever, in the management of the firm to which they have been appointed. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not cast aspersions at all on accountants in their profession. I know hundred of accountants in my own area and throughout Queensland through my years in politics and in business, and I believe they are good at their job. They are good at the job of accountancy. But I do not believe that they can automatically hold up some sort of badge and say, `I am a great restaurateur. I can be a hotelier. I can look after some processing firm'. And that is the task that is given to them. </PARA>
<PARA> I argue strongly that the objective of receiver-managers is to maximise the recovery of moneys owed to creditors and to maximise the outcome for shareholders. Also they have a moral responsibility to employees. That responsibility also flows to the liquidators. Yet in thousands of cases-and I suspect across the nation tens of thousands of cases-there is evidence that the system is not working and that there is a real need for this issue to be taken up at the level of the ministerial council for the Attorneys-General and to be placed on the agenda so that the relevant corporation law can be amended. The law needs to be amended in the first instance to ensure that the person appointed to be a receiver-manager has the ability, the competency and the expertise to do that job. </PARA>
<PARA> Business brokers, people whose firms have gone broke, hoteliers who have gone into bankruptcy and all sorts of directors have come to me and raised the issue that, whilst in principle they are allowed to stay involved, they never get the chance, particularly where some banks are involved. The banks appoint receiver-managers and those people are given all power. They often have no training whatsoever in business management; they have no understanding of whatever that industry is; and in most instances they tend to simply work out who owes what and what the assets are worth, and then they go all out to recover the moneys owed to the major creditor who was instrumental in having their appointment made before the court. </PARA>
<PARA> In most instances, they act like a liquidator in the interim period. From what I am told they carry out what we could call a scorched earth policy. They go out to sell up everything they can, sometimes at any price. This issue is an important one because it affects shareholders and employees. If the business goes bust, the employees lose their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> The alternative is that, given people in place who are competent, who have those skills, that business could continue, creditors could recover a large amount of the moneys owed to them and shareholders could ultimately get a return from their investment. Instead, what do we find? We find receiver-managers charging up to $160 an hour. Another case I have here is of a receiver-manager charging $1,000 a day-for what? To wind down, in effect, that company-not to carry out his job. If we look at some of the disbursements at the end of the period when the liquidator has finally come in, we see fees of $130,000. I have two cases here: firstly, of fees of $135,000; and, secondly, of a construction company in North Queensland where the liquidator's fees were over $100,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The costs have to be relative to the results received and I would suggest that is not the situation. Instead, what these individuals do is simply sell off assets. In one instance I have here, there was the needless selling off of assets. They sold assets far in excess of the moneys required to recover, in this instance, a bank's debt-and that same person is still refusing, after six months, to substantiate the fees charged. The losers are always the other creditors. The losers are always those people who are left behind-and very rarely do we find a prime creditor suffering in any way. </PARA>
<PARA> The solution is to ensure that receiver-managers who are appointed have that experience and that there is a requirement for them to convince the court that they have that experience-the experience to maximise the recovery of moneys for the creditor; to maximise the capacity of the business to be ongoing, which ultimately protects the employees. If a liquidator comes in after a receiver-manager, again there ought to be a requirement that that person maximise, again, the return for all concerned. But that simply does not occur in many cases. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been told of sweetheart deals-of liquidators who have in fact a class of friends in business who are there to buy up the businesses in trouble. There ought to be a requirement that all businesses in difficulties such as this ought to go to tender; that equipment, fixtures and fittings all ought to go to some form of auction. There ought to be real tests made when companies are sold up. </PARA>
<PARA> A case was given to me where a liquidator sold a business to two directors of that company for about a third of its worth-a price tested by its real asset backing, tests having been done on land, improvements, pieces of plant, fixtures and fittings, stock, and work that was in progress. It even went into goodwill areas such as the brand name and, in this instance, some drawings. We could add in other companies where we have patents and trademarks that are of real value, but these things do not seem to be taken into consideration by the liquidators who carry out what is really a fire sale to their mates-a fire sale to the boys. </PARA>
<PARA> All businesses and all properties should be put to public tender when liquidation is reached or, when a receiver-manager is involved, he should be bound to do his utmost by way of public tender, by way of every action possible, to recover the debts not only of the petitioning creditor but also of all other creditors. He should be forced to call a meeting of all creditors. This sometimes happens and sometimes it does not. Very often a person knows nothing about it as a creditor until there is a piece in the newspaper or the word gets out-and that person is the last one left. There ought to be a requirement that every creditor is notified in writing and that letter ought to be sent at a reasonable time-not well down the track. </PARA>
<PARA> I know this is difficult. I know that when we start advertising a situation where a receiver-manager has been appointed, suppliers are going to hesitate and many will simply have no part of the business in difficulty. This can still be done taking that point into consideration. For instance, it can be achieved by having that full meeting of creditors. </PARA>
<PARA> I would suggest also that we need to have a hard look at the US chapter 11 system where an individual can stay the action of a creditor. One has a given period of time-it is a short period, admittedly-when one can bring in a manager with great skill on an interim basis to try to overcome the problems and see where the difficulties really are. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation we have instead in this nation-and I go to cases in Queensland of restaurants, hotels, construction firms, engineering companies, processing companies, and it goes on and on and on-is that receiver-managers have been appointed and the only result was the winding up; that is all that happened. There is the case of a particular restaurant in Brisbane where immediately the plant, the fixtures and the fittings were sold; of a hotel in central Queensland where they went automatically to auction; of a construction firm in Queensland that they did nothing to help-the fees were enormous, but they did nothing to recover the stability and viability of that firm; and with an engineering firm they did not even bother to try to sell the business as a going concern, but instead sold off bits and pieces at depressed prices. </PARA>
<PARA> In another instance, they actually sold the key machinery of the business, which made it impossible for the business to continue anyway. At a processing company in Brisbane the receiver-manager had no understanding of the business whatsoever, and all he did was to wind it up and sell all the equipment on a piecemeal basis. </PARA>
<PARA> I give due credit to the accountants, who have a very difficult job to do. At the same time, they ought not take on these tasks that they are not competent to a carry out. What we could and I believe should do is take advantage of the many people out there in the community who come within that retired category. I give this as an example because, in the case of a newsagency in Brisbane, the Kendals accountancy firm decided to appoint, employ, a retired newsagency proprietor. He and his wife were working on a strictly salary basis, and within a period of time ended up turning what was a newsagency in great difficulty into a business that was going quite well. It was ultimately sold at a fair price. The major creditor in this instance, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, had a total recovery of its money and all other creditors gained significantly because of the action taken by Kendals. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not true of other accountancy firms, and I do not want to go into naming some of them. Some of them are very well known. Some have great reputations in the accountancy profession. But what they do is appoint accountants; they do not appoint people with skill and expertise. I know that there is a list of liquidators in Queensland, but again there is no measure of their skills; they are simply on the list. From what I am told of people who are close to this in the legal profession, these people virtually take their turn. They are on a register of liquidators, their turn comes up and they eventually get a job-a job that they have no skill for, have had no involvement, experience or past performance in, and for which they have no expertise-but they get the job, and who suffers? Again, the creditors, the shareholders and the employees. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another good example of Horwath and Horwath, accountants, in Brisbane. A major reception centre was in great difficulty. But instead of putting an accountant in, they put in a competent management couple. They are now making solid profits. I suggest that we could add to that the Australian Business Industry Council. The ABIC linked up with Benfield Constructions, identified the most viable part of the company, and got it running well. Why, again? Because they used competent people who knew that specialist industry; who found the profit source and did something with it; who understood how to turn what was then a very bad dollar in debt terms into good dollars in profitability terms. In this instance, with this building construction firm, the jobs have been kept, a lot of creditors have already been paid, and there is a maximising of the returns. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe we can go further. I believe that we have the opportunity to go further, now that corporate law has become uniform at a national level and we do have this ministerial council structure. I believe we can actually come down to a procedure, for instance, where a receiver-manager who is appointed by the court ought to be required to go away and come back to the court with what we might call a business plan that sets out the options available. </PARA>
<PARA> I think also there is room for the appointment of some type of board of review or panel of experts to assist the judges, so that when the receiver-manager comes back and says, `Look, these are the options; these are the things we can or cannot do', people with that specific expertise can say, `That's the way to go'. Instead, what happens? Their turn comes up as the liquidators, they get it and who cares? As long as they wind it up and at the end of the day they, the liquidators, get paid. It is a receiver-manager situation. The only ones who are really concerned are those petitioning creditors who appoint in most instances or highly recommend the receiver-manager. That person gets his $160 an hour or $1,000 a day and the major creditors recover their money. The others are the losers. </PARA>
<PARA> I argue that, as we take up this issue- and it is an important one; as I said, it was raised in the 1988 Harmer report-there ought to be some type of investigatory stage. I mentioned before the American system where they have an interim manager arrangement. It seems to me that we do not have to just copy what the Americans do, but we can take the advantages from what they have experienced and what they have been able to achieve. There ought to be some type of investigatory arrangement as stage one, where the receiver-manager goes in-and he can be the accountant, the money person-and checks through the whole business; then he can come back with a prepared plan, a plan that goes to the judge; and the third stage would be the implementation of that plan, with the appointment of competent people. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue is serious. I take note of what the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) said. I also have concerns about the growth in the number of bankruptcies. I have seen it in my own area. I have seen people whose life savings have gone. I have seen people who have retired from Commonwealth jobs and from the Army and who have gone into a business of one sort or another. They are now bankrupt and face a very miserable existence. I also ask the House to take up the issue of those other people linked to businesses-the creditors, the shareholders and the employees. I believe that we really need to come to grips with this problem because no-one else appears to have done so. </PARA>
<PARA> I give full credit to my own Government for what we have done in the area of the rights of shareholders. I refer to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, chaired by the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch), which is doing some excellent work in this area. As a member of that Committee, along with the honourable member for Higgins, I am impressed with the sorts of recommendations coming forward. But as yet no-one has taken up this matter and understood the imperatives that exist in trying to solve the problem. It is a major problem and its consequences are measured in hundreds of millions of dollars and in ruined lives. This Parliament has a special responsibility to try to solve those problems. The suggestions I have put forward may not be the total solution but I believe they are at least a solution in part and ought to be considered carefully. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had not really intended to join the debate on the Companies (Insolvency Assistance) Amendment Bill because it appeared to be a fairly straightforward amendment under the new Companies Act. However, when I read the second reading speech by the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy), I found that a good deal of it was put along the lines of the debacle involving the Hooker Corporation Ltd. I therefore thought I would correct the record because there is an attempt in this somehow or another to dump on me in particular and the Opposition in general for what was, without any doubt at all in my mind, a rushed, ill considered and certainly self-interested push by the professional advisers to Hooker.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I even went back to my office and got my diary. I have found that in politics it is a very good idea to keep a diary. It has all sorts of interesting things in it. In fact it is the first time I have opened it since 1989, and I will refer to that later. It shows that the first time the matter was drawn to my attention was on Saturday morning, 16 December. The House was sitting on 21 and 22 December-one of these new fangled ideas of having sittings of Parliament the day before Christmas for the maximum convenience of members. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of that Saturday morning, three people, Brazil, Cadell and Grellman, travelled to Brisbane to outline their proposals to have a specially designed Bill for the liquidation of the Hooker companies introduced into the House and passed instantly. As all honourable members would know, Hooker got into some financial difficulties. As a consequence of this intervention, I asked them why the rush. I have always been of the view that corporate matters should be given time to mature. There is no point in suddenly rushing in to change company law or some Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The cooperative scheme-I was the Minister responsible for getting it through the House, and a few other things-took nearly 3 1/2 years to get together, getting the States to agree and so on. The hallmark of its success was the fact that all the various draft agreements and parts of that companies code were circulated to all the interested communities. Every law society, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Australia, the public accountants, got the papers. They all had three to six months to read them and everybody agreed. There was no disagreement at the end of the process. It took time, there is no doubt about that, but at the end we had the best we could muster on that occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> This is one of the areas that I took issue with in relation to the last event. That was not circulated and the Government did not have community agreement behind it. It just pushed it through: no consultation, shove it through. Company law is not about shoving things through, it is about a technical matter in which one must carry the lawyers, the solicitors and all the participating people. </PARA>
<PARA> I indicated that I thought that, firstly, a special pleading really was not the thing for Federal Parliament and, secondly, that these things do not really need to be rushed. I wanted to know what the rush was. It appeared that there were some 90-odd companies in difficulties, some of which were solvent and some insolvent. There were a range of credit preferences. They were proposing to merge the assets and liabilities, pay out the lesser ones to an amount I think of the order of $200,000, maybe $250,000, somewhere in that area, and manage it out. </PARA>
<PARA> When I inquired who was the person who stood behind most of this, I found that that unfortunate bank, the Westpac Banking Corporation, was there and that it had largely lent on negative pledges to the tune of $800m. So suddenly the urge for action was readily seen. We left that meeting on the basis that I said we would not support a particular Bill, that they ought to think about a general Bill, and that I still saw no reason to rush. </PARA>
<PARA> Time then passes and we get to Canberra on Wednesday, 20 December, when there was a party room meeting and shadow Cabinet meeting. That Bill was not on the list and it did not reach my room in the new form until Wednesday night. It was then produced in the general form of amendments to the insolvency Act. This is Wednesday, 20 December, with the House called back for 21 and 22 December to pass amendments from the Senate. They were tight timetables. I shall read from my diary for Thursday, 21 December, and I will leave out some personal observations. </PARA>

<PARA> I informed these gentlemen that the best I could recommend would be that it be introduced into the Senate, let lie on the table over Christmas, and come back on the agenda in the new year. One gentleman had some problems with his position with the New South Wales court, to which he had to return his views by 10 February or something like that. But I took the view that that was not a bad position. </PARA>
<PARA> Because I found the behaviour of the staffer from Bowen's office irregular, I sought out Lionel Bowen. I met him in the parliamentary dining room and I told him that I thought what was going on was unusual. It says in my diary, `Later Bowen agreed with me to introduce it in the Senate and leave it there if he could get it on the timetable'. That was at about 7 p.m. that night. I subsequently learnt that the Government dropped the Bill. From 21 December 1989 we rushed all the way through to 20 February 1991 before it came into the House. </PARA>
<PARA> I rest my case. I do not know what the rush was at that time. One of those gentlemen involved in this then went out and gave me a bucket. There is nothing unusual in that. The professional behaviour of those involved in all this was rather extraordinary. I do not blame the current Attorney-General; he had nothing to do with it. I am quite sure, on talking to Lionel Bowen, that Lionel was not fully up to it either. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The long and detailed contribution by the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) is a very difficult act to follow in respect of the Companies (Insolvency Assistance) Amendment Bill before the House. It is always good to keep diary entries because they can often be used to prove a point. I think he has done that tonight. I also think it is quite refreshing to hear the honourable member for Ryan, from the Opposition benches, suggest that it is important for consultation to take place and that draft Bills be allowed to lie on the table of the House and warnings be given to the broad constituency which may be affected by pieces of legislation so that they may respond to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In respect of many pieces of taxation legislation, that is certainly not the attitude that has been displayed by the Opposition. It quite often suggests that exposure drafts of legislation, the so-called legislation by press release that it claims the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has been famous for in the past, has often meant that there is too long a delay in getting Bills into the place before debate occurs. It is refreshing. It goes hand in glove with the attitude displayed by the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) yesterday in his contribution to the debate on the matter of public importance. It is a much more reasoned and a softer approach. </PARA>
<PARA> A couple of points made by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) and the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) in this debate were interrelated to some degree. I am referring particularly to the issue of bankruptcies. Sadly, bankruptcies do occur in the Australian economy, an economy which after all is reasonably diverse, and the opportunity is provided for people--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a recession, as the honourable member for Wannon suggests, there is an increase in those bankruptcies. But it is also important to look a little beyond and say to the obvious culprits that might be there, like the government of the day, that their policies have put the economy into recession and therefore they are to blame entirely. Then when people have finished with the government they go to the banks and say that it is the banks' fault. The point I was going to make to the honourable member for Higgins was that in a submission that has come to the parliamentary inquiry into the Australian banking industry it was clearly demonstrated that about 5,000 bankruptcies occur annually within this country-not at this particular time because of economic circumstances, but mainly as a matter of course. The reason that this is the case lies in the very point that the honourable member for Capricornia made about people who perhaps were in the armed forces and had taken a severance pay, or people in the Commonwealth bureaucracy or a State bureaucracy who had taken a severance pay, or coalminers who had decided it was time to get out of that industry. They take a considerable sum of money with them, and the next thing they decide is that they are small business people. They set themselves up in some business where they think that their investment will be multiplied and that they have the necessary level of expertise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a sad commentary. Again, I think the honourable member for Capricornia was absolutely right in his reference to experts needing to be put into positions where perhaps bankruptcies or the winding down of companies are taking place. The same thing can apply to people who intend to become small businessmen and women in this country, and that is a level of training. It is a difficult and very competitive environment in which they seek to become involved. It is simply not a matter of finding a shop location somewhere and paying rent every week to ensure that one has one's shopfront location, putting in some stock and expecting to sell it. That is not what it is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a myriad of legal complexities involved in establishing a small business. On top of that there are the taxation requirements of Federal and State governments and a range of issues which people must address. Whilst we in this place might be debating the rights and wrongs and the problems that have been caused by the present economic circumstances, it is important that we should not lose sight of the fact that certainly while those circumstances may contribute to some of those problem bankruptcies, nevertheless, it is important to look a bit beyond that. </PARA>
<PARA> I appreciate, Madam Deputy Speaker, the opportunity to range a little widely in this debate after the latitude that you have displayed to other speakers. I come particularly to the Bill before us. I suggest that the purpose of the Companies (Insolvency Assistance) Amendment Bill is to simplify the use of schemes of arrangement in complex corporate structures. The Bill will enable the court to order meetings of creditors of a group of companies on a consolidated basis where the scheme of arrangement will have the effect of transferring assets, property and liabilities to the holding company. This consolidation will reduce the total number of meetings to a manageable number. I will refer to that classic case of the Hooker Corporation Ltd shortly to illustrate that point. </PARA>
<PARA> The power given to the courts is in addition to the powers the court already enjoys under the Companies Act-a point that was made by the honourable member for Higgins. The power is to be used in conjunction with the discretions the court has in determining the classes of creditors and in protecting the interests of creditors. That is a point that needs stating again and again. The interests of creditors must be protected. I do not think there is any disagreement by members on both sides of the House in respect of that. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 315 of the Companies Act 1981 allows a company in financial difficulty to reach a compromise or arrangement with its creditors or members as a means of avoiding a possible winding up of that company. I again would suggest that we would all be in agreement with that procedure. Schemes of arrangement provide significant benefits to both the creditors and shareholders of companies experiencing financial difficulties. But the great value of schemes of arrangement lies in their simplicity, their flexibility and, probably more importantly, their reversibility. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite often all creditors agree to a compromise of their claims. In this particular circumstance not even the court's approval needs be obtained and all that may be necessary is informal consultation with creditors and their consent to the scheme itself. As well, any combination of rights may be decided upon so as to suit the needs and the circumstances of the company, its shareholders and, of course, its creditors. Indeed, the only real disadvantage of such schemes lies in their initial cost. The preparation of documents for the court and legal representation may result in substantial costs. </PARA>
<PARA> Surprisingly, at the moment the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs is examining this matter. It is looking at this whole question of costs of legal actions. I think it is probably appropriate, in the light of issues such as this and generally in terms of the extent to which actions are being launched in difficult economic times by people to recover debts. </PARA>
<PARA> The current Bill aims to enhance the advantages of schemes of arrangement in the case of complex corporate structures by reducing such costs where necessary. As was indicated, and as I indicated a little earlier, the legislation has its genesis in the winding up of the Hooker group. The honourable member for Ryan went to some length to explain the Opposition's involvement in the preparation of this legislation. I have no need to comment further on the contribution that he made. In December 1989--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8I4">Mr MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would not tell the honourable member even if I could remember. In December 1989 the Government was approached by legal advisers to the provisional liquidators of the Hooker group of companies, seeking an amendment to the Companies Act because of the considerable practical difficulties which the provisional liquidators were facing. As was indicated by the honourable member for Capricornia, the fundamental problem facing the liquidators was the need to organise some 500 separate meetings of various creditors across the whole of Australia because of the interrelationship of approximately 90 holding and subsidiary companies which made up the Hooker conglomerate. I think that says something about the structure of some Australian companies, what has happened in the 1980s and why perhaps now there is such a call within corporate Australia for them to re-examine themselves and to look at the interrelationships that they have within their corporate structures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course we are talking about perhaps improving the ethics of business. I think that is appropriate for the 1990s. Sadly, of course, it is a reflection of some extravagances in the 1980s, which occasioned that for a variety of reasons that I will not go into at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> In the circumstances of the Hooker wind up, there was a real risk that it would not be possible to reach agreement on an appropriate scheme of arrangements which would enable the affairs of the companies to be wound up in a way which provided the optimum protection for creditors. There is that particular phrase again. The then Attorney-General accepted that there was a need to facilitate schemes of arrangement for complex company structures and the Government agreed that legislation should be developed which would provide a general solution to problems of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA> At present, schemes of arrangement require separate meetings of classes of creditors of each subsidiary. In a case such as the Hooker Corporation, one can see the obvious difficulties there. This can result not only in the enormous task of getting people together, but also in the arranging of hundreds of meetings in a country the size of Australia, which can be a very costly exercise and should be avoided at every opportunity. The Bill therefore allows the court additional flexibility in making orders under section 315 in order to circumvent this particular problem. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that the Chairman of the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities advocated his support for such change on 29 June 1990. In the Australian Financial Review of the same date, he was reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . liquidations such as that of the Hooker Group often involved many creditors meetings, each of which had to agree separately to arrangements to wind up affairs of the parent company. By consolidating all assets and liabilities of individual companies the number of creditors meetings could be reduced and the liquidation could be accelerated. </PARA>
<PARA>I suppose the idea of accelerating liquidation is not a pleasant thought, but nevertheless the arrangements for doing so when a company of this size was in a great deal of difficulty provided an appropriate process for facilitating that. </PARA>
<PARA> In drafting this legislation, the Government was concerned that the fundamental protections already in existence for such schemes were maintained. One essential element of such schemes was that a court should decide whether a consolidated meeting of creditors should be held. This would enable the interests of shareholders to be protected as they could ensure that the court was aware of considerations applicable to the circumstances of each specific case. </PARA>
<PARA> As I think was indicated, the process and the pattern of having legislation introduced at that time necessitated a rather rapid passage of legislation but, for a var- iety of reasons which the honourable member for Ryan elaborated upon, that did not happen and the legislation is now with the Parliament for consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> The original exposure draft which was put together in 1989 is different from the Bill presently before us. There have been one or two particular changes, not the least of which is that the power to order a consolidation should arise only where the number of subsidiaries of a group is at least 30. As a result of the consideration by the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities, this Bill allows consolidation orders to be made where the court considers that circumstances exist which would justify making such an order where there are fewer than 30 subsidiaries involved. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that legal opinion on this matter has indicated general support for it. In fact, Associate Professor Leigh Ffrench has offered the opinion that:</PARA>
<PARA>Applications to the Court for a scheme maybe made in respect of a group of related companies. However it may be difficult to ensure in these circumstances that proper separate meetings of members and creditors of the individual companies are held. Often the respective meetings are combined together. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will go a long way towards overcoming the problems which arise as a result of the necessity to hold separate meetings for all subsidiaries. Quite obviously that is the major intention of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation is in keeping with the spirit of the current case law and aims to expedite the administration of such schemes by overcoming the strict formality of complex company structures. As was indicated by His Honour Justice Street in Re Jax Marine Pty Ltd (1967) as reported in the New South Wales Law Reports at page 145, persons should be dissected into separate classes-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . by reason of some particular matter so affecting the rights of some as to render impossible for them to pursue their own interests concurrently with their participating in the pursuit of the interests of the class of which they appear to be members. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will vest in the court a capacity to facilitate schemes of arrangement in the case of labyrinthine and convoluted corporate structures where emphasis can be more readily placed upon the real interests of creditors rather than upon the formal organisation of the corporate group. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, it is the creditors who must be protected. This legislation will do that. It is appropriate and it is timely. Again, I am pleased that the Opposition is supporting this legislation unamended in its passage through this place and to the Senate. I wish it speedy passage and I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a sad day for Australia when the Government brings in legislation to make it easier for people to go bankrupt and that is what this Companies (Insolvency Assistance) Amendment Bill does. The second reading speech of the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) makes it very clear that, whilst the original beneficiaries of the amendments will not be able to take advantage of them, they `will, however, be available for other administrations of complex groups'. That was the Attorney-General's comment when he introduced these amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, one of the greatest assistants to insolvency in Australia today must be the Treasurer (Mr Keating). He is assisting more people to become insolvent than any other known factor in the history of this country. So this Bill follows the phil- osophy of the Treasurer and makes it easier for people to go broke or to wind up their cases when they find they are in difficulties. That is a sad commentary on the way in which this Government feels that it needs to deal with its economic problems. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has broad economic problems and one of its fix-it-quick processes is to allow large corporations to fold up easily. It allows all those people who are creditors to forgather, sometimes in numbers exceeding 500, in subsidiary groups and complex arrangements to be represented at a grand meeting. One could almost describe this as a funeral or a wake as another great Australian corporation bites the dust. So these creditors can assemble in proper solemnity and see how much of the remnants of that company they can attribute to themselves or to those for whom they act. </PARA>
<PARA> Bankruptcy law in Australia has been a problem, as has the administration of that law. In some instances it has been so rigid it has not been possible for creditors to rightfully gain access to their funds. In other instances bankruptcy law has been relaxed, where agents and other individuals have been appointed to act on behalf of the Commonwealth to wind up companies and to see that funds and assets are distributed, but there is little left at the end of the day. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of cases come to mind, cases which I have raised in this House. One that is still proceeding is the Latona case, which is a fascinating study of a bankrupt being wound up by a bankrupt agent but the Attorney-General refusing to remove that bankrupt agent-who was also an accountant-from the completion of his task until late in the day. Then the Government personality representing the Attorney-General eventually concluded the bankruptcy proceedings. It is fascinating to study how a bankrupt can be wound up by somebody who subsequently, during the process of those proceedings, proves to be bankrupt himself. </PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General assured me at the time that changes would be made to resolve that. I have not noticed them come before the Parliament, but today before the Parliament we have this wonderful piece of legislation to allow people to become bankrupt more easily. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, within the last few weeks we have had the total bankruptcy figures for Australia, and it will not surprise the hordes of people in the gallery tonight to know that every year and every month records are being broken in Australia. It is a record breaking government! It is smashing records like you would not believe. But the records that it is smashing each successive month are its own records in the number of people who are going broke in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> That record of the Government is something that today in the House the Treasurer appeared to be proud of-the economy is steady on course, and we are about to come into some sort of legislation-led recovery. The legislation that is going to bring about the recovery is legislation of the type we are debating in the House at present-that is, legislation to assist people to become insolvent. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the statistics it is pretty easy to understand why indeed people are going broke. If one looks at the commentaries of major business groups around Australia, one can easily see that the stern advice being offered to the Government is not being heeded-and it is desperate advice in most instances. I have never seen such uniformity of proposals coming to the Government to assist it to rectify the problems that it has in bankruptcy and rising unemployment. It does not matter whether it is the Confederation of Australian Industry, the Business Council of Australia or any of the myriad of smaller groups representing employers-those who supply the wherewithal for the Australian economy to function- the propositions that they are putting to the Government are consistent. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the position is best summarised by the comments of the Business Council of Australia, which says in part that to be effective and credible, the statement that we are to face on 12 March-which will cover issues such as bankruptcy, unemployment and trade-must convince business that the Government is committed to all elements of the Australian economy, not just traded goods and services, to become internationally competitive. It is not saying that legislation to make bankruptcy hard is going to solve the problem. It is saying there must be consistent attention given to the internal needs of Australia as well as to our export effort. I guess that is the key to Australia's recovery. </PARA>
<PARA> When one considers that Australia, in a period of just over 20 years, has slipped from about the fourth country in terms of living standards down to about twelfth, thirteenth or fourteenth, and in trading countries down to twenty-seventh, one can see it does not matter what measure is used. Whether it is trading ability or living standards, Australians are suffering. </PARA>
<PARA> Right at the moment we have seen the insolvency processes of very large Australian corporations, one of which would have benefited from this legislation. Not only have we seen the friends of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer-former friends, those magnates of large corporations, who have become people whom they do not associate with any longer-disappear from the corporate scene over the last 12 or 18 months, but also we have seen many very efficient and effective businesses come to a stop and cease business. The effect of that, of course, is the massive and quickly rising level of unemployment in Australia and the fall in the levels of job vacancies. </PARA>
<PARA> The average Australian, through the processes and policies of this Government, has in fact really suffered from the bankruptcies that have occurred over the last 18 months. It does not matter whether it is somebody some Australians now like to poke the finger at, such as a Bond or a Holmes a'Court-and we tend to be a bit like that, which is regrettable in some ways-or little subcontractors, many of whom live in my electorate, who employ two or three people and who now find they only have one or two days work a week. If they go bankrupt the effect on the Australian economy and our future is exactly the same. </PARA>
<PARA> It does not matter whether a little subcontractor is dragged before the bankruptcy court and the house and his wife's assets are gone, and the funds of his children are dissipated, gone-`lost the lot' is the term-or whether it is the large corporation, multi-million or billion dollar corporation that has also suffered, the impact on the Australian community is exactly the same. The nation has become less effective. It spends more on welfare. People cannot manage their family budget from week to week. We find rising unemployment and hardship. It is a tragedy that the Minister, in introducing this legislation, did not give some acknowledgment to the greater dependence that there is now on bankruptcy law in Australia and to the difficulties that people have in meeting their commitments. </PARA>
<PARA> The so-called Hooker's amendment-the Companies (Insolvency Assistance) Amendment Bill 1990-that we are debating today deals with one particular case, but I would have thought the Minister could have used the opportunity to announce, firstly, a major review of bankruptcy law and bankruptcy processes in Australia. It is not as clean and easy as it could be, and to solve one particular case by one specific piece of legislation such as this really does not resolve the problem. That could have been the other area that the Attorney-General, in his typical free and easy style, could have alluded to-that is, the problems of the economy-and proposed some alternatives for the Treasurer. Maybe he did not feel disposed to, but at least in his second reading speech, instead of a castigation of the Australian Democrats and the Opposition, there could have been some acknowledgment of the problems most Australians find themselves in today. </PARA>
<PARA> I have looked through the statistics concerning our foreign debt ratio. Most people know that we are in debt. Few realise it has taken about 20 per cent of our exports to meet that debt--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SD4">Mr CADMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is more than that, my colleague now says. It continues to rise. The profitability of organisations in Australia is falling dramatically. Something the Treasurer used to pride himself in was the profitability of Australian enterprises, and that is falling dramatically, particularly if one is to remove from the profitability factors the interest charges and the tax charges from corporations. If one removes the high interest rates, or removes interest rate factors and takes that into account over a period of years, and if one also removes the burgeoning tax on Australians and Australian employers, and runs that back over a period of years, one comes to the point of view that never before-or in the past 20 years-has profitability been lower. Therefore the pressure on solvency is greater and the prospect of or need for bankruptcy or liquidation is even greater than it has been in the past. That can be followed over the last 20 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today the Treasurer went back to the time of Menzies in order to draw some parallels. He need not have gone that far back; he could look back over the Fraser Administration as well as his own to realise that profitability is extremely low, which means employment is going to wane and the prospect of employment for school leavers is going to wane. It means that those people providing productive effort in Australia-the small businessmen, the small employers, the self-employed persons-are not going to be able to offer jobs or prospects of expansion. One only needs to look at the last 20 years to realise what a parlous state Australia is in. </PARA>
<PARA> We can use all sorts of measures to look at, for example, pre-tax profits and sales of corporations, at how much people want to buy-domestic demand-and where that has got to. We can look at the unemployment rate and the way it is rapidly screaming up, and at business investment. All of those things are just measures of how people in the community feel. Most of the information that comes to government is probably dated by six months by the time it passes through the Australian Bureau of Statistics and then becomes available. The figures that we look at here are dated in regard to what is happening now in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation in rural areas is desperate. In city areas there is rising desperation, with many bankruptcies and homes for sale. Therefore, I have taken the opportunity of this debate on the Companies Amendment Bill to draw broad attention to the fact that the way ahead for Australia is not one of producing legislation which allows people to become bankrupt more easily or of assisting them in the process of selling up their assets and dissipating the goods and savings of companies, but lies in other avenues. It does not matter whether those avenues of reform lie in reform of the Australian work force, the Government's own behaviour and expenditure, or just performing better in what are loosely termed the micro-economic areas such as transportation systems, with improvement of our capacity to get goods on vessels and sell them overseas on time and at the right price. All of these factors must come together as a package. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately for the Hooker organisation, for which this legislation was drafted, the single blunt instrument of the Treasurer's single-minded high interest rate policy was the cause of its problems. One can analyse company after company that is going bankrupt. The real cause of their problems is high interest rates. We can look at companies' profitability tables, market share and employment rates, and sheet the whole lot home to high interest rates. The Government has had alternative policies offered to it for two years now. It has fiddled with the hard parts and used the easy part. The Government could have done the hard things but it chose the easy way, which was to stick with a rigid, gut-busting, company life-destroying high interest rate policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The 12 March statement is approaching. I will guarantee to the Minister at the table, the Minister for Local Government (Ms Fatin), that the expectation created in the community in regard to this statement will not be met. The community knows that the Government talks big and acts little. The process of the gradualisation of change will be continued on 12 March. All of the high-sounding statements and the polemic will be there, but there will be no firm proposals. It will be something similar to the Premiers Conference-a constructive idea broken down into a series of committees, the results of which we are yet to see. So 12 March will result in a continuation of the same policies of high interest rates, failure to grapple with increasing bankruptcy and the continuing and increasing need for the Government to use prop-up measures such as this measure before the House today-a measure which seeks to make it easier for people to become insolvent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In May 1988, the Federal Government offered rural industry finance on a dollar for dollar basis up to $750,000 a year to finance an Exotic Animal Diseases Preparedness Consultative Council to assess the adequacy of existing exotic disease control procedures and the human and capital resources associated with those control procedures. The council was also to inquire into the social and economic implications of exotic diseases and compensation principles. It was to advise on how to monitor the efficiency of veterinary emergency plans.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The National Farmers Federation (NFF) agreed to take up the Government's offer because it believed there should be an independent body to look at those matters rather than interdepartmental committees. At that time I was critical of the Government off-loading some of what I believed should have been a national responsibility for exotic disease preparedness and quarantine services in Australia. It is to the credit of the National Farmers Federation that it accepted that responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Meat Chicken Levy Amendment Bill is to correct a drafting mistake in the 1989 amendment to the 1969 Act which accidentally set the maximum at 0.005 instead of 0.05. I suppose that one can say it was a drunken drafting error, with regard to the 0.05. It has also taken some time to correct that error because the Bill went through in 1989. I do not know what has happened to the level of contributions from the industry in between times. It is my understanding that the operative levy rates will continue to be set by regulation-presumably that is the answer, as the rates had not gone up to the maximum-on the recommendation of the relevant industry committee of the NFF in accordance with the Exotic Animal Disease Control Act 1989. The funds raised through the setting of the correct levy rate for this coming year are estimated to total $27,000. I understand that that is about 6 per cent of the total contribution to the rural dollar for dollar part of the fund. The other industries involved are wool, sheep meat, beef, dairy, pigs, poultry, buffalo and goats. </PARA>
<PARA> The Exotic Animal Disease Control Bill 1989 established the consultative council. One of the major reasons the legislation was introduced and the council established at that time was the continuing problem of disease risk for our livestock and plant industries. It has been the relative freedom from these exotic diseases which has been a great strength of those industries in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, more diseases are being discovered in Australia and there is considerable risk from a number of other diseases. The latest disease to be recognised is the nematode disease affecting some potatoes in Victoria. That is an unfortunate important problem for the potato industry in this country, which previously has been free of that disease. We face also the great risks of screw-worm fly, rabies and bluetongue.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, there is the risk of inadvertent, but to some extent deliberate, introduction of disease through a minimum risk quarantine policy. One can think of transmissible gastroenteritis with the importation of pig meat, fire blight with apples, and diseases of bananas, strawberries, deer, nursery products and nashi fruit. There are probably quite a few others as well. </PARA>
<PARA> This is of great concern to those domestic industries because so far they have been free of disease and they do not see why they should be exposed to those disease risks through a quarantine policy that allows imports into this country which they consider to be less than adequate. They also point out that there is a double standard being applied in relation to the importation of horticultural products in particular into Australia compared with the quarantine requirements imposed on our horticultural products when they are exported to other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> I am thinking in particular of the citrus industry. We have been allowing the importation of oranges from California. Australia has the same disease affecting citrus as does California and although we allow the importation of Californian fruit they will not allow our fruit into California-even though they now admit, reluctantly, but admit nevertheless, that it is the same disease. When one challenges the United States representatives on why this is so they say, `It's only a matter of a short period before this is sorted out. It's only one more review or one more set of documents to fix'. But they keep finding a problem each time. One has to question the sincerity of the United States in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I also challenge the sincerity of Japan. When one compares the standards Japan requires under area freedom-the policy of area freedom of minimal risk for the importation of product from another country-its definition of area freedom for product from Australia is dramatically different from product from Japan. I think particularly of nashi fruit, but I know there is a range of other horticultural products that are equally disadvantaged by the double standard of the Japanese. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that since this consultative council was introduced and other improvements have taken place with the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service there is better communication between the industry and the responsible Department, and I include in that a monthly magazine. The original legislation also mentioned the Austvet plan-the emergency veterinary plan to combat any of these exotic disease outbreaks. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Animal Health Laboratory (AAHL) at Geelong plays an important part in this overall plan. It is part of a worldwide network of maximum security laboratories. Purbright in the United Kingdom is a similar laboratory which I have visited and which is well-known for its foot and mouth and blue-tongue work. I think also of Oondespooret in South Africa, which I have visited twice-the last time last July-which is the world's leading centre for blue-tongue. </PARA>
<PARA> That one facility in South Africa-the South Africa that is reviled in relation to the rest of Africa-has done more than any other operation to prevent and cure animal diseases throughout the rest of Africa. We should remember that those African countries rely more on animal products to feed their people than on the grain products of other countries. The work by Oondespooret has done more to help people in the rest of Africa live and eat properly than all of the Western aid and Western lectures put together. I think we should realise that. I am disappointed that we have not been able to maintain the relations, communications and cooperation between Oondespooret and Australia-AAHL, in particular-which are essential if we are to combat exotic diseases around the world. </PARA>
<PARA> I look forward to a normalisation of relations between our two countries, which I believe should take place again, so that that cooperation between those two very important animal health facilities can once again return to what it was for the benefit not only of our two countries but also of many other countries. On behalf of the Opposition I support the Meat Chicken Levy Amendment Bill 1991. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Meat Chicken Levy Amendment Bill 1991 is to amend the Meat Chicken Levy Act 1969. The Act was to increase the maximum rate of levy for exotic disease, as the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) has commented. We have been fortunate in Australia, as an island continent, in being free from many of the diseases that have ravaged Europe, Africa and the Americas. It is important that we ensure, through the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) and every other means possible, that we maintain that high standard-and I must say that AQIS does a great job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Act was amended in 1989, together with other livestock industry levy Acts, as the honourable member for Murray has said, in order to raise funds for exotic disease preparedness. There is always a risk that, no matter how many precautions we take, inadvertently-for example, through fishermen in the north-some disease will come into Australia. I share his concern with regard to screw-worm, which is prevalent in New Guinea; rabies; and foot and mouth disease, which is present in some of the South East Asian countries. If those diseases got into our herds in the north, the cost and the means of eradication would be monumental. I believe it is important that we impose levies for preparedness measures to eradicate exotic diseases. </PARA>
<PARA> Due to an error, the maximum rate of levy was set at .005c per head instead of the correct rate of .05c per head. I guess the original amendment, like a chicken on Thanksgiving Day, has to get the chop so that we can bring in the correct levy of .05c per head. The matter has been discussed, as the honourable member for Murray said, with the relevant producer organisation and, of course, the National Farmers Federation has (NFF) has formally indicated its support for the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> Passage of the Bill will enable the correct rate of levy to apply from 1 July 1991, on the recommendation of the relevant industry committee of the NFF, in accordance with the Exotic Animal Disease Control Act 1989. The funds raised via this levy are matched on a dollar for dollar basis by the Commonwealth, and it is estimated that the additional funds raised by the setting of the correct levy rate will total some $27,000 in 1991-92. This is in accordance with many of the other levies that are matched dollar for dollar by the Government-whether it be in regard to research and development, which is equally vital for our rural industries, or in regard to exotic disease. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Murray raised some interesting issues in regard to quarantine standards in other countries. Australia has the highest quarantine standards in the world. It is important both to prevent disease coming in and to make sure that when we fight for freer trade we are able to show that our quality product is the best and the cleanest in the world. We faced some problems when dieldrin was found in our beef, and I have always believed that this was used for some time as an excuse to keep our beef out, even though there were errors in the first instance. We have to ensure that we have the highest standards so that other nations are not able to use excuses such as health or disease risks to keep our products out. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other difficulties we have had-and we are getting breakthroughs in this area-is with regard to protocols between countries. We have set up a protocol with New Zealand in horticultural products. It is often hard for us to get the recommended and desirable standards because New Zealand has a hang-up about fruit fly because it does not have the problem in that country. There are several other less harmful problems we have that have kept zucchinis in particular, which are produced in very large quantities in my area, out of the New Zealand market. Although they are heavily tested and sprayed, if even one egg is found the whole consignment is in trouble. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a lot more work to do to ensure that we get the best protocol possible. Time and time again quarantine measures have been used against our nation to refuse us access into other markets. That is why it is so important for us to show that we have the best standards in the world in order to protect our industries here and to gain access to other markets. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister's country task force, of which I am a member, met with some egg producers this week and we discussed many issues-in particular, intensive farming. Pressures are often put on primary producers by animal liberationists in relation to intensive farming. I have always been of the view that farmers are, in the main, most humane and concerned people in regard to livestock because that is how they make their living. I believe they are doing a great job in the research and development that is going on now into producing quality breeding stock that can live better in that sort of environment. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unfortunate that often these sorts of issues are blown up in the media for sensationalism, because were it not for intensive farming we would not be able to feed the world. I remember when I was attending primary school that teachers used to tell me that the world would be starving by the year 2000. Of course, that will not be the case: food production is outstripping consumption. It is ironic that as we approach the next century we still have mountains of food stockpiled all over the world as a consequence of new technology and better farming methods and practices. It is intended to maintain the best standards here so that we can access the markets that are flooded as a consequence of the technological breakthroughs that have existed, particularly in countries in Europe. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Horticultural Corporation Amendment Bill and the Dried Vine Fruits Legislation Amendment Bill will restructure the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation into the Australian Dried Fruits Board and place it under the wing of the Australian Horticultural Corporation (AHC). The Bills will deregulate the domestic market by removing the domestic component of the sultana equalisation scheme, but continue export underwriting for another three years to minimise the impact of the changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Industry Commission, formerly the Industries Assistance Commission, is required at least every five years to investigate and report on any primary industry receiving what is called government assistance. The definition of assistance basically is that there is some sort of delegated power or authority from the Government. Thus these Bills follow a report and investigation by the then Industries Assistance Commission in 1989 and recommendations for the future marketing of dried vine fruit. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation we have before us is in many ways similar to that for the wheat industry in that the domestic market is to be deregulated, but export controls will continue. The Government will continue its current-not currant-underwriting scheme for another three years. The two pieces of legislation, as I said, will change the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation into a board and place it under the broad oversight of the Australian Horticultural Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite frankly, the dried fruits industry does not want it; the industry has been forced or blackmailed by the Government, by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), to agree to those changes to preserve the export power. I acknowledge that that was a sensible decision for the industry, because the export power is particularly important in these uncertain exporting times. The dried fruits industry cannot see any benefits at all in being tied to the AHC. All it will have is an additional cost of $60,000 a year for the next three years while there is some government subsidy to the overall costs of the AHC, and then the price could double. </PARA>
<PARA> The export power is an important one for the industry, and I believe it has utilised that power with great skill. The industry has a long history of competing successfully in export markets. Australian fruit, competing against that from a number of other countries, including the United States, Turkey and Greece, attracts the highest price on world markets; it attracts a quality premium and there is obviously good marketing. But the Government has claimed that its decision to force the industry into the AHC is justified by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>When monopoly export control powers are exercised, government needs to be assured that sufficient checks and balances are in place to ensure that the national interest is taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA>In reality, the AHC is the creation of the Minister, but so far has been of very doubtful value; in government we will certainly review whether it has any worthwhile future. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to some of the details of the legislation. The sultana underwriting scheme was introduced in 1982, when the world was oversupplied with sultanas and prices were disastrously low. The scheme paid out $1.3m or $16 a tonne in its first year, but has not been triggered since-and I emphasise that. In 1986 the scheme was changed to reduce the level at which the Government could underwrite. The level was set at 80 per cent of the free on board export return for the past three years and a sunset clause inserted so that the scheme finished at the end of December 1990. This legislation will continue the underwriting for another three years to help the industry to adjust to the deregulation of the domestic market. </PARA>
<PARA> The sultana equalisation scheme was introduced many years ago to equalise the domestic and export markets so that farmers would be paid the same price for their product irrespective of where the product was sold. Legislation in 1986 set a cap on the equalisation payments that could be made over and above the average export return, and those payments are now limited to 15 per cent above export returns, or equivalent to import parity. Because the domestic price in most years was above the export price the Government and the Industry Commission believe this has been a consumer transfer. However, it should be pointed out that neither the Dried Fruits Corporation nor the Australian Dried Fruits Association actually has ever marketed fruit on the domestic market. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of this perceived transfer, the Government is removing the domestic component from equalisation but, as I indicated earlier, it will continue it on exports. This means that equalisation will be a reconciliation of export returns at the end of each season. There will be no levies and no government financial involvement. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry, as I said earlier also, is not happy with losing domestic equalisation. It points out that it is already competing on the domestic market against heavily subsidised product from Greece and very much cheaper and poorer quality fruit from Turkey, and is now subject to a decreasing tariff so that by July 1992 it will be 15 per cent on a normal basis and 10 per cent on a developing country basis. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer in more detail to this point of protection, because the dried vine fruits industry was one of five agricultural industries in 1988 to have a regime of tariff reductions so that by 1 July 1992 they would be all on the 15 per cent normal and 10 per cent developing country preference. The speed of that tariff reduction is far greater than that which has been applied or is likely to be applied to any of the high tariff protected manufacturing industries, if one looks in particular at textiles, clothing, footwear and the motor vehicle industry. In addition, if the Government accepts the latest recommendation from the Industry Commission about the motor vehicle industry, that industry will have an extremely generous export subsidy. No agricultural industry has any export subsidy whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also talk in the Government that, while this slower reduction of tariff is taking place with those highly protected manufacturing industries, there will be further reduction in the already low level of tariff for agricultural industries that are on this very low level of tariff at present. I believe that is wrong and unfair. What is known as the `tops down' approach is, I believe, far fairer-that is, all tariffs come down to 15 per cent and 10 per cent before there is any further reduction. I believe that is a far more equitable way of handling what we all believe is necessary-and that is reduced tariff protection-than what appears to be sold or talked about at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to challenge the calculations used by the Industry Commission in relation to what is the effective level of assistance. I know the effective rate or level of assistance is more than tariff; it can be a range of marketing procedures, export subsidies and so forth. I commend the National Farmers Federation for the independent work that has been done on the way in which the Industry Commission calculates protection or assistance. In a news release of the National Farmers Federation of 20 December last year, it said that the Industry Commission had miscalculated levels of assistance between agriculture and other industries throughout the economy. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA> ``In essence, the Commission has failed to recognise that agricultural industries are being penalised by inefficiencies in other sectors in the economy, particularly in the transport, irrigation, financial services and electricity industries . . . The rate of assistance, or the aggregate effect of Government intervention in industries such as sugar, rice, dairy and dried fruits, is much lower than is indicated by the Commission's current methodology. </PARA>
<PARA> ``Inefficiencies in key support service industries have resulted in major cost burdens on our efficient export industries, yet the Commission has ignored their impact. </PARA>
<PARA> ``NFF is calling on the Industry Commission to change the methodology it uses when calculating effective rates of industry assistance so that all industries are treated equally''. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission's assistance rate calculations include the cost of tariffs, subsidies and other Government intervention on goods which are internationally traded, but excludes Government interference in services and non-traded inputs to production. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission's reasons for including some interventions in the calculation and leaving others out are weak and very flimsy . . . An assistance calculation that ignores services and non-traded inputs is half baked and an unreliable policy guide. </PARA>
<PARA> ``If the Commission ignores the need to improve the accuracy and comprehensiveness of their calculations, it risks a serious loss of credibility.''</PARA>
<PARA>I understand that there has been some contact between the Industry Commission and the National Farmers Federation on this matter since then. </PARA>
<PARA> I now want to indicate the difference between the calculations of the Industry Commission of effective rates of assistance and those of PDP Australia Pty Ltd, which was the consulting body used by the National Farmers Federation, by reading the following table into the record:</PARA>

<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The figure for sugar would be considerably less since 1988. The figure for citrus is an interesting reverse. The figure for dried vine fruit is the key figure for this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the Industry Commission adopts a methodology that is fair and equal and on the same basis between primary industry and all the other sectors that it is comparing. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to talk about a problem confronting the dried vine fruits industry. It also relates to what I would call fair trade. If we look at the problems in that and many other industries which are either import competing or a combination of import competing and exporting, there is no fair trade at the present time. For fair trade to occur, first of all, those countries that are not genuinely developing countries should no longer continue to receive the 5 per cent tariff advantage. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that the criteria or definitions used certainly by the United States and New Zealand are considerably different from that used by Australia. These countries belong to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and conform to the GATT rules as much as Australia does. For example, the Asian Tigers-that is, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the Philippines, et cetera-all still have their developing country preference with Australia. I am told that all of them have now lost it with the United States because of the calculation it uses on ratios of gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also other requirements used by both the United States and New Zealand which limit developing country preference to particular commodities when they have reached a certain percentage of the market or some other basis. I am told that, for example, citrus concentrate from Brazil is no longer allowed into either of those countries on a developing country basis. I believe we have to review the reality of many countries and commodities still receiving that assistance in Australia and not recognised, in reality anyway, as such by other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point in relation to fair trade is food standards. The very high food standards applied in Australia-and correctly so-should be equally applied to all imported goods. There has been progress in this area. It has been slow and painful and it has been very much bipartisan at the Federal level over the years, but it is still not adequate because there is still only a very minor percentage of imported foods being tested. </PARA>
<PARA> I give an example of the dramatic contrast in our standards of food testing. I have been advised that some dried apricots were imported from Turkey, but because the quality was so poor they could not be sold. So, when we attempted to re-export them because they could not be sold here, they could not be re-exported as they could not receive the health certificate necessary to export them from Australia because they were not considered to be on the same basis as an Australian product. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point in fair trade is dumping. When the coalition Government lost office in 1983, we had, at least for certain types of horticultural commodities, an arrangement called `fast track', particularly with New Zealand. At the 60-day point, it allowed cash securities to be applied if a prima facie case had been established. Then those cash securities were either confirmed as dumping or countervailing duty or repaid at the final determination. </PARA>
<PARA> In this country at the present time there is a 55-day initial investigation and then two periods of 120 days each, which makes it 295 days generally before any dumping or countervailing duty is applied. I believe that is too slow and unfair on that industry. Where there is prima facie evidence, it should be possible to apply cash securities after the 55-day period. I am told that in the United States there is a 30-day period. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have the requirement for material injury, which in practice means that 20 to 25 per cent of the market has to be lost before a complaint can be lodged. That in itself means that quite a period of time will have been lost. I am aware of cases over the years in the United States involving some of the products from Goulburn Valley. Those involved do not bother about material injury. They belong to GATT. The moment dumping is proven or the prima facie case has been established, the duty or penalty is applied. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that a particularly difficult and unfair addition of this Government in relation to dumping is the sunset arrangement-that is, if dumping or countervailing duty is applied, after three years basically it has to be proven again. But because material injury or significant loss of market share has to be proven before one can actually apply for the dumping action to begin, basically the whole rigmarole and nightmare of losing market to what may be a dumped product has to be gone through again before action can be taken. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that both the dried vine fruit industry and the citrus industry are examples of industries in which potential complications could arise. Surely it should be possible to have some investigation ahead of that three-year sunset arrangement to establish whether or not the reasons why the duties were applied in the first case are still in place before the duty expires. </PARA>
<PARA> We are moving to lower protection levels in Australia. I believe that is necessary provided in particular, as I said, that everybody shares equitably in that. Therefore, I think it does increase the importance of ensuring that products are being imported fairly. That is the reason why I mention those four or five key points which I believe are essential for the establishment of a fair trade policy. The dried vine fruit industry, as I said earlier, reluctantly has agreed to this legislation, and the Opposition supports the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Dried Vine Fruits Legislation Amendment Bill, which is being debated cognately tonight with the Australian Horticultural Corporation Amendment Bill, is to continue the sultana underwriting scheme for three years and to remove the domestic component of the dried vine fruits equalisation arrangements. In September 1989, the Industries Assistance Commission reported on the dried vine fruit industry and recommended reforms to equalisation and underwriting arrangements. The Government has since then been liaising closely with the industry on these recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The extension of the sultana underwriting scheme for three years to 31 December 1993 is to assist the dried vine fruit industry during the period of change in the level of Government involvement in other areas of the industry. The Government considers this appropriate, given the concentrated regional nature of the dried vine fruit industry and the impact that change may otherwise have on such regions. </PARA>
<PARA> I concede that I do not have any dried vine fruit in my electorate. In my electorate of Hinkler I probably have the most equable climate in the world and, consequently, I do not have the climate that allows one to grow dried vine fruits. But I do acknowledge the interest of several honourable members here who do have dried vine fruits in their electorates. Dried vine fruits are a great product and just because they are not a massive industry does not mean that they are not important. They are equally as important as any other industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And I do enjoy consuming some of the products from the electorate of the honourable member for Mallee, who has just interjected, because those products are top quality. The Bill also provides for domestic returns to be removed from the statutory equalisation arrangements. Once removed, the provision for a levy on domestic sales will no longer be necessary and the Bill therefore provides for the levy arrangements to cease to apply to fruit produced after 1 January, 1991.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under the existing equalisation legislation, a levy is imposed on domestic sales of dried vine fruit and the proceeds are then equalised across all sales, both domestic and export. A domestic consumer transfers results in seasons when domestic returns are higher than export returns. Domestic returns have been higher than export returns in some 26 of the past 30 years. The proposed amendments thus leave in place provision for the equalisation only of dried vine fruit export returns, and provide for this to take place as a reconciliation after the end of each season. </PARA>
<PARA> The continuation of the sultana underwriting scheme continues the Commonwealth's liability to make payment in the event that the scheme is triggered. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics has estimated that export prices would have to slump in excess of 30 per cent over the three-year period of the scheme's extension for it to be triggered and for a pay-out to be made. With the removal of the domestic component of the equalisation arrangements, a levy on domestic sales will no longer be necessary. The Commonwealth's involvement in these levy arrangements, other than to complete arrangements for previous years, will therefore cease as a result of the proposed amendments. Continuation of the equalisation of export returns has no financial implications for the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The other Bill being debated is the Australian Horticultural Corporation Amendment Bill 1990. The purpose of this Bill is to provide a mechanism for the establishment of an Australian Dried Fruits Board within the Australian Horticultural Corporation, the AHC. In September 1989, the Industries Assistance Commission report on the dried vine fruits industry recommended that the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation be brought under the umbrella of the Australian Horticultural Corporation, and this Bill provides the mechanism necessary to achieve this. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for the establishment of product boards within the Australian Horticultural Corporation. Product boards are to be corporate entities and are to operate with substantial autonomy, but under the broad oversight of the AHC. The Australian dried fruits industry is currently assisted by the Commonwealth in the area of marketing only for exports. Participation in the Australian Horticultural Corporation is not intended to change this. </PARA>
<PARA> Provision has therefore been made for the functions of boards to be tailored to cover particular products in particular ways. The Minister will have the final say on which products will be covered by a product board since product boards will be established by regulations. They are to have functions and powers that largely mirror those of the Corporation: to promote those Australian horticultural products covered by a board, both in Australia and overseas; and to improve the industry's competitiveness by improving the quality, handling, storing, processing and marketing of board products. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to add that only recently the Queensland Banana Association has become involved with the greatest rugby league team in Australia-the Broncos. The Broncos are supporting the banana industry of Queensland. That shows the sort of innovation that is starting to come into our agricultural industries. That is what we need. Just imagine how much more we could sell if Elle MacPherson perhaps promoted some Australian horticultural products. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Dried Fruits Board is to be established through provision in the Bill, as this is the most efficient way of providing for the transition from the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation. We can expect that, at this stage, only the dried vine fruits industry will join the AHC under the product board arrangement, although the honey industry may well take advantage of this structure. Product boards are to be corporate entities and are to operate with substantial autonomy, but under the broad oversight of the AHC. They are to have powers and functions which largely mirror those of the AHC and are to be funded in the same way through industry levies. Such funds are to be paid direct to the relevant board from Consolidated Revenue net of an amount to be paid to the AHC to cover a share of the overheads of that body. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill then provides for the establishment of the Australian Dried Fruits Board and for the repeal of the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation Act of 1978. Essentially, the Dried Fruits Board will take on the activities of the ADFC, including the export control arrangements and the ADFC staff, assets and liabilities. The Bill provides for a product board to be funded by industry levies which are to be paid to a product board directly from Consolidated Revenue. Product boards are to be responsible for their own finances and are to have their financial dealings separately audited and reported. Payments to boards from Consolidated Revenue are to be net of payments made to the AHC for the product boards' contribution to the AHC's overheads. The formula or amount of this contribution is to be determined by regulations. I believe that the dried fruits industry is currently finalising this matter with the AHC. </PARA>
<PARA> When monopoly export control powers are exercised, the Government needs to be ensured that sufficient checks and balances are in place to ensure that national interest is taken into account. This will be provided for the Australian Dried Fruits Board through the oversight and monitoring by the AHC. As well as this, the Government has before it two independent reports both recommending that the dried vine fruits industry be brought within the AHC, namely, the Industries Assistance Commission report into the dried vine fruits industry; and the review by Professor Jeremy Davis of primary industry statutory marketing authorities. The Government has agreed with this approach and the provisions of the Bill reflect this. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth currently collects and then disburses industry export charges imposed on dried vine fruits to fund the operations of the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation. The Commonwealth recovers the costs of these charge collections from the dried vine fruits industry. This involvement by the Commonwealth is set to continue with the establishment of the Australian Dried Fruits Board since that body will be funded in the same way, through industry export charges and levies. Costs associated with the establishment of other boards will be met in the same way from levies on products covered by these boards as other industries come into the system. There are, therefore, no implications in this Bill for additional costs to the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to comment briefly on the horticultural industry in total, because I am very fortunate to have the largest and I believe most important horticultural industry in my electorate, in Bundaberg, which now produces more tomatoes than any other area in Australia and some $135m worth of horticulture in any year. It has played a massive part in employment and in the operations of the many service industries and small manufacturing and engineering works that have been associated with horticulture. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some interesting contrasts in views in regard to aerial spraying, and the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) mentioned the concerns that had been raised and supported them. In the Bundaberg region we lose $2m worth of horticultural crops a year because of the indiscriminate and inaccurate use of chemical sprays, particularly 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T, which are used in other enterprises. I have consistently called on the Queensland Minister to tighten up the relevant Act because individual farmers cannot afford to lose $2m worth of crops a year through the indiscriminate use of chemical sprays. </PARA>
<PARA> Until the election of the Goss Government there was no Act in Queensland covering the health and safety of workers in the horticultural industry, and indeed the farming industries. That matter is now being addressed by the Queensland Minister for Employment, Training and Industrial Relations, Mr Neville Warburton. Unfortunately there has been massive indiscriminate use of chemicals throughout the horticultural industry over years. We all know what happened when dieldrin was used with gay abandon in Queensland, and the resultant effects on our beef industry and on our exports markets will be felt for many years. </PARA>
<PARA> Horticulture has a massive export potential. Earlier in the debate on a previous Bill, I said that protocol was one of the problems that has to be addressed. Many of the protocols that have been in effect for several years with different countries-New Zealand in particular-will run out. New Zealand does not have fruit-fly and its horticultural industries are sensitive not only to fruit-fly but also to other problems we have that are similar to or associated with fruit-fly. </PARA>
<PARA> If we can demonstrate through research and development that products such as zucchinis, which are grown in my area, are clean and cannot cause any contamination we have a massive market potential. Last month during a brief visit to Japan I went to a supermarket in Yokohama to find that rockmelons cost $25 each. We sell our rockmelons locally and in the markets in Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne for $1 plus each. While transport charges are very high, with protocol and a little technology I believe we have a massive market potential in Japan, particularly as that country starts to lower its tariff barriers, which it is doing. </PARA>
<PARA> When the beef liberalisation comes through in April, I believe Japan will discover that the consumer is the beneficiary. Once that consumer pressure builds up, it will diminish the pressure from the Japanese farm lobby as a consequence and we will get better access for our products into the Japanese market-a market that, along with Taiwan and Korea, poses the greatest potential at the present time for Australia, given the behaviour of the European Community. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) spoke about dumping. Australia has very good anti-dumping measures in place, but it is like any other problem. We need to be able to prove dumping, as we need to prove that someone has broken the law before that person can be charged. It is not easy. The honourable member for Murray mentioned New Zealand as a case in point. Since that example he gave, which was several years ago, we have moved into closer economic relations (CER) with New Zealand. I am positive that CER will be a benefit to both countries because both agricultural nations have access to markets on which each can piggyback. </PARA>
<PARA> Collectively, Australia and New Zealand have a population of 20 million and, collectively, an expertise in marketing our export products. We can utilise the markets New Zealand has that we may not have access to in Australia and vice versa. We should be neither intimidated by nor fear our brothers and sisters in New Zealand, which has only 3 million people and a very small area of land. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other concern I have which I should like to mention, given that it was mentioned several times today during Question Time and would have a massive effect on the horticultural industry. I refer to the imposition of a goods and services tax. It would impose a 15 per cent tax on food in this country and reduce the ability of people, especially pensioners and working people, to buy food and it would impact on farmers. A goods and services tax would have a devastating effect on the horticultural industry and particularly on the agricultural industry right across the country. The Opposition would do well to abolish any plans to implement such a tax if it really cares about horticulture. </PARA>
<PARA> Protection is another issue that we grapple with. I am criticised in my electorate for consistently supporting freer and fairer trade. I was pleased to note that recently the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) said that he would not ban imported food products because he recognised that 80 to 85 per cent of our agricultural products need overseas markets. I am pleased that the Leader of the National Party understands that if Australia erects barriers against imported products it cuts off its nose to spite its face. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately in my electorate in Queensland two of the three stooges in the National Party, Senator Boswell and Senator O'Chee, have continually run around frightening farmers in support of protection. It is beneficial neither to their Party nor to the industry. I wish they would desist from spreading that proposition. All it has done is frighten the farmers and put a proposition that may well in the short term be beneficial to their own political stand but will be of no benefit at all in the long term to either agriculture or to them. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to imported food products, I should like to see every product that is sold in supermarkets being Australian, but Australia has to trade bilaterally. We have introduced an initiative that has not yet been acclaimed or cheered by people such as Senator Boswell, who has been critical of us. I refer to the compulsory labelling with country of origin of all fruit juices and blended fruit juices. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has taken an initiative through Senator Tate, who deserves to be complimented on the way in which he has attacked this issue, in asking all State health Ministers to support our lead in the compulsory labelling with country of origin of all food products in Australia. Once that is enacted it will give Australian consumers a choice. We are all proud of being Aussies. The Brisbane Broncos have lined up with the banana industry. This will give other horticultural industries an opportunity to promote their products and will halve the number of imported food products sold on our shelves simply through promotion and the loyalty of the Australian consumer. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, Senator Boswell, who is one of the critics of our free trade proposition, cannot even come to terms with his own Party's decision on wool. He continually supports protection for his own short term political ends at the expense of our large export industries such as beef, wheat, wool and sugar and is even at odds with his own Leader. </PARA>
<PARA> These Bills deserve the support of the House. They are not dramatic Bills that will attract the attention of the Press Gallery, but they are part of the agricultural industries that ensure the employment of thousands of Australians and thousands of Australian farmers. I believe these Bills provide us with a great opportunity to expand our horticultural industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can understand Australian farmers being concerned if they heard the comments of the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice). The fact is that this Government has only a single-item policy on horticultural industries, and that is to reduce tariffs. March 12 will produce more of that process and will bite more on the farmers and manufacturers of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unlike the Government, the Opposition has a multi-strand approach to these problems. We are determined to reduce tariffs but we are not prepared to send more and more businesses broke, as the Government is doing, by relying on high interest rates and reduced tariffs. A more rational and thoughtful approach must be brought to bear on these industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Our approach is to reduce tariffs and at the same time to instigate reforms in industrial relations, to establish more competitive and efficient government enterprises, to ensure that our transportation systems are working, to make sure that, unlike the Government, there is actual reform on the waterfront so that our export industries gain the maximum markets. We have a multiplicity of strategies to deal with Australia's current economic problems. Unlike the Government, we have ideas. Unlike the Government, we do not rely upon one policy, which is to reduce tariffs. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last few days the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has made a continuing commitment to further reduce tariffs without giving any consideration to all the other cost factors that impinge upon the cost of production and the effectiveness of our horticultural and manufacturing industries. Sure, we have to be in the world reducing tariffs. Sure, we have to be internationally competitive. But we cannot meet that target by reducing tariffs. That is the bluntest instrument a government can use against employment and against those who provide employment. We cannot get results in Australia in that way. That is a punitive approach which is just a prescription to send more and more people bankrupt and create more and more unemployment. The Government needs a range of strategies. </PARA>
<PARA> A lot of hype has been generated by the Prime Minister, Senator Button-the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce-the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and a whole bunch of people. Even the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean) wants to jump on the bandwagon. A whole raft of them now want to get involved in this. I wonder whether the Minister at the table, the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), is involved in the drafting of the 12 March statement. </PARA>
<PARA> In this speech I am not going to blame the Australian Labor Party for creating the wrinkles on sultanas, but I do blame the Labor Party for the way it has dealt with all of these complex problems with such simplicity and such obvious failure. One only has to read the bankruptcy lists to recognise the failure of the large companies and look at the increasing unemployment list, the queues on the dole and the job vacancies that are not there to understand that cutting tariffs and high interest rates is not a policy that will get results for a government of Australia. The Government has to be more sophisticated, more thoughtful and more intelligent. The Minister is intelligent; he needs to increase his intelligence by listening to some of the wisdom that comes from this side of the chamber in order to deal with the problems that confront Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no good saying, `The ACTU is really difficult and they're our mates and we can't fix up the transport industries because we've got TNT and we've got this one and we've got that one'. It is really too hard for the Government. It has to be firm. It has to be able to take a stand on these issues. That is what we are prepared to do. There has to be a range of strategies to solve the problems that confront Australia today. Nowhere more can it be seen than in Australia's dried fruit industries. Those are industries in which we are extremely competitive. We are competitive by world standards. But it also happens to be an area of production that most of southern Europe is involved in. It is an area that can be dramatically affected by the low cost of labour. It is an area within the European Community where there are untold problems of trying to cope with the surplus of dried fruits. Despite its efficiencies, Australia has an international problem in trading where there are subsidies and mechanisms of support and protection that are so much more sophisticated and devious than ours, which tend to be up-front and transparent, and we tend to use the tariff mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA> The growers of Australia understand that it is our intention to reduce tariffs, but I want to reiterate, in perhaps a more serious vein, that it is our intention to deal with a range of policies that will dramatically reduce costs of production. Dealing effectively with matters such as transportation-road, rail and sea-the reform of industrial relations, privatising and making more competitive Australia's great organisations and corporations that are currently controlled by the Government, will add to our gross domestic product 3.7 per cent. That is the gain that Australia will see from taking those matters under control. If the Government pursues its current course of just reducing tariffs, there is a gain to national product: 1.5 per cent. It is less than half of what can be gained by taking a harder course but a more productive course in the management of Australia's economy. </PARA>
<PARA> I challenge the Government with these issues. It should just not chuck stuff off as it has with the dried fruit industry and the Industry Commission and hope to get a report that is rationally dry which it will endorse, while the Prime Minister is baring his chest saying, `We are going to cut tariffs'-wonderful stuff-and then walk away from the hard issues of being more productive in terms of economic outturn and benefit to the average Australian. I challenge the Government in that area to not concentrate on a single strand policy as far as Australia's horticultural industries, our smaller industries and our manufacturing industries are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) raised an issue that we also need to deal with. As we reduce the protection in Australia we shall be more and more challenged by the cheats of international trade. As they have in the past, they will test our market and endeavour to undercut an Australian industry in order to weaken it to an extent that production falls and the number of people involved is reduced and ultimately it is exposed to imports. A fair way of tackling that problem is to insist that the standards that apply to production in Australia, standards which are brought onto the table of this House in the form of regulation or into State parliaments in the form of ordinances or regulations, must be observed by importers if they apply to Australian manufacturers or Australian producers. That is not the case at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Where a discrepancy is noticed in quality or standard by an Australian producer, then a notification process is required and through our Customs system we can require imports to comply with those standards. But it is only on notice and by the quasi-legalistic approach that we can achieve a fairness of quality demanded by governments of Australian manufacturers that is equivalent and is matched by goods being brought into the country. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this is a wrong approach. I endorse the view that where there is a legislative requirement for standards to be met in matters of manufacture and matters of processing or further development of foodstuffs, it should be mandatory that those standards apply to goods coming into Australia. It is easy to understand when considering the simple example of the dried apricots that we have just been presented with by the honourable member for Murray. Dried apricots were allowed to come into Australia which were of such poor quality that they could not be sold here and yet again of such poor quality that they could not be exported because they did not meet Australian standards. </PARA>
<PARA> How stupid of us to force Australian growers to meet standards that are required for the safety, the health and the expectation of the Australian consumer to be undermined by anybody who wants to ship a load of apricots or anything else in here. That is incredibly poor. It is really bad management and really undermines the competitive edge that Australian industries may have. That ought to be a change that this Government is prepared to instigate to prevent the international cheats in trade who would destroy the benefits of cutting tariffs and who will create great resentment and concern within those communities that will bear the tariff cuts. The Ministers of this Government will have knocking on their doors groups of people who will say that they have been dumped on and cheated against by overseas producers because on a quality basis they do not have to observe Australian standards. </PARA>
<PARA> I bring that important issue to the attention of the Government. It is further clarified when one looks at the requirements of the National Health and Medical Research Council, which looks at the standards required for human medicines and for cosmetics. Something that comes into contact with a human being must have very strict controls, and we apply those controls. Some would say that we apply those controls to an extraordinary degree, that the process of testing and the time it takes to examine products is overdoing it because what we do is to reinvent the wheel and conduct the same tests as the Americans, the British and the whole of Europe and we duplicate that process. That is wise and should be a requirement. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, however, we have an attitude about manufactured goods and some processed foodstuffs that there is not a requirement to meet Australian standards. That is wrong and there should be blanket legislation to stop that going on. That would stop the cheats. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area in which the Government is moving painfully slowly-and I know it is a hard area; I have examined this matter myself-is that of labelling and product identification. Why does the Government not pick up Nick Greiner's suggestion-I think it is excellent; it is a way to make a start-and say that what applies in Western Australia will apply nationally and what applies in New South Wales will apply nationally? Everybody will accept everyone else's codes and we will have blanket legislation that is composed of all the current standards required around Australia. We could make that the starting point. </PARA>
<PARA> As time passes and the impracticality of some of the standards becomes obvious, we can gradually carve away at the edges. That is the only way in which we will have the States of Australia agreeing to a common marketing code, a common labelling code and a common description code that can be legislated across the country. We will do that if we follow the Greiner formula. I believe that he presented an argument and a way through this traditional problem of the competing interests of the States of Australia. So that would be a start. </PARA>
<PARA> Until Australians can be assured-not just on orange juice; on everything they jolly well buy-that something is made in, is a product of and is packaged in a certain place, until they can read that information, then they are not being provided with proper information to make judicial judgment on what they should be purchasing. Then there is the contents factor which is another argument that I will not go into here. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area that I will touch on briefly is that of dumping and the need for Australia to have effective anti-dumping procedures. I believe that these procedures are too protracted, too lengthy and too expensive. It takes 210 days to get a dumping case up and running. How much do we pay to the lawyers? How can a small manufacturing industry possibly cope with that? Anti-dumping procedures must not be made a protective mechanism. I think we can do it quickly and effectively and I think we can remove some of the factors that are currently there without creating a false barrier. That is what I would like to see instigated, also for the purpose of preventing the international cheats. </PARA>
<PARA> The proof of injury to an Australian industry is almost impossible. The honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher) may remember that some years ago the cheese industry in Australia was under attack. Certain types of cheeses were not manufactured in Australia and Europe poured tonnes of cheese into this country. The cheddar industry and other healthy industries were wiped out when huge quantities of cheeses of different types were dumped on to the Australian market. The equivalent quality or the equivalent product argument in our legislation knocked out the dumping case against those cheeses. </PARA>
<PARA> Unless we are a bit smarter and a bit more inventive, then those who want to abuse Australia-those who want to kill an Australian industry and then take advantage of that death to promote their own product-will continue to do so. That has gone on a lot during the term of office of this Government to too great a degree. I thought that Ministers would have been more perceptive than they have been in detecting where Australian manufacturers and producers have been knocked off because of a lost leader in the market for a while. </PARA>
<PARA> There is the cumulative effect of one country putting a bid in, then bids from other countries flowing through until we have a huge amount of one product on the Australian market. It is worthwhile looking at the battery industry in that regard. Very quickly the orders roll from one country to the next, from one subsidiary or family company to the next and before we know where we are, across a range of countries-not from one source-we have the Australian battery manufacturers under attack. These are the areas to which the Government has to pay greater attention. </PARA>
<PARA> I started off my speech talking about the sultana industry. I have not blamed the Government for putting wrinkles on sultanas, but I do blame it for being far too simplistic, not thoughtful enough and not dedicated to fixing the hard things in Australia, the critical things that will produce the gross increase and provide a greater gross national product in which every Australian will share. High interest rates and cutting tariffs is not the answer to Australia's problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Horticultural Corporation Amendment Bill and the Dried Vine Fruits Legislation Amendment Bill that are before the House tonight form a part of the changes that have been seen as necessary if the horticultural industries in Australia are to expand in importance and provide a role for the national economy in the future. As these industries are finding new domestic markets and continuously entering overseas markets, they are certainly entering a new era for agricultural production in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the potential of these industries is realised, they will emerge as very significant earners of export dollars, as has been alluded to by honourable members opposite. The horticultural industries will produce significant and sustainable levels of production which will make Australia the major supplier to countries such as those on the Pacific rim. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Horticultural Corporation, set up some three or four years ago, has already witnessed and addressed a number of industry issues in its role as an industry driven organisation. Growers, processors and exporters have found the past year a difficult one, to say the least. With sophisticated overseas competition, dynamic market demands and shifting economic tastes, Australian participants have had to take a hard look at ways to improve their performance in the horticultural marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) mentioned earlier, the coalition policies on the horticultural industry involve a number of things. One point on which they do agree with us is the reduction of tariffs. That would go ahead, even under a coalition government. The honourable member for Mitchell mentioned the basis for industrial relations and transport reforms. Perhaps if he had been listening to some of the answers that were given at Question Time, he might have been satisfied with the progress the Government is making in that area. If not, perhaps we could ask another question at the next sitting. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the Corporation's primary tasks is to assist in maximising the net return from horticulture in Australia. It has vigorously pursued the issues of shipping freights, access to export markets and domestic consumption. By working alongside industry, it has emerged with a full understanding of the horticultural environment and its demands. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Horticultural Corporation already has a number of achievements and they include an increased commitment to domestic promotion in advertising, market research into new and potentially lucrative markets and the establishment of the various bodies to better coordinate and address issues before the industry. Jointly with other boards it has been involved in negotiations which led to considerable savings on shipping rates in the 1990 season. It has also undertaken an extensive review and simplification of export licensing arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the previous speakers mentioned some of the problems that are facing the industry. I think the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) expressed some reservations about the Australian Horticultural Corporation and its future. Perhaps he could look just at that last aspect-the simplification of the export licensing arrangements and where that could lead us-and take it on board. </PARA>
<PARA> This aspect of the Corporation having the power to license exporters through whom all exports go is to be commended. Too often we see a number of small producers attempting to export into the same market. As a result buyers play them off, one against another, to the detriment of the final income earned. Probably one of the successes of the Australian Wheat Board has been to remove that sort of anomaly. </PARA>
<PARA> Product boards that are being set up under the Australian Horticultural Corporation have the function and powers that largely mirror those of the Corporation itself and the boards thus far set up will go a long way to ensuring that those industries reach some stability and maximise returns to growers. </PARA>
<PARA> Like the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice), I do not have any dried fruit vines in my electorate. Sometimes I wish that I did, but nevertheless, the interest that I have in this legislation is the success of the Australian Horticultural Corporation, because some of the subtropical industries in my electorate- banana, macadamia and others-need a degree of assistance with marketing, both domestic and export. </PARA>
<PARA> I will certainly be doing my best to encourage those horticultural industries that I have just mentioned, including the avocado industry, to come under the umbrella of the Australian Horticultural Corporation by forming their own marketing board. The gains that they can make in terms of extending domestic markets, researching and establishing standards which encourage domestic production, and researching and funding overseas marketing arrangements, will certainly ensure that surplus production can find a niche market and not be dumped onto the market, thereby depressing prices. </PARA>
<PARA> I feel there is an endless potential in the Northern Hemisphere for producers of subtropical fruits, such as we have here in Australia and especially in the area of the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) and my own seat of Richmond, where there is a tremendous climate in which to produce a large range of subtropical fruits. We certainly could exploit the market during the off-season in the Northern Hemisphere. Consequently, there is no need to have the large surplus production depressing the prices, as I have just mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to see, through the Australian Horticultural Corporation, these product boards researching a little more to find particular niche markets in that area. To simply produce a surplus here and then to put it onto a market when it is here leads to unreliability of supply and certainly a bad reputation. It is something we have done in the past, and something we have to address in the future if we are going to lift our game, so to speak. </PARA>
<PARA> What we do need to do, and I am sure this will occur under the Australian Horticultural Corporation and the boards that are being set up, is find niche markets, especially within the Pacific Rim, and take advantage of the fact that there are few other Southern Hemisphere companies that produce the subtropical fruits and vegetables that we produce here. Our only other competitors of any real significance would be countries such as Chile, South Africa, New Zealand and perhaps Argentina, which have the same potential as we have. But we must address the fact that we are on the doorstep of the Pacific and the Asian markets and we must take advantage of them. </PARA>
<PARA> We must establish these marketing boards, and the Australian Horticultural Corporation recognises this. As I said, I will certainly be doing as much as I can to encourage industries in my region, and in any other region for that matter, to come under the umbrella of the Australian Horticultural Corporation, and to seek to establish not just one-off markets but products which are produced for particular markets, so that instead of just getting in there when we have a surplus, we can get in there and stay there, and become a recognised and reliable producer. </PARA>
<PARA> Much has already been said of the problems of overseas competition being allowed into Australia, but what we must do here-and it is happening under the Australian Horticultural Corporation-is increase quality standards, as mentioned by previous speakers from the other side of the House, as well as food safety. These are aspects which Australia can address. Certainly one aspect which we can address is quality. It has long been recognised throughout Asia and the Pacific Rim countries that Australia can provide quality and safe produce, which is what they demand-produce which is free from any pollutants or any chemicals which would see it being downgraded. </PARA>
<PARA> It is certainly clear that consumers around the world are becoming increasingly concerned about what is in their food. From research in the major Asian markets we know that Australia has an image of supplying fresh quality produce grown in an unpolluted environment. Monitoring of fresh produce in the home market has also shown that it is rated alongside the best in the world. The challenge is certainly there for the Horticultural Corporation, for producers and producers' boards to build on the wholesome and nutritious image of Australian fruit and vegetables. </PARA>
<PARA> A further aspect would be to show the consumer, through educational programs, that fruit and vegetables are even better value for money in times of financial restraint. As production expands-as our agricultural industries are quite capable of doing-we will become better and smarter marketers. That is one aspect of the Australian Horticultural Corporation's charter. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian grown produce is more likely to gain increased access to Pacific Rim countries as a result of the stronger image of quality and reliability, and it is hoped that the efforts of both industry and government alike will assist in the entry to markets currently closed to Australian product. If we take up this challenge, niche markets will also develop and have a significant impact on the total market mix. </PARA>
<PARA> A further aspect which is not directly related to this Bill but which has been mentioned by two previous speakers-and it is certainly related to the performance of Australian horticultural products on the domestic market-is the country of origin labelling which has been initiated by the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate). I commend his efforts in coordinating the difficult task that it is with the States and Territories to draft the legislation which will permit that function. Certainly the labelling of products with their country of origin will have a decided advantage for Australian producers. One thing that has been expressed to me is the frustration that people feel in not being able to determine accurately whether products are Australian made or have undergone some small degree of processing in Australia. Certainly the food regulation process is part way down the track. It is frustratingly slow, but it has to be done, and has to be done well. We will all be very pleased when that finally comes to fruition. I certainly call upon the State health Ministers who are involved in this part of the process to try to speed up the process over the packaging of food so the labelling of the country of origin can become a reality. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The difficulty is, as the Minister has interjected, that New South Wales has tended to drag its feet there. I would ask the New South Wales Government to speed up the process of negotiation as there are a number of industries within the State that are suffering because that State is dragging its feet on this particular aspect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other aspect of this is that unpackaged food-not just packaged food but unpackaged food also-has been imported, and certainly we need some legislation in place quickly so that food which is imported will carry a label of some sort so that buyers, when they go to purchase, can be assured that what they are buying is Australian grown and that they are in fact supporting Australian farmers and not, as has been mentioned before, the cheats in the international trade of produce. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to finish on that note. I support the legislation. Certainly the issue of the dried vine fruits board is one which, as part of the Australian Horticultural Corporation, will go towards supporting that industry. Honourable members have mentioned how significant the dried fruits industry is. It is a large horticultural industry in Australia; it exports a large proportion of its production-some two-thirds of its production-and consequently it does play an important role in our balance of trade. With the advice and the guidance of the Australian Horticultural Corporation, other fruits and other vegetables can also play a similar role. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the previous speakers mentioned the cost of production but did not quite mention the nature of the industries. Most of these industries are based on family farms involving family labour, and with the impetus of the Australian Horticultural Corporation, it is one way of ensuring that the family farm remains to the forefront of sustainable agricultural production. That is just one more reason why I support this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For 100 years the dried fruit industry has been a very successful part of the region I represent in the Sunraysia. It is the area where virtually all Australian dried fruit is now grown-90 per cent in the electorate of Mallee and approximately 10 per cent across the border in New South Wales in the electorate of my Leader, the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer). It makes an enormous contribution to the local economy, and it is extremely important for the whole aspect of regional development. Dried fruit is the single largest horticultural crop in Australia, producing $160m worth of produce annually on average, with about a $500m flow-on effect throughout the local community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In many ways the Australian dried fruit industry is a miracle industry in terms of the Australian economy. Dried fruit is a high cost horticultural crop. It is highly intensive. Generally, it is competing against low cost, low labour countries. Yet, it has managed to survive and remain extremely viable over this long period. In fact, just at this moment I guess there are thousands of people out in the fields picking under the lights or in heat that is probably very close to 40 degrees celsius-not like it is for those of us here, in an air-conditioned chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it should be asked why this industry, with all its impediments, has been so successful. Basically, there are three major reasons which make the industry an example to every other horticultural crop growing industry, in fact every other industry, in this country. First, the industry has an obsession with high quality product. Second, for years the industry has had a very disciplined marketing scheme. Third, I think it has also had a very effective level of industry leadership. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sad to say that this legislation, despite a lot of the patronising rhetoric we have heard tonight, challenges both the history of enterprise and the stability that has existed in this industry for so long because of the very radical changes that it proposes. As has been pointed out, the proposed changes are a result of an Industry Commission report. I have no difficulties with the IC's reporting and recommendations on industry assistance. However, I have a problem with two aspects. First of all, the Government seems always to act upon recommendations to reduce the level of protection and tariff assistance to agricultural industries, but it is very reluctant, in fact it seldom takes action, on IC reports when those reports relate to manufacturing industry in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The IC does have a role, but as my colleague and Deputy Leader, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), said, it is time the IC changed its methodology and gave away some of the subjective guessing that it undertakes. In fact, there is a joke going around my electorate that the best way to get a downturn in the dried fruit or citrus industries if they are performing well is to have an IC report and the best way to get an upturn, if the industries are performing poorly, is to have an IC report. </PARA>

Four or five years later, the cycle turns, and the IC recommends that people in the citrus industry restructure into the dried fruit industry. In fact, it is such a joke that four or five years ago in the main street of Mildura the second last IC report on the dried fruit industry was formally buried.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will now refer very briefly to a couple of comments made by the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice), particularly as they relate to Senator Boswell. We know that our senator wears his heart on his sleeve, but one thing he does do is work his guts out to protect the well-being of the people he represents. </PARA>
<PARA> If it were not for Senator Boswell and if it were not for the fact that so many people came up to this Parliament last year from the horticultural regions of Australia to protest on the streets of Canberra, we would not have had changes to the labelling laws. Make no mistake about it, that was the initiative that started that process off. If it were not for Senator Boswell we would not have the anti-dumping inquiry presently being undertaken by a Senate committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A major breakthrough. Let us be honest about these things. Let us not condemn people for their activities on behalf of the people they represent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These Bills will restructure and significantly change the administration, operation and marketing functions of the Australian dried fruit industry. They propose to make three basic changes. Firstly, the Australian Dried Fruits Corporation will be renamed the Australian Dried Fruits Board. It will become part of the Australian Horticultural Corporation (AHC). Secondly, the domestic component of the sultana equalisation scheme is to be removed, effectively deregulating the domestic market. Thirdly, underwriting will continue for three years to minimise the impact that even the Government acknowledges these changes will make as the industry adjusts to the deregulation of the domestic market. </PARA>
<PARA> I support this legislation, against my better judgment and my experience of the impact of similar legislation, particularly in the wheat industry. The dried fruit industry has worked very hard and has cooperated with the Government. However, in order to maintain its most significant marketing power-its export power-the industry has been forced to accept two measures that are not in its best interests. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to go through very briefly the sultana underwriting scheme and the sultana equalisation scheme. The sultana underwriting scheme was introduced in 1982 when the world was oversupplied with sultanas and prices were disastrously low. In that year the scheme paid out $1.3m, or $16 a tonne, to dried fruit growers. That scheme has not been triggered since. In 1986 the scheme was again changed to reduce the level at which the Government would underwrite. The level was set at 80 per cent of the free on board export return for the past three years, and a sunset clause was inserted so that the scheme finished at the end of December 1990. As I said, this legislation will continue the underwriting for another three years to help the industry adjust to the new arrangements. The House should be aware that this scheme, while providing a notional level of security, in practice at 80 per cent, will provide no benefits at all to the industry as it did in 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, legislation was introduced many years ago to equalise the domestic and export markets in the dried fruit industry. It was done with the single purpose of ensuring that farmers would be paid the same price for the same product; in other words, a policy of equity and stability. Legislation introduced by this Government in 1986 set a cap on those equalisation payments that could be made over and above the average export return. Payments are now limited to 15 per cent above those export returns. </PARA>
<PARA> Because the domestic price of this product in most years was above the export price, the Government and the Industries Assistance Commission believe that this was a consumer transfer, even though the Australian dried fruit industry is not itself involved in the sale of its product on the domestic market. However, it should be pointed out that because of this perceived transfer the Government is removing the domestic component from equalisation, but will continue it on exports. This means that equalisation will be a reconciliation of export returns at the end of each season. There will be no levies and no Government financial involvement. </PARA>
<PARA> To this industry's credit, to counter this move and because of this industry's forward thinking, it is in fact putting in place a voluntary equalisation scheme. Although it is a voluntary scheme it will be legally binding and will use a system of contractual arrangements between the industry, the growers, their packers and processors. The industry should be commended for this. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry has the right to object to losing this equalisation of the domestic market. It already competes on its own market with heavily subsidised fruit from Greece and cheap and poor quality fruit from Turkey, which has been discussed already tonight. The dried fruit industry does this only with the aid of a low and decreasing tariff of developing country status. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the worst feature of this legislation-the industry becoming part of the Australian Horticultural Corporation. As has been pointed out, the Bill provides for the establishment of an Australian Dried Fruits Board to be structured within the Australian Horticultural Corporation. It will be done by changes to the structure of the AHC to provide for product boards. This is necessary because the Government will concede that the dried fruit industry needs more autonomy than that which the other industries connected with the AHC presently enjoy. This is in recognition of the excellent export marketing operations of the current Australian Dried Fruits Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that to date, the AHC has done nothing of note in the way of marketing for the industries which are currently participating under its control-the apple, pear, citrus and nursery industries. I know and I respect the people within the AHC. I believe that the new chairman will bring a new professionalism to this AHC that was lacking in the previous structure. However, why place a specialised industry such as the Australian dried fruit industry, an industry that has been successful and which has probably one of the most outstanding marketing records of any horticultural industry in Australia, within a bureaucratic structure and charge the industry $60,000 a year, with very dubious results- and recognising that, of course, as the years go by the cost will be doubled? I find this a most extraordinary thing to do in regard to an industry such as this. </PARA>
<PARA> The second part of the Bill sets out how the product laws will operate. The Dried Fruits Board will be the only product board but the framework means that other industries can, in the future, be accommodated. The product board will be a body corporate that will assist in longstanding arrangements the dried fruit industry already has with a number of overseas agencies and groups. The Government says that the Board will not interfere with the active private industry marketing program which the dried fruit industry runs in Australia because it will operate only on export markets. </PARA>
<PARA> The product board will have an independent chairperson, selected by the AHC in consultation with the relevant producer organisation, and five other members selected by the relevant industry body. Three of the five must have expertise in the industry, while the other two can be drawn from general areas. While the industry does not like being forced into the AHC, it recognises that in order to hold its export control it must agree to this legislation, and it is reasonably happy with the final structure of the board and the degree of autonomy it has been given. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude with some general comments. Today in this House we listened to the Treasurer (Mr Keating) telling us how successful the long term nature of his high interest rate policies will prove to be in encouraging value added industries. This industry we are speaking about tonight already fulfils that role and function, as does the citrus industry. The Treasurer has lambasted us and has obviously convinced the media that the National Party policies of the 1950s and 1960s were bad for primary industry. I am tired of this misrepresentation. In my electorate of Mallee the 1950s and 1960s were a time of great consolidation, with the development of strong communities and towns and of profitability. </PARA>
<PARA> We had value added industries in those times. In fact, in Victoria we had 49 flour mills throughout the State and small and flourishing abattoirs in almost every town. Where have they gone? They have been gradually destroyed by the activities of unions and the Australian Council of Trade Unions, outmoded work practices, high domestic costs and high government charges. </PARA>
<PARA> This week some honourable members may have watched the Four Corners program focusing on the rural recession. This program was filmed in my electorate of Mallee. It showed not the brilliance of this Treasurer's stewardship but a string of bankruptcies and human disasters that will never be repaired. We are now told by economists working in a regulated wage system-I emphasise that-that the answer is off-farm work for the women. The economists say, `What a wonderful social reform, making them full time partners in the family economy'. This is a symptom of economic desperation and, for most, a time of great unhappiness. Pure economic theory counts not the value of the woman's contribution to the farm, to family life or to the farm's economy. Government policies are replacing the fundamental value of household life and the community. They have replaced farm people with chemicals and machines and imposed awful pressures on the land itself. </PARA>
<PARA> The ability to safeguard Australian industries from injury through the legitimate use of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has been undermined by changes this Government has made to anti-dumping legislation. Unfair trading practices acknowledged by other nations are now acceptable in Australia. I really do not understand why this Government penalises Australia's primary industries to this level. We have become the laughing stock of the world; we have become the dumping ground for other nations' highly subsidised and, in many cases, low cost products. There can be no doubt that some day Australia will be posthumously awarded a medal for the self-sacrifice of its industries in the interests of minor pain relief for the great trading nations of the world. The surviving country people will be seen trapping a few rabbits, and I am sure they will feel patriotic and proud. </PARA>
<PARA> I pray that this legislation does not do to this industry what the wheat legislation has done to the wheat industry. In one year the Government's wheat legislation has reduced the domestic cost price of wheat to growers on its own market by 39 per cent. I am fearful that the same pressures of world export trade on our dried fruits industry will do the same thing. It is alleged that last week nine semitrailer loads of Brazilian orange juice flowed into the converters and processors of citrus juice in this country. It is an absolute disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe governments have to be much stronger in relation to quality, labelling and anti-dumping. More importantly, they also have to remove some of the taxation burdens from these industries. I give but one example and it relates to the grape industry. A bottle of brandy in a shop would today cost about $16.60. Of that $16.60, the growers, producers and retailers receive $4.60; the other $12 is government tax. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to address the Australian Horticultural Corporation Amendment Bill 1990. The purpose of the Bill before the House is effectively to amend the Australian Horticultural Corporation (AHC) so that it can accommodate the dried fruits industry. Effectively, what has been the ADFA, the Australian Dried Fruits Association, will lose its control of the dried fruits industry and the ADFS, Australian Dried Fruits Sales, which has been the marketer for the ADFA, under this legislation now loses control of the domestic market for Australian dried fruits. As the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher) has said, the dried fruits industry is somewhat reluctant to accept this move, but it has agreed to it because, under the Government's legislation, the Australian dried fruits industry in fact retains control over the export part of the industry and it retains a level of autonomy-not the amount of autonomy it would like but a level of autonomy that it earlier feared it might lose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Horticultural Corporation has indicated to the Australian Dried Fruits Association that the Corporation will assist in market development. If we are to look at the second reading speech of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin), it would seem that this legislation is the first step in the establishment of the proposed product boards that the Minister wants as part of the AHC. As I have said in my contribution and as the honourable member for Mallee said very eloquently indeed, the industry is reluctant to make this move. This is partly because the move will cost the Australian dried fruits industry $60,000 per annum for the next three years and could cost it even more beyond that date, depending on the success of the move and whether the Government agrees to further subsidise funding for the AHC. </PARA>
<PARA> On 26 occasions in the past, the Australian dried fruits industry has used its domestic sales to assist with its export sales. These equalised payments, which have facilitated export sales, will now be lost. However, the sultana underwriting scheme, which has guaranteed some sort of stability to sultana producers around Australia, will continue. This underwriting scheme has been triggered only once since its inception, and that was in 1982 when the triggering of the underwriting scheme provided $16 per tonne for the producers of dried sultanas. </PARA>
<PARA> I can tell the House that $16 is not much on a tonne of sultanas because it takes an awful lot of tiny golden balls that were once large sultanas to produce a tonne. However, the mechanism was triggered and produced $16 per tonne and effectively cost $1.3m in 1982. The Industry Commission has calculated that it will take a 30 per cent slump in profitability for sultana producers for this mechanism to be triggered again, so it sees no reason for the underwriting scheme to continue. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out to the House that, while the underwriting scheme has given stability to the industry through difficult times and while a 30 per cent slump is seen as unlikely from the point of view of the Industry Commission, from my own experience in the industry-and I am sure the honourable member for Mallee would echo these sentiments-it is not beyond the realms of possibility for the income of dried fruits growers to slump by at least 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point that needs to be borne in mind when we look at the Australian dried fruits industry, particularly the sultana segment of that industry, is that it enjoys relatively little protection. As the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) said, its protection level will be only 15 per cent in 1992 or 10 per cent where there is a developing country preference. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not one to stand here advocating additional protection for either this or any other industry, but I do think that the House in considering this legislation has to bear in mind what a remarkable industry the Australian dried fruits industry has been and is. The honourable member for Mallee has made the point, and I can only restate it, that for almost 2,000 years the dried fruits industry around the world scarcely changed. The technique was developed by the early Egyptians of taking fruit, cutting it, finding an appropriate climate in which it would be reasonably preserved-or some other way of preserving it-leaving it in the sun until it was dried down and then discovering that they had a product that they could carry around with them for 12 months and still use as a food. This invaluable resource for the early Egyptians has, in its production technique, scarcely changed over 2,000 years.</PARA>
<PARA> Even at this time of the year in Sunraysia or Riverland, people will be found simply placing fruit in the sun in order to dry it and producing a product called `naturals', which is a dried fruit product, without any chemical exposure at all. The task is simply to take the product, keep the dew and rain off it, expose it to the sun, trust that the weather is kind enough to allow it to dry down without any fungal development and then market it as a product known as `naturals', which effectively lasts the year round. </PARA>
<PARA> The most remarkable thing about this industry is that in 1991 we have legislation dealing with an industry that is labour intensive and yet has survived in Australia. As an interesting aside, I point out to the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean) and the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons), who are at the table, that in 1991 when we are facing high levels of unemployment, when unemployment is clearly a major problem around Australia, in those areas of my electorate responsible for dried fruit production, there has been relatively little inflow of outside labour to harvest fruit. Because, remarkably, unemployment levels in the country are so high, much of the fruit is being picked without the Commonwealth Employment Service having to send labour in. </PARA>
<PARA> Given that that is the case, the two Ministers at the table might care to consider what will happen in country Australia, particularly in the electorates of Mallee, Farrer, Wakefield, Riverina-Darling and Barker, when the fruit season ceases and these people currently employed are then unemployed. We will then see unemployment levels of unprecedented proportions-thanks, I am sorry to say, to the policies of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In spite of the high labour content of the Australian dried fruits industry, it has continued to be a success. I think relatively few people are familiar with what was once the labour intensive technique of taking a bunch of grapes; placing it in a bucket that is perforated; dipping that bucket in a dip made up principally of caustic soda, potash and oils which then clung to the grape and allowed the skin of the grape to be broken down; placing that then damp bunch of grapes onto a rack of horizontal wire netting; leaving it for two or three weeks until it broke down into the product with which honourable members are familiar; shaking it manually off that rack onto hessians under the rack; pulling the hessians out from underneath; running them out in the sun; exposing that dried fruit in the sun during the day and closing the hessians at night to protect it from the dew; opening out and raking it out during the day-this process being repeated for a week or a fortnight, depending on the weather at the time-and then producing dried fruit, particularly sultanas, as we know them today. </PARA>
<PARA> If that were not labour intensive enough, let me remind the House that those who are producing raisins from gordo grapes, and not sultanas from sultana grapes, dip those gordo grapes in boiling caustic, oils and potash. If one considers the reality of being in 40-degree heat and keeping a dip of 200 gallons of boiling caustic on the boil all day, one can get an impression of how far removed from the comfort of Parliament House these people, even of my generation, I have to say as one who has done it, really were. </PARA>
<PARA> Today, the most remarkable changes in drying fruit have occurred. While there are still people today who go ahead with the task of picking grapes, dipping them and placing them on racks, they are normally picked, placed on racks and sprayed. But as a result of the work of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation the dried fruits industry has seen a dramatic change. Techniques are now being developed and used in, particularly, the Mildura area in the electorate of the honourable member for Mallee at this time where growers, instead of going through the labour intensive process I have just outlined, cut the canes on the grapes, spray the grapevine, still with the bunches on it, with recently cut canes-a cold spray that includes caustic, potash and oils; all relatively harmless chemicals-allow the grapes, the canes having been cut, to hang and dry on the vine and then harvest them off the canes with precisely the same machinery as is used to harvest wine grapes. So a real change has occurred in the dried fruits industry and some of the labour in the industry looks like disappearing as a result of the capacity now to harvest dried fruit on the vine. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever technique is used, whether the grapes are dried on the vine or on the rack, the remarkable thing is that what is produced in Australia is a grape in the raisin, sultana and currant area that is unrivalled around the world for quality. Our capacity, in spite of our high labour cost, to sell in export markets reflects the quality of Australian produce. I do not want in any way to sensationalise the debate, but I often have in my pocket, and therefore I have in the chamber now, some of those sultana grapes produced in my electorate and in the electorate of the honourable member for Mallee. </PARA>

<PARA> I keep these sultana grapes in my office. As those honourable members on this side of the House know, one can always come and sample dried sultana grapes in my office, because they are a product without equal. No-one else in the world can produce sultana grapes as cleanly as can Australian producers. The great problem that the Spaniards and the Greeks face, and a difficulty that even the Californians have more acutely than ourselves, is the intrusion of dust into their dried fruit product. Because of the way in which Australian producers are so particular about drying greens and maintaining a good environment for drying grapes, and because they have properties that allow them with irrigation to keep some sort of ground cover, Australia as a sultana, currant, raisin, dried apricot, peach and pear producer is unrivalled in the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> I make a comment or two about the complexity of the industry. One may well say that if the industry is as good as those speakers this evening have indicated, everyone in a Mediterranean climate where it is dry and irrigation is available should be growing dried fruit. This has been a very difficult product to market, for just one reason: sultanas and gordo grapes-or, in the dried form, sultanas and raisins-are not only used in the dried fruit industry but also in the wine grape industry. Given the complications I have painted of being a dried fruit grower and facing all the labour intensive drying techniques that are part of the dried fruit industry, there is a real temptation for growers not to supply the dried fruit industry but to supply the wine grape industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Those who market Australia's dried fruit, particularly Australia's sultanas and raisins, face this constant fluctuation of supply-not dictated solely by frosts, droughts or hail, but by the fact that growers will determine to take their product wherever the short term demand is. If there is a short term demand in the wine grape industry, as there certainly was when cask sales were popular, suddenly we will find a scarcity of supply in the dried fruit industry, and export markets that have been cultivated and developed by that industry will be unable to be supplied. </PARA>
<PARA> I digress for a moment. This does not only apply to dried grapes. It also applies to dried apricots, peaches and pears, because there is a demand in the apricot, peach and pear industry for product for juice. If there is a demand for apricot juice, pear juice or peach juice, suddenly we will find product moving from the labour intensive and difficult dried industry into the less labour intensive processed industry. There is a constant move. Those who market our dried fruit face a constant challenge not only from the vagaries of nature but also from the unpredictability of the people who produce the fruit.</PARA>
<PARA> I want to make a comment or two about the environmental sensitivity of the dried fruit product and then about its market- ability. Australians, increasingly bothered about what they consume and about the impact of their lifestyle and their consumption on the environment, ought to recognise that dried fruit provides a great opportunity to consume something that is pollution free and environmentally sensitive. It is no idle boast to call this sun dried, because sun dried it is. We did not have to fire up oil furnaces to produce this dried product; the sun was used. This is a solar product; it has not been dipped in poisons or pesticides. It may have had the odd fungicide, but that would have been sulphur or copper based and therefore what I might loosely call a basic chemical and not a toxic chemical. But, apart from its exposure to the odd fungicide, it will have been well washed by the packaging and processing houses. It is sun dried and therefore environmentally sensitive. It is in itself non-toxic and, furthermore, is relatively non-perishable and, because the water has been taken out of it, provides a very concentrated form of energy that is easily transported around the world. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier in my speech, there have been real changes in the way in which this labour intensive industry goes about producing its product, minimising its labour cost. What is needed for this product is not now on-farm efficiency, but off-farm efficiency. Changes in the transport area and changes to the waterfront are desperately needed by Australia's dried fruit producers. I do not find the dried fruit producers of my electorate demanding protection; they simply want to work in an environment where, if they are to be deregulated, so also should the wage market be deregulated. They do not expect people to work for them for Asian wages, but they say they want eight hours work for eight hours pay. That is not an unreasonable demand. But they have an even more acute need: they are saying that when the product leaves them and goes into the packing house or leaves the packing house and heads to the wharf they want to see that the people who are being paid to handle it are handling it in an efficient way. </PARA>
<PARA> I think I ought to restate a couple of points were made by previous speakers. The industry is entitled to rapid track anti-dumping legislation. This Government owes the industry at least some form of rapid track anti-dumping legislation-just as this Opposition has committed itself, through the honourable member for Murray and the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), to producing such legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> In my concluding remarks, I must take issue with the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice). He made a perfectly reasonable contribution to the debate until, at the end of his expose this evening, he could not resist getting stuck into the Opposition in a quite unsubstantiated way. He said that the goods and services tax, if you please, would be a major burden to Australia's horticultural producers. He wanted us to apologise for the very tax designed to assist exporters! I would remind him that this tax is designed to make exports more saleable and exporters more profitable. That is the Opposition's motive in entertaining it. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the honourable member for Hinkler went on and applauded the actions of the Queensland Government in proposing additional controls over chemicals. I do not know any horticulturalists or primary producers who are casual users of chemicals, because they have to pay for them and they have to expose themselves to those chemicals. So horticulturalists are among the most particular people about the way in which chemicals are applied. </PARA>
<PARA> As if that were not enough, the honourable member for Hinkler went on to say that a major problem faced in developing a horticultural export market is Queensland fruit fly. How, I ask, does he propose to control fruit fly in the chemical free utopia he was painting for the House tonight?</PARA>
<PARA> Horticulture is an industry with great export potential, but its capacity to realise that potential will depend entirely on the cost of production beyond the farm gate being addressed, and we have seen little of that from the Government of the day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the last few moments we have witnessed the most disgraceful conduct imaginable by an incompetent government. We are debating very important legislation, the importance of which has been totally lost on the Government, as evidenced by the fact that the Opposition has now been served with 11 substantial amendments to the Australian Horticultural Corporation Amendment Bill 1990, which has been lying on the table for several months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Just how are the Liberal and National parties to fulfil their responsibilities in representing the horticultural industry in this place-this Government has abrogated its responsibilities-if we receive amendment after amendment in the last few moments of debate? It ought to go on the public record that this Government has at the very last moment served the Opposition with a number of amendments in a way which precludes the Opposition from giving them the detailed attention they so obviously deserve. This is important legislation which badly needs to be debated at length by this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Until we get some explanation from the Government, I will not be quite sure whether it has been an act of incompetence or deceit on the part of the Government that has led to this situation. It is more likely to be one of utter incompetence, but, even worse than that, it is likely to be complete disregard for the forms of this House and for the horticultural industry. After all, it is almost certain that horticultural industry representatives themselves have not had a chance to peruse the amendments to be moved on behalf of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Leaving aside the obvious insult to the practices and personnel of this Parliament served up by the Government, there is the matter of the effect it will have on the legislation itself. The shadow Minister for primary industries, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), needs to consider at some length the amendments now before the House, but is prevented from doing so. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's seeming contempt for the industry is something that we have come to expect. To it, rural industry is something peripheral to the major economic debate. Its concentration is so often with industry, to the point of ignoring primary industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not take rural industries seriously. That is what it boils down to. It comes into this place and introduces amendment after amendment. It cannot possibly regard rural industries with the seriousness that we on this side of the House do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just in explanation of what has become a rather interesting affair, I must say that these amendments were first shown to me by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) about 15 or 20 minutes before the second reading debate was completed. At that stage, the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean) gave them to me and asked whether we were aware of them. I said that I certainly was not. I checked with the Whip and also with the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), and I was informed that this was the first time he had heard of them. The suggestion has now been made that they have been in this place for the last 24 hours. Even if that is the case, they have been in the hands of the Opposition for only the last half an hour. I can only support what has been said by the honourable member for Murray-that this is a pretty shoddy arrangement when we consider that the legislation was apparently introduced into this Parliament last September.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are now debating this Bill clause by clause, and we have to ask the question when we look at the short title, which says that this Act may be cited as the Australian Horticultural Corporation Amendment Act of 1990, what that refers to-the amending Bill as it was originally given to us, or is it inclusive of the amendments that are here with us now? It has happened on more than one occasion that amendments have come very late from the Government. I think an explanation has to be given, quite apart from the one that apparently these amendments have been in the hands of the Parliament-and I am presuming not within the chamber-for the last 24 hours, in answer to the question of what happened to them, and why was the Opposition not shown some courtesy by their being forwarded at a much earlier time than this?</PARA>
<PARA> I fully support the complaint that has been lodged by the shadow Minister that it is not good enough. Perhaps we ought to be debating this clause by clause just to find out, if these are just technical amendments, where the rest of the errors lie. Maybe they need amendment at the same time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher) and, indeed, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) for their expressions of the quite rightful indignation that the Opposition has at the way the Opposition has been treated this evening and the way in which these amendments have been made available. As the honourable member for Murray has pointed out, this legislation was available on 4 December, but these amendments the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean) has suggested became available 24 hours ago, while the honourable member for Murray's own experience is that they became available no more than half an hour ago. I am not questioning the word of the Minister at the table, the Minister for Science and Technology, but I must say that, even if it were 24 hours ago, this does not really represent the sort of consultation with the industry that the industry has offered the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Murray has already made the point that the industry has been prepared to make itself available to the Government and spend thousands of dollars getting to Canberra. Some of us who are in this chamber know those who represent the Australian Dried Fruits Association. I refer to people such as Mr Henry Tankard, who is himself a dried fruit grower who has other demands on his time but has willingly made available time to meet with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) and time to meet with the Opposition, and I must say he has been well received and I would have thought well regarded by the Minister. Mr Tankard has every reason to be indignant at the way in which we, the Opposition, have been dealt with concerning these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> Why should Mr Tankard be indignant on our behalf? Because I do not stand here as Neil Andrew and the honourable member for Murray does not stand there as Bruce Lloyd. We stand here representing electorates. This chamber does not belong to the Australian Labor Party or the Liberal Party of Australia. This chamber represents the nation and the people who elected those of us who take seats in this chamber and are entitled to a voice. The dried fruit growers who happen perchance to be represented by people on this side of the chamber are being denied their voice because we have not had a chance to be either briefed on their behalf or to brief the chamber on their behalf, or to look at the way in which these amendments reflect on the legislation and, as the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) has said, to voice their concerns effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> The dried fruit industry has been all about consultation. I know it well enough to know that is a fact. The Minister would agree that he has enjoyed excellent consultation from the dried fruit industry. It would seem now that that consultation has not been reciprocated and that the dried fruit industry has not enjoyed the confidence of the Minister and the preparedness of the Minister or his department to consult with it. On behalf of the industry-not the Liberal Party-I stand here indignant tonight to think that we should have major legislation changed by the whim of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course it will pass; the Government has the numbers. But that does not make it right, any more than it would be right if we were the Government. The industry is entitled to a measure of consultation; that consultation has been denied it; and I stand here as one who has had no opportunity to thumb through these two pages of amendments. For that reason I believe I and all other speakers on this side of the chamber must protest loudly at the sort of regard or, more accurately, disregard, the Government has shown for the Australian dried fruits industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason why we have taken this action is that the Bill was introduced in December. There was plenty of notice available about the timing for the debate. I was never notified as the shadow Minister that two pages of amendments were being brought in. It is the usual courtesy that that be done. The first notice that we had that there were two pages of amendments was when one of the honourable members opposite brought these amendments to the table during the latter stages of the second reading debate. We have been told that the announcement about the amendments was made 24 hours ago. I certainly have never been advised. The actual physical presence of those amendments during the debate was not evident, I am told, at the beginning of the debate. I would like some explanation from the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is obviously quite a bit of confusion. That confusion is shared by me. These are all purely machinery amendments. For example, the amendment to clause 17(3) omits the word `regulation' and substitutes `regulations'. I am sure the Opposition understands that. The situation is that the duty Minister introduced amendments into the House 24 hours ago. Therefore, I assume he or she did not push them across the table. They are machinery amendments. The amendments were circulated on 20 February and I am sure the clerk who records circulation in the chamber can confirm that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand that the Opposition is concerned that the Australian Dried Fruits Association might not know all about this, but it has certainly been advised of the amendments. The Dried Fruits Association has no problems with the amendments. In fact, I have a fax here which states:</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The letter is dated 15 February 1991. They are just straight machinery regulations. The whole purpose of these amendments is to get the Dried Fruits Association under the umbrella of the Australian Horticultural Corporation. Most of these machinery amendments have been drafted so that the Australian Horticultural Corporation can effectively allow for a product board. The ADFA has agreed to that. This is a result of a lot of consultation over a long period. I would be misrepresenting the views of the ADFA to say that it is entirely happy about this course of action. But this happened as a result of a long consultation. It basically thinks this is the way to go, given the Government's policy with respect to the dried fruits industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I could go through the individual clauses that are being changed if that would help honourable members opposite. Clause 17 repeals part IV and substitutes a new part to allow the product board to convene an annual general meeting. The next amendment states that the first annual general meeting shall be the period since the establishment of the board. Here we are talking about a dried fruits product board. The third amendment changes the word `regulation' to `regulations'. Clause 24 repeals the Dried Fruits Export Charges Act 1924, and puts that into the Australian Horticultural Corporation, hence we need a new clause 30A. That amends section 7 and provides that the total rate of export charge payable under section 7 includes the charge imposed under new section 8A. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 31A-Flexibility in the rates of charge-is a new clause which amends section 11 of the Horticultural Export Charge Act so that it also applies to section 8A. Clause 31B, concerning regulations, is the seventh amendment. This is a new clause which amends section 14 of the Horticultural Export Charge Act and provides that before making regulations for the purposes of section 8A--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my 5 1/2 minutes to conclude my contribution to this particular debate, I repeat how I started out. That was to try to approach this issue from the viewpoint of a parent of young children who obviously are very impressionable on the question of television violence, from the viewpoint of a former policeman who has seen the effects of television violence on young people, or perhaps, as I mentioned earlier, as a member of the baby boom generation, the generation which has been exposed at some great length to the effects of television over the years since it was introduced into Australia in 1956.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I mention this purely and simply as a means of reducing some of the tension present in the House at the moment. I would like to look at an extract from an article in the Canberra Times which probably summarises the experiences of a lot of parents around the country on a Saturday morning. Certainly, it would be very familiar to many constituents in my electorate. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Weekends are different. </PARA>
<PARA> I am still amazed by the fact that children who have to be dragged, protesting out of a warm bed at 8am on school days have an inbuilt alarm which triggers off a jack-in-the-box effect around 6am on Saturdays and Sundays. Having soaked up all the early cartoons they are bored and ready for action around 8.30am just as we are turning over for a cuddle. </PARA>
<PARA>I mention that quotation because, as I said, it has a ring of familiarity for many people around the country. It is necessary to consider the effects of some of these cartoons on the impressionable minds of young people. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer to an extract from the report entitled TV Violence in Australia Volume I: Decisions and Reasons which looks at the function of the `G' classification and at some of the cartoons that appear on Saturday mornings in front of impressionable young children. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . Ms Boekenstein of the FCB noted that the `new breed' of cartoon, such as TRANSFORMERS and GI JOE, contained violence which:</PARA>
<PARA>  . . . throw away the rule book on kids' cartoon violence, (and) are causing us constant grief. The very last episode of GI JOE we saw, we actually put a PG on . . . We decided that the ongoing violence . . . was sufficient to warrant PG, which is a bit of a watershed for us in terms of that style of cartoon. </PARA>
<PARA>In other submissions it was noted that Channel 10 had withdrawn Transformers, The New Three Stooges, and Hulk Hogan's Rock 'n' Roll Wrestling from its program line-up. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important issue to my constituents about which I spoke earlier today is the question of rising unemployment in my own electorate, particularly amongst young people between the ages of 15 and 19. I think it is important that we consider the ramifications of this particular report in the context that in my electorate, at least, a far greater number of young people are going to be spending a lot more time sitting around watching television thanks to this Government's horrendous economic policies which have forced them onto the unemployment scrap heap. I pointed out to the House earlier today that in my area, the northern suburbs of Perth-which I would say is fairly typical of suburban metropolitan Australia-has seen a youth unemployment rate rise from 2,000 in December 1989 to 3,500 in 1990. </PARA>

I think that even from the vastness of the Speaker's chair, you would not be immune to the knowledge that the Australian population watches quite extraordinary amounts of television. During these trying times it is more likely than not that that will be exacerbated. Given the subjective nature of many of the judgments which have to be made in this difficult area, to attempt to restrict debate in the way that the honourable member opposite has is quite wrong.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I see that contributions to this debate this evening are required to be wide-ranging and I am more than happy to comply with that. This matter is very important. I would like to start off by talking about violence in a much broader context. The Government's response to the serial killing in Melbourne and the community reaction to that launched a wide-ranging committee of inquiry called the National Committee on Violence. The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal already had its reference as far as the media was concerned. I really think that the Committee is an important starting point. It did an excellent job. It put out a number of publications, all of which were very good. One which really impressed me was on domestic violence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should also say that this National Committee on Violence introduced me to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. This occurred many months before I was inundated by many constituents' letters. The report on domestic violence was very good. (Quo-rum formed) I think it should be pointed out that the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) called for a quorum when I was talking about domestic violence. He has so little concern for domestic violence that he wants to pull the little stunt of calling a quorum. I hope he can stand up to the women of his electorate and say, `I think so little of domestic violence that I called a quorum.' In fact, it was the honourable member's profession-the police-that was singled out in the document on domestic violence as being singularly unsympathetic and uninformed about the needs of victims. Shame on the honourable member and shame on him for calling a quorum. I hope his electorate condemns him. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member wants to talk about the poor in his electorate. Why does he not read the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal's report TV Violence in Australia, which had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Poverty is one of the most important causes of violence and notes that most violent offenders and victims of violence are drawn from the disadvantaged strata of Australian society. The image which many people who earn low incomes have of themselves is one of worthlessness, expendability or, at best, irrelevance. </PARA>
<PARA>That is something that the honourable member reinforces daily in this House. The report went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>This self image is reinforced if the person of economic disadvantage belongs to a minority group. Respectable paths to status or prestige are seen as barred or are often expressed in self-destructive or outwardly aggressive behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee considers that governments and oppositions should avoid the kind of political point scoring which labels poor people as worthless bludgers. </PARA>
<PARA>And who was doing that in this Parliament? The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee considers it is a responsibility of the Federal Government to continue to provide adequate income support for the most disadvantaged members of society. Evidence for the importance of adequate income support comes from countries which lack income support programs, and where the level of violence is much higher. </PARA>
<PARA>I say to the honourable member for Moore that the real tragedy that we have had meted out this week is that Opposition members propose economic measures that are ideas from America. America has a much more violent record than we have in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The report of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal is a very good one, but I think it is really flawed in one respect. It calls for voluntary enforcement of codes, which I support. But it also calls on the parents of Australia to exercise responsibility in relation to the television material that their children see. Quite frankly, we need to encourage all parents to fully exercise that responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point that I would make is this: it is up to television viewers, if they are dissatisfied with this voluntary approach to these standards that have been adopted by commercial stations, to protest, and they will be heard. If they wish to know how to protest, they should in the first instance ring the television channel and voice their concern. If they wish more vigorously to follow up their complaint, they should write to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. If that is something they do not wish to do, they could write to their member of parliament. Certainly in the electorate of Chifley I would be encouraging them to write to me, because I can assure them that each and every complaint I receive I would be more than willing to pass on to the television station and to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not just something for the eastern suburbs or the north shore in Sydney. It is a responsibility that we have right throughout New South Wales and right throughout Australia. I wish to repeat that the success of this voluntary code will depend on parents and television viewers accepting their responsibilities in relation to their own children, and also passionately believing that they have a right to be heard and that their standards are important. If television stations are not capable of exercising this voluntary restraint, or if they are producing material which offends the viewer, then the viewers should, and must, in our democracy make sure that their voices are heard. </PARA>
<PARA> Sometimes members of parliament are accused of getting carried away with certain issues. Does violence on television have an impact on children or adults? The weight of evidence is fairly consistent: that preferring violent television viewing leads to aggressive behaviour and aggressive values. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, there was a study undertaken in the United States that monitored soap operas, and in particular suicides within those soap operas. The researcher found, by going through the record, that every time there was a suicide in one of those shows the number of women suiciding went up quite dramatically. Why should it be women? I presume it may have something to do with the hours during which the programs were shown. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe this ought to be a matter of concern to us in this Parliament, and more especially of concern to us out in the community. We can cite an Australian example where there was a film shown, I think it was called Doomsday Flight, which portrayed a ransom being extracted from an airline. Of course, it was not too long after the screening of that film that Qantas paid out $500,000 in what appeared to be very much a mirror image of that film. </PARA>
<PARA> I would say that there is much more evidence than I have quoted here tonight to suggest that violence on television has an impact on children, who I am most particularly concerned about, naturally, and also on adults. I wish to reiterate that we cannot be passive about this. As a community, as fathers and mothers, as ordinary mums and dads, we have the right to determine what those standards are and whether the voluntary standards in fact are infringing. </PARA>
<PARA> Intrusive behaviour can also be very offensive. There are shows which are well known for intruding into people's privacy. This is outlawed also-where the interviewer extracts the last tear from the subject being interviewed. I have to say frankly that I find those types of interviews most offensive. In my own electorate I well recall a current affairs program interviewing one of my constituents, who was not able to cope with the aggressive tactics of the interviewer. That might not have been too bad, but the consequences were that it created quite some difficulty within his local community. He was not really well equipped to deal with that, and had to go around and apologise. So the television stations have responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to go into the precise nature of the codes, except to say that of course they cover news, drama and current affairs. The key point is that in our society so many people feel that they are powerless, that if things are meted out there is no way in which they can fight back, there is no way in which they can make their voices heard. </PARA>
<PARA> I just wish to say to my own constituents in Chifley-who are very proud people by the way, and very good parents-that they do not have to cop it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was very concerned to see that the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) was quite perturbed when the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) called a quorum during his speech. I point out that when the honourable member for Moore was making quite a telling point in his speech-a significant point which was important for people to hear-the honourable member for Chifley called a point of order which took up the last three or four minutes of the speech of the honourable member for Moore, thus preventing him from making those quite significant points. Therefore, whilst I agree with the honourable member for Chifley's comments tonight in regard to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal Report on TV Violence in Australia, I feel I had to make that little point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not perhaps completely at one with him when he says that he totally agrees with the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal's recommendation that television stations should be voluntarily fulfilling the requirements of the Tribunal in regard to what they televise at certain times. The honourable member said that many people who complained about television violence would be surprised to know that there would be many other people complaining as well. This means that the voluntary system is very likely to break down and that we will need some pretty strong regulation of the programming of television channels when vulnerable audiences are watching. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Chifley and other honourable members have pointed out, the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal's report is very interesting with regard to television violence in Australia. The honourable member for Chifley made a very strong point of the fact that most of the submissions to the Tribunal referred to the effects of television violence on children. Of course, as honourable members would know, that is a topic that has concerned me for many years. As a consequence I am very glad to have the opportunity to speak for a short period in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the major concerns of the Tribunal was the possibility of copycat or imitative behaviour. This is indeed the case. As I mentioned when making a point in the social security debate yesterday, prior to my coming into Parliament and following my career as a teacher I was involved in criminology and dealt with juveniles in varying age groups in New South Wales. It became patently obvious to me that the violence that was depicted on TV, in comics, in videos and so on certainly had a very dramatic effect on people's behaviour. Certainly, it had an effect on vulnerable people. Of course, such things do not affect all people but there are a substantial number of people in the community, particularly the young, who respond in dramatic ways to what they view on television. Very often they are young people who in other respects have all sorts of good influences on them. A wide debate can be undertaken with regard to that point. </PARA>
<PARA> I well remember one particular offender who had quite serious behavioural problems in the various institutions in which he was placed. On one occasion when he came into the area over which I had control, I made a deal with him in regard to his aggressive behaviour that if he did the right thing and toed the line and did the best he could I, as the chief superintendent, would actually take him home on discharge and meet his parents. That was our agreement. He fulfilled the agreement. When I took him home I went into the lounge room where the father told me over a cup of coffee that they were going to celebrate that night. He said, `I have all his favourite videos here'. I looked on the TV set and saw six or seven of the most violent movies that one could ever set one's eyes on. It soon became patently obvious to me why we were having a lot of trouble with that person. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not really have to think very hard to come to the conclusion that the viewing of violence on TV by young minds, very often of varying degrees of emotional maturity, has a harmful effect. We say that five-year-olds should not watch certain things. Some five-year-olds are quite resilient and maybe would not be affected. Other five-year-olds have not reached the necessary emotional maturity to enable them to watch varying kinds of violent behaviour on TV and not be affected very deeply by it. Therefore, we have to take into account a tremendous number of factors in regard to what we show on our television sets and how it can affect anybody's behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the point that it is far better to err on the side of overtightening the regulations rather than being too lax, because no-one has ever suffered as a result of having a fairly restrictive regulation of television content. Many years ago when we used to visit the cinema-perhaps the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee) would not remember this because he is still quite youthful-we would not have had any concerns about what was screened or, in fact, what was shown on television because the programs were very strictly controlled. It was very rare for anything violent to come on to cause us or our parents any concern. However, we cannot argue that today. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen a gradual sinking of our standards. The programs on TV in this day and age really need to be looked at very carefully, perhaps with a view to tightening the regulations a little more. This is bearing in mind, as I said before, that we will not suffer as a result of that extra regulation. I think that the nonsense people go on with about civil liberties being interfered with is just so much bunkum. People who take that view have rocks in their heads. We ought not to be swayed in the legislation and recommendations we make in this place by those people who are usually very vocal on these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Chifley and other honourable members have mentioned the need for parental responsibility. Of course, in this day and age when so much violence is allowed on our TV sets, at times when the viewing should be Granted, even when the news is on, parental responsibility is an absolute must. Parents who do not monitor the programs that their children watch are really not being very responsible. I know it is not possible to scrutinise and watch every minute of television viewed by the child, but parents ought to be extremely mindful of the need to be aware of the kinds of things that their children have access to on television. </PARA>
<PARA> I remember, not so many years ago, that when quite violent scenes appeared on the news it was very distressing to my wife and me, and more often than not we had to turn off the news when our children were watching. That was not any special kind of supervision on our part; we believed it was normal for us as parents to do that. That is the kind of normality I would like to see other parents in this country adopt with regard to the things their children are watching on television. </PARA>
<PARA> This report is quite extensive in the areas it covers. A great number of submissions came in and many witnesses came forward to give assistance to the Tribunal. I notice that one submission came from the South Australian Council for Children's Films and Television. Mr Glenn Cupit, the affiliate vice-president of that organisation, carried out a study which found that a consistent theme appeared. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>If you expose children to a diet of violent material they will be more likely to resort to violence themselves, they become less concerned about injury done to other people. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Cupit's survey showed that television violence involving humans stuck more in the minds of children. These are facts and, as I said before, we as legislators should be able to see from a purely commonsense point of view that we need to do something more constructive and more practical about the censorship this country currently has in place. If we do not see the dangers we are creating and leaving in place for the young people of today, for older people and for future generations, I say again that we have rocks in our heads. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to be aware of that. It is not something that we can argue away with obscure studies that minimise the effects of such things. The effects that violence has on young people are very serious, and I can talk from vast experience in that regard through my dealings with thousands of young offenders in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I mention that somebody who participated in the debate, although not in this House, said that he could excuse and justify violence and that he was opposed to the general tenor running through the debate in this House. He argued that there is much violence in the Bible, and he quoted that. There is a major difference between the violence in the Bible and the violence shown on television today. The violence in the Bible illustrates the conflict between good and evil, between righteousness and wickedness. Much of the violence shown on television today is between evil and greater evil-we have to admit that when we see the deterioration in the quality of films. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Bible there are godly heroes with whom the reader can identify. On today's television programs the heroes to whom young people and others relate are usually people with no respect for God. Viewers, including children, are usually forced to choose between people who have no respect for godly things and evil people, so they really do not have a great deal of choice. Quite frequently on some of these television programs the person who at first seems to be the best of the group turns out to be the worst of the bunch. Young people watching programs such as that can be quite devastated. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by quoting the last verse of a poem entitled The Bad Example. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>All in vain is splendid preaching,</PARA>
<PARA>And the noble things we say,</PARA>
<PARA>All our talk is wasted teaching,</PARA>
<PARA>If we do not lead the way. </PARA>
<PARA>We can never, by reviewing</PARA>
<PARA>All the sermons on the shelves,</PARA>
<PARA>Keep the younger hands from doing</PARA>
<PARA>What we often do ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that we take that on board. </PARA>

<PARA> The debate tonight on the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal report on TV Violence in Australia is a very important one for the community. The evidence of the level of community interest is demonstrated by the number of honourable members who have asked to speak in the debate tonight. It shows the level of concern not only in the community but also in this House that people wish to comment on the amount of violence on Australian television. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose one of the television programs that has generated the greatest amount of comment concerning violence on television is the very famous children's cartoon called Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I know that a large number of parents have expressed concern that these cartoons depict characters who carry knives and all sorts of weapons. While it is certainly true that the characters, who are held up in an idealistic manner, use these weapons for the forces of good, it is also of great concern that it is often reported that children seek to imitate the behaviour of these Mutant Ninja Turtles. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Chifley reminds me that some schools have had to ban children from wearing Ninja Turtle outfits and, in some cases, carrying imitation weapons when mimicking the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle program. Whilst I suppose any adult watching the program would see the humour in it, we have to think what impact that program and others will have on a child of an impressionable age, and that is what this debate is all about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Several years ago-in fact before the former Minister for Transport and Communications, now the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Evans, asked the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to carry out this investigation into television violence in Australia-I made one or two speeches in the House of Representatives expressing my concern about violence in the news coverage on Australian television. The program that triggered my concern was a report on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) of some of the violent deaths that had taken place in black townships in South Africa. This program sought to explain the fact that many of the Western news services censored out a lot of the worst violence that was on occasion filmed in South Africa. This ABC program went on to show the most horrific murder that I have ever seen on television. Whilst it is true that it was shown at about 9.00 at night, I am sure that a large number of young people would still have been watching at that time of the evening. </PARA>
<PARA> What worries me most about the news coverage rather than cartoons, films about the Mafia or some other violent fictional event is that people know that it is the real world, it is real life. It is of great concern if news reports show graphic violence early in the evening. I am sure that most young children watch some of the news services between six and 7.30 at night. I am sure that the commercial broadcasters, the ABC and the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) realise that they have a great responsibility to make sure that they do not broadcast vision which can frighten and perhaps scare and make, for an extended period, a severe impression on young children. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that some honourable members in the House will remember a debate that took place in the television industry when one of the commercial television networks decided to show an American public official committing suicide with a pistol at a press conference. Although most of the networks did not broadcast vision, most of them broadcast the audio tape of the event taking place. One of the commercial networks actually broadcast the vision at about six o'clock at night. There was such an outrage from the community that I understand action was taken against the news director concerned for allowing that incident to go to air. </PARA>
<PARA> That is one example where a response from the public resulted in a broadcaster realising that a mistake had occurred. I am not aware of any similar horrific vision being shown that early at night since that time, and I hope that the voluntary code which now seems to have been accepted by the industry will ensure that that does not take place in years to come. </PARA>
<PARA> My main concern is what is broadcast in news programs. These days, news programs are often broadcast on the different networks later at night between 10 o'clock and 11 o'clock. It is fair for broadcasters to assume by that time of the evening that parents have put their younger and more impressionable children to bed. Some of the vision held back from the earlier news services should be able to be used later at night. </PARA>

Vision that cannot be shown earlier can be shown at that time of the evening. That is something which should be considered in a proper manner by the news directors concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the same time, our broadcasters do have a responsibility to show horrific events when they take place out there in the real world. There are occasions perhaps when we need to be shocked if terrible things are happening. For example, when the tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square it was right for the world to be told that terrible things were taking place in Tiananmen Square. It did not mean that broadcasters should show footage of human bodies being damaged physically or vision disturbing to individuals had to be shown early at night in news bulletins. But all of us who do live in the freer countries of the world did have a responsibility to learn what was happening in China. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MG4">Mr LEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And be shocked, as the honourable member for Chifley said. We heard a debate in this House earlier about the events in the Baltic states. All of us are concerned about the future of the Baltic states. Several weeks ago violence was committed in one of the Baltic states when some of the defence forces of the Soviet Union got out of control. One television camera was able to record some of that footage. The fact that that footage got to the West and was broadcast around the world means that that violence is less likely to be repeated. If that violence had not been shown on television, because we had a policy that no violence could ever be shown on our news services, that would have been wrong. That is an example where it was important that we be shocked by seeing police beating people with night sticks and guns being fired at random. There is a second example where perhaps it is important that we know what is happening out there in the real world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have said, there needs to be a balance. I think we can allow broadcasters to decide what vision is acceptable early in the evening for the six and 7.30 bulletins. They have greater freedom for the late night bulletins, and it is up to them to use that freedom responsibly. </PARA>
<PARA> I also make a few comments about the level of violence in films broadcast on the commercial stations, the ABC and SBS. I know that the shadow Minister at the table, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), is a keen watcher of SBS television movies. I know that he is aware that SBS movies are not subject to the same censorship requirements that apply to the commercial networks. A film shown on the Channel 7 network perhaps would be required to be edited or censored because of violent or sexual scenes, but those same scenes could be broadcast without censorship or editing on SBS. That is a ridiculous situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that when the great Australian film Bliss was shown on ABC television a number of complaints were received because some people objected to certain scenes being shown. If that film had been shown on a commercial network, the censors would have required some of the scenes in that entertaining film to have been deleted. </PARA>
<PARA> When the honourable member for Gippsland goes to the video store in Fyshwick or some other place to rent a video, as a responsible person-I think I can use that description about the honourable member for Gippsland-he is making an informed decision as to the video he wishes to see. Parents should pay greater attention to the sorts of videos that they hire or that their children can watch at home, but on the whole the classification system for videos can be made to work. </PARA>
<PARA> But television is different. Television programs are beamed into the television set via an antennae. There is not the same form of parental supervision of live to air television as there is with videos. Programs not broadcast live to air should be required to meet certain standards. The ABC and SBS should follow the same standards as the commercial networks. If the standards are good enough for the commercial networks, why do they not apply to the ABC?</PARA>
<PARA> I remind the House in the few minutes I have left of the research carried out by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal in its inquiry. We should not forget that that research showed that 60 per cent of the community felt that there was too much violence on television. So very strong concern was felt in the community about the level of violence on television. On the question of violence in news programs, over three-quarters of the adults sampled in one of the interviewing groups reported distaste for intrusive interviews with accident or tragedy victims. That goes to the point that the honourable member for Chifley was emphasising that news programs should not seek to hound victims of accidents or tragedies simply to get a story to air in order to boost their ratings. Any program that sought to use people in tragic circumstances like that deserves to be reprimanded strongly. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the same research from the discussion groups showed that, despite the belief of some viewers that the screening of real life violence was justified, six out of 10 adults thought that news showing explicit violent material should only be shown late in the evening. That goes to the heart of the point that I have sought to make tonight in this important debate. I know a large number of other members wish to make a contribution tonight, so I will restrict my comments to that and commend the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) for the statement he has made indicating that the voluntary standards now appear to have been adopted by the industry. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like others who have spoken previously, I am delighted to have the opportunity to address the House on the occasion of the tabling of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal report TV Violence in Australia. The background would be known to most honourable members. The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT) inquiry was established in August 1988 and it reported in January 1990. I have to express my regret that it is more than 12 months after the delivery of the report to the Minister for Transport and Communications that this House has a chance to address its content and its recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The ABT inquiry was established in the context of the National Committee on Violence report entitled Violence: Directions for Australia. Honourable members may recall that that report was commissioned in 1987 after the Hoddle Street massacre and other random acts of violence throughout Australia. It reported in 1990. The National Committee on Violence report called for a uniform code on violence to apply to the networks, exercised through the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. This issue was referred to the ABT, hence its report before us this evening. The ABT report will provide the basis of establishing the uniform code called for by the National Committee on Violence (NCV). </PARA>
<PARA> I wish tonight to concentrate my remarks on sports violence on television. The terms of reference set for the ABT inquiry by the former Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Gareth Evans, did not preclude an opportunity to consider closely the impact of violence in televised sport. The terms of reference were wide ranging. In part, those terms sought the inquiry to investigate:</PARA>
<PARA>The portrayal, presentation and reporting of violence on television including general entertainment programs, news and current affairs programs, cartoons, advertisements and other programs. </PARA>
<PARA>The terms of reference had the scope for an investigation into the impact of violence by way of televised sports broadcasts. Indeed, the findings of the report begged the very issue of the impact of televised sport. The qualitative research carried out by the inquiry found that males of all ages are more likely to watch television programs with high levels of action as well as all types of sport, and thus appeared to be more often exposed to television violence. </PARA>
<PARA> There is precious little evidence in all the four volumes of the report that the issue was addressed in any way whatsoever. A total of 1,114 submissions were made to the inquiry, but not one of these was from a formal sporting body. However, some 31 individual submissions dealt with the issue of violence and televised sport. These ranged from submissions from concerned private citizens to those from organisations such as the Australian Council for Children's Films and Television, departmental community welfare officers, officers of the Sport and Recreation Ministers' Council, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, the National Viewers and Listeners Association, the Australian Family Association and the Tasmanian Minister for Education and the Arts, the Hon. Peter Rae. </PARA>
<PARA> Such has been the concern with violence in sport that two years ago all the Ministers for sport called for a reduction of televised sporting related violence. Last year's report by the National Committee on Violence entitled Violence: Directions for Australia, to which I referred earlier, highlighted concerns with sports related violence as portrayed in the national media. I will refer to its recommendations shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> The call for a uniform code of practice in regard to violence portrayed through the television networks sprang from the NCV report. However, the concern with sports related violence highlighted in the three-year inquiry into violence in Australia has not directly filtered through into this ABT inquiry, nor specifically into its recommendations. Unfortunately, the television networks themselves appear uninterested in the issue, or at least they are reluctant to raise it as an issue. The two networks, Nine and Ten, which submitted to the ABT inquiry their guidelines on presenting violence had precious little to say about their responsibilities on televising sport. Nine was concerned with martial arts and Ten said it was not in the interests of future generations of sports men and women to overemphasise violence which is not a normal part of the game. One is left wondering what `overemphasise' and `normal' mean in this context. </PARA>

Ten's submission to the inquiry questions whether the network, or any of the other networks, have any idea whatsoever of the impact of sporting related violence on the community, especially the young.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The inquiry's research clearly found that children and adolescents, especially males, were exposed to a massive amount of televised sports. It also found that younger viewers were vastly more accepting of the level of violence displayed in the various broadcasts than were adults. It was fit and proper that the inquiry dealt with violence in the news and current affairs programs as well as those depicted in drama and light entertainment schedules, but it was disturbing that the impact of televised sport was neglected in its key recommendations. It was equally confusing as to why, given the prevalence of the concern in the submissions, sports related violence was not deemed a substantial or important part of the inquiry's focus. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, you would appreciate that sport penetrates popular culture in this country on a staggering scale. It is a central feature of the lives of the bulk of the community. Unlike any other form of organised activity, unlike any institution, sport in its various forms virtually dominates this society. The honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), the former Minister for Science and Technology, has spent a lifetime railing against the preoccupation of Australian society with sport at the expense of so many of the other higher callings of the human spirit. Again, that is reflected in the research of the ABT inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> Given this mass viewing audience of televised sport, why has the ABT not concentrated, in some part at least, on the aspect of violence in televised sport? It seems to me that Australia has a blind spot when it comes to criticising sporting activities which exhibit high levels of violence. The violence which is portrayed in sport is socially sanctioned violence. We may condemn violence, as other speakers have this evening, as portrayed in fictional programs-movies, dramas, soap operas. We can even express revulsion at real life violence presented in news and current affairs programs. But we are incapable of casting a critical eye on violence in the various sporting activities we ourselves indulge in, as spectators or participants. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not have to have the research figures to assess the scale of the impact of sport on the national life and we do not have to have the surveys and the reports to know that sport is a key medium through which the young build their social relationships, both on and off the sporting fields. Sport and the individual role models it presents are powerful determinants in child and adolescent development. Sporting heroes figure deeply in the lives of all the young and sporting incidents are key channels for communicating. As such, the nature of the conduct of those heroes and the character of those incidents are potent vehicles for transmitting formative ideas, values and attitudes. Ultimately they play a role in determining how the young relate to others and how they respond to circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> There is something special about the character of sports related violence. It is not removed from life, as is a cartoon or drama program. It is not an event which can appear to happen almost abstractly in another country or to other people, as it often appears on the news. Sporting violence penetrates deeply and personally into the lives of young. It is lived over and over again in repetitive conversations; it is mimicked on the sporting fields and in the schoolyards. As such, television networks have a profound responsibility to work cooperatively with sporting bodies to suppress the levels of violence which frequently puncture sporting events. Of course there will be problems and difficulties in achieving this. </PARA>
<PARA> Sport by its very nature is combative, aggressively physical, competitive and stressful. It is associated with great risks in esteem and safety, which are matched by great returns in victory and triumph. It is driven by emotion and always verging on chaos and loss of control. Consequently, the networks have a responsibility to promote vigorously fair play at the expense of hard play and the other more explicitly gratuitous acts of violence which erupt over the course of a competition. I just do not believe that networks are fulfilling their responsibilities in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> Clubs and players are under enormous commercial and TV network induced pressure to maintain high levels of excitement in the game. This pressure is added to by commentators who are forever glorifying and eulogising acts of violence and overtly rough play. Channel 7's Australian football league commentator, Don Scott, is renowned for this. He, like his Sydney based rugby league colleagues such as Rex Mossop, constantly equates good play with rough play and justifies unsettling the opposition and taking out key players as being intelligent tactics. In so doing, they create a sense that skill, control and excitement are secondary to direct physical confrontations. What lesson is this to the thousands upon thousands of young viewers? Is it a lesson that sporting prowess is expressed through violence?</PARA>
<PARA> That is a criticism of Channel 7. Channel 9 is no better. Its Sports Sunday program constantly promotes and packages violent sporting incidents from around the world: ice hockey violence, tragic racehorse falls, baseball brawls and potentially brain damaging knockouts in boxing. Channel 9 commentators endorse violence in sport by way of their amused style of presentation and their emphasis on pain and conflict as being entertaining. Hinch on Channel 7 is guilty of the same crime. On a weekly basis, the Hinch program packages an array of violent sports incidents and presents them to viewers in a jocular, amusing context. </PARA>
<PARA> The sports package called Sports Machine has as its commentator Mike Raymond, who provides a comic commentary-if it can be called that-on thuggery in Canadian ice hockey or in any other sports. The program frequently depicts graphic violent incidents on sports fields, and it does so in a childish context which makes one suspicious of the high moral integrity that the program, its producers and the presenter lay claim to. </PARA>
<PARA> The message from the networks that violence is part of sport is also conveyed by the insidious tendency of networks to replay violent incidents. Perhaps it is a generalisation to suggest that there is more violence in sport today than in the past, but broadcasting technology has certainly exposed the community to a greater amount of sports related violence than at any time in the past. Last year during the play-offs of the National Basketball Association, the coach of the Canberra Cannons headbutted an opposing player. It was repeatedly replayed in slow motion and became a centrepiece of the commentary from there on. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very disappointed indeed that our television networks do not regard the issue of televised sport and the violence so often contained in it more seriously because, after all, we do believe that there is no need to have a regulatory body presiding over matters such as this. There is a great deal of understandable community scepticism regarding the capacity of networks to balance their commercial interests with wider community obligations. The recommendations of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal that have been floated should be taken up as a matter of commonsense by the networks. To trade on violence in search of ratings and commercial success might serve the financial interests of the networks well, but in the long term it may well destroy the sports themselves. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) has pursued the issue of violence in sport and his concern that this aspect of violence on television has not been pursued by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. I will go to that issue later. I broadly endorse the remarks he has made, although I would question some of the criticisms and suggestions with respect to the value of sport to our society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been suggested that the most vulnerable group in respect of violence is children, but sometimes I believe that we underestimate children. It is important that we consider the way in which they view these things. I remember as a child hearing stories about dragons, ogres, witches and monsters. All of us have participated in sharing fairy tales, sometimes graphically gruesome in their carriage. But I do not think they are necessarily permanently damaging, because they are part of the normal fantasy life of a child. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed I might relate one or two of my experiences. I am interested in and occasionally watch Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I remember my daughter telling me the names of the various turtles. I asked, `Where do you think these names came from?'. She said, `Of course, they are Renaissance painters-Donatello, Michelangelo, et cetera'. From time to time I think we tend to underestimate the understanding of children and the way in which they view these things. </PARA>
<PARA> If one reads a story like The Hobbit and reads about the exploits of Gandalf and Bilgo Baggins, one reads about terrible dragons, goblins and monsters. These are all part of the upbringing that I am sure the honourable member for Gippsland had, as did many of us. It is not necessarily the case that children unrealistically view these sorts of programs. </PARA>
<PARA> I see that the report suggests that the most dangerous programs from the point of view of children are those of the style of Rambo, which shows indiscriminate killing and destruction in a way that none of us would endorse. It might also be suggested that a young child waiting for Sesame Street, which begins at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, has to endure the violence of Federal Parliament during Question Time. Perhaps this could be a damaging experience. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Gippsland made a number of points on sport. There are many examples in sport of gratuitous violence. This is not the sort of thing that should be condoned. Indeed sport administrators have a responsibility to very closely watch their codes and to try very hard to produce a game which is competitive and fair and in which the spirit of competition is one which does not allow violence to seep in. </PARA>
<PARA> But I think that to suggest that all of those things that we see in respect of sport on television are damaging is not accurate and in fact unfair. Many pleasing things can be said about the way in which sport is depicted on television. In this life we are separated from others in other lands. In Australia we are separated by various things. We are separated by geographical distances; by language from people in other countries; and by political and cultural views. </PARA>
<PARA> To some extent it is true to say that sport can be a very unifying influence and an important one in teaching us of the need for various characteristics if our society is to be successful. For instance, team sports and the image of watching a team succeed and play well together are important lessons in cooperation. Cooperation is one of the very important things that come out of that. </PARA>
<PARA> On the subject of children watching sport, we should be very concerned about violent activities which occur on the field in a gratuitous way. Certainly I believe the most pleasing aspect of watching sport is to observe those sports which contain a great deal of skill and which indicate by their activity that, indeed, this skill is not easily achieved; it is the result of a great deal of training and effort on the part of the participants. When that message is passed through sporting performances on television, it is very positive. What we need to do is make sure that those competitions that are depicted on television do not involve gratuitous and violent acts, and indeed all administrators are trying to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> But there is an aspect of sport which is real-and that is competition. I am sure that the honourable member for Gippsland agrees with me. I have found life to be very competitive. Indeed, in this House it is a competitive environment. That is not necessarily an aspect of our lives that should be removed from the purview of society. Indeed, it is an aspect which can provide people with a very good and positive example. It is not a difficult or bad thing; it is something that is real and it is part of the way in which all of us grow up and learn. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, I recently had the example of my young son sitting in front of the television watching a sporting program, a soccer program. He said to me, `You know, Dad, West Germany and East Germany used to be two separate countries, and now they're only one country', and I said, `Well, that's very interesting; how did you come to think about that, Jonathan?'. He said to me, `Well, just imagine what a good soccer team they're going to have now'. So, from that aspect, just the geographical lessons that can be learnt are important. But it indicates that children think beyond what may be depicted on the screen and, in fact, they have greater capacity than that for which we sometimes give them credit to see through things that occur on television. </PARA>
<PARA> One of my concerns about this is, of course, that voluntary codes have been tried in various ways to monitor the activity of organisations. Indeed, in respect of violence on television, a voluntary code is the way in which we think it is most appropriate to proceed. If we are going to have voluntary compliance in a case such as this, then it is necessary, of course, to have some scrutiny as to the success or otherwise of that voluntary code and the way in which it operates. I would hope that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal is able, in its deliberations, to scrutinise accurately what is done, and to apply to television programs appropriate criteria. </PARA>
<PARA> An example of the sorts of criteria that are important is: at the time when this program is shown, who is going to be watching? As was rightly pointed out by both the honourable member for Gippsland and the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), there are times when the audience is predominantly young children, and of course there are programs we would like not to be shown at those particular times. We also want to know whether or not the material that is being shown is centrally relevant-is this something that is necessary; do we really need to show this? Those are the sorts of questions that need to be asked. </PARA>
<PARA> The other question that needs to be asked, I think, is what can be the cumulative effect? That question needs to be asked because, if we watch television for two or three hours-and I think the statistics show that, generally, most Australians watch for three hours a night or some horrific figure like that-then there are cumulative and repetitive effects that can cause damage. So they are the sorts of criteria that need to be taken into account. Then, of course, we have the criteria concerning what actually, explicitly, is shown in particular programs. Of course there are prohibitions about the moment of death, dead bodies, and those sorts of restrictions which I think are generally understood and accepted. </PARA>
<PARA> I do believe that there is a broad community consensus about what things are acceptable, but we will always have an argument about censorship when we come to those things which are close to the border. For example, when we do an examination, if someone gets 50 per cent and someone else gets 49 per cent then the difference between passing and failing is very little-and there will always be a number of issues in respect of television where there will not be a consensus as to whether or not the particular behaviour depicted represents violent activity which should be excluded or an activity which is acceptable and real. </PARA>
<PARA> Determining those sorts of borders will be something that of course is particularly difficult. The sorts of criteria that we are going to apply to a current affairs program which is shown at 9.30 at night is different from the sorts of criteria we might be using for the news flash that occurs during the children's hour or the criteria that may apply at 7 o'clock. I think that those are the sorts of considerations that are important. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, of course, besides violence to humans, we need to consider activities which include animals. Indeed, we often see programs in which there are animals suffering in various ways. Sometimes there are lessons to be learned and these are important things to show; and examples of animals that have been injured as a result of an oil slick or whales washed up on the beach are cases in point. But there are other occasions when, of course, in various programs one sees violence towards animals which is an unacceptable thing and certainly something that we should be concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA> Another difficulty that we face when we look at violence is of course the cultural relativity-the difference that occurs between one culture and another. If we watch cops and robbers programs-and they are pretty popular and always have been since television has abounded in this country-then there seems to be a signi-ficant difference between the sorts of cops and robbers programs we see from the United Kingdom and those we see from the United States. Indeed, perhaps what we see there is a reflection of the society in which those programs are made. I think that it is important that we understand that those sorts of programs are things that create a mood and influence the way in which society develops. </PARA>
<PARA> My view has been for some time that the sorts of programs that emanate from the United States are infinitely less realistic and significantly more violent than those which we see from the United Kingdom. Perhaps that reflects the society in which those programs are made, because it is clear that two cities such as London and New York, although similar in size, are significantly different in respect of their crime rates and the ways in which their different police forces behave. What we see when we watch programs like that is indeed a reflection of the society in which they are made. The unreality of those sorts of programs is mind-boggling. Someone being hit on the jaw and then getting up and copping it again is very unreal, because anyone who understands a blow such as that would know that of course once one has been hit once like that one does not get up and carry on. Indeed, that unreality is something that is frightening and I believe very dangerous-in exactly the same way as are programs like Miami Vice, Rambo and Tour of Duty. Those programs engender an air of unreality which is dangerous and frightening. </PARA>
<PARA> If there were to be significant sanctions against such programs, I believe I would then find myself supporting that view, because it is true that unbalanced behaviour, unrealistic behaviour, is more likely to evoke violence in our society as a result of its explicit detail than many of the other things that we are concerned about. Some of the concerns about pornography, for instance, receive more attention but perhaps should not receive the same attention as that violent sort of behaviour. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was interested to see the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) rise to speak tonight. The earlier list of speakers showed that only a couple of Government members were interested in this topic; whereas I am amongst a significant number of Opposition members who have had their names down for some time to speak on this topic. It is of genuine concern to me, as I know it is to all the Opposition speakers who have been planning for some time now to speak on this subject.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Perth is certainly right about one thing, and that is the timeliness of our discussion on the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal report TV Violence in Australia, occurring two weeks after the initial televising of the proceedings of the House of Representatives. One could say that in many respects that ought to be R-rated-the `R' standing for rabble, because that is the impression viewers get when viewing Question Time in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> One could even describe the treatment by the Treasurer (Mr Keating)-there are others but he is pretty good at this-of the Australian people as an act of violence, and that is now portrayed live on television across the country. I cannot help but mention the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe), because whenever he answers a question he becomes almost physically violent. One would not want to get too close to him. Indeed, I wonder how the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) sometimes survives. One feels that somebody ought to rescue him and put him out of his misery. However, the topic really is much more serious than this. </PARA>
<PARA> The report was tabled by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) in May 1990. I believe it is a worthwhile contribution to the debate on this subject, which has now been going on for some time. The decision to initiate the inquiry arose out of a concern expressed at a Premiers Conference on gun control in December 1987. There are 13 significant recommendations as a result of the inquiry by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal that I believe are worthwhile. Evidence given to the Tribunal showed that a significant number of people are concerned about violence on television. </PARA>
<PARA> Interestingly, the evidence also showed that people do not know how to allay their concerns, whether for themselves or their children. Consequently, one of the significant recommendations deals with the conduct of an awareness campaign to inform the public about violence on television and specifically to offer advice on classifications of programs and program content. Apparently 60 per cent of people surveyed, which is a rather large number, had no knowledge of the current regulations in respect of violence on television and only about one-fifth were aware of what the classification system was about. The report also points to the need for strategies to be developed and implemented by the industry so as to improve understanding of the classification system and specifically that the industry should consider time zone promotion program guides and warnings. </PARA>
<PARA> The report takes the view that the answer to violence on Australian television is not censorship and that violence can best be held to socially acceptable levels on television by the industry itself through self-regulation. However, to be most effective a uniform approach by the commercial and public sectors of the industry is required. The most important and in fact the first recommendation of the report is that the industry be requested to draw up a uniform self-regulating code on the treatment of violence on television. This code would be used as a basis for the Tribunal interim television program standards and consolidate and strengthen the existing internal industry guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people may have doubts about whether a voluntary code will work. Perhaps some honourable members on both sides of the House may think that we should take even stronger steps, but I am prepared to take the view that we ought to give it a go. We would generally prefer to see self-regulation. Generally speaking, I believe that the Australian television industry has served Australians pretty well over the years and that reasonable standards have been maintained. I notice the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) in the chamber. With his interests he may find programs such as No. 96, Neighbours or Home and Away anything but intellectually stimulating. However, they are the daily diet of culture for a lot of people. Perhaps such programs do not reach the greatest intellectual heights, but in my judgment we have not done too badly. </PARA>
<PARA> As the report shows, it is ultimately the individual's responsibility to regulate his own and, more importantly, his children's viewing. I am pleased to note that the recommendations of the report are indeed far-reaching and that the Minister, in tabling the report, indicated that he fully supported all 13 recommendations. The industry is apparently now committed to drafting a uniform code, and I understand that it will shortly be available for public scrutiny. I hope that at that time the Minister will bring it into the Parliament for detailed examination and further debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Watching television has become a major Australian pastime. For many people it is their primary recreation; they get their daily exercise sitting in front of the television. Much research that I have seen over the years shows that both adults and children have in many respects become almost addicted to watching television. The downside is that there is plenty of evidence to show that children are watching television at the expense of reading books or engaging in more creative activities. </PARA>
<PARA> Generally speaking, I subscribe to the view that adults, within broad community standards, should be able to choose what they watch on television and, in doing so, be guided by classifications and, where necessary, specific content warnings. As a parent, however-and a number of parents have spoken in the debate-I am very concerned about what children watch on television and the effect that violence has on children. Since 1963 a lot research has been done in this area, and it is generally agreed in most of the research I have seen that at least in the short term violent television programs make children behave badly. The research is somewhat more ambivalent on effects on children in the longer term. </PARA>
<PARA> A significant piece of American research I came across showed that there was a quite high correlation between children who watched a great number of hours of television during elementary school years and aggressive behaviour as teen-agers. That was quite conclusive. There is no doubt that this issue of the effect of violence on children is a particularly complex one, and it is important that parents be extremely vigilant about what their children watch on television. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of guidelines available for parents, and perhaps I should place on record a couple that we found helpful with our younger children. Firstly, parents should watch at least one episode of the television program their children view. It is amazing what happens if children turn the television on and get inte-rested in a program. It is very good for parents to sit down and see what their children are digesting. Parents should be prepared to discuss with the child what motivated a character they have seen to commit a violent act. Of course, parents can encourage their children to watch programs that are positive in terms of demonstrating help, care and cooperation-the converse to the situation where children behave badly. Children can learn to imitate good behaviour and to behave in socially acceptable ways by watching the right sorts of television programs. So in that sense there is a very positive aspect to what children can learn from tele-vision. </PARA>
<PARA> Parents ultimately can and should ban programs for their children which are obviously violent or offensive in some way. There is an argument going around that children sooner or later are going to encounter the real world and are going to find that it is characterised by injustice, thoughtlessness and a desire to exact retribution- all of which can be described as violence. It seems to me that, on balance, parents are probably best advised to err on the safe side and be very selective about what they allow their children to watch on television. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is that children are often subjected to incidental violence on television. There has been quite a lot of discussion in this debate about that so far. Mention has been made of news broadcasts. From what I read, children do not really like watching the news. They do not choose to watch the news at night. But when it comes on at 6 o'clock it is on in most homes, around dinner time, and parents mostly like to watch it so kids are subjected to it. They are exposed in most news broadcasts to violence of some sort. Often the difficulty with violence in that context is that children are less likely to find that understandable because they do not see it in any particular context. From my understanding, the violence in the news is more dangerous than perhaps the violence in an understandable or explainable context. </PARA>
<PARA> I would hope that the code would pick this particular point up and perhaps a G rating should apply to the 6 o'clock news, whereas a more explicit news could be shown later in the evening and that would tend to overcome that sort of problem. It is very important that news is not censored in any way. Sometimes I think it is probably fair to say that violent images add very little and they could be kept for viewing later in the evening. </PARA>
<PARA> We have viewed evidence of violence and graphic real life scenes in the Gulf war. I suppose we have been exposed to them almost ad nauseam over the last few weeks. I found it important with my young children when they are seeing that on the news to put it in some sort of a context for them, otherwise I found that they were quite concerned that that war was happening down the street or in the backyard or something. I wanted to help them understand just exactly what was going on in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that children are not in any way as immune to shock and horror as are adults. Children feel very vulnerable and unprotected when they see explicit violence and suffering, particularly as they do on the news, often out of context. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>Children need to understand violence, know alternatives to expression and have an informed appreciation of how it should be viewed in conjunction with more positive pro social motivations and attitudes. </PARA>
<PARA>This highlights the importance of parental guidance and the need for individuals to exercise stricter control over the viewing habits of their children. </PARA>
<PARA> Another factor highlighted by the report in terms of children viewing violence incidentally is the advertising of violent movies within and immediately following family viewing programs. This is something that the code will obviously need to deal with. Of course, the introduction of appropriate time zones would mean that the advertising of violent movies would only be appropriate in those time zones. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite a lot has been said about cartoons. The research that I have read in this area probably indicates some ambivalence about the effect of cartoons on kids at least eight years old and above to recognise reality and unreality. The under eight-year-old group is still a very uncertain area. </PARA>
<PARA> I suppose a lot of us have been brought up with Popeye and Bugs Bunny and probably have not been terribly badly affected by it, although I think Noddy and Big Ears have since been banned for other reasons. Although I guess in this enlightened age for the same reasons they will probably be brought back before too long to show that we treat everybody equally. </PARA>
<PARA> However, as the honourable member for Perth said, we have gone beyond that. We live in the age of He Man and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Those particular characters in my view do exhibit extreme violence. Yet Ninja Turtles has become a favourite playground pastime for most younger kids. My own six-year-old boy has not taken it terribly seriously but he is giving his young sister a terrible time with all these Ninja Turtles kicks that they get up to. I suppose in a sense it has affected his behaviour somewhat. </PARA>
<PARA> When I look back to my own childhood I guess I saw Superman leaping off tall buildings. I do not think I ever attempted to do that. </PARA>

<PARA> I was not going to speak on this report because, quite frankly, I do not think it is all that significant. It is a nonsense to suggest that today's society is more violent than it has been in previous times. My mind goes to quite an old poem written by that most prolific of English poets, Anonymous.

<PARA>Violence is nothing new. Violence in the past has been far worse than it is today. However, we are entering a new era of authoritarianism, of puritanical actions and attitudes. We see this in some of the violent assaults on civil liberties that we get in this country. We have had this damn nonsense from the courts recently about the dangers of passive smoking. As a non-smoker I feel absolutely affronted at this assault on the civil liberties of other people. This is a violent action, in my view. </PARA>
<PARA> I have read in some detail books of the Old Testament. If one runs through Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers-there is a good one-Judges, Samuel, Kings and Chronicles, one will find them fraught with violence.

The reason that violence can be separated is that there is violence to which people relate and violence to which they do not relate. People who saw footage of the First World War and the bloody battles of Gallipoli and of France, where people got blown up and there was absolute mayhem, did not relate to that violence. They do not relate to violence when a bomb is dropped on Hiroshima. However, they do relate much more to personal violence. I think the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) raised a very pertinent point: it is in the nature of the culture, and if one does look at the cops and robbers on American television or American programs generally, one sees enormous personal violence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having not been immune from violence myself in the past, while it may be true that twice is he blessed whose cause is just, I can tell honourable members that thrice is he blessed who gets his blow in first. It is very hard to come back from that first punch. Yet repeatedly on television we see people get absolutely massacred and mauled beyond what any human body could endure, then get up and win. That creates in people's minds a view that the body is much stronger than it is. </PARA>
<PARA> I have seen a situation recently where a man stopped five close range slugs from a revolver and he then went on to conquer his assailant. But then he was an American policeman. I can tell you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that being the recipient of a bullet-I still have the bullet in my arm-I did not feel like getting up and fighting anyone. Indeed, I could not because I could not move my arm. It felt extremely dead and painful. I know from experience that the body does not tolerate the sort of violence that we see it continue to be subjected to on American television. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not see this violence to anything like the same degree on British television. I think the honourable member for Perth was right when he said that it was more realistic; it is much more realistic and in my view it is no less entertaining. I have asked the opinion of people who have watched the various programs. It seems to me a lot of the English programs have a big following because they are realistic and they are clever; they do not rely just on violence. </PARA>
<PARA> When it comes to Ninja turtles, I think it is absurd to suggest that society generally is going to relate to Ninja turtles and that they are going to be the cause of aggression or undue violence in teenagers. After all, the Ninja turtles are the goodies and there is far less fear and loathing raised in the minds of anyone, even children, when the goodies win. They are still animated characters, not people to whom we actually relate except in perhaps a very small minority of cases. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that we could find 100 psychologists who will tell us about the ill-effects of violence on television and how it should be curbed and banned. We could also find 100 psychologists who will tell us the opposite. That is the nature of psychology and it has to be taken with a large grain of salt. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the history of violence. I recall the national anthem we used to have. The second verse said something like, `Oh Lord our God arise, scatter our enemies and make them fall'. I would certainly say that is a call for violence, albeit from a high authority. That raises in people the view that violence is right in some circumstances and I have to say that I believe that is the case. We are being subjected to a lot of violence now on television from the war in the Middle East. That is horrendous violence. Abhorrent as that violence is, I am drawn to the inevitable conclusion that it must take place for the long term outcome. </PARA>
<PARA> I would support a self-monitoring of violence on television, but we should be realistic. This is far preferable to any sort of regulation and I am very worried about regulation. I see a lot of regulation as an assault on people's liberties. It would be much more effective to leave it to Customs to whack a solid tariff on American television because it is this American invasion, the cultural invasion on television, that brings the violence most people are concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA> The American culture is a much more violent culture than ours and I do not believe that it has created in America anything that we would want to emulate. It is true that the American culture is also a much more religious culture than ours. I ask myself sometimes whether religion and violence are not synonymous and interchangeable. It is true that nothing engenders as much passion, as much moral authority as religion. We see this today very much with the fundamentalist Islam, but no less do we see it with fundamentalist Christianity, particularly that emanating from the United States. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If necessary, I will spend an hour educating the honourable member for Gippsland. On the question of regulation, I do not think it is necessary to have regulations set too stringently. In my own family I have one child who is an avid television addict. He watches virtually everything; he can recite commercials virtually word for word. I see no evidence in him that he is unduly influenced by this violence. It is true that there may be a subliminal effect; there may be a compounding effect, but I somehow doubt it. I doubt whether he is going to be any the better or any the worse because of his exposure to this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We must make sure that self-regulation in television does not go down the Calvinist, puritanical road which Australia and a lot of other countries seem to be going down at the moment. As I said earlier in my speech, this to me is the greater violence-when we deny people their individuality, when we deny people basic rights or freedoms in the name of some common good or some perceived common good. I think that is an extremely dangerous course to take and one which we should certainly try to avoid. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to ask ourselves whether we want television to entertain us or to educate us. The answer to that is that in the main we want television to entertain us.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If anyone were to suggest to me that a film like Mad Max should be banned, I would say that perhaps it should be banned on other grounds, maybe on some sort of artistic merit. But that is the sort of violence that people in general do not relate to. The most dangerous and pernicious violence is that where individuals are assaulted by individuals, where we see violence in the family situation. That is the most pernicious and dangerous sort of violence on television-the violence where it shows that it is okay to punch up women and to kick people to the ground. That is the dangerous sort of violence, not the violence we see in a military situation, because people generally do not relate to it, and they see it as a thing apart.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This gets back to what I was saying earlier about the difference in artistic merit between British programming and American programming. I might also say that I have seen programming in Europe. I have seen some very good French programs which do not have this level of violence that is portrayed in the modern American programs. We have seen the nature of violence grow in American programs. Back in the old days of cowboys and Indians, there was a clear-cut distinction between right and wrong. To my recollection in those days the baddies conveniently wore the black hats, but there again it was tempered by the fact that justice prevailed in the end. Today's violence is much more muddy than that; we are receiving a much more convoluted message. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that if we are serious about violence and we want to do something about it then we should be looking to Australian programs to develop our own culture and to stop the spread of cheap American programs throughout the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Mr Deputy Speaker, I am going to make a couple of comments I really had not meant to make tonight. I just have to say that the contribution we have just heard from the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) is one of the best illustrations we will ever have as to why people should not speak for the sake of speaking. Secondly, something I learned many years ago in public speaking and debating is that one should never try to debate nonsense. I am about to break that second rule. The honourable member's speech was the stupidest speech I have heard in this place in a long time-and I make no apologies for saying that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is a serious subject. It was being pursued in a non-adversarial way, but we have just had adversaries put into it. One thing I will not live with and will not just let go over my shoulder is this nonsense about, `It is all the fault of American television'. I agree with the member for Kalgoorlie that the United States of America has a fundamentally more violent society than Australia has. The issue of violence and the subject of violence on television is that there are many Australians saying, `We do not want Australian television to go down that path'. I will deal specifically with the news and other items too. </PARA>
<PARA> I interjected at one stage when the honourable member opposite was off on a tangent and saying that we never see anything violent that is made in Australia. I said, `What about Mad Max?'. Then we had some other dissertation there. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly there is much in American television programs that reflects the violent nature of American society, but it is not confined to American television. The spurious solution the honourable member opposite came up with, in contrast to the recommendations in this report that we are debating tonight, that all we have to do is put a tax on American film, is really nonsense. He said that British films were okay. British cops and robbers films and television series can be the most grotesquely violent things we could ever watch. They will match anything we see. On occasions I have flipped on SBS without actually knowing what the program is-I am usually searching for something I want to watch, so I will flip by. One sees films on SBS, albeit only fleetingly, which are extremely violent. The honourable member's comments are just nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are debating is Australian television and what is shown on television here, whatever the source. Like many people, I really welcome this debate. I am delighted that we have this opportunity here in the House of Representatives tonight-no matter that it is a totally obscene hour of the night and no matter that the reasons we are debating at this hour of the night are totally unworthy of the subject. </PARA>
<PARA> For years, in my life as a parliamentarian, I have been concerned about and involved in the public arena with the subject of the portrayal of violence on television and in videos. This goes back well before my membership of this chamber, back to when I was in the Senate. I have found this to be a subject which stirs the greatest concern-deep, real concern-in the Australian public. But as deep as the concern about incidents of violence which may be shown on television is the concern that people have expressed about their powerlessness to do anything about it. That is really, surely, the issue of this report, and I hope not to run out of time before I can give my own views about where I think the report is deficient. I would like to make a couple of simple suggestions about how that deficiency might be overcome. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the years I have spoken with many people involved in the television industry, particularly the television news industry, about the subject of portraying violent scenes on television news. I remember being told by a spokesman for one of the channels in Queensland, my State, that it had surveyed audiences to find out what were the sorts of items on news programs which people most wanted to see. I will share a little bit of that with honourable members. </PARA>
<PARA> The No. 1 item was so-called medical stories. People liked news stories about breakthroughs in treatments of disease, particularly the sort of disease that strikes a common chord of fear, like cancer, heart disease or something like that. That was the No. 1 choice of people. No. 2 was stories of trauma-that is, violence. That could be the trauma of a road accident or the trauma of crime. </PARA>
<PARA> People were being asked what they liked, but what was not asked was what they did not like. So it could well have been that when the television channel found out that the No. 2 choice amongst the people they were talking to was stories of trauma, if it had asked exactly the same people what were the things they did not like, it would have got a bigger percentage who did not like stories of trauma. </PARA>
<PARA> The television industry has been very dishonest about this subject over the years. It is only of late that we are starting to get data coming out from reputable sources which is showing the sorts of things being talked about in this debate, which I do not intend to canvass. There is resistance to certain matters. But television executives and news editors for years have been holding up the sorts of statistics I have just referred to and saying, `This is what people want, we cannot censor it. It is news, it has happened and people want to watch it'. They have been very dishonest. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to come back to that because I wish to make a very particular reference to the Seven Network in Australia and to mention some of the positive things it has been attempting to do, at the expense of its ratings on occasions, in this area. I think it should get credit for it. The overwhelming, principal concern on the subject of television violence is that there are violent scenes in news and current affairs being shown at a time when children are likely to be watching. But it is not only children we should be concerned about. Unlike what some other speakers have said, that children are unwilling watchers of television, I have had parents say to me children come home from school saying their teachers have said they have to watch the news for a particular reason, or they want the children to watch the news for certain educational reasons. Parents, being conscientious, and in trying to accede to the teacher's request-or maybe feeling, quite independent of school, that it is something they want their children to become conditioned to as an interest in what happens in the world- find their children exposed to the most awful trauma. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, not only are children affected by news violence. This is the issue I wish to pose to the House and also to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. Surely, is the issue not what we as Australians want to set as public standards? Should not our television news in particular, but not only our television news, reflect that?</PARA>
<PARA> In the last decade we have been seeing increasingly on television scenes of grief and trauma which to me are an offence to a sense of human decency. This report refers to the Hoddle Street massacre in particular, and credit has been given to a meeting of Attorneys-General. I say it is to the shame of a lot of people that it took the Hoddle Street massacre and a meeting of the Attorneys-General concerned about gun laws to get this going, because thousands of Australians have been crying out about it for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA> This nauseous habit of television journalists going to a recently bereaved parent or spouse-a child or a spouse may have been murdered-and shoving a television camera in that person's face and a microphone up the nostril, and asking, `Well, how do you feel about your daughter having been raped, strangled and thrown in a ditch?', to which mum says, `I really feel dreadful' is just horrendous. It makes one want to be ill. </PARA>
<PARA> I think those of us in public life who have had the experience of television know that there is something about it that is implicitly intimidating. I am not saying the journalists mean to be intimidating, but people do feel a bit intimidated, instinctively, by the approach of a television camera. The average John and Mary Citizen, who never dreamed they would ever face one, are just completely overwhelmed by it. It is not enough to say people can decline to answer. People who are traumatised are numbed; they are defenceless; their senses are suspended; and they should not be asked. It is an offence against human dignity. </PARA>
<PARA> The very worst incident of this I ever saw on television was quite by accident when I was in a motel in Melbourne with a committee inquiry early in 1988. I cannot say which channel it was-I wish I could. I wish I could have screamed from the house tops! I was so horrified when I saw this incident I turned the television off and walked out of the room. </PARA>
<PARA> A little three-year-old boy went missing in Adelaide at 8 o'clock at night. His body was discovered later in the evening in the driveway of a home approximately one kilometre from his house. He had been riding his tricycle on the footpath outside his home after dinner. The police had had a report of the missing child from the father. The police went to get the father to bring him to see the body of the little boy, who had been sexually molested and strangled, so that he could identify his son. Somehow, a television channel found that a child's body had been found. The camera crew was there before the father. Here on the six o'clock news we saw the father cross the street, be shown the body, and we heard his screams. I have never forgotten. As I said, I instinctively turned off the television and walked out of the room. If anybody can justify putting that on television at any time of the night, I want to hear the justification. </PARA>
<PARA> Because my time is running out I want to refer to what had been, up until that stage, the worst thing I had seen either on television news or in the print media. I am going to talk about the Challenger disaster very briefly. At 7 o'clock one morning I heard on radio news that the Challenger had exploded on take-off. My instant feeling was one of horror. In those days Challenger blast-offs were broadcast live on television. I thought, `My God, that girl's parents will have seen that on television'. I went and turned on the television because that is the best source of news under those circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only did her parents see it-they were there and saw it live; they saw their daughter being incinerated. And we saw their reaction. The smart television cameraman instantly thought, `Ah, the girl's parents' and whizzed the camera on to them. We saw, first, the look of disbelief and then the grief and horror as her mother and father realised that that ball of flame was their daughter dying. I watched television until President Reagan came on at 11 o'clock that morning. That shot of the explosion and the girl's parents was shown over and over again. </PARA>
<PARA> I thought that I could not see anything worse, until I opened the Courier-Mail the next day, which went one better. Next to a picture of the explosion there was a close-up of the girl's sister, screaming hysterically. That is just about as low as it is possible to go. That is what we are told is news. That is what we are told we ought to accept. The final thing I want to say about that is that for two nights on the news, whenever the newsreader referred to the Challenger disaster and the inquiries that were being established, the picture in the background was the explosion. So 48 hours afterwards we were still looking at a picture of five people being incinerated. Absolutely unnecessary. Totally unnecessary. I just wish we could have a few more debates like this, and I wish that it had not taken the Hoddle Street massacre to bring it on. </PARA>
<PARA> Very quickly, I will refer now to the gratuitous violence that is shown. This is my last example. There was a case in America of a felon being chased by police. Television news crews got in a helicopter and followed the police chase. The felon's car crashed. He was armed. He leapt out of the car. The police shot him dead, on camera. We saw this in Australia. What did it have to do with us? It was some dinky town in America I do not think I had ever heard of, but Australian television was showing it. Let us not blame the Americans; blame the Australian news editors and the Australian programmers. </PARA>
<PARA> I am nearly out of time so I will have to be very brief, but I want to pay tribute to the Seven Network in Australia, which years ago set a code for what it would show. Channel 7 has come second to Channel 9 in news ratings by and large over the years, but Channel 7 has not deviated from its code. In my experience, Channel 9 has shown no taste at all on the subject of personal trauma, violence, tragedy, offence to human decency and all the things that we would want to have as Australian standards. I hope that not only does the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal have a say but also that consumers will be empowered to make their complaints from now on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I enter this debate to place on record my hope that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal report on TV violence in Australia presented to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) will result in initiatives within the television industry specifically. I realise that when one thinks about initiatives and is dealing with a subject such as this, one really has two choices: the choice of introducing deterrents to those people who continue to portray violence on television-violence at those times when children tend to watch television; or the choice of incentives-incentives for the industry and, I think, for the parents to think through the present and look to a different future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I personally opt for the choice of incentives. I hope that as honourable members carefully consider the report, the recommendations and the evidence that have been presented to this House, we will argue for incentives that will in fact impact positively on our own television industry. I am not talking about the industry presenting programs on the channels, but that part of the industry that produces the programs. I see a real difficulty here. I take up the cudgels for those who make films in that there is no real incentive today for them to spend their time and their money producing better quality films, films that are different in their emphasis-an emphasis that comes back to the family and the children-and which come within the G classification. </PARA>
<PARA> If it comes to dollars, it is far easier to get someone to smack another person in the mouth than it is to come up with a script that is family oriented or to really spend the money to ensure that the documentary that is produced will be educational in its purpose. So I think there is a real challenge to our Parliament to ensure we do not leave all the effort that has been put into this report as just a report. There is a real challenge to ensure that something good comes out of it. </PARA>
<PARA> I note many of the recommendations and am impressed by them. However, I want to go to a couple of issues-it is impossible in the 15 minutes members have to canvass every aspect. I want to refer to that emphasis which I believe needs to be given to public awareness. It is stressed in the report that most people do not know the current regulations. Most people do not understand the current classifications. Yet, the report also says that most people are concerned. It stated that the large percentage of people interviewed were concerned about the predominance of violence in films that are available to them and their children. The report also stresses that these people do not know what to do. I think that leads us to one of the important tasks of the Parliament and the government of the day, which is ensuring that we come to grips with this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> It was said to me some time back, when a mother was accused of abusing her child, that we really should not blame her because she knew no better; that she had been abused and her mother before her had been abused. Sometimes I think we take parenthood for granted; we believe that parenthood and parental responsibility somehow just happen, although we teach and try to inculcate into people many other skills. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe this report is saying to us that it does not just happen. There is a need for people out in the community not only to be aware of the effects of violence on their children but also to come to some solutions as to what they themselves can do about it. It is very easy to say that, but it will also come back to a question of alternatives. It is easy to say to parents `You should not be letting your children watch a particular film or program', but when one goes through the television guide one finds that there is not a lot else that children can watch. </PARA>
<PARA> Many other speakers have stressed the violence content of news. The report argues at length about the violent impact that some cartoons can have-although I have some differing views about that. We need to ensure in the first instance that there is an alternative, and that comes back to my original point. We need to provide an incentive to the producers in this country who are prepared to produce family films. If this means going to a tax situation of 150 per cent-a discriminating tax situation-whereby if a person produces particular types of films he or she obtains particular tax gains, I think we ought to put that on the agenda as a matter for consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> I applaud the emphasis the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and a number of commercial channels are now giving to environment-related documentaries. They are tending to develop pro-nature segments in their program agendas. But that is expensive and people also want to watch the movie; they want to watch serials and a variety of other things. They will not sit down and watch programs about nature night after night. They will turn to the video, which is a point I want to raise later in my remarks because I believe it is related, even though it is not a part of this report. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that we need some incentives. We need some incentives for the film producer, and I am raising the possibility of a tax incentive. There could also be deterrents for those who continue to produce the rubbish that often appears on our television screens. It is suggested that under the present regulations there is always the threat of loss of licence, but I would rather that we opted for better programs and that we tried to give those incentives. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, upon notice, on 20 December 1990:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Did he or the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade at any time as a consequence of the Government's decision to phase out the subsidised overseas students program and introduce a full fee/scholarship program for overseas students in tertiary institutions make a statement, either privately or in public, to the effect that the loss of revenue to higher education institutions arising from the phasing out of the subsidised program would be fully offset by direct revenue accruing from new scholarship places so that the change would have a revenue neutral impact on the tertiary education sector; if such assurances were made, (a) when were they made, (b) how were they made and (c) to whom.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Will the higher education sector suffer any loss in revenue as a consequence of the Government's decision to phase out the subsidised overseas students program and introduce a full fee/scholarship; if so, what will that loss be in (a) 1990, (b) 1991, (c) 1992 and (d) 1993.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (a) (b) (c) The change in overseas student policy was announced in a joint public statement issued by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and myself on 18 December 1988. In that statement we pointed out that the institutions themselves would benefit from the abolition of the subsidised program which would no longer attract students away from the full fee program. In addition, losses to revenue arising from the phasing out of the existing subsidised system would be offset by direct revenue accruing from the new scholarship places.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) (b) (c) (d) The system wide reductions to institutions operating grants were based on estimates of numbers of scholarships and course costs. Due to constraints in the aid budget and less than expected average course costs the estimated income to institutions was not sufficient to fully offset the reduction to operating grants in 1990, and is expected to have a similar result in 1991 and 1992. This matter was addressed by the Government in July 1990 and it was agreed that any shortfall between the increase in full fee scholarship income and the reduction in operating grants should not exceed $4 million in each of the 1991-1992 calendar years. The exact shortfall for 1990 is still being determined in consultation with AVCC and this may impact on future years, hence it would not be appropriate to provide figures at this stage. It should be noted that any shortfall arising from the less than expected income through Commonwealth full fee scholarships has more than been offset by the income from full fee places (approximately $65 million in 1990) which arose from the removal of quotas.</PARA>
