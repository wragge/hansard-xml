I do not want to prolong the proceedings now, but I do wish to place on record the strongest possible protest by the Opposition that, as far as we are aware, there will not be an opportunity for questions to be directed to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) or Ministers during these two days of sittings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) proposed to the Prime Minister that, following the Prime Minister's address when he moves the motion and the address by the Leader of the Opposition, there should be a break in the debate to allow for questions to be asked of the Prime Minister and Ministers and also that there should be a Question Time tomorrow. It is unusual, to say the least, that the House should sit and there not be an opportunity for questions to be raised of the Prime Minister and Ministers, particularly in such grave circumstances, and that members should be denied this opportunity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition supports the Government's move to allow the proceedings of this House to be televised today and tomorrow. The involvement of the nation in war is the gravest step that a government can take and it is appropriate, to say the least, for the Parliament to discuss the situation in the Gulf and for the Australian people to be able to witness the parliamentary statements of the party leaders and members as they are made. Parliament is the central core of our democracy and it is important for the people to know what is discussed here. We hope that the Government's decision to allow proceedings to be televised today and tomorrow will be extended to all sittings of the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We on this side of the House have been calling for the televising of proceedings for some time, and the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) indicated at the close of the last sittings that the Government is prepared to countenance it. I hope that today sets a precedent for the opening up of this chamber and greater access to it by the public of Australia, and I urge the Government to permit the televising of all proceedings of the House when Parliament resumes on 12 February. </PARA>
<PARA> The guidelines that will apply, I understand, are similar, if not identical, to the guidelines that apply in the Senate. When the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) first discussed the possibility of the proceedings of the House of Representatives being televised, the guidelines that were proposed were somewhat more restrictive. I hope that, as well as setting a precedent for the opening up of Parliament by televising the proceedings, we are setting a precedent for the guidelines. The guidelines that should apply for the trial period of televising the House of Representatives should be no more restrictive than those that apply in the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That this House-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) reaffirms its support for an on-going role for the United Nations in promoting world peace and the selfdetermination of nations and in particular the resolutions of the Security Council directed to end the aggression of Iraq against Kuwait;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) affirms its support for Australia's positive response to the request made by the United Nations Security Council in Resolution 678 for support in implementing that Resolution;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) expresses its full confidence in, and support for, Australian forces serving with the UN-sanctioned multi-national forces in the Gulf;</PARA>
<PARA> (4) deplores Iraq's widening of the conflict by its unprovoked attack upon Israel; and</PARA>
<PARA> (5) recognises, as those with whom we are acting now in the Gulf have recognised, the need to intensify efforts to establish peace and stability in the Middle East, including a just resolution of the Palestinian issue and the continuing security of Israel, once the crisis in the Gulf is resolved. </PARA>
<PARA>On 2 August 1990, Iraq's armed forces assaulted, seized and subjugated Kuwait. Now, with the authority of the United Nations (UN), and only after Iraq had made it clear that it would defy the United Nations by remaining in Kuwait, Australia has joined a great coalition of nations in a military commitment to defeat that invasion and to restore Kuwait's sovereignty and independence. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision to commit Australian armed forces to combat is of course one that constitutionally is the prerogative of the Executive. It is fitting, however, that I place on parliamentary record the train of events behind this decision. On 4 December I informed the House that, following a decision of Cabinet, Australia was prepared to provide forces to participate in operations under United Nations Security Council resolution 678, should that become necessary. On 17 January, after consulting senior Ministers, I gave effect to that decision by authorising our naval task force in the Gulf to participate in such operations. I then formally notified the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Governor-General of the Government's action. </PARA>
<PARA> I subsequently requested you, Mr Speaker, and the President of the Senate, to recall Parliament so that I can report to the Parliament and to the nation on this grave issue, and so that members of parliament can have the opportunity to express their views. </PARA>
<PARA> The passage of this motion will solemnly and forcefully underline-to Iraq, to the United Nations, to our partners in the multinational force, and to our fellow Australians serving in the Gulf-the strength of Australia's support for our armed forces there and for the role to which they have been committed under the authority of the United Nations. This is the most serious step any government can take, just as, indeed, war is the most serious action on which any nation can embark. </PARA>
<PARA> In this turbulent century Australians, like many others, have endured severe trials of war and have made tremendous sacrifices to enjoy the fruits of peace. The last few days of fighting in the Middle East have served to remind us once more what a terrible price is paid when nations embark on war. And we must be prepared for worse. </PARA>
<PARA> The protests within Australia over recent days have reminded us, too, how deeply felt are the emotions aroused by any military commitment such as this. Let me assure every member of this House, and every Australian, that this Government is deeply concerned to see that this conflict is ended as soon as possible. Every decision and action we have taken since 2 August was aimed at preventing this war in the only way it could have been prevented-by upholding the United Nations resolutions for the unconditional withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> Every member of this Government-not least this Prime Minister-shares, with the overwhelming majority of the Australian people, the sense of sadness, compassion and sorrow for all the victims of this war, not least for the Iraqi people, who have been hurled into this tragedy by a dictator. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been few wars-perhaps none in history-which have been debated so intensely and widely before the actual outbreak. In Australia there has been, as there should have been, the most intensive and comprehensive public debate. This is the third occasion on which the Government has initiated formal debate in this House. On this third occasion, it is of vital importance for us as members of parliament to ensure that our constituents, the people of Australia, understand clearly why this war has come about, why this allied military response has become necessary, why the decision to commit Australian forces was a proper and a just one, and what the goals are for which we are now fighting. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians should be willing to commit our forces to combat only in the highest cause, and only as a last resort. This Government believes, most fervently, that the cause which our forces now serve does embody nothing less than our highest aspirations and interests and that we have committed our forces to combat only as a last resort. Mr Speaker, those will be my themes today. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision to commit Australian forces to this war in the Gulf is without historical precedent. Never has Australian military action been undertaken with such global consent and within such a broad alliance. We stand with a coalition of nations the like of which, in its diversity, strength and authority, has never before been assembled. Never have the nations of the world acted in such overwhelming concert to condemn and to reverse an action as they have in these last few months condemned and acted to reverse Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> One hundred and forty-four nations in the United Nations General Assembly have condemned Iraq's invasion. About 40 nations have agreed to provide or to help to sustain military forces deployed in the Gulf to uphold the United Nations position-North Atlantic Treaty Organisation nations, former Soviet bloc nations, Arab nations, Muslim nations, Pacific nations; nations from every continent have provided troops, ships, aircraft, medical teams, supplies and money. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of this coalition are now conducting military action with the highest authority that the international community can bestow-the authority of the United Nations Security Council, given in resolution 678. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason this unprecedented coalition has come into existence is to achieve and preserve three interests of truly global importance. Each of these three interests is of tangible importance to each of the members of the coalition of nations, including Australia, and none of the three can be achieved without first achieving, as the essential precondition, the withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, these are indeed stakes worth fighting for-by peaceful means, if possible, but by force of arms, if necessary. First, we seek to establish the conditions for peace and stability in the critical region of the Middle East. There can be no security in the Middle East while Iraq remains in occupation of Kuwait or continues to threaten the whole region. And, as this proposed parliamentary resolution acknowledges, it can be only after the current crisis is resolved that we can-as we must-intensify our efforts to establish peace and stability in the region, including through convening an international conference as part of this objective. As all honourable members know, we have supported the concept of an international conference before this conflict erupted. We continue to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Second, we seek to prevent the catastrophic distortion and disruption of the international economy that would result from Saddam Hussein being placed to pursue his goal of domination of the world oil market. This can be done only by restoring Kuwait's sovereignty. </PARA>
<PARA> And let me nail that easy but mindless catchcry `no blood for oil'-as though we could somehow wish away the strategic, the utterly vital, nature of oil to our daily life, to the prosperity of our nation, and to the economic health of the world. The one who is shedding blood for oil is Saddam, who has shed the blood of so many Kuwaiti people on the altar of his ambitions, as he did for eight years the blood of his own and the Iranian people, for the same purpose. It is he who seeks to dominate the oil market, and it would be he who would exact for it not only an economic but also a political and a strategic price. </PARA>
<PARA> Third, beyond even these vital interests, we seek to achieve the promise of a more free, more peaceful and more prosperous world order in which the goals of the Charter of the United Nations can at last be fulfilled-the promise that, until Iraq invaded Kuwait, was so tantalisingly within our reach now that we have put behind us the draining rivalry of the Cold War. </PARA>
<PARA> The history of civilisation is in large part about the attempt of humankind to move from the law of the jungle, where blood and might prevail, to the rule of free men and women by just law. It is a tragic truth, however, that our century has known more of the jungle than of justice: two world wars and tens of millions dead; countless smaller wars; and the development of weapons of mass destruction-chemical, biological and nuclear. The League of Nations collapsed, and for many years the United Nations was emasculated by great power contention, thereby denying the world, especially smaller nations like Australia, the prospect of a just system of collective security. </PARA>
<PARA> The last few years, however, have seen a dramatic turnaround. The Cold War has ended. The prospect of global nuclear holocaust has significantly diminished. Despite the current problems within the Soviet Union, we must hope, and work towards ensuring, that there will be no return to the superpower confrontation of the past. </PARA>
<PARA> We have entered a new global environment where the possibility of effective United Nations response to conflict or aggression has been growing ever stronger. The United Nations, in which the great powers now cooperate, has helped or is helping to bring peace in Namibia, Afghanistan, between Iran and Iraq itself, and potentially to Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA> Saddam Hussein's special guilt lies in his defiance of the United Nations and his attempt to return to the era of unpunished aggression. </PARA>
<PARA> And our special responsibility is to try once more, but this time with real hope in our hearts, for an effective international system against aggression, a system in which all countries, great and small, play a part. If we fail in this obligation, in this the first test of the new international order after the Cold War, the consequences for our medium and long term security and for that of many other countries are deeply disturbing. </PARA>
<PARA> For those who say that this international system, centred on the United Nations Charter, is a system which rejects the use of force, I say they have not read the Charter-or if they have, they choose now, conveniently, to ignore it. The centrepiece of the United Nations Charter, as established in the 1940s, was the collective use of force in extreme cases where no other way was left to punish and defeat aggression. This should be utterly unsurprising. The United Nations was, after all, founded by men and women who had just lived through a global slaughter the like of which had never been seen before. They knew why this slaughter had happened. It happened because men and women of decency, compassion, and hope had turned their eyes away from the great evil which had arisen in their time. They hoped it could be reasoned with, placated; it could not. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems that each generation has to learn anew the same hard truth-that peace without justice is a dangerous charade-but that peace with justice is not given free of charge, but sometimes demands a high and terrible price. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said to the people of Australia on Thursday, Mr Speaker:</PARA>
<PARA>We all of us wish for peace. But we cannot have peace just by wishing for it or just by talking about it; we have to work for it, and sometimes, tragically, we have to fight for it. The great lesson of this century is that peace is bought at too high a price, if that price is the appeasement of aggression. </PARA>
<PARA>Do any of us believe that, if allowed to go unchecked, Saddam would have been content with Kuwait? Does anyone believe he would not have sought to master Saudi Arabia and the other Gulf States, and manipulate his control over the world's oil supply, to the massive detriment not only of developed countries like Australia but developing countries, and the newly-emerging democracies of eastern Europe? Does anyone doubt that he would have used, once more, his chemical weapons-against his own people, as he has already done, or against his neighbours? Who doubts he would have continued to develop and then perhaps use biological and nuclear weapons?</PARA>
<PARA> These concerns are not merely our speculations-they reflect his actions in the past and in many cases his explicit threats for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a leader who, after his eight-year war with Iran, has attacked, without provocation, two countries in the last six months: Kuwait, and, only in the last few days, Israel. This is a man who has brutalised his own people and the people of Kuwait, and who was prepared to take innocent hostages, including Australians, and use them as human shields. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a self-proclaimed leader of the Arab people who has killed Arabs and crushed an Arab nation. He did not, as he later claimed, invade Kuwait for the sake of the Palestinians. Indeed, his exploitation of the Palestinian cause was for the most callous and transparent of reasons-to help him satisfy his own greed and territorial ambitions. </PARA>
<PARA> I am confident that the majority of the Australian people understand and accept the reason why this war has come about and why Australia has become involved. </PARA>
<PARA> An incident having occurred in the gallery-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! The Prime Minister might resume his seat. Order! Those people in the galleries who are interjecting should not do so. One of the prime objectives of this Parliament is to preserve your right to freedom of speech, but one of your obligations is to make sure that this Parliament can operate and the Prime Minister and other members should be able to speak and be heard.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe the majority of Australians recognise the magnitude of Iraq's challenge to the world community and the importance of our campaign to meet and overcome that challenge. But there are, of course, some voices raised in protest against the war and against our involvement. I do not in any way question the right of those voices to be heard; vocal protest is a proud part of Australia's democratic heritage. But I do most profoundly disagree with what those voices are saying today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Here in this Parliament, with logic and patience, let those criticisms be answered. For it is vitally important, as we embark on a military endeavour that may not be short or simple, that every Australian understand the facts-not the slogans or dogmas, but facts-on which the Government's position is based. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard some say that this alliance serves only to promote the interests of the United States. But, truly, it serves the interests of the United Nations and of each of its members, including of course the United States, who rightly demand the freedom of collective security and individual sovereignty. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard others say that this is purely an Arab problem requiring an Arab solution. But the solution chosen by Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Syria and the Gulf states, including Kuwait itself, is clear: it is to seek the support of the United Nations and to participate in the multinational force against Iraq.</PARA>
<PARA> We have heard others still who oppose this war and this Australian involvement because they opposed the Vietnam war and Australia's involvement in it. To them I say: do not debase the principled opposition that was voiced to the war in Vietnam; and do not demean the motives of those who opposed it. </PARA>
<PARA> Today we face a conflict of an utterly different kind. None of the great principles at stake in the Gulf-the principles I have outlined in this Parliament today and previously-was at stake in Vietnam. And none of the principles on which we based our opposition to the Vietnam war applies to the Gulf today. </PARA>
<PARA> Most significantly, on this occasion as distinct from then, the processes which sought first to avoid conflict and which now mandate this action are the processes of the United Nations. May I say, Mr Speaker, that I have appreciated the bipartisan support that has been given to the Government at this time by the Opposition-and I take this opportunity to thank Opposition members for it. They will therefore understand the sense in which I make this point: my Party disagreed with Australian involvement in Vietnam-that is a clear matter of record which needs no elaboration here-but my Government will not be dissuaded from taking what is the right decision today by the invocation of that decision of 25 years ago. It is irrelevant, and massively irrelevant. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, there is one issue on which all Australians of goodwill must stand united at this time. We should all condemn-without qualification-any harassment, abuse or discrimination directed against Arabic and Muslim Australians. The suggestion that the entirely understandable concern of these people for their relatives, friends and former homelands constitutes some kind of disloyalty to Australia is a perverse and utterly distasteful one to me and to this Government and, I am sure, to the Opposition-particularly so since, in the words of so many Arab Australians, they enjoy and value their new life in this country precisely because Australia is a land of peace, civil liberties and religious tolerance. </PARA>
<PARA> I am aware that there are many in the community who may well accept all that I have said so far but who still feel disquiet on the grounds of timing-who judge that the allied military response is premature. Let me remind these people that this war did not begin on 17 January 1991. This war is not four days old. It began on 2 August last year, when Iraq invaded Kuwait. It is a war now in its sixth month. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a war that has been fought against the innocent people of Kuwait, in flagrant defiance of world opinion. It has been a war of ruthless suppression of Kuwaiti resistance fighters. It has been a war of systematic and premeditated plunder of Kuwait's assets by its greedy neighbour. It has been a war that has forced hundreds of thousands of Kuwaiti and foreign nationals out of their rightful homes. And it has been a war, as Amnesty International reported on 19 December, in which the human rights of those who remain in Kuwait have been repeatedly and awfully violated, including through detention, torture, rape and summary executions. </PARA>
<PARA> In this war an allied military response began on only 17 January and none of the destruction that has been caused to Iraq's military capabilities in the allied bombing since then would have been necessary-none of it-had Saddam simply brought a halt to this war by complying with the United Nations and withdrawing his forces unconditionally from Kuwait. He can still bring a halt to this war by such compliance and withdrawal. We continue to hope he will do so. </PARA>
<PARA> So, Mr Speaker, let it be clearly understood that we-the allied nations-did not initiate this war; we did not want this war. We sought to resolve this conflict by diplomacy and not by force. But let it be equally clear why diplomacy could not prevent this war. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout the 5 1/2 months since it invaded Kuwait, Iraq has ignored or rejected every international initiative aimed at resolving the crisis by peaceful means. The United Nations Security Council has, since the invasion, passed twelve resolutions on the issue. The message and the extent of its international support could not have been made clearer to Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, six weeks ago the United Nations authorised the use of military force, if that should prove necessary, to compel Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. The Security Council gave Iraq until 15 January-`as a pause of goodwill'-to withdraw of its own free will. Those six weeks passed. Iraq did not withdraw its forces from Kuwait. It showed no willingness even to consider withdrawing those forces. It refused the very generous proposals put forward by the United Nations Secretary-General as late as last week. </PARA>
<PARA> Over those weeks the nations supporting the United Nations made it clear that they were resolved, if there was no alternative, to liberate Kuwait by force in accordance with the United Nations' resolutions. Iraq's Government was under no illusions about that resolve. It knew it had only two choices: to withdraw peacefully or be expelled by force. </PARA>
<PARA> Over that same period Iraq's Government made it more and more clear that it had no intention of withdrawing from Kuwait. Saddam Hussein talked about negotiation, but he never talked about concession. Nothing he said suggested that Iraq would ever relinquish Kuwait. Everything he did made it clear that he intended to hold Kuwait forever. Because that has been Saddam Hussein's decision the rest of the world has faced a choice equally stark and equally tragic. We must either accept Iraq's seizure of Kuwait or fight to reverse it. There is now no other way. The world has agreed that Iraq's seizure of Kuwait cannot be allowed to stand. </PARA>
<PARA> The United Nations has demanded that Iraq should withdraw because the invasion of Kuwait, the destruction of its state, the slaughter of its people and the plundering of its wealth are contrary to every principle upon which the United Nations was built and upon which peace depends. The United Nations has demanded that Iraq withdraw unconditionally because the nations of the world recognise that making concessions to aggressors is like making concessions to terrorists: it makes the world more dangerous for everyone. </PARA>
<PARA> The United Nations has agreed that by giving concessions to the invader of Kuwait we give away the principles upon which the United Nations was founded. Those principles are not airy abstractions; they are the laws that make the world safe for all of us. It cost the world the Second World War to establish those principles; they are too precious and too important to be bargained away to save Saddam Hussein's face. They are important enough to fight for. </PARA>
<PARA> The United Nations has decided that after five long months there is now no other way. The overwhelming condemnation of the world community has been ignored. Stringent economic sanctions have been toughly enforced, but no-one can say when, if ever, the damage to Iraq's economy and the suffering of its people will bring Saddam Hussein to his senses. And he has been quite unmoved by the threat of war. So now we must fight. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, at this moment of crisis let us pay tribute to the courage and skill of our fellow Australians who serve aboard the Brisbane, the Sydney and the Success. They do us proud. They know the importance of the task we have asked them to perform. We know that, whatever the danger, they will perform that task as well as it can be done. We want them to know, and we want their families and loved ones to know, that we will bring them home as soon as possible when the job is done. </PARA>
<PARA> But let us ask the question in its most basic form: why should Australia, here in the southern oceans, send its young men and women to fight thousands of kilometres from our shores? If I may borrow from Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, `Why should we be concerned with a far away country of which we know little?' They were the words of Neville Chamberlain, his description of Czechoslovakia as he consigned it to destruction in 1938. The answer, of course, lies in that very event: the fatal appeasement of Hitler. </PARA>
<PARA> The Czechoslovakians know something of life under a tyranny, having emerged from the Nazi scourge only to come under the rule of totalitarian communism. So it was truly significant to hear that the new democratically elected Government of Czechoslovakia expressed on 17 January its full support for the Gulf action. Earlier, President Vaclav Havel had said that no price is too high where aggression is concerned. And, of course, there is a special force, as well as poignancy, in that statement from President Havel. Czechoslovakia symbolises not only our terrible failures of the 1930s but also our great hopes for the 1990s and beyond. And that is why his words are both a statement and a symbol of why this allied military campaign is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Czechoslovakia, invaded by a neighbour and abandoned by the rest of the world in 1938, knows how important it is that Kuwait, invaded by its neighbour, not be abandoned by the rest of the world in 1991. It knows it and, with the overthrow of the tyrannies of eastern Europe, it can express it and, moreover, can do something about it. Today, Czechoslovakian chemical decontamination teams are supporting the multinational effort to free Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, the allied nations, with Australia, shall prevail against Iraq's aggression. We shall restore the sovereignty of Kuwait, and in doing that we shall have done much more. We shall have established the conditions for peace and stability in the Middle East; we shall have protected the health of the international economy; and we shall have erected and strengthened the framework for a world order in which all nations can live in greater peace and harmony. </PARA>
<PARA> Sadly, of course, no-one can expect that there will never again be a dictator like Saddam or an outrage such as his invasion of Kuwait. But by our actions now we will have made it harder for such outrages to be perpetrated, and we will have made it easier for them to be punished and remedied by the world community, because each time aggression is resisted it becomes harder for the next aggressor-just as each time aggression is appeased it becomes easier for the next. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia, as much as any country, must surely value that achievement, and we must surely value the way the world is asserting this truth, for the very coalition building that has united us since last August and the very resolve displayed by us through the United Nations are the very qualities that we want to preserve and protect when this Iraqi crisis is over. They are the very qualities that we want to see as the hallmarks of the new world order. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, it is fundamental to everything that I have said in this place today that, when this crisis is over, we will have opened the way to a safer and more peaceful world, a community of nations working more harmoniously through a reinvigorated and more effective United Nations organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> In such a world we are entitled to hold this basic and earnest wish: that we will be able to devote ourselves as never before to the real and urgent tasks of peace-not expending our resources on war but investing them in social justice, economic development and human freedom. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, the Opposition parties strongly support this motion before the House. There is no graver decision for a Government than to commit a nation to war. There is no greater responsibility for an Opposition than to define its position on the issue of such involvement. I welcome the opportunity today to put that position clearly on the record in this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Almost nine months ago I was privileged to stand in the dawn light at Anzac Cove with our Gallipoli veterans. In their faces that morning I saw etched a fierce pride in their achievements 75 years previously; but I also saw a deep sorrow in their remembrance of the horror of war. </PARA>
<PARA> That Gallipoli pilgrimage was one of the most moving experiences of my life. To meet and talk with our original Anzacs and to study that campaign filled me with admiration for their courage and taught me a lot about my country. Throughout our history we have been a genuinely peaceful people, but we have never been a pacifist people. We have been a proudly independent country, but never a neutral one. </PARA>
<PARA> We have always been a nation prepared to stand up for our principles and to stand by our friends. We have a clear idea of what is fair and acceptable international conduct. We know what our vital interests are and we have been prepared to defend them. We are a nation that believes in a fair go, but not a free ride. The graves of Australians around the world who gave their lives for their country in the great wars of this century are testimony to that fact. </PARA>
<PARA> There never has been a good war. There have been necessary wars and just wars; but never good wars. Only the foolish and the deluded welcome war as something ennobling and uplifting. But even that is only half the truth. There may never have been a good war, but there can be a bad peace-a peace that is bought at any price, a peace that compromises the very foundations on which it is supposed to be built. That kind of peace makes war more likely, not less likely. There are times in a nation's history when its vital interests are directly threatened and when the only effective response is unity of purpose and commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has taken a very clear-cut view of Australia's interests in the outcome of the Gulf crisis and of the integrity of the United Nations (UN) position. That is not a view we have reached on the basis of emotion or jingoism or any selective assessment of the facts. It has nothing to do with political ideology. It is not a question of `my country, right or wrong'. It is a conclusion we have reached after a very careful judgment of the international realities we are facing. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's interests are directly engaged in this crisis. That fact is no less true because it has been repeated so often by so many people within and outside Australia over the past 5 1/2 months. </PARA>
<PARA> - We do have an interest in helping to build a new international order where the strong are just, the weak are secure and the peace is preserved. </PARA>
<PARA> - We do have an interest in making the United Nations an effective means of establishing such an international order. </PARA>
<PARA> - We do have an interest in resisting Saddam Hussein's threat to regional stability and security, particularly that of Israel. </PARA>
<PARA> - We do have an interest in deterring or preventing the use of chemical warfare and other weapons of mass destruction. </PARA>
<PARA> - We do have an interest in helping to ensure that the international oil market is not held to blackmail as a result of Iraq's aggression. </PARA>
<PARA> - We do have an interest in helping to end the brutalisation of Kuwait's citizens and the appalling violation of their basic human rights over the past 5 1/2 months. Amnesty International and others have documented the torture, rape and killings that have marked Iraqi rule in Kuwait. No civilised country can ignore those appalling facts. </PARA>
<PARA>Australian interests in the current Gulf crisis are real and they are vital. We cannot expect others to protect them for us. They are interests that go to the heart of our values as a nation and our hopes for a newer and better world. They require us to be clear-eyed about why this war began and about the only way it can be ended. They may well require us to be in for the long haul in what may well be a very difficult campaign. They require us not to lose our nerve. And they also require us not to let rightly expressed differences of opinion among us obscure what is at stake for us as a nation. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe, therefore, that this Parliament, on behalf of the Australian people whom we represent, must today send a clear and united message to Iraq, to the rest of the world and, not least of all, to our defence personnel in the Gulf. And that message is an unambiguous one:</PARA>
<PARA> - First, Iraq must withdraw unconditionally from Kuwait in line with the 12 United Nations resolutions. </PARA>
<PARA> - Second, the territorial integrity of Kuwait as a sovereign country must be restored and respected in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> - Third, the right of Israel to exist in peace and within secure and internationally recognised boundaries must be respected. </PARA>
<PARA> - Fourth, and very importantly, our message must also reflect our pride in the role and professionalism of our Defence Force in the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA>We as an Opposition will do all we can, in cooperation with the Government, to ensure that such a message is the outcome of this special sitting. Abraham Lincoln told the American nation at a critical time in its history that `a house divided against itself cannot stand'. For our part, we will do all we can to ensure the unity of this House today. </PARA>
<PARA> I give that commitment in a very deliberate way. There is much that divides our parties. We have fundamentally different visions on many things from economic and social policy to the role of government and the enterprise of individuals. We do not seek to minimise those differences. The outcome of the Australian people's choice between them over the next few years will determine what kind of nation we are in the next century. But today, on this issue of war in the Gulf, I want to put those differences not behind us but certainly to one side-where they belong in this debate. I want to state, in the clearest possible terms, that we share with the Government a fundamental unity of purpose concerning the Gulf war. </PARA>
<PARA> - We stand united in condemning Iraq's invasion and occupation of Kuwait and its strategy, which is now apparent over recent days, to spread the conflict even wider. </PARA>
<PARA> - We stand united in our belief that the United Nations is upholding the principles of its charter. </PARA>
<PARA> - We stand united on the issue of the current nature and extent of Australia's defence involvement in the Gulf crisis. </PARA>
<PARA>That is why we are pleased to support the motion which the Prime Minister has moved today. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition believes that events over recent days in the Gulf represent a very dangerous escalation. We deplore the indiscriminate and unprovoked attack by Iraq upon Israel. That attack is part of a clear long term strategy by Saddam Hussein to break up the coalition against him and to isolate Israel in a sea of open Arab hostility. The restraint which Israel has shown in the face of this aggressive provocation has been particularly commendable. We believe it serves the best interests of long term stability in the region. But there are limits to Israel's tolerance. We can only hope that Iraq's capacity to jeopardise Israel's security and inflict suffering on the Israeli people is neutralised before the limits on Israel's tolerance are breached. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me also add that the Opposition understands the personal difficulties and sadness which this conflict is causing for Australia's Arab and Jewish communities. We deplore in the strongest terms whatever discrimination is taking place against Jewish and Arab Australians as a result of this war. We know they put Australia first. And we understand the special anguish and concern they must feel at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> The views which the Opposition has taken on Iraq's actions since August and our defence involvement in the Gulf are ones that we have consistently argued since this crisis arose. Without wanting to exaggerate their importance, I believe that our clearly stated positions during this crisis have encouraged the Government in the development of its policies. I also believe that the Opposition's critical questioning during this crisis of the detail of Government policies has had a very constructive effect-particularly on issues such as defining the precise role of our Defence Force in the Gulf, clarifying the general aim of the rules of engagement, ensuring that adequate information is provided to Parliament and trying to guarantee that Australia's response to future developments is decided on its merits. </PARA>
<PARA> May I also add that I believe the Opposition's strongly expressed view that this Parliament should reconvene at this time has also had a constructive effect. The bipartisanship that has marked the general Australian response to the Gulf crisis has not always been a characteristic of Australian politics in time of crisis and war. There were, in particular, significant political divisions during periods of the First World War and the Vietnam war. Political divisions make it harder for any governments to act decisively and confidently in time of war. They certainly do nothing to build a sense of national unity and common purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that one of the easiest ways of winning publicity and cheap political points, particularly for an Opposition, is to exaggerate popular fears and inflame suspicions. That would have been an easy option to exploit. The Australian people, for all the support they have shown, do have many fears and suspicions about this war. There are loud and strident voices in the community telling us that the role of an Opposition is to oppose this war. That is not a course of action we have pursued; nor will we be doing so. From the onset of this crisis back in August, we have been committed to building a unified national response. We have taken the consistent view that there is too much at stake for petty political point-scoring. I firmly believe we have lived up to the spirit and to the letter of that commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> The principles on which we base our policy on the Gulf crisis have been clear from the start. They lead us to one inexorable conclusion: that the United Nations' position is right and that Australia is right to support it. The world community is facing an historic challenge in confronting Iraq's aggression. For much of its first 40 years the Cold War prevented the United Nations from fulfilling the high hopes of its founders. The Suez crisis, Vietnam, Afghanistan, the previous Middle East wars and countless others bear testimony to the failure of the United Nations to achieve its central purpose. Now, with the end of the Cold War, there are new hopes for the United Nations. The Gulf crisis is a great opportunity for it. It provides an opportunity for the United Nations to fulfil the vision of its founders. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us be very clear about one thing. If the massed military power of the multinational force, backed by a global political consensus through the United Nations, is not allowed to deal decisively with Iraq's lawlessness, then nothing ever will. The United Nations will be condemned once more to irrelevance as a peacemaker. Australia has a vital interest in working with so many other countries to ensure that the will of the United Nations prevails in this crisis. It cannot be allowed to fail. This is a fundamentally important reason why we stand with the Government today in sending a clear statement from this Parliament on the Gulf war. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, it is appropriate that on this occasion I express the Opposition's strong support for the role of the United States, and President Bush in particular, throughout this crisis. The US Administration has perceived the significance of this crisis from the very start. It has acted responsibly, clearly and consistently. </PARA>
<PARA> President Bush has set a new standard for crisis management in the post-Cold War era. It is the United States, under President Bush, which is the real driving force in making possible what are the first signs of a new international order. He has skilfully helped to enhance the authority of the United Nations. He has facilitated an unprecedented international coalition that has cut across the old East-West divisions, that has included a majority of the Arab world and that has brought together many old enemies. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps most importantly, he has spelt out a clear statement of the principles of international order, based on the UN Charter, that Iraq has violated. He has shown great courage in his consistent determination to ensure that these principles are respected. This issue should not be a matter of pro-Americanism or anti-Americanism. It is a matter of assessing actions on their merits. On that basis, we believe that President Bush has acted both bravely and wisely and that the actions of the United States should be seen as such. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, the Opposition knows full well the gravity of the decision we have taken in support of the United Nations. Each of us has wrestled with the complexity of war in a different way. For some honourable members, the Second World War or the Korean War has shaped their thinking more than anything else. For many of my generation, the defining experience was the Vietnam war. Like many others, I agonised greatly over Australia's role in that war. Now, many Australians are agonising again over our involvement in another war. </PARA>
<PARA> We on this side of the House are convinced that the multinational force in the Gulf is involved in a justified military action and that Australia is acting in its national interest and meeting its international responsibilities by participating in it. In saying that, I know that there are many Australians who have a genuine opposition to this war. I respect their views but I disagree fundamentally with them. I disagree with them not because I impugn their motives or doubt their sincerity; I disagree with them because I find the arguments used to support their case unconvincing. </PARA>
<PARA> I hear, for example, the claim that the use of force against Iraq is wrong because `peace has not been given a chance'.``Yet there can be few wars in history that international diplomacy and economic action have tried harder to prevent than this war in the Gulf. Unlike many wars that have begun by accident or drift or sudden decisive action, the Gulf war has been almost a war by timetable. There has been a careful, measured sequence of warnings and sanctions, following which the threat of force was clearly signalled. </PARA>
<PARA> In 12 resolutions of the United Nations Security Council over the past 5 1/2 months, most of which have been passed unanimously, the international community has spelt out its opposition to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and its determination to evict Iraq. The United Nations set firm deadlines and defined a clear option for Iraq to accept if the use of force against it were to be avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> It is Saddam Hussein, and no-one else, who has refused to give peace a chance. It is Iraq, and no-one else, which has rejected every international initiative aimed at avoiding war. </PARA>
<PARA> An incident having occurred in the gallery-</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="1" SPEAKER="Mr SPEAKER" NAMEID="10000">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">Mr SPEAKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! Those people in the gallery applauding will cease doing so. As I said earlier, people in the gallery who wish to continue interjecting should do so outside the chamber, not in here.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9H4">Dr HEWSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I repeat: it is Iraq and no-one else which has rejected every international initiative aimed at avoiding war. It is Saddam Hussein's growing conventional and chemical arsenal, and whatever other weapons of mass destruction he has, together with his ruthless willingness to use them arbitrarily on his own people and others, that have ensured that peace could have no chance in his own region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those who want to give peace a chance offer a false choice between what they portrayed as peace last week and what is war today. But the peace was shattered by Iraq on 2 August, not by the allies on 16 January. Saddam Hussein gave his Arab neighbours in Kuwait no chance of peace when he launched his invasion on 2 August. </PARA>
<PARA> I hear it said that the use of force under UN auspices is inappropriate, but that argument seems to come from those who prefer a United Nations that talks but will not act in defence of its principles. Such a view condemns the United Nations to impotence, not influence. </PARA>
<PARA> I hear it said that economic sanctions have not had long enough to work. Yet 5 1/2 months of effectively enforced sanctions showed no signs of being able, in their own right, to convince Saddam to leave Kuwait. Many of those who argue that sanctions need longer to work never specify precisely how long they should be given. One suspects that, however long one may suggest, it would never be long enough. And all the time Iraq would be entrenching its brutal rule in Kuwait and building its arsenal. Sanctions have had a negligible effect on the Iraqi military. Saddam Hussein would simply keep passing on deprivations and shortages to his long-suffering citizens to ensure his military machine remained unaffected by sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA> I also hear it said that the conflict in the Gulf is nothing more than a war over the price of oil. None of the countries involved in the multinational force in the Gulf has concealed the fact that fear of the consequences of Saddam Hussein's increased control of world oil reserves is a factor in their response. That fear is a quite legitimate and relevant one. Success in seizing Kuwait's oil assets would encourage Saddam Hussein to repeat the strategy against other neighbours. His growing oil power would fund a further expansion of his military arsenal and adversely affect inflation, growth and interest rates not just in Western economies but in Third World ones as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Saddam's aggression has come at a critical time for the global economy, with the onset of recession in many countries, the severe difficulties confronting eastern European countries and the threatened breakdown of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade system. It also comes at a particularly critical time for our own economy, which is very vulnerable to any downturn in the international economy. To prevent world oil supplies being illegally acquired and manipulated by a ruthless and aggressive dictator is not a goal about which Australia or the rest of the international community need feel any embarrassment. </PARA>
<PARA> I also hear it said that the uncertainty of the war's outcome makes it unwise to wage war at all. Yet there are far greater uncertainties in allowing Saddam Hussein's aggression to succeed. There are uncertainties about any postwar situation in the Middle East. They are difficulties which need to be addressed and to which I will return later, but they are not reasons that justify appeasement or inaction now. </PARA>
<PARA> I also hear it said by those opposed to the UN position that this war could have been averted if Saddam Hussein had only been given a ladder to climb down, a concession to allow him to save face. The concession most often suggested is that of a linkage to the Palestinian issue. One fact is most relevant here: Iraq did not invade Kuwait, pillage its assets and brutalise its citizens to defend the rights of Palestinians. Iraq, or at least Saddam Hussein, did so for reasons of selfish aggrandisement. To concede now a direct linkage of the Palestinian issue to the task of getting Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait would be to reward him for his aggression. Furthermore, any negotiations over a solution to the Palestinian issue which enhanced Saddam Hussein's stature would be of serious concern to many other Arab countries and would confirm Israel's worst fears about its own security. </PARA>
<PARA> The argument in favour of linkage in this crisis misunderstands the nature of the man at the centre of it. Saddam Hussein has clear goals for regional dominance and a ruthless determination to pursue them. He will only succeed if others fail to resist him. </PARA>
<PARA> He is a man who has used poison gas against his own people, personally executed some of his closest colleagues and is prepared to use thousands of foreign nationals as hostages. He is one of the world's great manipulators. He manipulates to buy time for himself, to put pressure on others and to misrepresent his true ambitions. The record of his actions since 2 August is clear evidence that he will manipulate anything and anyone to further his grand designs. Any deal done-or even the hint of a deal-with him will only inflate his aggressive ambitions even further. </PARA>
<PARA> I hear the claim that we are locking ourselves into another Vietnam. But I believe such analogies are seriously flawed. No-one will deny that tragic mistakes were made in Vietnam. But the real lesson of that war is that if there are uncertain goals, an inappropriate military strategy or an absence of an international consensus, disastrous consequences will follow. I believe that no such considerations apply in respect of the Gulf war. </PARA>
<PARA> The goals of the United Nations in this crisis are very clear. The military strategy being applied to achieve them is appropriate. And unlike the Vietnam War, the United Nations has taken a clear lead in building an overwhelming international consensus. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, if there is to be an historical analogy the most appropriate is not Vietnam in the 1960s. It is Manchuria in 1931, Abyssinia in 1935, or Czechoslovakia in 1938, as alluded to by the Prime Minister. In each of those cases there was, as in Kuwait, a clear case of naked aggression. But unlike the League of Nations in 1931, 1935 and 1938, the United Nations in 1990 and 1991 is not turning a blind eye to aggression. </PARA>
<PARA> The world paid a terrible price for the failure of the League of Nations in the 1930s. We cannot repeat those mistakes now. Woodrow Wilson, the architect of the League of Nations, which unfortunately failed despite his best endeavours, left a vision that should still inspire us. In 1917 he said:</PARA>
<PARA>There must be, not a balance of power, but a community of power; not organised rivalries, but an organised common peace. </PARA>
<PARA>The United Nations is our best hope for implementing that vision. One nation's aggression must not be allowed to bring it down. </PARA>
<PARA> I hear other claims that the United Nations' response to the Iraqi action in Kuwait is inconsistent with its response to the crises in Panama, Grenada and East Timor, and to the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza. Such claims do little justice to the very real differences between these various crises, wars and occupations and the situation which the international community now confronts in the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA> Little is gained by these debates over the rights and wrongs of history. They are, in practical terms, irrelevant to the case in question where Iraq's use of force is clearly viewed by almost all countries as unprovoked and indefensible. The actions or inactions of the United Nations in the past should not necessarily become the yardstick for its role today. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, the Opposition has carefully addressed these arguments about giving peace a chance, about giving sanctions longer to work, about establishing linkage, about seeing beyond the implications for oil prices, and about keeping the United Nations consistent with its past actions. We have found none of these arguments convincing. We have always been convinced of the integrity of the UN position. We remain stronger than ever in that conviction.</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition, therefore, is proud to support the motion before the House. In indicating that support today, I also want to highlight three areas where I believe Australia's response to the Gulf crisis has created an agenda of unfinished business. </PARA>
<PARA> The first relates to Australia's national defence strategy. The Gulf crisis is re-emphasising some important lessons to us. It affirms yet again the fact that our defence interests, like our foreign policy interests, are global. That is not to say that our defence and foreign policies should not have a special regional perspective. But they cannot be confined to a narrow regionalism or any exclusive notion of continental defence. </PARA>
<PARA> The six major wars which Australia has entered this century have all been on the side of our allies-Britain and the United States-in defence of common security interests. The Gulf war is no different in that respect. The Gulf crisis has affirmed, yet again, the importance of our alliance relationships and defence cooperation, particularly with the United States. Selfreliance in national defence is a very worthwhile aspiration. But it is not a reality; and it is far from becoming one, given the reductions in Australia's defence budgets over recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Gulf crisis has raised some legitimate questions about the scope which our defence resources give us in responding to such a situation. This crisis and Australia's capacity to respond to it seem to have undercut many of the assumptions and prescriptions of the 1987 Defence White Paper. </PARA>
<PARA> In the wake of the Gulf war, we believe that the Government should undertake, as a matter of urgency, a thorough and public review of the 1987 White Paper. The issue of an Australian defence strategy, appropriate to our resources and national interests in the 1990s, is set to become a major focus of domestic debate in a way that it has not done for many years. We on this side of the House look forward to taking up that vital challenge. </PARA>
<PARA> My second concern is related to the issue of a relevant national defence strategy. It concerns the nature of the new world order about which there has been so much recent discussion. No-one should delude himself that this new era is somehow preordained or straightforward. </PARA>
<PARA> The challenge confronting the international community in the current crisis goes beyond the achievement of a quick and decisive military victory. There will remain the great challenge of negotiating some kind of settlement of the longstanding grievances of the nations of the Middle East, including those of the Palestinians, and safeguarding the rights of Israel. </PARA>
<PARA> That process of negotiations cannot begin while Iraq occupies Kuwait and threatens regional destabilisation. It will also be greatly complicated should Saddam Hussein succeed in his aim of dragging Israel into this conflict or unleashing his holy war. </PARA>
<PARA> Beyond that, there is the larger challenge of how international order in this new era will be maintained. Most nations look forward to the renewal of the United Nations as a force for peace in the world. But not too many of them are prepared to pay the costs involved. As in previous decades, the United States is carrying a disproportionate burden of the leadership and the military costs involved. In addressing the challenge of the new world order which we are defending in the Gulf, the Australian Government needs to ask itself some serious questions:</PARA>
<PARA> - What kind of longer term Middle East settlement do we see as consistent with such a new order?</PARA>
<PARA> - What would such a settlement demand of the Arab states and Israel?</PARA>
<PARA> - How can a genuine international security system, built on UN principles, evolve if countries are unwilling to accept their proportionate cost in making such a system work?</PARA>
<PARA> - What new responsibilities will fall to medium powers, such as Australia, if this new world order is realised?</PARA>
<PARA> - What does Australia see as the proportionate costs or actions it is willing to undertake in giving practical support to the emerging new world order?</PARA>
<PARA> - What will it mean in terms of our defence priorities, strategy and resources?</PARA>
<PARA>These are serious questions that go to the heart of what we see as an appropriate Australian role in the world. We on this side of the House will be addressing them as a matter of urgency. We urge the Government to do the same.</PARA>
<PARA> The third concern I want to note today relates to the dangers of gaps emerging between Australian rhetoric and actions in this crisis, between the strength of Australia's support for a new world order and Australia's preparedness to defend it. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is right to take the stand that it has taken. But there are questions-quite legitimate ones, I believe-now being asked about whether the nature of Australia's practical support for the UN position is really proportionate to the importance which Australian statements attach to the role of the United Nations in the new world order. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me be quite clear on this point. The Federal Opposition supports the size of the current Australian military deployment in the Gulf. We are not calling for any immediate increase. However, there needs to be consistency between the statements from both sides of this House over recent months about the significance of this Gulf crisis for Australia's international interests and the extent to which we are prepared to back our words with actions. Accordingly, the minimum position we should take on the possibility of some future increase in Australia's contribution is one that gives us the proper flexibility to assess our response to each development as it occurs. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that to rule out categorically any change in Australia's military contribution, beyond that which now exists, regardless of what may happen in the Gulf, does little justice to the very sound strategic, economic and other arguments which most of us have been putting about why this crisis so vitally engages Australian interests. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, there can be few greater contrasts in history than that between the optimism which so many shared this time last year about a new era of world peace and the great sadness which has accompanied the onset of the Gulf war. </PARA>
<PARA> This time last year we were celebrating the destruction of the Berlin Wall, the collapse of communism in eastern Europe and the end of the Cold War. Many people throughout the world were advocating ways in which the `peace dividend' should be spent. We were looking forward to the end of the arms race and a new era of constructive international cooperation. These hopes have proved premature; but they are not vain hopes. They will be realised only if the international community is prepared to stand up for them. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, I was deeply moved when I farewelled our naval personnel on their departure for the Gulf and I was delighted to welcome some of them home at the end of their term of duty. I have been greatly impressed with their quiet confidence in their own capabilities and in that of their ships. They are an impressive and inspiring body of Australians in whom we can all take pride. Moreover, they are serving in the finest traditions of our Defence Force. They have the Opposition's admiration for their professionalism and our total support in their service on the nation's behalf. We wish them well and we wish them a safe return. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, Mr Speaker, let me address one final comment to all members of this House, irrespective of party. Let history record that in this place at this time we made unmistakably clear where Australia stands. </PARA>

The commitment of forces to an area of conflict, particularly one so far off, is not something which any government can do without the most serious and careful consideration.

People need to understand that the Government has already made it clear that there will be no further commitment by Australia beyond that undertaken to date and under no circumstances will there be any conscription of young people to the war. </PARA>
<PARA> The naval force serving Australia in the Gulf is part of Australia's regular professional armed forces-a force which has committed itself to serving Australia's interests with courage and dedication; a force to which Australia already owes a substantial debt. </PARA>
<PARA> But, as difficult as any conflict is, it is a government's job to sift through the issues and grasp the underlying truth of the circumstances surrounding such a problem. That is what this Government has sought earnestly to do: to find the right weighting of the events and to weigh our response accordingly. It is perhaps stating the obvious, but our conclusions have matched the conclusions of the great majority of nations. The central thrust of that deliberation has been the right of a small country to retain its geographical integrity and its political sovereignty. It is this principle which is the key to our refusal to acquiesce in Iraq's takeover of Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem is that the invasion of Kuwait is another development in the long line of developments that set a pattern for Saddam Hussein's presidency. When the Shah of Iran was overthrown by the Ayatollah Khomeini in 1979, Saddam Hussein saw the opportunity to fill the void in the Gulf, and the Arab world in general, created by the Shah's demise. The assault he led against Iran in 1980 had the aim of filling that void while seizing control of the greater part of Iran's oil reserves. Saddam did not bargain on the cohesiveness of Iran or on the power of Islamic fundamentalism in holding that nation together. When the conflict between Iran and Iraq finally abated in 1988, Saddam was left with a large military force and a debt-ridden economy. A major part of the debt was owed to the neighbouring state of Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> Saddam's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 had four objectives: firstly, to extinguish its debt with Kuwait by incorporating Kuwait within Iraq; secondly, to expropriate Kuwait's oil reserves and hence its wealth; thirdly, to obtain direct access to the Persian Gulf; and, fourthly, to give Hussein the financial wealth to sustain and equip his large army, including to equip it with unconventional weapons-weapons that had the capacity to threaten Saudi Arabia, a state led by people whom he had accused of being friends of America and a state which husbands the greater part of the world's oil reserves. </PARA>
<PARA> Some Australians with good intentions but misplaced sentiment talk in disparaging terms about a war over oil. But ever since Saddam Hussein became President of Iraq in 1979 he has been all about oil. His more recent belligerence towards the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries producers over their cautious pricing policies was evidence again of his belief in oil power. Saddam's strategy has been to become the paramount Arab leader, eclipsing the economic power of Saudi Arabia by establishing an Iraqi military superpower. </PARA>
<PARA> No-one should labour under any misapprehension that anything Saddam Hussein has done between 1979 and 1991 has had anything to do with a sensible or moderate balance of power in the Middle East or, more particularly, with a resolution of the Palestinian question. He has been in the business of power for himself and is after the money and wealth which are needed to sustain it. The problem for him is that in his thrust for that power and wealth, he miscalculated in his invasion of Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> While he may have believed the United States saw him and his nation as a counterweight to Iran throughout the 1980s, he made a mistake in believing that the United States would have acquiesced in the military annexation of Kuwait, particularly when such an annexation enhanced his capacity to threaten Saudi Arabia. But not only did the United States not accept his invasion of Kuwait; neither did his arch rival, the Syrian President, Hafiz al-Assad. </PARA>
<PARA> The extent of his miscalculation was further evidenced by the fact that the Soviet Union, a supporter of Iraq for two decades, also condemned the invasion. Indeed, the international condemnation of Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait is without precedent. The great body of nations represented at the United Nations has voted overwhelmingly against Saddam's brutal takeover. Those who protest the military response by the allied countries may well contemplate this fact. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people were also arguing that the Gulf problem is an Arab problem which should be resolved by the Arabs. This matter was referred to by both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). But to the extent that the Arab states saw the annexation of Kuwait as an Arab problem, none were convinced that individually or collectively they had the power to deal with it. That is why Syria, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the Gulf states have supported a United Nations solution. If the Arab states do see Kuwait as an Arab problem, they certainly see the United Nations resolution as the Arab solution. Whether or not that solution relies upon the backbone of United States military power, it did not deter the Arab states from supporting the United Nations sponsored action. </PARA>
<PARA> The Arab states obviously believe that Saddam Hussein had become such a threat that the stability of the Middle East would have been constantly threatened. Perhaps more importantly is the threat Saddam Hussein poses to world stability. At a time when Cold War rivalries and tensions were abating sharply and a more sympathetic world order was emerging, Iraq's brutal blitz of Kuwait reminded every small country that its sovereignty was not secure. Hence smaller countries, having a vested interest in a more secure world order, have invoked a United Nations remedy, a strategy of collective security. So too, sensibly, has Australia. As a smaller country, we have a clear interest in a more secure and predictable world order and a vested interest in supporting the one multilateral body set up to maintain it, the United Nations. The clauses in the United Nations Charter which deal with territorial sovereignty and integrity stand out like a beacon to any nation interested in peace and a sensible international order. It is these elements of the United Nations Charter which have secured support for the United Nations as an institution from every political corner of the globe. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has supported the United Nations from its inception and has continued to support the United Nations down through the years. Its role today has become especially important as the balance of superpower polarity has broken down. That is why Kuwait is the first real test of its capacity in the post-Cold War period. That is all the more reason for it to obtain multilateral support and all the more reason to maintain Australia's support. </PARA>
<PARA> Critics of military action of the multinational force should focus on the fact that it is the United Nations which has condemned Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and it is the United Nations in its resolution 678 which authorises member states to use all necessary means to uphold and implement the Security Council resolutions on Kuwait. Resolution 678 required Australia and other member states to consider whether it should extend the operational role of its task force to participate in operations designed to liberate Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Prime Minister made clear in his speech to the House of Representatives on 4 December 1990, this Government believed that Australia should extend its role to participate in such operations. He made it clear that our ships would be available to participate in action with the allied fleet in the Gulf once the liberation of Kuwait was to be undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> There are those in the community who fear that the liberation of Kuwait could become another Vietnam, another subject which has been mentioned by the two previous speakers. Those of us who remember the prolonged agony of Vietnam can sympathise with their anxiety, but those of us who know the facts cannot sympathise with their argument. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's involvement in Vietnam was executed by surreptitious means without any reference whatsoever to the United Nations. By contrast, Australia's participation in the multilateral force has been defined by, then made in response to, successive United Nations Security Council resolutions with the overwhelming support of United Nations members. The war in Vietnam was a war of national liberation against the imposition of colonial rule after World War II. Many saw it as halting the onward march of South East Asian communism. Whatever one's view of it, it bears no comparison with the situation in the Gulf, where one country has invaded and annexed a separate and distinct neighbouring sovereign state. Those who called into question the Government's military commitment to the Gulf on the basis that a commitment made a quarter of a century earlier in Vietnam was a mistake do not do justice to the Government's motives and mislead the Australian people as to the merit of the Gulf commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> If Saddam Hussein was left to go his way with the booty of Kuwait, how many years would it be before the world was contemplating another Middle East incident, probably involving Saudi Arabia, where Saddam's arsenal then contained more punishing and destructive weapons? Does the world then say from the position of vulnerability that his territorial ambition should be acceded to? How would the international environment look if he decided to wage a massive and destructive campaign, not just against Saudi Arabia, but also against Israel, with all of the retaliatory issues which such a course would invoke? A benign policy of appeasement now would be not only unjust but also dangerous and the family of nations would have to contemplate life in the international economy with up to 70 per cent of the world's oil supply, the lifeblood of most nations' commerce, in the hands of one malicious tyrant. It would certainly be blood for oil then. </PARA>
<PARA> As it is, the current military conflict in the Middle East and the Gulf will be difficult enough to resolve. The success of early air power operations has brought optimism and in some places euphoria in the face of what is seen to be conquests of relative ease. The concentration over the last couple of days on the Scud missile attacks is a concentration on a weapon which seems more capable of inflicting fear than being part of any coordinated major strike capability. </PARA>
<PARA> Claims of air superiority by the allied forces and concentration on the Scud missiles have tended to overshadow the more bewildering prospect of ground force combat. A lot will be required by air power and air support to loosen the grip the Iraqi ground forces have on Kuwait. It is this part of the war which is likely to sorely test allied morale and which should remind us that a successful resolution of this conflict will be no easy matter. For Australia's part, our commitment is a sensible and useful one which materially supports allied operations at sea, but which does not overplay our hand relative to the national interests involved. </PARA>
<PARA> I should also make a few comments about the Arab and Muslim communities in Australia. It would be completely irrational if members of these communities did not fear for their relatives and their former homelands. That concern does not, in my view, constitute any disloyalty to Australia. Most Arabs and Muslims in Australia value Australia as a country without divisions and one which is racially and religiously tolerant and they are loyal to it as such. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I would like to express what is obviously the clear wish of the House: that the men and women of the Australian forces in the Gulf complete their task and return to Australia and to their families as quickly and as safely as possible. For our part, I can assure the House that the Government will be doing everything possible to achieve this goal. I support the motion before the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Our best wishes are extended to all in the multinational forces. Indeed, our best wishes are extended to their spouses and families in what is clearly a very difficult time for them. Therefore, in the time available I would like to address a number of related parameters to this complex equation. Firstly, it does have to be said that the agendas of Israel, Iran and Syria are not necessarily identical to the agendas of the multinational forces and, indeed, the Australian force. This is a matter which I will not dwell on, other than to say that the situation there is complex; it is unfolding rapidly. The coalition has held together well in the days since hostilities have been rejoined-remembering the hostilities commenced on 2 August-and we must ensure maximum support for our forces both here as a parliament, across the nation of Australia and beyond.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would also like to say with regard to the Australian commitment that the temptation will be for the public to depart from that level of support. The temptation will be to be distracted by all that is going to unfold and the brutal circumstances which will appear on television screens right across Australia and the like. Again I would say to the public of Australia that we must stay the course. We have no choice, given all that has happened in the Middle East, especially on 2 August with the original invasion of Kuwait by Iraq and there should be no shirking from that course, given the extensive efforts, diplomatically, to try to bring about a peaceful resolution. Those diplomatic efforts failed because of one person. Let us not forget it. The reason they failed was because of the attitude of one President Saddam Hussein. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me also say that there are additional aspects which the peace movement should think about. On return from the Gulf, I visited a number of smaller Asian countries in which I have a deep interest, including Nepal and Bhutan; I had previously visited Singapore and Brunei. It is a matter of record that many officials in those countries, formally and informally, emphasised to me their deep concerns over all the ramifications associated with the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. Indeed, one of the first countries to move very quickly in support in the United Nations was the tiny kingdom of Nepal and for very good and proper reason. The whole issue of regional stability in our own region is relevant in this equation, quite apart from all the other reasons advanced by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, which I fully support. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now touch on the defence parameter and build on the remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition that we must now look again at that defence paper which clearly fails in light of events of 1990 and 1991. As honourable members will recall, the whole thrust of the approach to defence by the Government at that time was one of self-reliance and an emphasis on low-level threat and contingencies. One thing this Middle East situation has clearly shown is the inadequacies of that policy. I appeal to the Government to acknowledge that its defence policy is now out of date and needs reworking. I quote particularly one aspect of the White Paper:</PARA>
<PARA>There are no current or prospective situations beyond our own region where Australia's direct strategic interests require a significant defence role or local circumstances offer scope for one.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly that particular extract from the White Paper has been completely eclipsed by all that has taken place. We need to look very carefully and seriously at all that lies ahead with regard to the defence circumstance facing Australia throughout this decade. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to another matter I consider to be extremely important. I refer to the Gulf trade sanctions. Until now the cost of those sanctions has been borne by just a handful of sectors-particularly export industries, including many rural sectors covered by bodies such as the Australian Wheat Board and the Rice Marketing Board-in direct and indirect ways. The Prime Minister gave a commitment in August that no one sector would bear the cost of the burden of the trade sanctions adopted, quite correctly and properly, against Iraq and Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> We have waited a long time to see further detailed action and the provision of much needed interim compensation, interim assistance, in the knowledge that that assistance will have to be subsequently adjusted for the growers and exporters involved because, whilst I will not dwell on this point in the context of this mainstream motion before the chair at this time, we cannot forget the horrific economic circumstances facing so many Australians at this time, be it in small business, in the rural sector or right across the board. Part of that equation has arisen because of the Gulf trade sanctions and it is totally in order to ask for rapid action by the Federal Government with regard to dealing with those Gulf trade sanctions and the ramifications which flow from them. </PARA>
<PARA> Likewise, in terms of energy Australia is in a very fortunate position compared to many other countries. Yet we clearly need to monitor that very closely, and time only allows for me to say that we need a practical commitment to consultations should the Government seek to change policy in this area. When it introduced the petrol price freeze last year there was no consultation with the industry involved. Indeed perhaps there was not even consultation between the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) until after the event. That is regrettable, but I do not dwell on that. Let us have proper consultations if we want to have sensible and comprehensive policy development in this critical area because clearly the price of energy, particularly petrol and diesel fuel, has an enormous impact on the ramifications of the economic performance of Australia as it works its way through this horrific recession. </PARA>
<PARA> However, let us turn back to that fundamental motion that this House is addressing on this historic occasion. Let us remind ourselves that the easier course of action would have been to walk away, to just hide down here in the Southern Hemisphere, ignore our responsibilities and say it is okay for Iraq to have gone ahead with that invasion of Kuwait and other places-which it would have attempted if it had not been checked and checked very quickly in that first half of August 1990. That would have been the course of cowards. That would have been the course of action which would be recommended by those who believe that it is in order to have such an invasion of sovereignty and the murder, rape and pillage which have flowed from that indirectly endorsed, and of course we on this side of the House and indeed Government members totally reject that. </PARA>
<PARA> Appeasement of Iraq is no solution. It will lead to complete catastrophe in the Middle East. As a Vietnam veteran I say to the House quite categorically that the comparisons between this conflict and that in Vietnam are indeed shallow and without foundation. If there is to be a parallel it should be with Adolf Hitler and the period of the 1930s in the lead-up to World War II. </PARA>
<PARA> All of us reject the idea of war, and none more so than those who have been to war. There is such a thing, however, as a just and proper war. This is such a war, sadly, and I offer the Government the support of the National Party of Australia in respect of this motion and indeed the coalition's full support in respect of the policy actions taken by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I also support in particular those comments by President Bush last week when he said that, unlike Vietnam, our forces on this occasion will go in without the problem of having one hand tied behind their back. That is indeed a very important statement and I congratulate President Bush on the leadership that he has provided to the world at large with regard to this extraordinarily difficult circumstance and war in the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia, the world and the grand coalition associated with the allied forces must stay the course until the objectives are achieved, until Kuwait is free, and we must not pause along that path. There can be no turning back. We must push on with the job ahead. I have every confidence in the outcome of that equation, in the fact that the Butcher of Baghdad will suffer for his actions in undertaking the rape of Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish our forces and all of the allied forces our very best at this difficult time and a safe return to Australia. It is in that context that I afford the strongest possible support for the motion before the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, no government can make any greater demand of its people than to commit them to war. Governments which make this demand must necessarily accept the burden, indeed the responsibility, of seeking to convince all reasonable people of goodwill of the justice of the decision they have made. Given the horrific nature of modern war, governments must be able to argue credibly that there was no other decision they could have made which, on the balance of probabilities, would not have led to more catastrophic, more awful consequences.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are some, I know, who believe that no breach of international peace, however blatant, however brutal, is worth a modern war. I do not accept that. To do so is to abandon the fate of the world to the aggressors in the international community. If it is a crime to begin a war, to commit aggression against a neighbouring country, then the responsibility for that crime in this particular conflict rests solely with Saddam Hussein. This war did not begin on 17 January 1991. It began on 2 August 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> The events that are now occurring in the Gulf would not have occurred if there had not been an act of brutal and blatant aggression against Kuwait five months before. The immediate cause of today's events stem directly from those of five months ago. They derive directly from the conquest of Kuwait by Iraq in August 1990. Despite some brief reference to a free government of Kuwait, the inability of Iraq to find any Kuwaitis to staff such a free government meant that no real pretext has ever been offered to justify that Iraqi invasion. </PARA>
<PARA> From the very beginning, Saddam Hussein simply treated the world community with contempt. He did not bother with any fig leaf to cover his naked aggression. Yet it may be said that small countries have been conquered, raped and pillaged before. Why, on this occasion, did the great bulk of the international community not only condemn Iraq's aggression but also demand that the invading armies be withdrawn? Why, in a series of sanctions unprecedented, did the United Nations seek to compel Iraq to disgorge its conquests? Why do most Australians, including the great majority of the critics of the Government's policies, demand that Iraq withdraw from Kuwait?</PARA>
<PARA> One reason is the very blatancy of Iraq's actions. Kuwait has been a semi-independent nation since 1899, and an independent state since 1961-a full sovereign state, a member of the United Nations, a full participant, along with Iraq, in the Arab League. This sovereign state was simply seized and turned into the nineteenth province of Kuwait. There were few of the difficulties and complexities here that have caused so many other dubious international interventions. The case of Vietnam, for example, was in essence the continuation of an anti-colonialist, nationalist struggle, complicated by a civil war. Here, there could be no United Nations endorsement of external intervention. </PARA>
<PARA> East Timor was no independent nation but the abandoned colony of a bankrupt empire. Here again the issue was complicated by an internal conflict. Whatever the rights or wrongs of Indonesian actions, there was little if any support for intervention to change the outcome within the immediate region. Contrast that with the situation relating to the invasion of Kuwait, where most of Iraq's neighbours-Saudi Arabia, the Gulf states, Syria and Egypt-have all participated in the United Nations multinational force to overturn the invasion of Kuwait. No doubt we could think of many other examples. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I would finally make on this issue is that the hypocrisies and imperfections of past international behaviour are, logically, quite irrelevant to the present question: is the United Nations right to seek the expulsion of Iraq from Kuwait? The answer to that question, unequivocally, is yes. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reason for giving an unequivocal affirmative to this question is simply the geographical location of Kuwait. The Middle East has long been a critical geopolitical area-one of the great crossroads of the world. Aggression there affects the future of the whole world to an extent not paralleled by aggression in more peripheral regions. Closely related is the fact that the Middle East is one of the great oil basins of the world. It is not to echo the vacuous cry `no blood for oil' simply to acknowledge the vital role of oil in the international economy. The existence of such strategic economic resources gives a significance to the events that take place in the Middle East not matched by those of most other regions in the world. Aggression there affects all nations, rich and poor alike. Thus it is not surprising that Iraq's aggression has occasioned an unprecedented international coalition demanding the expulsion of Iraq from Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> The controversial question, however, is how we should seek to secure that expulsion-an expulsion that commands near universal assent. First, of course, we should seek negotiation. That has been done. For five months the United Nations has sought by negotiation to secure the withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait. In all of that time there has not been a single indication from Saddam Hussein that he would withdraw his troops. Indeed, he has simply strengthened his hold on his nineteenth province. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been suggested that Iraq should be granted some form of compensation, for example, some Kuwaiti islands or some bits of Kuwait to assist Iraq's access to the sea, or perhaps some portion of the Kuwaiti oil fields. But this would simply constitute a reward for aggression. Such a strategy suggests a very dubious morality and would provide incentives for future aggression. If it were established that aggressors could keep some parts of the fruits of their aggression, incentives for further aggression would be strong. A less obvious form of compensation is the so-called linkage-that, in return for withdrawing his troops from Kuwait, Saddam Hussein should be offered an international conference to settle other conflicts in the Middle East, particularly that over the occupied territories. </PARA>
<PARA> Three observations need to be made on this matter. First, Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait was designed to capture the wealth and resources of Kuwait. It had nothing whatsoever to do with Israel and everything to do with the aggrandisement of Iraq. Secondly, Saddam Hussein himself has never once made the linkage argument. There has never been from him the slightest hint that he would withdraw his troops in return for such a linkage. It is true that on 12 August he demanded Israel's withdrawal from the occupied territories and, for good measure, Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon. But there was no undertaking on his part, or even suggestion, that he in return would get out of Kuwait. Thirdly, while refusing explicit linkage with Iraq's withdrawal, the United States has made it clear that a resolution in Kuwait could serve as `a springboard' to tackle other issues in the Middle East. More explicitly, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, both privately and publicly, made the following offer to Saddam Hussein:</PARA>
<PARA>I have every assurance, once again from the highest levels of government, that with the resolution of the present crisis-</PARA>
<PARA>in Kuwait-</PARA>
<PARA>every effort will be made to address, in a comprehensive manner, the Arab-Israeli conflict, including the Palestinian question. I pledge my every effort to this end. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what he offered Saddam Hussein. To all these offers there came no response from the Iraqi dictator. He simply dug himself deeper into Kuwait. It is naive to believe that this man will remove his troops from Kuwait without the exercise of force. But if force is to be used, why not rely on economic force? Why not rely upon the continued use of economic sanctions to expel Iraq from Kuwait? Economic sanctions are a very attractive option, a relatively painless method of imposing international will upon Iraq. Their seductiveness is obvious-in every peace rally the banners proclaim, `Put war aside, give sanctions a go'. Even sophisticated analysts urge military restraint while sanctions are given a chance to work. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, sanctions are having some effect on Iraq. There has been a decline of 10 per cent in Iraq's gross national product, food prices have risen and irritating delays and stoppages, particularly in non-essential industries, have been quite widespread. Why not allow sanctions to continue to erode the will of Iraq to remain in Kuwait? International decisions, however, unfortunately, rarely involve the luxuries of time and simplicity. </PARA>
<PARA> There are strong grounds for believing that, in pursuing economic sanctions alone, we would be playing further into the hands of Saddam Hussein. He could be given even more time to repress the people of Kuwait and to eradicate Kuwait's sense of national identity. Just as important, he would be given more time to strengthen his defences, to develop his nuclear potential, and to refine the production and delivery of chemical and biological weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> Even more critically, it is not just a question of hoping that economic sanctions will work. If we persist with economic sanctions we must have complete confidence that such sanctions will compel Saddam Hussein to withdraw. For we would not be able to resurrect the military option next year or in two years time if economic sanctions failed to achieve their objectives. We would not be able to re-establish the vast military forces now gathered in the deserts of Saudi Arabia. We would not be able to put together the massive alliance now committed to the military liberation of Kuwait. The cost of the failure of economic sanctions in those circumstances would be awesome. Just as the failure of economic sanctions against Italy in the 1930s destroyed forever the credibility of the League of Nations so, on the verge of a potentially better world order, we would ruin the credibility of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe most of the participants in the international coalition have reached the same assessment as this Government has-that we simply do not have the necessary level of confidence that economic sanctions would force Iraqi troops from Kuwait. Economic sanctions are of limited value against a dictatorship, for there are no internal forces to exploit the economic dislocation and political discontent within Iraq that sanctions may cause. Iraq could well sustain a long and possibly quite painful economic attrition without Saddam Hussein's military machine being seriously affected in any way. Given the refusal of Saddam Hussein to withdraw his armies when confronted with perhaps the most powerful military forces ever assembled, is there much likelihood that economic sanctions could compel that withdrawal within any foreseeable time framework? I fear not. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, there is a common tendency for economic sanctions to weaken over time, for the embargoes to be eroded or circumnavigated and for borders to become porous. Given the postponement of the military option for at least a year, even if it were feasible to maintain the armies and their morale in the desert for another long, hot summer, the immediate pressures would be off Iraq. Saddam Hussein would be free to work, in the volatile politics of the Middle East, to undermine the coalition arrayed against him. </PARA>
<PARA> This leaves us with the use of military force under the authority of the United Nations. It is not a course anyone would choose unless compelled to it. But given the failure of negotiations and the clear balance of probability against achieving the withdrawal through economic sanctions, we are left with the use of military force to repel aggression, and we do it with a wider international support than for any multinational intervention in our time. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout this century those non-pacifists seriously concerned with achieving lasting peace have sought an international body that can command the military resources of its member states to deter aggression. It was hoped that the threat of the use of international military force through a system of collective security under the League of Nations or the United Nations would prove sufficient to deter aggression or compel aggressors to give up their conquests. But if such collective security under the aegis of an international body failed to deter or compel the disgorgement of conquests, then military force under international sanction would be an appropriate response. </PARA>
<PARA> For all its imperfections-and we live in an imperfect world-the United Nations multinational force in the Gulf approaches this ideal more than any intervention we have seen in our lifetime. We cannot now afford to fudge the issue-to retreat from the use of military force sanctioned by the United Nations, to abandon an act of collective security imposed through a multinational force. If there were ever substance to the notion of a just war, it is to be found in the current military campaign to liberate Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> The verdict is in on Saddam Hussein, as it should have been in on Hitler at the time of Munich. Hussein has created a First World army in a Third World country. He has devoted the resources of a relatively poor country to the building of a formidable arsenal of horrific weapons, and he has worked to develop a nuclear arm. He has suppressed with great brutality the revolt of the Kurds in northern Iraq. He used the opportunity of the Iranian revolution to seize Iranian territory, and fought for eight years, with the loss of nearly a million Iraqi and Iranian lives, to retain it. He grabbed Kuwait, and he has been prepared to widen the present war through an unprovoked attack on Israel in order to serve his politico-military objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, history does not repeat itself, but it does teach us lessons-and we should learn this: to appease the unappeasable may bring us a short respite, but in the end it will bring us a longer, bloodier and more devastating war. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support not only the motion before the House but also the commitment, naturally, which is contained within the resolution by which the Australian Government has committed troops to the multinational force with the full support of the Opposition in this Parliament. I believe that the motion itself could be improved, and I will touch on that in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The most important point is-as with some of the great democracies throughout the world-that there is consistent support for the governments of the day for the difficult decision they have had to reach in coming to terms with this immense problem. In the United States of America, there was at first a degree of partisanship. But, once those resolutions had passed the Congress, through the House and the Senate, both major parties supported the President as commander-in-chief; so, too, in Great Britain, where the British Labour Party is supporting the Conservative Party. Why?</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) reminded the House today that the first move was taken not under the aegis of this force but by the attack by Iraq on Kuwait on 2 August last year. It was an act of grave deception carried through after the invasion when, with the nonsense that the Iraqi Government and forces had been invited into Kuwait, a puppet regime arose-only to disappear within 24 hours, when followed campaigns of slaughter, pillage and destruction of a type not seen for decades. It was, as I think the Prime Minister said, an example by one who claims to proffer the words `the Arab brotherhood' of an Arab slaughtering Arabs, developing chemical weapons and developing biological weapons-typhoid, anthrax and the like. </PARA>
<PARA> This contribution that is made against what has transpired-I have traversed this before in this House-is firmly rooted in international law. For all that public international law is a bit like beauty-it might be in the eye of the beholder-at root, there have been 12 resolutions of the United Nations Security Council, leading to resolution 678 which, I remind honourable members, among other things `Demands that Iraq comply fully' with the previous resolutions. It then goes on to talk about allowing Iraq `one final opportunity, as a pause of goodwill, to do so'. It then authorises member states `to use all necessary means to uphold and implement' the previously passed Security Council resolutions. It then actually goes on, in its third paragraph, to request all states `to provide appropriate support for the actions undertaken'. So this is not just a decision of the Government taken on its own assessment of events in the Middle East, but a response to requests of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> I have heard interjections coming from the gallery today saying that all war is wrong. No-one in this Parliament wants a war; no-one wants any bloodshed. But, again, rooted in the United Nations Charter itself is article 15 which confirms that nothing shall:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . impair the inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs against a Member of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA>This is founded in law and it is founded, of course, in any commonsense with an understanding of historic trends in the world in which we live and have lived. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned at the outset that I have a few difficulties with the motion. The Opposition fully supports the motion and I do not mention these difficulties to quibble at all as I think it is crucially important that the message go out not only to other nations of the world but also to our own troops so that they know that in what they are doing, of the highest order professionally, they have the overwhelming support of the duly elected members of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> In saying that these are not quibbles, I think that, firstly, if we were executing what has been requested of member states, we would in the first paragraph not be calling simply for an end to the aggression of Iraq against Kuwait, as the motion says, but for an end to the occupation. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I would also wish to see not only that we are fully supportive-as we are-of our own troops serving in the United Nations sanctioned multinational force in the Gulf, but also that we give support to that force itself. Thirdly, in the last paragraph, I would wish in fact that we did not go on simply to cite one or two elements that have to be worked out in seeking peace and security in the region for the future. It must be the abundant duty, even whilst this conflict rages, of those in government to be putting their minds to the best way of ensuring, once this particular conflict ends, greater progress towards peace and security in a region which is the tinderbox of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> The references in this motion to `a just resolution of the Palestinian issue and the continuing security of Israel, once the crisis in the Gulf is resolved' are crucially important. They represent the policies of the parties on this side of the House-a just resolution of the Palestinian issue and the continuing security of Israel. After all, I think Australia stands third only to the United States of America and Canada-or used to, prior to this Government-in its support of Israel in the United Nations. But that is only one element of the whole issue. Important though it is, unless one solves the Palestinian problem and unless one ensures Israel's security within recognised boundaries, there will be no settlement. But it will also involve a little less tranquillising of what the international scene actually is. </PARA>
<PARA> All of us want, in the ending of the Cold War, a move toward what is becoming a cliche-a new world order. But there seems to have been implied, in the remarks and writings of many throughout the world, that with the ending of the Cold War we can now start to wind down our defences and concentrate purely on economic and trade issues. It will be at some peril, regrettably, if we do that. In an ideal world, that would be just what we want. But so long as nation states exist or continue to exist, power or its pursuit will continue to be a main arbiter in the determination of governments in international affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable members want some reminding of that, they can just look at what we are involved in now. What, other than its supply of oil, is really a fairly mediocre country of only 17 million has had the capacity to hold the world at bay because it went out on a deliberate policy of increasing its military power and then, in addition, showed a propensity, will and determination to use it. As others have said, Saddam Hussein is not the first to do this in history and he certainly will not be the last. </PARA>
<PARA> Had it not been for the firmness and the resolve of the United States of America itself, perhaps we would not have had the situation of the United Nations having been moved in the manner that it was moved to stand up to the aggression that was shown. The fact that the military power of the United States of America was the only thing capable of mounting an effective riposte to Saddam ought not be lost on people- because there are economic giants in the world today that have not made quite the same contribution and with their own economic power were unable, with that power alone, to stand up to the sort of rape, pillage, lies and destruction that have occurred. Behind it all, tragically, we are reminded again that, if one seeks peace in the sort of world we have, it has to be peace firmly founded on policies of security. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, all of us in an ideal world would wish it to be different, but that pursuit of power, backed up by military means, reminds the world that to be safe we have to be able to protect ourselves, as well as to protect the ideals for which we stand. I often hear the denigration of our alliance with the United States. It is supposed to be some power bogey over us. I am proud to say that the alliances we have entered into in the past in this world, whether it be the five-power alliance or the ANZUS alliance, are not just alliances of countries which are coming together for military purposes; they are alliances of nations which believe in peace and security and order and justice and freedom under the rule of law. I do not think they get much of that in Iraq today. If we are intent on propagating further the freedoms of mankind-God knows there has been enough blood and treasure spent over centuries to get us to the stage we are at today-then we must recognise that behind it all we have to be in an adequate position to defend not only ourselves but the values for which we stand and for which we work as elected members in democracies in the twentieth century. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that there are those who disagree strongly with the sorts of views I am putting. I have been out of the country; I have only just got back from the Northern Hemisphere this morning and I have not heard all the detail. I heard some of the arguments before I left, and our Leader in a very well argued and plausible speech dealt with many of them this morning. As one who had to support many years ago a commitment with which those now in government disagreed, with the greatest goodwill, I say to the Government, because we stand in support of what the Government is doing, that if it is going to sustain support in this country for what it is doing it should continue to argue its case. If Vietnam taught us anything it taught us that, if we cannot carry public opinion with us, we cannot sustain that commitment. Quite apart from the correctness of the Government's action, it should continue its arguments to take the Australian people with it in what is the correct course upon which it has embarked. I would wish to hear more and more the arguments of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three particular arguments. The first is to give peace a chance. I have talked of the resolutions passed by the United Nations leading up to resolution 678 and of the efforts by so many world leaders and diplomats to achieve a settlement-leading last week to the Secretary- General of the UN being sent packing for his efforts. He had to hang around in Baghdad before he was spoken to, hectored and lectured. His efforts all came to nothing. There is the argument that there is some legitimacy in this invasion because, after all, Kuwait is only a country that was drawn up at the end of Britain's colonial period. In fact, all those maps were drawn up in that manner. `Hear, hear', I hear a gentleman say. He would be in a significant minority on this one because, if we are talking about maps, we might have a look at Iraq before the map was drawn up. We might find that we would be serving up a little bit of Iraq to Turkey, a little more to the Kurdistans, and a little more, perhaps, to Syria. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is that we have a world order today, with nation states joining the UN and acting in concert here. They have acted on the basis of recognised boundaries. It is fatuous to argue that in a selective way. Finally, there is the argument that we cannot condone the use of force at any time, and I think that has been dealt with. I remind honourable members that article 51 itself proclaims the right of individual and collective self-defence, and that is what we are involved in here. </PARA>
<PARA> In supporting the Government, we are calling for the Iraqis to withdraw from Kuwait; for there to be a return to legitimate government; for there to be work for peace and security in the region; and asking that we not overlook the human suffering that continues for every day this goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> That is all I wish to say today, save and except to conclude on the note that there are some very brave men and women serving Australia's determined interests at the present moment, and there are families which are suffering and anguishing as they hope for their return. This Parliament gives them total and full support for the legitimate course that the Prime Minister and Government have embarked them on in participating in that multinational force.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia's military commitment in the Gulf has two objectives and two only. The first is to stop the dictator of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, in his bid for regional dominance and what flows from that. The second is to ensure that the principles of the United Nations (UN) Charter will at last become the basis of international law. Australia's pursuit of these two objectives is a key part of our responsibilities as a member of the international community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> From history we see the periodic rise of aggressors prepared to use force to take territory, to plunder, to commit atrocities and to dominate weaker countries. These are actions which all reasonable people oppose and which most Australians believe are worth fighting against. Saddam is just another old-fashioned dictator prepared to use force against his neighbours. Unfortunately, he is most unlikely to be the last. If Saddam is setting any historic precedent it is for the deadly potential of the chemical, biological and nuclear weapons capabilities he is developing and by his apparent preparedness to use them for aggression. </PARA>
<PARA> As a country with a small population we have a great interest in establishing and maintaining an international order based on the UN Charter. We are now reaffirming in the most explicit way, and in a way that sets an example for the future, the principle of collective security. With the end of the Cold War we have seen the removal of the main constraint on the application of this principle, namely, the use of the veto by one or other of the superpowers. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I came into Parliament I was a career diplomat and I spent some time as a member of Australia's delegation to the United Nations. With that experience in mind, I am convinced that the United Nations will emerge from this crisis a much strengthened institution. This is because it will now be possible to dissuade potential aggressors, who will recognise the real possibility that, if they reject diplomacy, reject the peaceful means of settling disputes, they may face a multinational force to check their ambitions. </PARA>
<PARA> In this case the United Nations authorised force only if Saddam rejected peaceful solutions, rejected diplomacy, and failed to respond to unanimously agreed United Nations' sanctions. It is worth reviewing the process that led up to that. On 2 August, immediately following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, the United Nations Security Council passed resolution 660, which demanded the withdrawal of Iraqi troops and the opening of discussions between the two countries. On 6 August, through resolution 661, the Security Council imposed comprehensive mandatory sanctions against Iraq unless it complied with resolution 660. Four days later our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) announced that Australia would participate in a multinational naval force (MNF) with the purpose of enforcing those UN sanctions-not, I might add, before the United Nations acted but after those two resolutions had been passed. </PARA>
<PARA> On 18 August the Security Council passed resolution 664, which demanded that Iraq allow foreign nationals to leave Iraq and Kuwait and rescind its order to close diplomatic missions in Kuwait. On 25 August resolution 665 authorised the use of limited naval force to ensure compliance with the sanctions. The aim of the sanctions was not to starve the Iraqi people into submission. The aim was to demonstrate, through the seriousness of the action itself and the sacrifices the sanctions imposed on Iraq and its former trading partners, that the international community would not accept the invasion of Kuwait. Indeed, so far as the starvation angle is concerned, on 13 September resolution 666 was passed approving the shipment of food to Kuwait and Iraq, with distribution through the United Nations and similar bodies, for humanitarian reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> The sanctions succeeded in stopping nearly all of Iraq's trade with the rest of the world. But after many months it became obvious that further economic hardship for Iraq's people was not going to influence Saddam. Unfortunately, dictators are in a position to resist that kind of pressure. On 16 September resolution 667 condemned raids by Iraqi troops on diplomatic missions in occupied Kuwait. On 24 September resolution 669 entrusted the Security Council's sanctions committee with considering assistance for countries suffering from the trade embargo. The next day resolution 670 prohibited all air traffic with Iraq and occupied Kuwait, except in exceptional circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> On 29 October, resolution 674 asked states to document evidence of human rights violations as well as financial losses resulting from the invasion. On 28 November, resolution 677 asked the UN Secretary-General to safeguard a smuggled copy of Kuwait's population register to foil any attempt to repopulate Kuwait with Iraqis. Finally, in December, resolution 678 was passed giving Iraq until 15 January 1991 to withdraw from Kuwait and authorising nations to use all necessary means to ensure compliance. </PARA>
<PARA> This motion was sponsored by six members of the Security Council-the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France, Canada and Romania. Following its passage 12 votes to 2, we witnessed the diplomatic efforts of world leaders to resolve the crisis peacefully. But in the end the Secretary-General of the United Nations returned from Baghdad a few hours before the deadline and reported that Saddam had not moved and showed no indication that he was prepared to move; in fact, quite the reverse. </PARA>
<PARA> Accompanying those resolutions was a continual, comprehensive and urgent effort by Arab nations, leading world figures and the Secretary-General of the United Nations, among many others, to bring home to Saddam the importance of complying with those resolutions and the consequences of not doing so. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia supported resolution 678 not because we were seeking war but because we hoped a clear statement that we were prepared to use force would avoid war. We put our faith in diplomacy for a peaceful resolution. We were disappointed. Our resort to force recognises that peace can have too high a price if that means accepting aggression, atrocities and Saddam's development of the implements of mass destruction-biological, nuclear and chemical weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to Australia's contribution. Australia's military commitment is proportionate and practical. The Australian naval force-the frigates HMAS Darwin and HMAS Adelaide and the supply ship HMAS Success-played a significant part in enforcing UN sanctions. They interrogated 698 ships and were involved with other elements of the multinational force in eight boardings and the diversion of two ships found in contravention of the sanctions. Darwin and Adelaide have now been replaced by the destroyer HMAS Brisbane and the frigate HMAS Sydney. HMAS Success, after the longest tour of duty of our naval force in the Gulf, will shortly be replaced by HMAS Westralia. Success has played a vital role not just in underway replenishment of our combatants but also of the ships of other members of the multinational force. The superb professional effort of the crew of Success has been recognised by the Royal Australian Navy, in that it was recently awarded the Duke of Gloucester Cup as the ship which is foremost in general efficiency, cleanliness, seamanship, equipment reliability and technical training. I congratulate the crew on that achievement. </PARA>
<PARA> Along with the crew of Success, we also recognise the important contribution of the logistic support team which has been deployed to assist our task force. The combatants we have sent to the Gulf have all been highly capable in terms of both their weapons systems and the high level of training of their crews. Operating with carriers in the Gulf environment, our forces are protected by a layered defence system which has as a first line of defence early warning by airborne warning and control system aircraft of any incoming threat and interception by fighters. Any hostile aircraft penetration would then be engaged by the ships' own Standard missiles as well as their three-inch or five-inch guns. Protection from missiles is provided by a range of decoys and the ships' last line of defence, their close-in weapons system, the Phalanx, as well as 50-calibre machine guns. </PARA>
<PARA> The other danger faced by the MNF is from conventional mines floating in the Gulf. Risk can never be eliminated in a wartime maritime environment, but we are confident that our crews are well equipped and highly trained for the difficult job they are doing so well. </PARA>
<PARA> We recognise the important contribution of members of the Army's 16th Air Defence Regiment from Woodside in South Australia who have embarked for the first time aboard our supply ships to reinforce their air defences. The medical teams we have sent to join the United States hospital ship USNS Comfort also deserve particular recognition. When I welcomed home the first two teams on their return to Australia on 10 January I commended them for the excellent work which they had done. They are acknowledged by overseas commanders as some of the best trained personnel, both medically and militarily, available to the MNF. They learnt a lot, it is true, but one thing they learnt was how good their training had made them in the job they had to do. I offer special thanks to the Reserve medical staff, all volunteers, who left their civilian occupations to provide Australians and allied personnel with the finest medical attention possible. Australia also recognises the contribution by those Australians serving on exchange with British and United States units deployed to the Gulf. They are key members of the units to which they are attached. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises the importance for morale of the conditions of service for Australian personnel deployed to the Gulf. I have previously outlined those to the House. They include the Gulf allowance of $45 per day while in the area of operations, $30 per day while temporarily outside it and a tax exemption for pay and allowances whilst away from Australia, as well as access to veterans' entitlements. We have made special arrangements to provide the equivalent of Defence Force retirement and death benefit cover to Reserve medical officers and made provision to pay the increased costs of private life insurance policies which are attributable to exposure to warlike action. We have given a commitment to introducing legislation in the autumn session to extend the same pension rights to veterans' widowers as already exist in regard to widows. That is required because for the first time we have women serving in combat related roles on board HMAS Westralia and in the theatre of operations on board USNS Comfort. Women have been eligible for combat related duty since May of last year. I made it clear then that they would not be removed from their duties in time of conflict. I am proud that we have women amongst our contingent, and I am sure that all Australians will acknowledge their contribution. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian people appreciate the tremendous sacrifices made by the families of those involved in our commitment-the pain of separation, the anxiety and uncertainty, and the extra burdens of daily life. Navy's personal services organisation is well practised in assisting such families. It has established a free crisis hotline and is ready to provide help whenever it is asked for 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Just to prove that commitment, I visited the team on Sunday morning, and I commend them on the very important job that they are doing to support families with loved ones in harm's way in the Gulf. I hope that it will not be too long before the families' waiting will be over and they will be reunited with their loved ones. </PARA>
<PARA> Controversy, speculation and, unfortunately, malicious rumour are inescapable when a nation becomes involved in conflict. The Government is making every effort to ensure that the public is kept as fully informed of developments affecting our nation's involvement as is possible without endangering our or allied personnel and operations. In that regard, speculation that the Government will increase Australia's commitment is totally unfounded. The force that we have in the Gulf is proportionate, appropriate and practical. The Government has no intention of increasing it; nor have our allies asked us to do so. Suggestions that Australia will commit ground troops, elements of our Air Force or call up reserves are all unfounded. Even worse is a malicious campaign, including the circulation of bogus letters, suggesting that the Government will introduce conscription. That is totally untrue. The Government believes in volunteer armed services and has a policy which explicitly rejects conscription except in the event of an actual attack on Australia's territorial integrity. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), in his remarks, suggested that our Gulf commitment is a departure from current policy set out in the Government's 1987 Defence White Paper. Although the White Paper focused on meeting credible levels of threat in Australia's area of direct military interest and on self reliance within a framework of treaties, it explicitly contemplated Australia contributing to peacekeeping operations on a scale appropriate to our circumstances. That is exactly what Australia is doing in the Gulf. If Kuwait had had similar capacities and policies-that is, defence self-reliance in the context of alliances-we would not be there and would not need to be there today. </PARA>
<PARA> The key point is that these peacekeeping operations do not determine the shape of our force structure. We equip ourselves to deal with threats in Australia's area of direct military interest. Those same capabilities may also be of benefit in contributing to peacekeeping operations. That is the case with HMAS Brisbane and HMAS Sydney. Both vessels are of types in service with the United States Navy. They are equipped with weapons and sensors suited to these operations and compatible with the ships and aircraft of the multinational force, particularly to serve with carrier battle groups, in which capacity they are now engaged. </PARA>
<PARA> It is impossible to be precise in predicting the likely course of events in any military action or the cost in human terms. In that respect, this conflict is no different from any other. I believe that most Australians have made their own sober assessments of the evil of Saddam's aggression and the sacrifice that is required by nations participating in the multinational force. I believe the overwhelming majority of Australians judge those costs to be worthwhile. When our service men and women return home from this awesome conflict, unlike from another war which divided our country 20 years ago, I believe that they will receive our nation's appreciation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commence my contribution to this debate by saying-not only for myself but, I am sure, for everybody in this House-that our first consideration and our first thought are not so much for the weight of the argument and the strength of our own feelings on the events in the Middle East but, properly, for the safety and the well-being of the 900 Australian men and women who are carrying the burden of the decision properly taken by the Australian Government to associate Australia with the action of the United States led forces in the Gulf.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also say to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that on many other issues I and the Party to which I belong, the Liberal Party of Australia, have profoundly disagreed with him, and we will profoundly disagree with him in the future, but on this particular issue I believe from the very beginning the Prime Minister has behaved correctly, has displayed the correct response of a person occupying his office and has shown considerable leadership within his own Party. I do not wish to dwell on that fact, but the nature of Australian politics commands one to observe that there is a broad spectrum of views within what can generally be called the Centre Left or the left centre of Australian politics on issues involving military commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> Twelve months ago the world-and this House was no exception-literally rejoiced at the collapse of totalitarian communism in eastern Europe. We celebrated the demolition of the Berlin Wall and we rejoiced in the fact that the Cold War had come to an end. Many of us felt a great depth of inner pride that free market capitalism and liberal democracy had won the great battle of ideology against collectivist totalitarianism. In a sense the most important thing that is at stake in what we are now debating is whether the hope of a new world order that the end of the Cold War tantalisingly held aloft to the world can be translated into the reality of a new world order. </PARA>
<PARA> However much we may talk about the role of the United Nations-and I do not wish to denigrate that body or the efforts of its many agencies-the reality is that the new climate of accommodation between the superpowers of the world has made possible the stunning array of the coalition against Saddam Hussein. Had it not been for the end of the Cold War and the removal of the potential of a Soviet veto on the action of the Security Council, then the coalition and the alliance that have been brought together may not have been possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Another observation that should be made-once again without in any way denigrating the role of the United Nations-is that we should pay particular tribute to the leadership of President George Bush in this whole issue. I know that this afternoon reference to George Bush and the United States has provoked a hostile response-not from the other side of the House, but from sections of the gallery-but I think people have to travel a long way back in history to find an example of a man who has been able to put together such an astonishing coalition of nations as he has been able to do. Would anybody have imagined 18 months ago that we would have had a coalition involving the United States, Turkey, the tacit support of the Soviet Union, and Pakistan, Syria and Egypt-all aligned against an aggressive Arab country? I think we ought to pause for a moment in this debate and pay proper recognition to the great contribution that President George Bush has made to the assembly of this astonishing coalition. </PARA>
<PARA> We do that in a sense of being a totally free independent nation that has made a rational decision to commit its own armed forces. We do not do it in some sense of being a lap-dog to the United States or making some kind of mindless genuflection before any decision of the American Government, but we do it recognising that the times have produced in the United States a man whose great experience has enabled him, particularly on the international scene, to put together such a broad ranging coalition. </PARA>
<PARA> In assessing the validity of the decision, I echo, in the same spirit as he offered it, the advice of my colleague the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) not only to the Government but to all of us in this Parliament: if we on both sides of the House believe in this decision, it is our responsibility never to tire of explaining the reasons for it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is in a sense easy to garner national support at the moment. The early news in military terms has been promising. There is a tendency-or there was-towards euphoria, but none of us should lose sight of the fact that the difficult and more bloody part of the campaign, particularly on land, lies before us. That will test the support in the community and there is a solemn responsibility, no less on the Opposition than on the Government, to ensure that no stone is left unturned in explaining the reasons for this very serious and grave decision. </PARA>
<PARA> None of us should be in any doubt that in the possible weeks and months ahead the casualty lists will grow and the strain on many people, for very understandable reasons, will increase. We should not lose sight of many of the very logical and compelling arguments that have been put, not only by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) but by others who have contributed to this debate. Without in any way gainsaying the total right and freedom of people in this nation who disagree with the Government's decision-with this Parliament's decision-lawfully to demonstrate their dissent, it will serve all of us well to remind them of the simple fact that one of the things that distinguishes this country from other countries-on this particular occasion, Iraq-is that there are no public galleries at national conferences of the Arab Baath Socialist Party, let alone the right of anybody to demonstrate. That is something we should never take for granted in this country and something we should never tire of reminding people about. It is one of the reasons why, many times this century, this country has been willing to play its part in defending the cause of freedom around the world. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister in his speech mentioned the words of Neville Chamberlain when speaking of those who ask why on earth we should be trying on gasmasks and worrying about a faraway country about which we know so very little. Over the Christmas period I had the opportunity of reading one of the latest books by the British historian Donald Cameron Watt on the last two or three years before the outbreak of World War II, called How War Came. It is a very scholarly and gripping account of those years and one thing that comes through with great clarity in virtually every chapter is the belief on the part of Adolf Hitler and Ribbentrop that, because there had been appeasement over Czechoslovakia, there would be appeasement over Poland and a succession of countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst we can push the analogy between present circumstances and previous circumstances too far, the analogy which has been used by the Leader of the Opposition, particularly this afternoon, about the events of the 1930s is instructive to all of us. We paid very dearly in blood and treasure and suffering between 1939 and 1945. Those small, very vulnerable countries in the Middle East have already paid very greatly and many of them would pay much more greatly were it not for the action being taken. </PARA>
<PARA> There are just two other things that I want to say. Firstly, as somebody who has always been, in company with many in this House, an unashamed if not uncritical admirer of the State of Israel, can I say how much I respect the restraint that Israel has thus far displayed against the unprovoked aggression by Iraq. Can I also express my admiration for the role that Egypt has played once again. We are reminded that in the late 1970s Anwar Sadat and Menachem Begin first gave us some glimmer of hope that a lasting settlement between Arab and Jew may be possible in the Middle East. Once again, Egypt has seen the wider issue, and once again Egypt has been willing to stay with the coalition, even against the possibility of there being some retaliation by the Israelis. The Israelis and the Egyptians in their different ways in this dispute have shown the rest of the Middle East that perhaps there can be some kind of lasting settlement. </PARA>
<PARA> I, along with others on this side of the House and elsewhere, explicitly reject the notion of any kind of linkage between the Palestinian issue and the invasion and subjugation of Kuwait because there is no linkage. Saddam's invasion of Kuwait was not done to liberate the Palestinians; it was done to subjugate the Kuwaitis-and others, were he not to be expelled. </PARA>
<PARA> All of us must hope that at some stage in the not too distant future the goodwill that Begin and Sadat displayed at Camp David can possess both Arab and Jew alike in the Middle East and that there will be some lasting settlement of one of the most difficult problems that have bedevilled diplomats of the world. I have great pleasure in supporting this motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In rising to support this motion I shall begin by commending the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and his Cabinet for having the strength and the courage to make perhaps the most difficult decision that this Labor Government has ever had to make. I would also like to congratulate the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Opposition for their wholehearted support for the motion before the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The decision to participate with the United Nations in forcing Iraq to leave Kuwait was a necessary one for Australia to help maintain a world order. I must stress that I do not want Australia to be at war. I, like the majority of Australians, have long been against war-all war. In fact, I first became involved in politics during the Vietnam conflict by opposing Australia's involvement. As our Prime Minister has rightly said, sadly there are times when in order to achieve peace we must fight a war. </PARA>
<PARA> In the relatively peaceful surroundings which Australia has enjoyed so far, one could be forgiven for not feeling as though this country is at war at all. Despite the vigilant news coverage of events in the Gulf and the peace demonstrations in some of our cities, to a large degree life goes on as before in this country. Therefore, it is important for us not to lose sight of the reasons for Australia participating in the United Nations' action against Iraq and of the type of man Saddam Hussein has shown himself to be. This is a man who has thought nothing of killing and torturing his own people. This is a man who has thought nothing of killing and torturing the people of Kuwait. This is a man who has tested chemical weapons on his own people. This is a man who has sought to eliminate the Assyrian and Kurdish people. According to Kuwaiti reports, an estimated 7,000 Kuwaitis were killed in the first three months of the invasion. Hundreds of thousands of Kuwaitis and foreign nationals have now fled from Kuwait in fear of Saddam Hussein and his troops. </PARA>
<PARA> We must not forget the unprecedented consensus of the international community in condemning Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait, nor the passing of the 12 mandatory resolutions in the Security Council of the United Nations which approved the use of force to remove Iraq from Kuwait. Iraq now stands in contempt of these resolutions. </PARA>
<PARA> I say again that, although I do not want Australia to be at war or for a war to exist in the Middle East, I do believe that it has become necessary for Australia to become involved in the Gulf crisis. Our Prime Minister rightly has emphasised the need for Australia to defend the United Nations' resolutions. If Australia were invaded, we would expect support from the allies. So in a time when the United Nations needs our help, it should be forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA> We must also remember the importance of the Islam religion to Muslims. With cultural attitudes and beliefs such as those among Hussein's troops and people, they will truly be a force to be reckoned with. According to the 1986 census, an estimated 2,340 Iraqis are living within my electorate of Prospect. In my capacity as Federal member, I have seen and heard accounts of victimisation and terrorism that many Iraqi families have had to endure from Saddam Hussein's Baath Party in Iraq. Many Iraqis have fled their country of birth to escape the oppression of Hussein's Baath regime. But not even in Australia can they escape. Family members who have been left behind in Iraq continually report to their relatives in Australia the acts of terrorism, the intimidation and the victimisation that are occurring there. Now, with the outbreak of war and Australia's involvement in it, many Iraqi families living in Australia are being harassed and persecuted as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Racism is based on ignorance, and this is no exception. Many Iraqis living in Australia would be seen as dissident groups in Iraq. These groups include the Assyrians, who have been persecuted by Iraq in the past, the Kurds, who also do not support Saddam Hussein, and the Christian Iraqis. This does not mean that Saddam Hussein has no supporters living in Australia. On the contrary, of course there are followers of the Baathist ideologies living here. However, we cannot and we must not assume that all Iraqis and migrants from the Middle East share the same cultural backgrounds and beliefs. They should not be discriminated against in Australia by ignorant people who do not understand the complexities of the Middle East cultures. </PARA>
<PARA> My electorate of Prospect has the largest ethnic population of any in Australia and the opinions of my constituents are greatly varied. However, I feel certain that the majority of my constituents would prefer Australia to be at peace with Iraq. Despite any personal opinions I may have on this issue, as a representative of my electorate I feel that it is my duty to express the attitudes and the feelings of my constituents. A number of my constituents have rung my electorate office, wishing to register their opposition to Australia's involvement in the Gulf war. Others have also, while praying for peace, supported the action taken by the United Nations and Australia's involvement in such action. All of them have nothing but praise for the Australian service men and women involved at the moment in the military action in the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many conflicting opinions about the use of economic sanctions against Iraq to force its eviction from Kuwait. Debate on how effective these sanctions were-even though they have been in operation for five months-has continued to be part of some people's constant reminders. One thing I believe we can be sure of is that Saddam Hussein has used these sanctions only to play for time. </PARA>
<PARA> While I support every Australian's democratic right to protest against decisions such as the one to participate in the Gulf conflict, I find it disappointing to see peace activists demonstrating inside and outside this Parliament House, the United States Embassy and the Israeli Embassy only. Why are they not demonstrating outside the Embassy of Iraq-the aggressor in this war? We do not see them there. We have listened to them and witnessed their behaviour today in this Parliament-and it has been a disgrace. Let them be reminded that Australia is a democracy. If they were in Iraq, besides having their tongues cut out they would be shot-not asked to leave the Parliament in good grace. We must remind the people who live in this wonderful country of ours of this. Why did we not see the peace marches begin when this war really started-on 2 August 1990? It is not Australia and the United States that have caused this war; it is Saddam Hussein's refusal to abide by the United Nations' resolutions and leave Kuwait which has caused this conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, it seems to me that too much has been made of the relationship between George Bush and Saddam Hussein. Many people now see it as their war. The focus of this war should be on the United Nations' resolutions and the freeing of Kuwait. It should be noted that it is not only Britain, the United States and Australia that are involved in this conflict with Iraq. Twenty-eight other countries have committed forces in support of the United Nations' resolutions, including nine Arab countries. Many other countries have also supported the United Nations' action by making substantial financial contributions to the multilateral military efforts. </PARA>
<PARA> There are lessons for our own region to learn from this conflict. Australia cannot presume its influence without first understanding and respecting its neighbours. We must appreciate other nations' cultures and endeavour to help them to understand our own. Fortunately, under the Hawke Labor Government's policy of multiculturalism we are achieving this-albeit slowly and despite the strains of the present crisis. Considering the gravity of the situation, it is of vital importance that Australians be kept informed and up to date with accurate-and I stress, accurate-statistics and details of action in the Gulf. I am sure that in this multicultural society many people who have friends and relatives in the Gulf region are following the events in the Gulf very closely. We, as a government, owe it to them to keep them accurately and appropriately informed of the happenings in the Gulf region. </PARA>
<PARA> This war, I am sad to say, is being seen by many people as an oil war-a war about world fuel resources. I say to them: if we choose not to learn from history, particularly the period which began in the middle 1930s under the control of another dictator-not called Saddam Hussein, but called Hitler-we are fools. Nobody wants war and it is a tragedy that innocent civilians must be victims of war. However, we will all be victims if we do not act now and show Iraq that the world will not tolerate the kind of invasion that Kuwait has had to endure. </PARA>
<PARA> Meanwhile, the tragedy in the Gulf continues to unfold on many levels. It is a tragedy that the most brilliant minds in half a dozen countries are being applied to the creation of weapons of war. It is a tragedy that people who have endured eight years of devastation of their country and families are again forced to suffer for the gratification of a megalomaniac. It is a tragedy that so many chances for peace over so many years have, again, been lost. The euphoria and the hope that followed the crumbling of the Iron Curtain are being cremated in Baghdad. So the line is drawn in the sand and we must stand and we must fight. There is now no alternative. Saddam Hussein must be stopped. His greed and his self-interest must be overcome and we must be united in working with the United Nations to achieve a lasting peace and respect among all nations of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I commend, and join, all of those people who have persevered with prayers for peace. I sincerely hope that our prayers will soon be answered. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise, as have other honourable members, in this debate to support this motion and I know that most Australians would support the motion as well. It is indeed no coincidence that so far all speakers in this debate, as representatives of the Australian people, have enthusiastically supported the motion. We all recognise, and we feel very strongly, that war is an horrific thing, but in this particular instance the choice is between war or appeasement. That is a very difficult choice because instinctively people may look to appeasement. But we have to face up to the fact that the first choice is resolution based on foresight and the second choice is peace at any price, which will lead to far greater consequences than the bloody war that is already taking place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This tragedy goes back many years. Some people have argued that it has its roots in the Ottoman Empire and the break-up of the Ottoman Empire after the First World War. But perhaps we could go back to the late 1960s, to the time when the regional power balance in the Persian Gulf disintegrated with the withdrawal of the British forces from what was described in those days as `east of Suez'. The British withdrew on the grounds that they no longer had the financial resources to sustain any military presence in the Persian Gulf and, indeed, beyond. In hindsight perhaps that is understandable, but in withdrawing they left behind a vacuum. I think that showed a lack of foresight. It was an interesting example in history of a government acting without foresight when the British just walked away and left the vacuum and said that the consequences of that were not their business. That contrasted with the effective British presence in the region in 1960 when Iraq threatened to invade Kuwait but, because of the apparent resolution of the British Government at that time, decided to desist. </PARA>
<PARA> After the withdrawal of British forces and with the Arab oil price hikes that followed in the 1970s, into the vacuum came Iraq. Iraq used its oil revenues to build a military machine, while Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and other Middle Eastern countries used their oil revenues to build up their own nations-to build their infrastructure, hospitals, schools, factories, steelworks and the like. Why is it that Iraq used its oil wealth to build a military machine when others did not do that? It is a question that we need to ponder this very day, because the answer to that question is clearly that Iraq aspired to become little more than a regional superpower. </PARA>
<PARA> That assertion is proved by the subsequent actions of Iraq, particularly under the leadership of Saddam Hussein. When Iraq had used the money it obtained from its oil reserves to build up its military machine, it then went to war with Iran in 1980 at a time when it judged that Iran was particularly weak as a result of the Iranian revolution. It believed it could dismember Iran and become the most powerful nation in the region. It was a cynical, horrific and bellicose decision that not only cost one million lives, but also left Iraq with a debt of about $80 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> So with that debt, Iraq inevitably faced an economic catastrophe. To solve its economic catastrophe, Saddam Hussein viewed the simple solution to be an increase in oil prices because at the time oil prices were not high. But how could he force up oil prices? He could not do that on his own. He started by complaining that the Kuwaitis would not increase oil prices, that the Saudis would not increase oil prices, and then as a simple way to resolve that problem, he sent his forces in brutally, not only to invade, but to occupy Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> That was a convenient course for Saddam Hussein because it is worth reflecting that Kuwait had lent the Iraqis $20 billion to help pay for their war effort against Iran. So immediately a debt of $20 billion was wiped off and Iraq was able to claim 19 per cent of the world's oil reserves. As a consequence, Iraq took the view-which has turned out to be a false and short-sighted view-that with 19 per cent of the world's known oil reserves, it would be able to rebuild its economy and, above all, rebuild its war machine so it could continue with the aspirations that it so clearly spelt out for some 15 to 20 years to anybody who watched the politics of the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> The invasion of Kuwait, as many have said in this debate, was cruelly reprehensible and totally illegal. And that is why the point made by the previous speaker-that people should demonstrate first and foremost outside the Iraqi Embassy over the reprehensible invasion and occupation of Kuwait-is such an important one. If we, as an international community, now turned our back on Kuwait, it would not only raise moral questions about abandoning a small country to an invasion and, worse, occupation by a neighbouring aggressor, but also after 12 resolutions of the United Nations and the final agreement by the Security Council to resolutions without any of those members exercising a veto, it would simply abandon the United Nations system at a critical time in its history when it actually can work. It would be to leave the United Nations as an expensive, exclusive debating club for diplomats, a glittering and chic club, but utterly meaningless in the daily lives of ordinary people. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and others have pointed out, that is precisely what happened to the League of Nations. Manchuria was invaded. People thought it was just too bad. Abyssinia was invaded by Italy. People thought it was just a bit of a shame. Austria was invaded through what was known as the Anschluss in 1938. What a shame; bad luck for Austria. It just happened to get in the way of Nazi Germany. Finally, Czechoslovakia was invaded and that was too bad as well. </PARA>
<PARA> The League of Nations therefore became totally irrelevant and the Western powers at that time, the allied powers as they came to be known, abandoned the League of Nations effectively by turning their backs on it and instead pursued a policy of appeasement. The price of that policy of appeasement was 50 million lives and I and other members of this chamber do not want to be party to a policy which in any way could remotely repeat the horrific mistake of the 1930s. Surely we are going to learn something from history; this is one of the great lessons we ought to take note of. </PARA>
<PARA> We also have to do more than just support the United Nations system. We have to do more than support the rights and the territorial integrity of Kuwait. As a Parliament and as part of an international community, we need to recognise the implications of an Iraqi victory. By `victory' I mean a victory which would have, at the very least, guaranteed Iraq continued control of Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned earlier that that would have given Iraq 19 per cent of the world's oil reserves. I do not doubt, and I do not think many governments around the world doubt, that Iraq, having obtained 19 per cent of the world's oil reserves, having rebuilt its war machine, would have quickly moved in under the cover of some excuse to gobble up Saudi Arabia as well and then control 44 per cent of the world's known oil reserves. All of that wealth would be in the hands of a man such as Saddam Hussein. He would be the man, to use a phrase, who would control the windpipe of the world. I think that is a terrifying prospect. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me almost incredible that people could talk about the oil considerations in this war as being in some way immoral. If we actually look at the issues and contemplate the implications of Saddam Hussein controlling the windpipe of the global economy, then we can start to understand, even at the practical level, why his invasion of Kuwait and possibly his subsequent invasion of Saudi Arabia, had he not been resisted, would have been a catastrophe for the world. </PARA>
<PARA> First, it is clear from all he did and said last year and the year before that he would use that power to force up oil prices. Some people may not think that would matter very much, that we should in any case resort to windmills and tidal power and so on, which in the short term are totally impractical. The consequence of the massive increases in oil prices that he would have imposed on the world would have been a collapse in the living standards not of the rich, but of poorer people in the Western world and, above all, a collapse in the living standards of people in developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a second very major concern about making, through a policy of appeasement, Saddam Hussein the virtual dictator of the Middle East, because one of the other ambitions he clearly has is to destroy Israel. I do not doubt for one minute that with 44 per cent of the world's oil reserves, with all the wealth that he would accrue from that, he would then launch a crusade against Israel. And I think all of us recognise the quite extraordinary implications, both in a military sense and a human sense, of such a war which Saddam Hussein doubtless would want to pursue. </PARA>
<PARA> If we doubt that, then we must ask ourselves why it is that he should have launched, in recent days, missile attacks on Israel when Israel has not been party to this dispute. Is that something peace groups in Australia and other parts of the world condone? Do they condone the use by Saddam Hussein of Scud missiles, inaccurate as they are, as weapons only of terror, to bomb cities such as Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, Haifa and others? That is a clear indication of one of Saddam Hussein's long term objectives. That is an objective that I find utterly reprehensible and that has to be stopped. So anybody who thinks that the issues of oil prices, the long term security of Israel, and the security and relevance of United Nations system and the international legal system are not important, is frankly profoundly foolish.</PARA>
<PARA> Let us remember that despite all of these things, over the last five months the world has given Saddam Hussein a chance. Many honourable members have already spoken of the 12 United Nations resolutions. There have been numerous attempts to negotiate. When people say, `Why not negotiate?', have they been deaf for the last five months? Have they not heard of the negotiations that have taken place; the endeavours by the Arab League to negotiate with Saddam Hussein, who has arrogantly swept aside his Arab brothers, as he may have described them, and said that he would retain occupation of a neighbouring Arab country?</PARA>
<PARA> Have people not heard of the European Community's attempts, of French, British, German, and Spanish attempts-the list goes on-to persuade Saddam Hussein to negotiate the withdrawal from Kuwait? Have people not heard of the endeavour by James Baker in Geneva to negotiate with the Iraqi Foreign Minister and the Iraqi Foreign Minister's refusal to accept even a letter from President Bush to President Saddam Hussein?</PARA>
<PARA> Have people not heard of even people such as President Kaunda of Zambia trying to talk sense to Saddam Hussein? Finally, have people not heard of Perez de Cuellar's last and unsuccessful attempt to reach some sort of basis of negotiation with Saddam Hussein? They have all failed. With sanctions which initially reduced the gross domestic product of Iraq by 10 per cent on top of these attempts to negotiate, still there was not the slightest sign that Saddam Hussein would withdraw from Kuwait. As a result, the world, including Australia, has been faced with two terrible choices: either we go to war with Saddam Hussein and liberate Kuwait and eliminate all those dangers that I have described, or we run away today and tomorrow we face the horrific consequences of our folly. I, for one-and I know other members of this House would agree and have said so during this debate-would not choose the second path. It may be a populist path, but it is a path that would lead to greater death and destruction than the first very difficult path. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion moved today by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). In doing so, it is necessary that as Minister for Resources with responsibility for petroleum matters I advise the Parliament about our oil supply situation and outlook. But before doing so I will take just a few minutes to place on the public record my strong and full support for the Australian Government's decision to make available Australian naval ships and medical teams to support the United Nations resolution to pursue `all necessary means' to force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. Australia's commitment of ships and medical teams to the Gulf has been made squarely within the framework of the United Nations Security Council's resolutions and the United Nations Charter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While the security of the world's oil supply is clearly a relevant factor in our policy considerations, this is not a war which is just about oil, although it is true to say that both in the context of Saddam Hussein's invasion of Iran and subsequently his invasion of Kuwait, oil was a primary consideration in his mind. But our role is foremost and manifestly about fundamental human rights and the world order. </PARA>
<PARA> The armed conflict in the Gulf, as previous speakers have indicated, did not start in January. It started on 2 August when Saddam Hussein launched his brutal and on any criteria whatsoever indefensible invasion and occupation of Kuwait. Iraq is in contempt of 12 mandatory United Nations (UN) resolutions. It has systematically and deliberately pillaged Kuwait and, according to recent Amnesty International reports, it has perpetrated massive human rights violations against the Kuwaiti people, ruthlessly applying illegal detention, torture, rape and summary execution. This is all, of course, separate and distinct from Saddam Hussein's despicable rocket attacks on Israeli cities and civilians. </PARA>
<PARA> The lessons of the 1930s should not and cannot be ignored. Put bluntly, military aggression must not in this instance be rewarded. Moreover, Australia's security interests depend very much on our having an international framework capable of upholding the security of middle and small sized countries. As the Prime Minister said in Parliament on 4 December, we clearly have a direct interest in the establishment and maintenance of an international order based on the Charter of the United Nations. It is for these and for many other reasons that I therefore strongly support our involvement in the Gulf alongside the coalition of 28 countries which have committed forces in support of the UN Security Council resolutions. </PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated just a few minutes ago, it is necessary that as Minister for Resources I inform the Parliament of our oil supply situation and outlook. I would also like to advise of the decision by the governing board of the International Energy Agency, of which Australia is a member, to agree to a contingency plan for coordinated emergency response measures and also to advise on the general outlook for the world oil market as currently assessed. </PARA>
<PARA> At the outset, I would like to stress that Australia is well placed in terms of our oil situation to cope with the impact of developments in the Gulf. We are around 85 per cent self-sufficient in oil supplies. We have adequate stocks and through our policies of exposing consumers to the full implications of international oil prices, we have already experienced significant reductions in domestic petroleum demand since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August. That invasion on 2 August 1990 and the subsequent embargo on oil exports from both countries temporarily removed some 4.2 million barrels per day from the market, representing around 8 per cent of Western world consumption. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to advise that since then this shortfall has been largely made up through increases in output by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries, mainly Saudi Arabia, and some non-OPEC production. Overall Western world supply in the fourth quarter of 1990 is estimated at 53.9 million barrels per day, almost the same as the average quarterly production prior to the August invasion of some 54 million barrels a day. OPEC production in December 1990, without the contribution from Iraq and Kuwait, is estimated at around 24 million barrels per day, also about the same as just prior to the invasion. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to higher oil prices, world consumption in the last quarter of 1990 declined about 0.6 per cent compared to the same quarter in 1989. The decline was somewhat higher for Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, approaching some 3 per cent. At current prices the world oil markets are generally well supplied. </PARA>
<PARA> Reflecting this improvement in supply and the decline in demand, crude oil stocks continue at high levels. Total OECD stocks on 1 January 1991 were estimated at almost 470 million tonnes, the highest beginning of the year stock level since 1982. This is sufficient for 96 days of current consumption, four days higher than the year before, and some 20 days higher than the stock coverage just prior to the 1979-80 oil shock crisis. In addition, there is an estimated 50 to 60 million barrels of unsold oil afloat and in store, additional to what is regarded as typical levels. </PARA>
<PARA> International oil prices have, of course, been extremely volatile, rising from about $US18 per barrel in July to peak at over $US40 per barrel in late September and early October and falling back to below $US30 per barrel in November and December. As honourable members would be aware, in recent days prices for Brent and West Texas have slumped to less than $US20 per barrel. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has responded to these international developments in a number of ways. On the supply side, over the five months to November 1990, our domestic production of crude oil and condensate was 11 per cent higher than in the same period of the previous financial year. Surge production is equivalent to 2 per cent of current production. Thus, around 12,000 barrels per day of additional production have been induced by producers making extra efforts to meet the market's requirements since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Increased production has been principally from offshore north-west Australia, higher condensate production from the North West Shelf and from the Cooper Basin. </PARA>
<PARA> On the demand side, increases in petroleum product prices and slower economic activity have already caused significant reductions in petroleum demand since August 1990. Monthly demand reductions since then, compared to the corresponding month a year earlier, have averaged around 5 per cent with preliminary figures for December showing that sales of petrol and diesel are down 5.2 and 10.2 per cent respectively. Mr Speaker, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table prepared by my Department showing the percentage movements in petroleum demand since July 1990. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0H4">Mr GRIFFITHS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to emphasise that the supply and demand response I have outlined did not just happen. It is the outcome of deliberate Government policies which have created the climate for producers to increase their production and for consumers to exercise conservation in their fuel use. While the higher prices have caused some hardship, of course, they have not been at levels which have impacted unduly on our economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Moreover, despite criticisms from certain quarters which are frequently made about our oil pricing policies, it bears repeating yet again that we have the third lowest petrol price among OECD countries and the second lowest level of petroleum taxes. Over the last few months when Australian consumers have been paying around 75c per litre for petrol, consumers in our major trading partners have been paying considerably more-for example, in Italy, $1.65 per litre; Germany, $1.10; Britain, $1.15; and France and Japan, around $1.35. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, because the excise on fuel is volume and not price based, the decline in sales which has occurred since the Iraqi invasion has resulted in a loss of revenue to the Government and not the windfall gain which certain interest groups have been trumpeting. Whatever gains the Government might make from increased oil excise revenues as a result of higher oil prices at higher production levels will have to be weighed against the losses from excise on lower petroleum product sales to which I have referred. The balance could well be negative but in that context we shall have to wait and see. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to prices, the Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA) has done an excellent job insulating consumers from the volatility and speculative influences of the market. By adopting a pricing formula based on a rolling average of those oil and petrol prices most relevant to the Australian market, the PSA has ironed out the peaks and troughs in prices and given consumers a less volatile price than the market, left to its own devices, would have provided. </PARA>
<PARA> The PSA is currently reviewing its pricing policy and in this process one thing is certain-the consumer will be foremost in the PSA's thinking about the most appropriate pricing system. The alarmist claims that petrol prices will soar as a result of the war are not in the best interests of the community. The ridiculous figures I have seen reported in some quarters recently are not supported by the market assessments being made by those in industry and elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, instead of the price hike that was forecast, we are currently seeing a major downturn in prices. Increased supplies, lower demand and higher stocks, plus the contingency plan of the International Energy Agency (IEA) to meet any potential shortfall are all exerting a powerful downward influence on price. Many commentators and analysts are now forecasting even lower international oil prices once the situation returns to manageable proportions.</PARA>
<PARA> On the international front, the governing board of the International Energy Agency announced on 17 January that it had agreed to a contingency plan for coordinated emergency response measures to be adopted by member countries in response to the outbreak of open warfare in the Gulf. The IEA's contingency plan commits member countries to achieving, collectively, a reduction in their oil requirements of some 2.5 million barrels per day through a combination of stock draw, demand restraint and surge production. In this regard, major IEA member countries-chiefly the United States of America (USA), Germany and Japan-hold some 800 million barrels in strategic stocks. The United States alone could provide significant supplies from its strategic petroleum reserve.</PARA>
<PARA> If required, the USA, Germany and Japan could meet a significant proportion of the IEA's contingency plan to reduce total IEA's members' oil requirements on world markets by 2.5 million barrels per day. For our part, Australia will meet its IEA obligations by a continuation of the successful policies pursued to date by this Government which have resulted in the degree of demand restraint and surge in domestic oil production already being achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has well established mechanisms for dealing with oil supply disruptions. These include the oil industry and the States being involved in a number of key consultative bodies-the National Petroleum Advisory Committee (NPAC), the National Oil Supplies Advisory Committee (NOSAC) and the National Fuels Emergency Consultative Committee (NFECC). </PARA>
<PARA> All of these bodies have been active over recent weeks and months, with meetings of NOSAC and NFECC being held as recently as 10 January. These committees provide advice on the state of the industry, the market outlook, potential supply difficulties and appropriate measures the Government might consider. Recent advice from NPAC and NOSAC indicates that our supply position is comfortable and that our petroleum stocks are adequate to meet the expected impact of recent developments on world oil markets. </PARA>
<PARA> NPAC, which has as one of its primary functions to advise the Government on the most appropriate options for dealing with petroleum product shortfalls, met in December, at my behest, and discussed the options the Government might consider as a response to the coordinated emergency response measures. We were therefore well prepared when it came to responding to the IEA's contingency plan. </PARA>
<PARA> Time constraints preclude me from going into any further detail on these issues, except to stress the importance of a continuation of Australia's sterling effort over the past 12 months or so in oil exploration and production. It reinforces the absolute necessity in this country to maintain an international pricing system so as not only to encourage conservation of a scarce resource but also to ensure that we have adequate levels of exploration and production in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, it reinforces again that if, after the third oil shock the world has experienced, world consumers, including Australians, are not moved to greater fuel efficiency in motor vehicles and more sensible driving practices, et cetera, then we will really have only ourselves to blame if and when we suffer a further and potentially more dramatic oil shock in the next five, 10 or 20 years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When on the eve of the deadline in resolution 678 of the United Nations Security Council I sent a telegram to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) urging that the House should resume, I did so not just because I knew a debate of this sort would ensue but because the implications of the events that are now occurring in the Middle East are profound for Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The United Nations, in my view, and certainly the United States and President George Bush, have trod the last mile for peace, but there is not peace today in the world, certainly not in the Middle East. It is not their fault; it is the fault of the man Saddam Hussein, labelled the butcher of Baghdad by those who see him and know him well. That man has not been prepared to accept the will of the rest of the world and the direction it would prefer he followed. </PARA>
<PARA> Today in this House this is a somewhat unusual experience for me, in that I support totally the motion and actions of the Prime Minister. I do so because Australia is a smallish to middle size power. In my view, it has a responsibility to play its part not just in this region but internationally. Our country, after all, is slightly smaller than Iraq. It is a nation which has acted always to try to do what it can to protect and preserve the freedoms of which we are proud and to enhance the rights and liberties of individuals, both our citizens and those of other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> On each of the occasions when citizens of Australia have enlisted, when they have fought wars away from this country, they have done so in pursuit of that just cause. So it is when one looks at the enforcement of law through the United Nations, one realises that this motion relates to the only way by which we can take action to pursue those freedoms and to enforce them. </PARA>
<PARA> The United Nations, imperfect instrument that it is, is the successor to the League of Nations. On the last occasion-nearly 2 1/2 months ago-when the House debated this issue, I spoke of something of the origins of the League. I said then that, as the League failed in the 1930s, so too would the United Nations fail and so too would the prospects for peace in the world fail if the world and Australia were not prepared to act in concert and act with the United States, not just in accordance with those other 11 resolutions of the Security Council but in accordance with resolution 678. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a lot of sympathy and understanding for those who protested their wish for peace in this place. Indeed, as several of the speakers in the course of this debate have said, what we are about is the protection of their right to have the opportunity to speak in whatever way they wish on issues that affect their well-being and on issues that affect, as they see it, the conduct of the affairs of the world. But they should realise that, if they are beset with a murderer or a burglar or a criminal or somebody seeking to intrude in their lives, they are the first to rush to the police to seek to enforce in some way the protection that they seek around their own lives. So must the United Nations act. </PARA>
<PARA> As several speakers have said, in clause 51 of the United Nations Charter there is recognition of the right to act in self-defence. In this instance there has been a succession of Security Council debates, there has been a succession of visits and, as President Bush has said, the world has tried in every possible way to tread that last mile for peace. But there are occasions when, if we are going to accept that peace alone should prevail, then in exactly the same way as the League of Nations failed, in exactly the same way as millions have lost their lives fighting seemingly needlessly to try to protect the rights and freedoms of individuals, so too we would have found the ultimate conclusion of Saddam Hussein's actions in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> Make no bones about it: it is not just Kuwait; it is Saudi Arabia. It is not just yesterday's victory; it is not just his victory of 2 August, about which Saddam Hussein is concerned; it is tomorrow's victory and that of the day after tomorrow. We need to remember that he has acted against his own minority, the Kurdish minority. He has acted against the dissidents in his own state; he has acted in every way to oppose those who have tried to assert their right to be different. He has acted in a way which makes him totally alien to the rule of law. Because we believe in the rule of law, because we seek to preserve peace, do not let anybody, whether in the gallery or in public, feel that had we acted other than as the Australian Government and the world have, peace could be protected or the rights of individuals could be in any way preserved. The sad part is that in their condemnation they have condemned George Bush. In my view, without the United States the sanctions of the United Nations would be meaningless. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us realise that, just as in the days of what was called British gunboat diplomacy when, if there was a rule of law in the world it was protected through the rights and the opportunities that Britain gave to other countries, since World War II it has been the responsibility of the United States. In my view no American President has acted more forthrightly. No American President has tried to pursue the cause of peace to a greater degree than has President George Bush in this instance. I am not uncritical of the Americans in many instances. I am not uncritical of their behaviour in other issues, but I believe President George Bush and the United States have acted with total propriety. If those who seek peace wish to demonstrate, I would suggest that they pursue their actions against Iraq, against Saddam Hussein and against those who have broken the peace, not against those who seek to uphold it. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr SINCLAIR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You, my friend, are one for whom this Parliament exists. You, my friend, are what this is all about, and you are the one who seeks to deny it. I trust that tomorrow you will try to write to Saddam Hussein and that you will try to do something to protect and preserve the rights and freedoms in which we believe. It is sad that a man like you-man if you are-tries to assert his rights improperly and irresponsibly in that way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second issue that I wanted to raise is a product of the defence commitment that Australia now has. I feel it is unfortunate that the Government has forgotten how it committed itself in the 1987 White Paper. On the last occasion on which I spoke in this House, I spoke a little about my concern regarding the military procurement program. I do not believe that the Anzac vessels would be capable of exercising the same role in the Middle East as the DDGs and the FFGs that are serving there. I am concerned that, with regard to procurement and in the policy that this Government has adopted in pursuit of trying to defend this country, while its objectives of self-defence are highly laudable, the steps that it has taken to achieve that self-defence down the line mean that, when each of the DDGs and FFGs are no longer in service, the vessels that we will have left in service would deny Australia the opportunity to play the role we are now playing in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable members read the White Paper they will see that there is reference to the Middle East and there is a slight qualification at the end of the relevant clause. It says that perhaps there are occasions in accordance with our United Nations obligations when we might need to take steps other than in accordance with defending Australia against regional offence. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to this House that one of the reasons why it is essential that this Parliament meets is so that we consider again the implications, as the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has said, of the present Australian defence strategy. I do not believe that the strategic analysis made of Australia in 1987 is relevant any longer. Twelve months ago we extolled the merits and virtues of perestroika and glasnost. We accepted the new world order. We accepted that when West Germany and East Germany saw the breakdown of the Berlin Wall there was a new opportunity for peace around the world. For Australia, it seemed there was no longer a hostile power about whose ambitions or aspirations we need be concerned. But today that is not so. Our territorial sovereignty may not be immediately threatened, and certainly I am one of those who believe that oil is part of the reason for the conflict in the Middle East. But do not let anyone be beguiled into thinking that oil is not important for our standard of living. Oil is important also for trying to improve and deliver the aspirations of the Third World. </PARA>
<PARA> An incident having occurred in the gallery-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5E4">Mr SINCLAIR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Oil is a vital infrastructure for the development and progress of this world and the only way by which we are going to be able to protect opportunities for those like you, madam, who seek to prosper and flourish in the future, is to try to ensure that there is power to assist you and there is adequate availability of energy for application. I feel sad that people like you are unable to see that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is very sad that, in looking at the future in terms of energy, there is not a recognition that we do need to do something to try to protect oil supplies. I say that Australia's national interests are involved. While that Defence White Paper and Australia's strategic bases assessment were published only a few years ago, in the light of the events in the Middle East it is now time to revamp that White Paper, to reassess our priorities. Of course, we accept the economic disciplines, and that is yet another issue which we in this House need to deliberate upon, because there is a price that we must pay, and the price is a dear one in the circumstances of Australia's present economic plight. I think it is important that we analyse the consequence of that and try to see to what degree within this country we can afford or we cannot afford to enhance our present defence effort, our defence capacity. I think that is the second part of the deliberations upon which this House must spend some time. </PARA>
<PARA> I come to the third aspect of the events in the Middle East that I think we need to be concerned about-that is, the substance of my initial telegram, which urged the Prime Minister to meet, not just to debate this proposed resolution, but to look at those longer term consequences. It has been said in this House today that we commend the State of Israel for its forbearance. Like the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), I am not uncritical, but I am a sustaining advocate for the State of Israel. I am concerned that as far as the future is concerned we need to look at the long term future of events in the Middle East. The last item of today's motion addresses that very question.</PARA>
<PARA> There are other issues that affect us. We have the problems of the cost of the war in the Gulf. We have the difficulties of reparation for those agricultural products to which reference has been made in this debate and which the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), the shadow Minister for primary industry, addressed in a press statement the other day. We have the difficulties of future markets. We have the difficulties of what sort of a commitment there will be to Iraq and Kuwait after this war is over. We need to remember that our object is to drive the Iraqis out of Kuwait, not to occupy Iraq. We need to work out whether there is to be an obligation for a peacekeeping force. We need to work out in what way and to what degree with respect to Kuwait there is going to be a future guarantee of territorial integrity. We need to register too that as far as Saudi Arabia is concerned the problems of its enhanced security risk no doubt will continue. Those matters mean that this Parliament cannot only meet today or tomorrow, and we cannot address only the narrow confines within which there is bipartisan support for the motion of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> This motion deserves total support from everybody in this place. If anybody dissents-I suspect there may well be some-it will only be to try to accrue some temporary and rather elusive popularity. The reality is that if we are going to try to enforce peace and provide opportunities for all of that in which we believe, we must support this motion. We as a Parliament must then look beyond this proposed resolution, look to a few of those other issues to which I very briefly alluded, and we must remember that unless we do so we are going to fail in our responsibility to those constituents who elected us. </PARA>
<PARA> There is at this time in the Middle East a great deal of uncertainty and anguish amongst those who are serving there. I commend the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) for visiting the naval forces and other detachments in the Middle East over Christmas. At the same time I think all of us feel equally for those who wait at home. All of us have some in our electorates. All of us know of the concern and anxiety that is in their hearts about the early and safe return of their loved ones. </PARA>
<PARA> I assure those who are serving in the Middle East that anything that I have said about the Australian Defence Force excludes them. I think that all of us have nothing but absolute admiration for the professionalism, competence, energy, enthusiasm and devotion to the task as shown by Australia's service men and service women. There is little doubt that those who are today committed in the Middle East maintain the high traditions of Anzac; they maintain the high traditions of their grandfathers, fathers and brothers. We wish them an early and safe return, and we trust that a product of their labour will be to genuinely achieve peace in the Middle East. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;An issue and a debate of this kind tend to produce a number of positions in terms of public comment, and it is very interesting that some people in this world-and we have heard some of them this afternoon, not in this chamber but in the galleries-have the tendency to opt for a position of moral authority and clarity of conscience; sometimes they claim a monopoly of that and see themselves as being the only principled people in a world in which the rest of the people act without principle. I want to challenge that very directly and, in this respect, point to some of the deficiencies of their position. But I also want to point them out for those who claim that they have it all clear in their minds; there are some even in the other chamber who believe they have that degree of virtue that is not possessed by us in this chamber. Again, I resent and oppose that and I intend to overturn it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do so for this reason: the difficulty of being in this world is that one is part of the world and one is part of the business of making difficult decisions. Sometimes those decisions do not lend themselves so easily to clear positions and to people being able to stand back and say that the world is a perfect place. </PARA>
<PARA> I use an analogy. The people who developed the bomb in World War II-Enrico Fermi, Leo Szilard and Albert Einstein-did not want the bomb dropped on human beings; they did not seek the decimation of populations in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. However, in developing the bomb at Los Alamos, they knew that, if Hitler had developed the bomb before them, the question of civilisation, as in our view, would be null and void. If Hitler had developed the bomb before the West had developed the bomb, there is no doubt that this world would be a very different place. There is really considerable doubt as to whether even a chamber of this kind would exist in Australia. For those who would stand back and say, `I condemn those people; I condemn Szilard, Fermi and Einstein for the work they did at Los Alamos', my response to them is, `It is all very well to do that, but what would you have done to stop Hitler; what would you have done to turn around the tide of tyranny?'. </PARA>
<PARA> One of our former senators sent me a letter last week, saying that we are obviously part of the United States of America conspiracy, that this is just a further extension of USA imperialism and asking what Australia is going to do and when we are going to withdraw from the Gulf. I sent her a letter back in which I said, `I have, however, only one question to ask of you: what would you have done to stop Saddam Hussein invading Saudi Arabia?'. She has not responded because unlike her--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Howard" NAMEID="ZD4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AG4">Mr RONALD EDWARDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will do. Unlike the former senator, we in this place do not have and President Bush does not have the luxury of standing back and simply saying, `If I hold up a placard, Saddam Hussein will take his finger off the starter button of those tanks and not invade Saudi Arabia'. The problem with the world is that we are in it and we have to deal with it and we have to make real world decisions-decisions that I see people in this place make on many occasions, with good conscience and with considerable concern. That is what marks today's debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So all that those who come here to try to lecture us-and, incidentally, to try to shout us down-do is to act within the tradition of dogma that was characterised by Hitler and Stalin, shouting and screaming in the absence of good argument. What we have seen here today is good argument. What we are getting is dogma, and we have to reject that dogma totally. Maybe they are misguided; maybe they do not understand the actions that they carry out. But it has to be said that the purpose of freedom is to conduct a reasoned debate about important issues; civilisation rests upon that. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to some of the positions from which they operate and deal with what I would call the spectrum of philosophical positions. Firstly, one has the position of extreme pacifism or general pacifism in which no war and no violence is the ideal. I am sure that we would all support that. But it has been worked through by many people; in fact, it has been a matter that has troubled people such as the libertarian theologians who have often said, `What do you do in a situation of oppression?' If you are a holy person, if you are a priest in Latin America in oppression, do you tell the peasants to revolt? If you are a black in a situation in South Africa, do you tell people to revolt; and does that revolution lead to armed conflict? It is very easy to stand and say yes or no. But what does one do when one is put in the position of actually dealing with the circumstance? Many people with great concern and troubled minds have thought it through. They have come to the conclusion that, in those circumstances of great oppression, violence is justified. </PARA>
<PARA> Nelson Mandela visited the Parliament. I know that this is a matter that troubles many people in this Parliament. But he and many other people of like mind came to that conclusion. That does not make it right; it does not make one morally superior. But one has to understand how it happens. </PARA>
<PARA> To deal with the question of general pacifism, I put this to those people: the world would have been a better place if Hitler had been assassinated early on; the world would have been a better place if Stalin had been assassinated earlier on. The same could be said of Idi Amin and Pol Pot. Sometimes an act of violence early on that minimises subsequent greater violence is justified. That has been argued by many theologians. It is not something that I say casually, and it is not something that people who would opt for that peace position should seek not to address. It has to be addressed. There are circumstances, sadly, in which violence is justified, and even those who take the general pacifist position have to understand that. </PARA>
<PARA> There is the second position which, again, is a much more easily addressed position, that is, that there are circumstances in which one regards a war as unjust. This has been mentioned and I will not labour this point: there were people who held the view-and I did-that the Vietnam war was unjust. However, the important thing on this issue here today is that many of our colleagues on both sides have put together information in a convincing way that says that this is not an unjust war. This is not a situation in which one cannot assemble information to show that the act of war will produce a better outcome. There is clear evidence to show that a properly conducted war can perhaps produce a better outcome. </PARA>
<PARA> Again I say to those who would stand back: it is very difficult being those service people of Australia and other nations at the front line. We must never assume, as some people do in the peace movement, that those people do not have consciences. They do not necessarily want to kill; they do not necessarily want to engage in violence-but someone has to do it. Some people seem to preserve the luxury of saying, `If only someone else will do the dirty work, I can stand back'. The important thing about this debate is that it has been thought through and people are giving considerable thought to the position that they adopt. That is what marks today's debate, and that is why it is important to have it. </PARA>
<PARA> The third position, which is an interesting one, is the utilitarian view that one ought to minimise pain and maximise satisfaction in the world. That is a reasonable position to adopt. But, again, does one minimise the pain of the Kuwaitis and the Saudis and others if one stands back and lets Hussein have his way? The answer is that, clearly, one does not. In fact, it may be better to act against a dictator such as Hussein and cause short term pain, but in the longer term minimise the pain and discomfort for the world at large. The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) has just given evidence in support of that, so I will not cover that in further detail, but I think that is a very clear position. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth point is the one that troubles me most. I say this to many people who may want to consider this debate: what does an open society like ours or any other open society do? Does it extend tolerance to those who are intolerant? It is a troubling question. Does it extend tolerance to people who want to shout it down? It is not an easy question to answer. If one in fact acts in an intolerant way, then one is no longer in an open society. But, if one is not prepared to recognise that sometimes those who are intolerant will take one's open society and crush it, one is very much naive in the ways of the world-and sometimes people have had to act to defend the open society. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are doing in the Middle East is in fact defending the open society because there would not be free speech if Hussein were to take over all of the Middle East. There would not be free speech if Hussein were to have his way in the world in general. I find it ironic that he has managed to link the Palestinian issue and the cause of so-called Palestinian freedom to this manoeuvre in the Middle East. There could not be more opposite positions than that of freedom for Palestinians and that of Saddam Hussein, because the word `freedom' is not one that is consistent with his practice or philosophy whatsoever-and we ought to recognise that. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to a matter that concerns me, and that is the question of Syria. I am not comforted by the fact that Syria is our ally in this matter. Syria has not renounced terrorism. It still holds hostages in the Middle East. I believe that, in fact, the alliance is simply a marriage of convenience for Syria. One of my great concerns about United States intelligence is that sometimes the United States picks the wrong side. It thought that Iran was the terrible enemy. It was numerically strong but technologically weak. However, Iraq technologically was getting stronger and it represented a threat. It troubles me that the enemy of mine enemy is not always my friend. I do not see that Syria is a friend in this circumstance. </PARA>
<PARA> Another issue that concerns me relates to the linkage between Palestine and the Gulf situation. It is important that the Israelis have a right to exist, and that has not been acknowledged completely by the Palestine Liberation Organisation. Until that is acknowledged, I am not one who is prepared to support the position that Israel should somehow be dragged into this. There is an attempt to drag Israel into the conflict by firing missiles at its population. However, it is important to understand that we do not advance the cause of Israel by making that linkage. </PARA>
<PARA> Much has been made of the question of sanctions. The fact is that, if we look at the neighbouring countries of Iraq, it did not make sense for them to have sanctions work. For both Iran and Syria it made more sense for Iraq to be engaged in a war to have Saddam Hussein flattened. For them it was not appropriate to have the sanctions work. Clearly, sanctions were always bedevilled as far as Syria and Iran were concerned and they were going to try to break sanctions. As far as Jordan is concerned, it made economic sense for it to assist in sanctions-breaking because it could make money out of it. </PARA>
<PARA> To those who say we should give sanctions more time, the fact that the three prime neighbours of Iraq had no stake in sanctions working ought to be understood. Therefore, there was only a limited expectation that sanctions would achieve much. However, they were an expression of solidarity on behalf of many countries, and we ought to recognise that as important. </PARA>
<PARA> We come now to the United Nations. As one who has grown up with the belief that the United Nations has a role, it is important to say-and there are many people who would attack both the Government and the Opposition over this-that for the first time the United Nations has rolled up its sleeves and wants to get on with the job. We ought to support that. In this post-Cold War world we now have a situation where the United Nations can deliver, and it is important that we are part of that through resolution 678. </PARA>
<PARA> I move now to the question of diplomatic solutions. It has been said by many honourable members, and I reiterate it, that those who say that diplomatic solutions were not given a chance are quite wrong. We even had the UN Secretary-General at the eleventh hour attempting a face-saving solution to try to avoid war. That was not a fiction; that was a reality. For his trouble, he was lectured in Baghdad for trying to bring peace. For those who would say sanctions, sanctions were not going to work; for those who would say diplomatic solutions, they were tried. I return to the point that, in the face of barbarism, sometimes civilisation will not work. Sadly, the diplomatic solutions, which were of a civilised nature, were not going to succeed in the face of the barbarism of Saddam Hussein. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the media coverage. I think that in many respects this has been an interesting aspect of the whole debate. We have had far more access to information than we have ever had in the past. The other day I heard an editor of the Observer newspaper complaining that it was another attempt by the United States to control the way we thought. I suppose that what he regretted was that reporters could no longer sit in the bar of Raffles Hotel in Singapore and write their press releases. The people who were in the Al Rashid Hotel in Baghdad were behind the lines and were risking getting killed. </PARA>
<PARA> The luxury of what I would call the gin and tonic, leaky-eyed set of World War II has gone out the window. We do actually have some people who are prepared to get in at the sharp end and try to report to us. The fact that much of it has come over unpolished and uncut is to the credit of the people who are getting the information to us. It is for us to decide, but at least the information is being provided. I for one am pleased that people have a chance to assess this information. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, I point out that when we come to an issue such as this-and it is important that we in this Parliament are debating it-it throws up a lot of concerns among people. Australia did not enter this matter lightly; nor did the United Nations; nor did the United States. It is in the interests of Iraq to have the United States bomb civilians in Baghdad, and the United States is not cooperating. In fact, the United States is using its technological superiority to take out military targets. However, the real measure of the issue we are dealing with is that when it came to the possibility of Saddam Hussein bombing people in Tel Aviv, he did not hesitate. Those two issues provide the contrast. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be a lot of shouting about this issue. There will be a lot of attempts to confuse the issue. What it comes down to is that this is a substantially important challenge to the post-Cold War world. I am pleased that we are getting considerable support from a variety of people in regard to this important issue. It is an issue that we as a parliament should be debating, and we are. I say to those people who would take the soft option: there is not a soft option when one's freedom is threatened by the likes of Saddam Hussein. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The speech of the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards), who preceded me in this debate, was a very welcome contribution. The comments from honourable members on this side of the House were testimony to that. No-one who has seen the horror and destruction of war would lightly advocate or support hostilities as a desirable means to attain political objectives. Yesterday at St Mary's Cathedral in Sydney, in a memorial service to the people in Lithuania who recently lost their lives, Cardinal Clancy said that there is perhaps only one greater obscenity than war. He described the tyranny of dictatorship, loss of freedom, oppression of individuals by force, and submission by occupation. He was, of course, describing the situation in the Baltic states, but the lesson is of general application.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The maimed men and women and children crippled by war in Cambodia are matched only by the horror of Pol Pot's killing fields on his own people. The events in the Middle East are not a contest of ideas or ideals. They are not about oil or resources, even though they are incidentally related. They are about the future of human relationships in a very troubled world. The year 1990 showed signs of becoming the genesis of a new world order. From the first crack in the Berlin Wall in November 1989, the collapse of physical and ideological barriers that divided Europe and the world so dangerously for most of this century proceeded rapidly and, for the most part, with less anguish and bloodshed than could have been previously imagined. </PARA>
<PARA> Germany is united; the Warsaw Pact has been dissolved. The democratic reforms sweeping eastern Europe, although welcomed, will produce results that are as unpredictable as were results that led to these remarkable developments in the first place. The end of the Cold War and the evolving relationship between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics have given us hope for the future of a world order characterised by peace, security and freedom. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two significant events that have now cast a shadow of enormous proportion over these developments. First, there are the events in the Baltic states of Lithuania and Latvia which have led to the tragic loss of 14 lives. Totally without justification, the Soviet Union seems determined to stifle any reasonable aspirations of the Baltic peoples to elementary self-determination. Under the shadow of the Gulf war, that cannot be covered up. It grieved me greatly to see and share the anguish of the Baltic people of Australia as these events have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, we have the events of the Middle East where, in an assumed power vacuum, Saddam Hussein of Iraq has moved to take a pan-Arab leadership role and brutally occupy his neighbouring country, Kuwait. This development has singularly altered the strategic landscape of the Middle East. The world is not yet free of dangerous ambitions, animosities, suspicion and greed. Thus, as 1990 drew to a close, the events of the Persian Gulf were to provide a test case for the embryonic new order. How it is resolved will provide a powerful impetus to the direction of global security for the remainder of this century and into the next. </PARA>
<PARA> Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait demonstrates that international lawlessness remains a feature of international relations. Underlying his actions was a belief that the rest of the world and its international agencies were impotent to act in the face of such naked aggression. That invasion of a sovereign state was a legitimate method through which he could pursue his aims. However, the rapid response of the United States, the willingness of the Soviet Union to cooperate on this issue and the unanimity of view of the members of the Security Council of the United Nations (UN) in imposing sanctions against Iraq were all encouraging signs that in the United Nations we might at last be able to realise the hopes upon which it was founded. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter one of the United Nations Charter states that the purposes of the United Nations are:</PARA>
<PARA>1. To maintain international peace and security, and to that end: to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace, and for the suppression of acts of aggression or other breaches of the peace, and to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity with the principles of justice and international law, adjustment or settlement of international disputes or situations which might lead to a breach of the peace. </PARA>
<PARA>In its preamble, it says:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . to ensure by the acceptance of principles and the institution of methods, that armed force shall not be used, save in the common interest. </PARA>
<PARA>These noble sentiments in the end can only be upheld when they are backed by legitimate force. </PARA>
<PARA> The response of the majority of other Arab states to support the UN sanctions against Iraq was also remarkable. Egypt and Syria joined with Saudi Arabia to make up a total of 28 United Nations member states contributing to forces in the Gulf. This represented an important addition to the effort to implement the UN resolutions that Iraq must withdraw from Kuwait. The imposition of a stringent trade embargo against Iraq was a concerted attempt by the nations of the world under the authority of the United Nations to find a peaceful method to end the Iraqi occupation. However, after several months, it was clear that sanctions alone would not force an Iraqi withdrawal. Simple observation from an independent press along with intelligence reports suggests that the borders of Iraq are more than porous and that substantial supplies were still finding their way into that country. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, the resolve of President Hussein to survive the sanctions was underestimated. Iraq is a police state, a dictatorship capable of enforcing the compliance of its people through the most barbaric means. Some people defend his regime on the basis of cultural and religious differences to which we should pay special regard. Unfortunately, little emphasis is placed upon our culture and its emphasis on the sanctity of life, freedom of choice and the individual. </PARA>
<PARA> There should be no doubt that the regime under which Hussein subjected his people and the people of Kuwait after his brutal invasion exemplifies the most flagrant violation of human rights. Amnesty International, which we in this Parliament accord a special and unique credibility, has detailed documentation of these violations, referring specifically to the continued and increasing acts of torture, arrests, summary executions, disappearances and abductions. Amongst the atrocities committed after the invasion of Kuwait, Iraqi forces tortured and executed hundreds of people, including boys as young as 15. The testimony of Kuwaiti refugees is of a horrifying picture of widespread arrests, torture under interrogation, summary executions and extrajudicial killings. One sees in this paper that I have before me case after case, detailed in the most comprehensive way, of the most barbarous acts one human being could commit on another. If I could incorporate the paper in Hansard, I would want to incorporate the methods of torture and ill treatment documented and used against the people of Kuwait- some 36 individual methods of brutality in relation to other human beings of a most excruciating character. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether it is the gouging out of eyes, the hammering of nails into hands, the piercing of skin with pins and staples or the sexual deprivation mentioned, the description is horrifying in the least. I can understand why President Bush read it and cried. Arbitrary arrest and unfair trial of political prisoners, including prisoners of conscience, continue in Iraq. Torture and the application of punishments which constitute cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment remain widespread. </PARA>
<PARA> Even during times of war, nations should be expected to abide by international standards on the protection of civilians and allow access to war zones by representatives of humanitarian organisations, especially the International Committee of the Red Cross and its brother organisation the Red Crescent. Both have been consistently denied access by Iraq. Iraq is in breach of the Fourth Geneva Convention on the treatment of civilians in time of war and deserves vigorous condemnation from the international community. </PARA>
<PARA> Iraq has continued to show its contempt for the rule of law internationally. Not content to hold innocent foreign nationals as hostages before the outbreak of war in direct contravention of resolution 663, Hussein continues to engage non-combatants in this conflict. I refer, of course, to the Scud missile attacks on the civilian population of Israel. Even today, he parades several prisoners of war in the most humiliating fashion before Iraqi audiences-again in contravention of Geneva conventions. The barbarism of this man rivals that of Germany's Adolf Hitler and Cambodia's Pol Pot. As each of them has been indicted by the international community, in victory, serious consideration needs to be given to war crimes trials and prosecution of this man Saddam Hussein. </PARA>
<PARA> Israel is clearly a non-combatant in this conflict; the bombing of its cities is Hussein's attempt to bring it into the conflict and hence create divisions in the United Nations coalition. However, Egypt and Syria both appear to have reaffirmed their commitment to the coalition even if Israel retaliates. Israel has shown extraordinary and commendable restraint by refusing to retaliate, although in international law it has every entitlement to do so. But other non-combatants have also been engaged. Hussein has repeatedly called upon pro-Iraqis around the world to unite in a jihad, a holy war against Western interests. We have witnessed evidence of this in the Philippines, Thailand, the United States, Europe, Pakistan and Indonesia. For all of these reasons, for the type of aggressor we are facing and his vision of dominating the world, the international community is utterly correct in checking the advances of Iraq. In committing its forces with the United Nations coalition in the Persian Gulf, Australia has acted not only in its own interests but in the interests of the international community. </PARA>
<PARA> None of this should be seen as an essentially warmongering posture by the members of the United Nations coalition in the Persian Gulf. It cannot be forgotten that the central issue here is the unprovoked invasion of a sovereign member of the international community by a recalcitrant neighbour and the threat that this posed to the security not only of other states but to the entire region. We did not want war. It is a fallacy to suggest that the UN actions in this conflict caused the war. </PARA>
<PARA> The Middle East consists of regimes which could hardly be called democratic by Western standards and in which the perpetration of human rights violations is endemic. Iraq has long nursed ambitions of a pan-Arabian nation. The Baath Party which Hussein leads is committed to creating a single, united Arab nation stretching from North Africa to the Iranian border. With Iraq's probable defeat, the power vacuum left will create another series of crises in the region. It is quite likely that the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait will lead other Arab states to significantly expand their military spending and essentially intensify competition in this sphere. After these events are over, this will place on us all a special responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The challenge facing the world in the aftermath of the immediate conflict will be to find constructive and enduring ways of safeguarding regional stability and security. The enhancing of support for the United Nations has given it a renewed sense of legitimacy and strength to act with certainty. International law assumes new meaning when it is given force and effect. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of resolving the Middle East crisis requires the continuing perseverance of the international community to promote negotiations between all parties and to impose forcibly on any party a settlement which may be inherently fragile. The political and cultural character of the conflict means that a settlement will only last if it becomes embedded in the politics of the societies of the countries taking part. This will be no easy task. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia should now constructively be encouraging the efforts of the United States, the United Nations and all parties in canvassing options to ensure post-crisis regional security, stability and peace. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I echo the closing remarks of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock). The remarks that I want to make go in some respects to some of the suggestions and some of the concerns that were raised at the end of his speech. In terms of my electorate, I appreciate the efforts of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), along with those of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), to ensure that, as far as Arabic people, people of Islamic background, are concerned, there is no discrimination and there are no wanton attacks on people, and there is a recognition in this community of the multicultural nature of citizenship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I have to say to some extent reflects an interest and an involvement in the peace movement that goes back to when I was 16. I joined the Fellowship of Reconciliation and became involved in questions of peace long before I became involved with the Australian Labor Party (ALP). Yet, I want to speak very much in support of the motion proposed by the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> This conflict with Iraq is the result of an invasion that cannot be condoned. By resolutions Nos 660 and 665, the United Nations (UN) Security Council condemned the Iraqi invasion and authorised that sanctions be enforced. In the face of the failure of all attempts to negotiate a peaceful resolution to Iraq's illegal aggression, the United Nations Security Council, by resolution 678, authorised the use of `all necessary means' to restore international peace and security in the region. `All necessary means', of course, includes the use of force. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is engaged in this conflict because of our condemnation of Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait and because of our support for the United Nations as the most effective and representative means of resolving international disputes. We do not want to prolong this war. The Iraqi people must be paying a terrible price for Saddam Hussein's intransigence. But we cannot move back from our responsibility to support the United Nations resolutions. </PARA>
<PARA> We must look forward, as the previous speaker suggested, to negotiating peace. This conflict cannot go on indefinitely. We must use every feasible opportunity available to us to work for peace. We must be clear that peace in the Middle East will be achieved only through addressing the old as well as the new problems that have arisen. The new world order referred to by the Prime Minister must be a new way of resolving both old and new international disputes following the end of the Cold War. </PARA>
<PARA> The United Nations offers us our best opportunity for the just resolution of disputes. Iraq's illegal territorial moves must be restrained consistent with the United Nations resolutions. The older structural problems in the Middle East must also be addressed, particularly the issue of self-determination for the Palestinian people consistent with the United Nations resolutions and with the security of the Israeli people. </PARA>
<PARA> We are under no illusions about Saddam Hussein's rhetoric in support of Palestinian aspirations for self-determination. The way he has used this issue is a cynical manipulation of the desperation of that hard pressed people. In working to settle the conflict with Iraq, we must support a comprehensive settlement, at least in the longer term, for this pressing issue as well. Indeed, an international peace conference or series of conferences no doubt would help to settle these issues. We must work for the reconstruction of Iraq as a democratic regime and to support and strengthen the role of the United Nations as a peacemaking, peacekeeping, peace enforcing and peace building institution with authority in all countries of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the incredible things about the issue that is before us is the extraordinary unanimity of the countries of the world. It was suggested in our party room this morning that only four countries had failed to indicate at least some support for the approach being taken by the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> The end of the Cold War has provided us with an opportunity for re-formulating the role of the United Nations. Since 1945 the United Nations has often been paralysed by the opposition between the United States (US) and the Soviet Union. The United States and the Soviet Union preserved a balance of sorts in the Middle East based on their well defined interests. There has been little room to move outside of these parameters. </PARA>
<PARA> But we are no longer frozen in our Cold War postures. International conflicts can be resolved on the basis of a much broader representation of interests. The United Nations has recently been successful in peace diplomacy, peacekeeping and election monitoring in some of the world's most troubled regions-Afghanistan, Angola, Lebanon and Namibia-and in settling the Iran-Iraq war. The United Nations has played an important role in alleviating the plight of refugees from regions in conflict. As a medium sized nation, we clearly have an interest in supporting and expanding the role of the United Nations in all aspects of international dispute resolution and peacekeeping. In supporting this role, we must be clear that internationalism is not pacifism. The United Nations has played an important role in constructing a coalition of Arab and Western nations to enforce legitimate interests of the Kuwaiti state and achieve a just peace. </PARA>
<PARA> I pause for a moment just to reflect on that issue. In terms of the peace movement and all of the concerns that are being expressed now, one has to remember that the best elements of the peace movement have always been concerned fundamentally with achieving an international approach. They have been concerned not simply with easy peace but with just peace and with a reconciliation of diverse, competing and often seemingly contradictory interests. The failure to achieve peace has resulted often in immense suffering, but the failure to achieve a just peace results in absolute catastrophe. We have seen that in great wars. </PARA>
<PARA> In pursuing this issue and perhaps thinking in the longer term, it is worth noting that one of the people associated with the Palestine Liberation Organisation, a person who may well in the longer term have played a very constructive role, was killed just a week ago. I refer to Abu Iyad, a founding member of the Palestine Liberation Organisation and someone who was a moderate advocate of peace with Israel. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been said by those who are against this war that Australia should not be involved in what is essentially an Arab dispute and that we are merely following the United States' lead in a dispute that has more to do with the United States' ambitions to act as the world's policeman than with a just resolution to the dispute. I refer those who say that the dispute should be left to Arab states to resolve to the presence of Saudi Arabia, Syria and Egypt in the coalition forces ranged against Iraq. There is a high level of cynicism abroad about the role of the United States in this coalition, but there is no doubt that the US is playing a key role in organising opposition to the Iraqi invasion. This coalition has been negotiated through the forums of the United Nations and it is controlled by the balancing of interests that has to take place before a position can be achieved. Arab governments in Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Syria have found it to be in their best interests to join in this coalition against Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> It is far too simplistic to take the view that any move by the United States in foreign policy is made for what sometimes is regarded as imperialist motives. In the current situation the United States has not only played a leading role in support of UN resolutions, of which there have been 11 on the part of the Security Council, but also it has been prepared to accept a major burden in the war that is being pursued. </PARA>
<PARA> This conflict cannot be equated with any we have been engaged in since the Second World War. We cannot draw parallels, let alone identify this conflict with Vietnam. This conflict has arisen as the result of a clear breach of international law. Saddam Hussein has not accepted that his territorial ambitions should be subject to peaceful negotiations. He has resorted to violence first. He has rejected all overtures offering peaceful negotiations. We simply cannot accept this. </PARA>
<PARA> Hussein is an aggressor. He is in a powerful position. His country has been on a war footing since 1980 when the Iran-Iraq war started. During this time the well-being of his people has never been an important consideration. This has clear implications for the responses that were possible to his invasion of Kuwait. None of the options that faced us were palatable. Hussein has rejected all attempts at peaceful negotiation. To those who are concerned about the peace issue, that is a fundamental fact that needs to be faced up to. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen the incredible price that was paid with regard to the Iran-Iraq war. If we look at this current situation, at all of the efforts made to negotiate-whether through the United Nations, the non-aligned forces or through various individual countries-and we see every attempt rejected, irrespective of the degree of leaning towards the perceived interests and the need to save face, we recognise that at some point a decision needed to be taken that in the end would ensure that the aggression being played out against Kuwait, and which no doubt would have been played out against Saudi Arabia in this desire to dominate the region, had to be rejected. We were faced with passively accepting Saddam Hussein's aggression or moving collectively under the umbrella of the United Nations to remove him, using whatever means were necessary. Given our support for the resolutions through the United Nations, I believe that we have acted as we had to. </PARA>
<PARA> It has to be remembered that Australia and, indeed, the Labor Party have been centrally involved in the United Nations since its inception. Dr Evatt fought for its formation and served with distinction as the first President of the United Nations General Assembly. Amongst other places, we have been peacekeepers in Cyprus, in the Sinai, on the border between India and Pakistan, and in Namibia. </PARA>
<PARA> This, then, is the concrete demonstration above all else of our commitment to human rights and the orderly resolution of international disputes. Our commitment to human rights demands that there be a series of international initiatives to resolve all of the issues which are directly involved in this dispute and which underlie the continuing instability in the Middle East. We can only take those initiatives, we can only move forward, if we achieve a change in the stance of Hussein to one that is consistent with UN resolutions.</PARA>
<PARA> We have had to act. We have had to take on a role as part of a coalition of forces under the umbrella of the United Nations. We are acting in a way that uses force, but our objective is always to achieve a just peace. That there be reconciliation of justice and peace has been fundamental to the concerns of not only the Labor movement but also the broader peace movement throughout the post-war period. One hopes that arising out of this situation in the short term we will be able to achieve peace and in the long term we will be able to achieve a just solution to the structural problems which underlie the instability in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> We have sent our frigates to the Gulf to serve with the multinational peacekeeping force. As other speakers and Ministers have said, I wish those Australian men and women in the force in the Gulf a short stay and a safe return. Those people, who are involved in that extraordinarily dangerous part of the world on our behalf, go with the strength and support of the Australian people and members of this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; This motion presently being debated by the House affirms support for Australia's military contribution as part of the multinational force presently engaged in action in the Gulf. The motion expresses confidence in, and support for, the Australian forces that are a part of that force and it condemns Iraq's attempt to widen the conflict by its unprovoked attack on Israel. The motion also contains a call for peace and stability in the Middle East and, above all, it endorses the role of the United Nations, in particular in seeking to bring to an end the aggression of Iraq against Kuwait.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I support the motion, and I do so for two principal reasons. The first reason is that the motion upholds and supports the role of the United Nations and it is, I believe, very appropriate that at this time-probably the most testing of all times for the United Nations-we should lend our unanimous and unqualified support to the world body. Perhaps the most concise and accurate way of making this point is to note the remark made by Mr Andreotti, the Italian Prime Minister, on 15 January. He said that what we were faced with here was not a dispute between the United States and Iraq, but a dispute between the United Nations and Iraq. Indeed, that is true because the history of this dispute, which has brought it to the stage of open warfare, is in fact the history of the flagrant and brazen refusal of Iraq to comply with a whole series of resolutions passed by the Security Council of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> Those resolutions commenced with resolution 660 which was passed on 2 August 1990-the same day, of course, as the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq. It condemned the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and demanded that Iraq withdraw immediately and unconditionally. I mention that resolution specifically because it will be noted that the Security Council, properly and accurately in my view, described what had happened in Kuwait-that is, that it had been invaded by Iraq. The motion before this House states merely that Iraq has been guilty of aggression, and of course it has been guilty of aggression. Upon reflection, it probably would have been better if our motion had stated plainly, as did the United Nations resolution, that what we are dealing with here is purely and simply an invasion, for that is exactly what it is-and, I might add, an invasion of one Arab country by another Arab country. </PARA>
<PARA> Be that as it may, since resolution 660 was passed-and, of course, that was over five months ago-Iraq has failed to comply with it. Not only has it failed to comply with that resolution of the Security Council, but also it has made it abundantly clear that it refuses to comply with it and that it will never comply with it. Since then, the Security Council has passed 11 other resolutions all directed at prising free the iron grip that Iraq has imposed on Kuwait. That series of resolutions culminated in resolution 678 which was passed on 29 November. That resolution did two very important things: firstly, it authorised member states of the United Nations to use all necessary means to uphold and implement resolution 660 to force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. The second thing of importance that the resolution did was to request all states to provide appropriate support for action taken to achieve that end. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention these matters in some detail because when that detail is examined it makes it plain, beyond any doubt at all, that the forces led by the United States-forces of which Australia is a part-are acting with all of the authority and legitimacy of United Nations approval. It makes it equally clear that Australia is acting with all of the authority and legitimacy of a request from the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA> I return, therefore, to that concise remark made by the Italian Prime Minister because, when one looks at the history of those resolutions of the Security Council, one can see just how accurate his remark was-that this dispute is now a dispute between Iraq and the United Nations. So let us have no more of this cant and hypocrisy that unfortunately we have had in recent days-in particular, the cant and hypocrisy that we hear from the so-called peace demonstrators-that this is some sort of war launched by the United States and its allies. It is not that; it is a military action to enforce the courageous attempt by the United Nations to bring to an end the illegal invasion and occupation of one member state of the United Nations by another. </PARA>
<PARA> I said at the outset that there were two reasons why I support this motion and I have given the first reason-that it is in support of United Nations resolutions. The second reason I support this motion which is now before the House is that, frankly, it is time that Iraq and the criminal despot who rules it were brought to account and taught a sharp lesson. This dictator, as we know from our studies, has enslaved his own people. He has dragged them into a ruinous war with Iran; he has used chemical weapons to kill his fellow countrymen; he has openly used murder and all of the apparatus of state tyranny; and now, on top of all of that, he has invaded a neighbouring country and tried to enslave that country and its people. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us get down to the reality of what this is all about. We are dealing with Saddam Hussein-not with some modern day Saladin who is fighting against unbelievers for some just or holy cause; that is not what we are dealing with at all. Saddam Hussein is not fighting for a Palestinian state either. Indeed, it must be obvious to everyone that, if there were a Palestinian state and if it stood in his way, he would invade it with the same enthusiasm with which he invaded the Kuwaiti state. </PARA>
<PARA> But, if there were any doubts about Saddam Hussein's true colours, surely those must now have been dispelled by his unprovoked and callous missile attacks on Israel. What is so monstrous about this most recent conduct is that not only have his missiles been launched recklessly against Israel, endangering the lives of civilians who were not even parties to the dispute, but also that they have been thrown against Israel deliberately and intentionally in the hope that civilians will be killed, and clearly with the intention of provoking Israel into retaliation. That this man and his regime have to be brought to heel is now, I believe, quite beyond argument. </PARA>
<PARA> I will add this about Israel, now that it has been necessary to mention that country, although it was never a party to any of the issues between Iraq and Kuwait: the world now owes an enormous debt to Israel for the restraint it has shown. At no other time and to no other country would we say, `Yes, we know you have been attacked; we know that missiles have been rained down on your citizens; we know that your citizens' lives have been put at risk; but please do not retaliate'. There is no other country to which we would say that. </PARA>
<PARA> Israel always seems to have to bear a heavier burden than other countries. It is always expected to show greater restraint than other nations, as it has done again this time. I venture to say after this matter is finalised, we will concede, on my part willingly, that Israel acted with our eternal gratitude. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion involves Israel and it involves the Palestinian issue. For that reason, there is a danger that some people will read the motion as having some sort of link between the current war and the Palestinian issue. For my part, there is no such link. In the first place, the Palestinian issue was never the original excuse or even the ostensible justification for the invasion of Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, let us be realistic about it: if there were no Palestinian issue and even if there were a Palestinian state, Saddam Hussein would have invaded Kuwait on the same day and for the same reasons. Thirdly, when the so-called Palestinian issue is solved, it will not be solved as part of the issues presently racking the Persian Gulf. We must acknowledge the leadership in this issue by the United States and particularly the leadership of the President of the United States. There are many other matters that one could refer to in this debate, but the issues coming from the motion are now fairly clear as this debate unfolds. </PARA>
<PARA> We commit ourselves in the motion to the ongoing role of the United Nations in promoting world peace. We affirm our support here for Australia's response and we acknowledge the enormous contribution being made by Australians in so many ways in the course of this dispute as it unfolds. The House deplores this monstrous attempt by Iraq to widen the conflict by its unprovoked attack upon Israel. Finally, although, as I say, for my part and for the part of most people, it cannot be said that there is any direct link between the two issues, the House acknowledges that there is an ongoing and continuing need to establish peace and stability in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a tragic matter and one can only hope that Iraq comes to its senses very quickly. One can only hope that before too much more time has passed, Australians who are taking an active part in the war are brought home safely and we can express in a tangible form our appreciation for the great contribution they are making today. </PARA>

Yet as a member of the House of Representatives, as part of my duties I regularly attend sub-branch meetings of the local Returned Services League and the Vietnam Veterans Association, which is extremely active on the central coast of New South Wales where my electorate is located. </PARA>
<PARA> As a member of parliament I cannot help noticing the physical and psychological damage done to veterans of past conflicts, not to mention the suffering of widows and orphans because a father or a mother may have been lost in a previous conflict. I do not for one moment doubt the horror of war which people have suffered in the past conflicts. And this conflict is shaping up as one which will probably be more horrible than most. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time I have to ask those people who are against Australia's participation in the allied forces: are you a total pacifist-an absolute pacifist-or are you someone who believes that there are some just wars where you would be prepared to serve your country? I do not deny that there are some people who say that they are absolute pacifists. They think that all war is wrong and that there are absolutely no circumstances in which a war would be just. I have to ask those people to think about days gone by when, but for the grace of God, they could have had to make a decision as to whether they would take up arms. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, many people throughout the world, including a large number of Australians, went to Spain to fight during the Spanish Civil War because they believed that fascism was making its first attempt to gain control of a country in Europe. Many Australians disagreed with their decision to take up arms and fight for what they thought was freedom and liberty in Spain. </PARA>
<PARA> If perhaps such a person were a French man or woman in occupied France during World War II, would he or she have refused to join the French Resistance in the valiant efforts that it made to bring about the earliest possible eviction of the Nazi occupied forces of France? To bring the issue a bit closer to home, I might ask whether, as Australians during the Second World War, they would have joined any of the defence forces or the civil defence to try to stop the Japanese expansionism and its onward march south throughout the Malayan peninsula, through to Papua New Guinea, with the ultimate aim of occupying Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> If such people can tell me that in each of those three cases they would never consider taking up arms to fight for what they believed was right, then I might start to believe that perhaps they are absolute pacifists, that perhaps those people would never in any circumstances take up arms. That is not my point of view and, to be honest, I suspect most of the people who attended the demonstrations could contemplate circumstances when they may think it would be right to take up arms. That is why I say to them that perhaps the question really is not whether we have to give peace a greater chance, but whether this is a just war. Is this one of those terrible times when men and women of goodwill have to take up arms in a just war?</PARA>
<PARA> The issues which then should be considered are these: we should remember that Kuwait was a sovereign nation, a member of the United Nations. I concede the point others have made that Kuwait was not a democracy; it was a feudal monarchy. But if we say that only nations that are democracies in the way we define a democracy are entitled to survive and only those nations should be defended if they are invaded by another country, not that many nations will survive. The majority of the members of the United Nations are not democracies in the way I would define a democracy. But if we allow countries to swallow up other countries because they do not meet our definition of democracy, we are going to be allowing a great deal of instability in our own region and throughout the world. </PARA>
<PARA> In making the decision as to whether this is a just war, I would ask people to remember the method which Iraq used to occupy Kuwait. First of all, the Iraqi President told President Mubarak of Egypt, others in the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries and the Arab League that he had no designs on Kuwait; he simply wanted a settlement of the claims that he had made against Kuwait. He said he would not invade Kuwait and he would not use armed force. But, of course, all those promises were breached within a couple of days. We had the laughable attempt by the Iraqi Government to tell us that a revolution, an uprising, had taken place in Kuwait and that a puppet government installed by the Iraqis had decided to amalgamate with the State of Iraq so it could become the nineteenth province of that country. </PARA>
<PARA> The methods used by Iraq demonstrate that this is not a just war. The United Nations Security Council has carried 12 resolutions and the most important one, resolution 678, stated that all necessary means should be used to enforce the United Nations Security Council's previous decisions calling on Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> Which countries have been unable to live with resolution 678? To the best of my knowledge, only these countries: Cuba, which had no problem at all in sending foreign troops to Angola; Yemen; and North Korea, which of course had no problems sending troops into South Korea in the early 1950s. So they are the sorts of countries that cannot live with resolution 678. The rest of the world, almost without exception-the democracies throughout the world-is prepared to allow forces to go and carry out this resolution 678 of the United Nations Security Council. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of my friends who disagree with me on this matter say that sanctions were not given enough time to work. They say to me, `Yes, 5 1/2 months have passed since Iraq invaded Kuwait but so many people will die in this war that we should have allowed the sanctions greater time to work'. It is important that we then ask: how well were the sanctions working? I have here a newspaper clipping which I have obtained from the Sydney Morning Herald in the last week. It starts off with an anecdotal story about a particular journalist called Tod Robberson, who was able to purchase in Baghdad a can of beer which had been produced in Jordan, three months after the sanctions were meant to take effect. The article goes on to talk about how the sanctions are working:</PARA>
<PARA> `The borders here are extremely porous,' a Western diplomat said. </PARA>
<PARA> Diplomats say there is strong evidence to say that Jordan, Iran, Turkey and even Syria are failing to check the flow of consumer goods across their borders into Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>A diplomat who was briefed by the Iranians says an oil barter deal is being arranged in which Iraq would hand over millions of barrels of Iraqi oil to be sold by the Iranians on the world market. </PARA>
<PARA>That sort of clipping demonstrates that there were great difficulties in enforcing the sanctions, despite the best efforts of all of the 28 countries which sought to enforce those sanctions. Even if we had allowed a longer time, it is pretty hard to understand why Iraq would have changed its mind because of sanctions if it did not change its mind with the actual use of force after 15 January. I think most honourable members in this House certainly would agree that there was no prospect at all of President Hussein changing his mind simply because of the effect of sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA> So if the sanctions were not going to work, what was the result going to be? I say to those people who have been attending the demonstrations that, really, time is on Saddam Hussein's side. He was working hard to design new technological developments so that he could put gas and biological warheads on those Scud missiles. The Iraqi Government has previously been caught trying to purchase and smuggle triggers for nuclear weapons out of Europe into Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> The Swiss have caught the Iraqis trying to purchase high precision lathes so that they can enrich uranium. I do not need to tell the House why they were trying to enrich uranium. The Iraqis obviously had set themselves as a high priority the development of nuclear weapons. So time was on Saddam Hussein's side. If the sanctions were not working and we gave Saddam more time, would we not really have allowed him more time to spend more money on developing these weapons of mass destruction? At the same time, of course, he was digging in in Kuwait so that his forces could try to stop any allied attempt to remove him from Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, while people tell us we should have allowed the sanctions longer to bite, we have to ask: what would have happened to the Kuwaiti people? I believe that they have already been tortured and brutalised by the Iraqi invader. I know that some people think that this is simply an exaggeration by the Western media, that the Iraqi media perhaps might also exaggerate and that no-one knows what the truth is-that there is no such thing as truth in a crisis like this. I would appeal to those sceptical individuals to look at the work of an organisation like Amnesty International-an organisation whose reputation is beyond reproach. Anyone who attended any of the concerts by the Irish band, U2, would know the efforts they went to to ensure that more young people understood the good work which Amnesty International does for prisoners of conscience and victims of torture throughout the world. This is how the Australian Financial Review reported Amnesty International's examination of the Iraqi regime on 20 December:</PARA>
<PARA> Iraq's Ambassador, Mr Abdul Amir al-Anbari, stormed out of the hall after his speech rejecting the Assembly's authority to criticise Baghdad . . . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Amnesty International, the independent London-based human rights group, on Monday sent a catalogue of cruelty by Iraq's occupation force to the Security Council and Iraq's UN envoy. </PARA>
<PARA> The report, released yesterday, described how thousands of people were tortured in the isolation of prison cells after arbitrary arrest. </PARA>
<PARA> Many were beaten with metal rods, whips or hose-pipes, while others had their arms, legs or ribs broken, or fingers and toe nails torn out, Amnesty said. </PARA>
<PARA> It reported that Iraqi soldiers cut off helpless detainees' tongues and ears and gouged out their eyes. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> `Time and again, we were told that the most common way soldiers killed people was to take the victim to his family's doorstep, have his relatives identify him, and then shoot him in the back of the head' the report said. </PARA>
<PARA> `The Iraqi forces' brutality in Kuwait has shocked many people in the past four months but such abuses have been the norm for people in Iraq for more than a decade.'</PARA>
<PARA>That is not the view of the Emir of Kuwait and it is not the view of George Bush; it is the view of Amnesty International-an organisation whose reputation is beyond reproach. So I would ask those who have been participating in these demonstrations recently to look at that Amnesty International report and to look at the background behind President Saddam Hussein and the reputation that he has developed throughout the world. We should not forget that Saddam Hussein has set himself the objective of uniting the Arab nation under his leadership, and his history is a pretty gruesome one. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people have said to me it is okay for the West to speak up for Kuwait, but where were they with East Timor and when the Khmer Rouge were carrying out genocide in Cambodia? I say to them that things have changed dramatically since the Cold War has come to an end. This is an opportunity to make the United Nations work the way it should. </PARA>
<PARA> At this time our thoughts are with the men and women serving in the Gulf. I would like to say to them and their families: we hope and pray that they will return safely and soon, having served with the same courage and valour as those Anzacs who served before them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems somewhat ironic that, as the Parliament today debates this war in the Gulf-a war which reaches into every corner of the world-it was only 12 short months ago that the world was celebrating and cheering on the reforms in eastern Europe which brought to an end the dictatorships and reigns of terror that had been undertaken by various governments in eastern Europe for many decades, and at the same time we also saw the Iron Curtain being knocked down and a sense of new and fresh hope was spreading right across the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As part of that new and fresh hope, we all thought that this would bring in a period of great stability and a new era of peace. Yet here we are today, just a few short months later, discussing a war which is killing people, which is affecting the lives of virtually every person who lives on this planet. There are a number of lessons that we can learn from this very recent experience. The lesson we learn is that, basically, human nature does not change all that much over time; that no matter what is going on in the world at the present time that seems good, at some stage or another along the way greed, self-aggrandisement, the struggle for power, megalomania, lunacy or cruelty will force its way to the top in some country in some part of the world and threaten not just its own citizens but also other citizens in other countries.</PARA>
<PARA> That teaches us the lesson that, no matter how good the situation looks today, the world must be prepared to defend itself adequately. It also teaches us the lesson that no amount of wishing will solve our problems; only actions will ultimately solve them. </PARA>
<PARA> I rise tonight to speak on behalf of my constituents in the electorate of Gilmore. I avert from the main substance of my speech today by referring to those constituents of mine who are currently serving in the Gulf-naval personnel from the Navy's fleet air arm at HMAS Albatross, some 40-odd of whom are currently serving under the Australian flag in the Gulf. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Tim Fischer" NAMEID="DG4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DG4">Mr Tim Fischer</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And doing a good job.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Leader of the National Party of Australia, who recently visited our service personnel in the Gulf, points out, they are doing a great job and they are a credit to each and every Australian. I wish them all the very best. All members have included in their speeches today the hope that they return to this country safely. I would say the same thing again. I would also say to the families of those 40-odd constituents who are in the Gulf, the families who are in Nowra tonight, lonely and worried about their husbands, wives or relatives, that we are doing all that we can to try to ensure that their needs and their concerns are being addressed as each day goes by whilst their relatives or spouses are serving this nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been in contact twice with the Commanding Officer of HMAS Albatross, Commodore Pardington, to discuss with him arrangements to ensure that the welfare of these people's families is being seen to properly. On the first occasion I rang him I was actually switched through to a meeting room where he was holding a coffee meeting with the wives of those people who are serving in the Gulf. He informed me then that this was a regular occurrence, that the Navy was keeping all of the families informed as much as possible as to the state of affairs of their husbands and family members and was doing all it could to ensure that the domestic scene back home was being properly maintained. For example, each of the squadrons has had a liaison officer appointed to it to ensure that if any of the wives have a problem at home that liaison person can be contacted 24 hours a day. For example, if they wake up in the morning and find that the car will not start they can ring up the liaison officer in their particular squadron and he will send someone around or go around himself to make sure that the car will ultimately start. Little problems like this that would normally be solved by the husband are now being carried out by the husband's colleagues at HMAS Albatross. It is that type of support structure which satisfies me at this stage that all of the needs of the families of those serving in the Gulf from my electorate are being properly cared for. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to make the point that OTC Ltd has gone out of its way to assist those families which have members serving in the Gulf. For example, OTC provided the opportunity for each family to contact their family member in the Gulf at Christmas time free of charge and to give them a Christmas message, to keep in touch. That is something which has been duplicated by many other firms in so many other different fashions. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that those who have family in the Gulf and the majority of the constituents in my electorate support the motion which has been moved by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) today and seconded by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). I am also sure that the majority of my constituents support the resolution of the United Nations (UN) which has led to the counteractions in the Gulf over the last few days. I support the UN's position. I support the Government's position and I give it credit for taking on a task which has required leadership and which has seen leadership given. </PARA>
<PARA> The choices I see on this occasion are very clear. We have two choices: we have either the choice of appeasement or the choice of war. Neither of them is a pleasant choice but the least pleasant of all would be to choose appeasement. Appeasement has proven in the course of history to do nothing more than suit dictators and militarists. We have seen in this century appeasement allowing dictators such as Hitler to have extra time to reinforce their positions, to strengthen themselves and to take territories and free and independent countries from their rightful governments to suit their own purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> We can use the experience of the past to suit our needs today. That experience tells us that appeasement will do nothing to serve the cause of freedom loving people throughout the world. All of us want peace. None of us want war. There would not be a member of this Parliament who would get up each day and say, `By goodness, isn't this great, we're having a war'. It is something that each and every one of us would shy away from. </PARA>
<PARA> So many people throughout Australia at present who are expressing their concerns about this war through rallies and demonstrations, some of which we have seen today, would share the same opinions as members of this Parliament. The difficulty for members of this Parliament is that we are in the position of having to make a decision. We are in the position of having to do something to try to solve the problem. Many of my constituents have contacted me over the last few days and said, `We shouldn't be in this Gulf war; America shouldn't be in this Gulf war. Nobody should be in this Gulf war; we should let the Middle East sort itself out'. Those people are good people. I know many of them myself and have done for some years. They mean well. Their cause is one that many of us would share. </PARA>
<PARA> We see other types of people who express a similar cause but in a different way. Today, for example, in the gallery of this House we have seen alleged peace protesters trying to howl down speakers in this chamber. They howled down the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. These people do their cause no good whatsoever. It begs the question: if they want credibility, why are they not expending as much energy outside the Iraqi Embassy howling at the Iraqi Government officials as they are expending outside the Australian Parliament howling at Australian parliamentarians? I think a double standard was being applied by some of those protesters who were in the gallery today. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I and, I am sure, the majority of my electorate, agree with the Government's position and the UN position, many disagree. I ask all of those who disagree with the motion that is before the House today what they would do to solve the problem. It is no good sitting on the sideline and saying, `We should have peace'. That is all well and good but how are we going to solve the problem? We have a problem, so how do we solve it? How, for example, do we stop Saddam Hussein gaining more power? How do we stop him killing more innocent people? How do we stop him controlling 19 per cent of the world's oil reserves? How do we stop him using that economic power to ruin our economies and to ruin our standard of living? What do we do to stop Saddam Hussein going from Kuwait to Saudi Arabia and, without doubt, on to Israel to take on a holy war, a Jihad, against the Israeli people? How do we stop Saddam Hussein doing those things-things that may ultimately lead to what I hear so many people talk of in absolute horror, that is, a third world war? I can assure people that if they allow people such as Saddam Hussein to have their way, to beat people and to hold the world to ransom, they will lead those people into having so much power that they could cause a third world war. </PARA>
<PARA> They have no adequate answers. Their best answer is, `We should negotiate further'. We have been negotiating for 5 1/2 months. How can one compromise with an uncompromising person? Saddam Hussein is uncompromising. He will not compromise; he will not negotiate. </PARA>
<PARA> People also say, `We'll allow sanctions to go their course a little further'. As we have heard from the previous speaker, the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), and other speakers here today, sanctions are not having their effect. I read an article in the newspaper the other day by a correspondent in Baghdad who wrote about eating in a restaurant and talked about the wide array of foods that were available and the plentiful supply of foods. He used this example to prove that sanctions were not working. Why would they work? Let us look at the people in countries bordering Iraq and wonder what their agenda is. We know it certainly does not suit Iran's cause to make sanctions work against Iraq. Allowing goods to go into Iraq gives Iraq the encouragement to go on with its aggression and ultimately to be defeated, which would put Iran in a stronger position. </PARA>
<PARA> Much the same can be said about Syria. I am sure that Syria's agenda was very different from what most of ours would be. Syria would be happy to see Iraq go to war and therefore would be happy to allow the sanctions not to work, to encourage it and to give it resources to go to war because it would strengthen its position in the Middle East. Neither sanctions nor negotiations worked. We come back to this fundamental question: how are we going to solve the problem? The only way we can solve the problem is in the way in which the UN has proven through its various resolutions. </PARA>
<PARA> The United States of America, under the leadership of President George Bush, deserves credit for the way in which it has been able to form a coalition of agreement in the United Nations and a coalition that has been able to establish a force that can take on Saddam Hussein. Its work shows great leadership at a time when the world really needs it. The UN is the only body now that shows a sensible resolution to the problem. If we all believe that the UN is going to do the world good, then we must support it. I personally believe in the UN. I think most people in this place would believe in the whole philosophy of the UN. I want it to work because I want this world to be a more civilised, more stable and more peaceful world for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The only way that will be achieved is if the UN can do more than just express words. It will work if it can express actions. Speakers today have spoken about how the UN in the past-in the 1930s, for example, when it was the League of Nations-was powerless to do anything against aggressors and, as a consequence, we ended up with the Second World War that cost many tens of millions of lives. So the UN must be supported if it is to try to provide for us that stable and peaceful world. If we believe in it, we must believe in this motion which is before us today. If we believe in stopping madmen from disrupting our society, we must support this resolution. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that so many of my constituents are affected in so many ways as a consequence of this crisis. We have seen wheat sales to Iraq stop. We have seen stopped sales that had already been engaged in; goods delivered not paid for; sales that were negotiated, for which deliveries were about to commence, not undertaken. We have seen wheatgrowers throughout Australia lose hundreds of millions of dollars-many of them in my electorate. We have seen woolgrowers lose sales over the last little while because of this. We see people hurting because of our economy being in difficulty. Because of this crisis, our recession will be stretched out for a longer period of time; because of this crisis, more people will be unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> But it is not just here in Australia that we see the effects of Saddam's madness infiltrating our society. If we look at eastern Europe, of which I was speaking a few moments ago, we see emerging democracies. What is going on in the Middle East today threatens those new democracies and those emerging economies. It affects all of the eastern European countries; it affects all of the reforms that MrGorbachev has been trying to undertake in the Soviet Union.</PARA>
<PARA> So the consequences of this are not just isolated to the Middle East. For that reason, this involves decent citizens of the world. That is why Australia has been so involved in the making of this resolution and has committed its naval personnel, its medical personnel, those army personnel who are engaged at the front and those engaged in protecting our supply vessel which is currently in the Gulf at the present time. I support the motion moved by the Prime Minister and seconded by the Leader of the Opposition. I know all decent, thinking, intelligent people in my electorate would share with me the concerns for world peace, and I believe that those who think through this issue will believe that the only way we can stop madmen from controlling and disrupting our lives, from killing innocent people, is to be united-and that is precisely what the Parliament is doing this evening. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The facts and dates that have led to the motion before the Parliament are well documented and have certainly been well covered in this place today. Of course, the natural follow-up question is: Why are we involved in a war?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The sentiment displayed by Australians over the weekend and today that Australia should not be at war is a strong one. That Australia is at war is something I am sure no member of this House is pleased about. Yet it is solely the actions of one man over the past five months that have regrettably brought us to this position. The confusion of war and the horror it encompasses are ironically evident in the reason why we are at war. Our ultimate pursuit is, of course, peace. That peace is an ideal we all value so much means that we must all stand up for it. Regrettably, there will also be occasions when we must fight for it. Let us make no mistake: the present situation in the Persian Gulf is one of those occasions. For this stand-off to be upon us and for Australia to be a part of it is something we would all rather have done without. However, countless attempts at a peaceful settlement have left the world with no other option. </PARA>
<PARA> In the months since the invasion of Kuwait on 2 August 1990, the world has tried through the appropriate forum, the United Nations (UN), to resolve the conflict. It is important to note that never before in bringing about the resolution of such a conflict has the UN had such a prominent role as a dispute-settling body. As a member of the international community and one of the founding members of the United Nations-for let us not forget the contribution made to the creation of this institution by Dr Evatt-it is essential that Australia not shirk its responsibilities in the world arena. Its role has never been more clearly defined for, with the breaking down of long-time barriers in eastern Europe, the bringing about of a resolution in the Gulf crisis has become the United Nations' prime focus. </PARA>
<PARA> On 3 August, the day after the invasion of Kuwait, the United Nations Security Council voted 14 to nil to condemn the invasion and demand the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Iraq's troops from Kuwait. In the next two weeks, another two resolutions were passed with a substantial majority giving Iraq more opportunities to withdraw. On 6 August, the Council voted 13 to nil to order a trade and financial embargo of Iraq and occupied Kuwait. On 9 August, the Council voted 15 to nil to declare Iraq's annexation of Kuwait null and void in international law. The other resolutions that came before the Council in the time leading up to the landmark resolution 678 on 29 November all showed a willingness on the part of the rest of the world to allow Iraq to withdraw peacefully. But after almost four months of opportunities to do so, Saddam Hussein showed absolutely no indication of withdrawing from Kuwait. Iraq is now in contempt of 12 mandatory UN Security Council resolutions. Painfully, we now know that five months of determined and committed effort by the United Nations and members of the United Nations has been to no avail. </PARA>
<PARA> There have also been countless diplomatic approaches made to Iraq, and Australia can stand proud to have been a part of these. Australia has acted in a number of ways, showing the rest of the world our commitment to avoiding conflict: through debate in the Parliament; direct discussions with Iraq by officials in Baghdad and here in Canberra; our role in the United Nations negotiations and through widespread regional consultations and support for third-party initiatives from both Western countries and Middle East nations; and the Government's involvement in freeing the Australians held captive as part of Saddam Hussein's human shield tactics. </PARA>
<PARA> The contemptuous delay by Saddam Hussein in meeting with the Secretary-General of the UN in the final 24 hours before the 15 January deadline clearly illustrates the shallow disregard Iraq has shown throughout the entire negotiating process to reach a peaceful settlement in the Gulf. The central theme in the overall Gulf argument is that one nation has used its might to act as an aggressor on a defenceless neighbour. We all now know that the follow-up attempts to bring about a resolution peacefully have failed to bring the aggressor to the table. </PARA>
<PARA> Our pursuit of peace is now reluctantly limited to one track, that of conflict. Through that conflict we will rid the world of the terror and greed of Saddam Hussein's pursuit of power in the Arab states. History has taught us clear lessons on the course of action that needs to be taken in such instances. We can ill afford to let Saddam Hussein repeat history and turn defenceless countries such as Kuwait into pawns in his power game. </PARA>
<PARA> The impact on the world economies of Iraq's campaign, were it to be allowed to continue, would be devastating. Further down the line, that has direct implications for every Australian family and, of course, their standard of living. It is only appropriate that the Government has taken the position it has in joining the more than 30 countries which have in some way lent their support to redressing this wrong- doing by Iraq. It saddens me that the stubbornness of one man has brought the rest of the world to this position of conflict. At a time in history when tremendous advances have been made towards disarmament in the world, over the past five months we have seen former long-time foes working together against the greed of this one man. We now risk decades of this work being undone in a few short weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> With Australia's involvement in the multinational task force's pursuit of international peace, it should be made clear that for us to achieve that goal there can be no other course of action. After 5 1/2 months, sanctions have reduced Iraq's gross national product by only about 10 per cent and have had only a negligible impact on its military. The imposition of the sanctions had one purpose in mind: to force Saddam Hussein to comply with the previous resolutions endorsed by the UN Security Council seeking unconditional withdraw from Kuwait. We should avoid the trap of looking only at the emotional side of the argument. There are few who could deny that the families, friends and relatives of those 884 Australians presently stationed in the Gulf are worried and concerned for their safety. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that those feelings of uncertainty spread further throughout the community as well, something brought home strongly to the people I represent in the electorate of Oxley. With a large Royal Australian Air Force base at Amberley in my electorate, residents in my electorate-both personnel at the base and those in the remainder of the community-are poignantly aware of the reasons behind Australia's need for a military presence in the Gulf. The residents in my electorate of Oxley share community concerns for the welfare of Australian service men and women in the Gulf and pray for their safe return. </PARA>
<PARA> In line with these concerns is the clear focus we must keep with the direction we need to take to end the present conflict. The desired result of having Saddam Hussein withdraw from Kuwait has not been brought about by sanctions. Neither has it been brought about by subsequent resolutions or diplomatic efforts. </PARA>
<PARA> While the current role of Australia's service men and women has changed from that originally intended, the present activities our personnel are engaged in as part of the Midway carrier group should not be seen as crossing the line into direct conflict, as has been portrayed by some minority sections of the community, but rather as a continuation of our commitment to see the present crisis resolved as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, we must remain mindful of the reason we are in a position of conflict in the Gulf: that the reluctance of one man to listen to the rest of the world has, bit by bit, increased the measures we must take to prevent him going any further. Moving into the future, the well-being of the next generation and the realisation of a safe and secure world are what our present involvement in the Gulf is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Middle East we have seen the unprovoked brutality of one country, Iraq, inflicted on its neighbour, Kuwait-nothing less. The circumstances leading to the nations allied against Iraq making that final difficult decision to realise the liberation of Kuwait are unprecedented in history. Never before has one country that has carried out such an act of aggression been given so many opportunities to withdraw. The freedom that is so much a way of life in Australia is the very thing that our defence personnel are standing up for for the citizens in the Middle East at the moment. It is our pursuit of freedom that strengthens our resolve to bring about that freedom for all citizens across the globe. </PARA>
<PARA> Such instances as those documented by Amnesty International and referred to already by other honourable members show precisely the stark reality of what we are up against in our fight to bring about that freedom. I believe that the report of Amnesty International was carried by 144 votes to one. We do not get any guesses as to the one country that voted against it. The tortures, detentions and summary executions leave no doubt as to what is required if we are to succeed. Such happenings show that not only have the people of Kuwait been denied the basic freedoms afforded to all Australians, such as freedom of speech and expression of religion; they have also been subjected to some of the most horrific forms of torture ever known. </PARA>
<PARA> In the necessary use of force to bring about a new era of peace it is saddening to see some of the emotional tactics being employed by those opposed to Australia's present involvement in the United Nations multinational force. Indeed, I find deplorable the measures being employed by a disruptive minority to incite fear into the families and friends of some of our defence personnel in the Gulf. I refer specifically to a media report in the Brisbane Courier-Mail of Friday, 18 January, which referred to the case of a single mother of an 18-year-old sailor stationed in the Gulf. Since the passing of the Gulf deadline the woman has received a number of threatening phone calls and other types of threats from individuals. </PARA>
<PARA> The same article also cited cases of families of defence personnel having derogatory messages painted on their fences or being advised to look at newspaper headlines which declared that Arab terrorists would strike at enemy interests any- where in the world if Iraq were attacked by allied forces. Since this article was printed, the local media in my electorate has also reported similar threats being made against an Ipswich mother whose daughter is presently stationed with the medical forces in the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA> I doubt that there would be a member of this House who would advocate the removal of the right to freedom of speech and expression, yet when such rights are abused in this manner it is painfully obvious that the perpetrators of such acts are unaware of just how lucky we are in Australia to have these freedoms. In fact, the sad irony of these cases is that it is the very rights of expression that the perpetrators of these acts have that Australia is pursuing for Kuwait and its people through its involvement in the conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> I share with those honourable members who have spoken today the natural concerns and reservations that come with the uncertainty of war. The commitment of Australian troops to make up part of the multinational force in the Persian Gulf is the toughest decision this Government has had to make. As with any hard decision, members of the Australian public have many questions to ask. However, it is one thing to voice an opinion; it is another to make sure that one's views are based on fact rather than fallacy. </PARA>
<PARA> It is only natural that people putting forward their views on the Gulf issue will come from a broad spectrum of the community. Naturally, this includes religious groups. I commend this as a member of this House, for it is only through such active involvement that Australians will become better educated about what is really happening in the Middle East at the moment. The obvious religious question posed in this argument is about the use of force against an aggressor. I know, and this no doubt would be the case for other members of this Parliament, that in the case of war there does exist some internal conflict in regard to the use of force. However, when looking at the broader picture, we see the atrocities committed by Saddam Hussein against his own people and his total lack of respect for life, demonstrated when new-born babies in a Kuwaiti hospital were literally thrown to the floor from the incubators that were keeping them alive. </PARA>
<PARA> When all the discussion is over and we have to take a stand, history shows that there comes a time when the use of force has to be condoned. Speaking in support of the address of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on the Gulf crisis on 4 December, I referred to the number of church services I had attended around that date in my electorate and how the common theme in the liturgies was the hope for a peaceful resolution to the conflict in the Gulf. However, at religious services across the country last weekend the theme had regrettably changed to one of prayer for a quick resolution to the conflict. While all members of this House can be assured that the women and men of our defence personnel in the Gulf will serve Australia well, along with other members I pray that it will not be too long before they are reunited with their families. </PARA>
<PARA> War is desired by no-one, detested by all. Yet there come times when we have no alternative. Let us make no mistake, this is one of those times. To this end, I commend the Opposition for taking a bipartisan stand on Australia's involvement in the Gulf. Our personnel need to know that Australia is behind them in their present role. I hope that at the conclusion of the debate on this motion this Parliament presents our personnel with the unanimous support they truly deserve. I put on record my appreciation for the efforts of our defence personnel in the Gulf. Certainly my feelings go out to their families, as has been indicated by many other members. I hope only that this conflict in the Gulf has a speedy resolution and that our troops can return home to their families as soon as possible. I am pleased to have the opportunity to join with other members of this House in supporting the motion moved today by the Prime Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the announcement came on the 11 a.m. news last Thursday that military action had commenced in the Middle East, I did what I know many other people in Australia and worldwide did: I wept. Shortly after that announcement the telephone in my office started ringing; many, many women rang my office that day, also in tears. Quite a number of them apologised for this. I feel there was no need; they probably did not realise that people the world over were weeping tears of despair, fear and grief for what was under way. Subsequently, watching television over the next 48 hours, I saw a Cable News Network television announcer weep who was on camera at the time of the announcement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> They were tears of despair that Iraq could force on the world the horror of war through its insane intransigence that would not attempt to find any acceptable solution but, on the contrary, seemed determined to promote war, no matter what. They were tears of fear for the world, and I do fear for the world, as I am sure all of us do. I fear for the realisation of the worst case scenarios that have been forecast of worldwide terrorism, chemical, biological and even nuclear warfare, and of the potential for escalation of the conflict to include other Middle Eastern countries and, ultimately, possibly the world.</PARA>
<PARA> There is grief at the failure yet again of reason; at the death for the time being of hope for a better, more civilised world; at the apparent inevitability of the human race self-destructing through this most senseless and barbaric of all forms of human behaviour. There is grief for all those who will die in the desert in the coming weeks and months, and grief for their families too. </PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of the women, who apparently did not ring many male members of Parliament, from what I have been able to discern, despite the dread in women's hearts they know only too well that violence must be resisted, that the strong must come to the aid of the weak and that whilst violence is not a characteristic of women it does not mean that they are not capable of resolutely resisting aggression-from Boadicea to Joan of Arc through to Golda Meir and Maggie Thatcher in more recent days. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard much from the peace movement in the last 48 hours, and women have been prominent in the marches and demonstrations that have been held. I have seen many a grey-haired lady there with little to say, not bearing a placard but possibly grieving for a son or husband from a war in time gone by and feeling that same despair. One who was interviewed said that she felt that she just had to do something. I have heard others loudly proclaim that sanctions were not given a chance to work. The sanctions did work. They showed that the world was capable of acting in concert for months on end and not giving in, no matter how the self-interest of those countries was affected. Australia participated in those sanctions and our self-interest was hurt through the sanctions. But the world stood firm, and in the end Jordan and the Jordanian people were hurting badly. From what we can discern, the Kuwaitis were hurting badly; but Saddam Hussein thrives on other people's hurt. </PARA>
<PARA> The sanctions worked as well as they could ever work. Iraq would have hurt if the sanctions had been kept up for 12 months or two years, but would Saddam Hussein have cared? This is the man who used chemical weapons on his own defenceless citizens, not in a civil war, under no provocation, but for his own political purposes-a form of warfare that we might have hoped had disappeared off the face of this earth many decades ago. This is the man who provoked and prolonged a war which killed one million people. That ranks him just a little behind Stalin and Hitler but heading fast in their direction. I remind the House that this is the man who bombed defenceless merchant vessels in the Gulf during the Iran-Iraq war and who ended that war only so he could turn his attention to the easier and richer pickings of Kuwait. Kuwait is only one more example of this crazy behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> Last October-not very long after the invasion of Kuwait and when the international diplomatic activity was at a frenzy-I, along with other members of the Parliament, was a delegate to the 147th session of the Inter-Parliamentary Union in Uruguay. That conference passed without a vote-in other words, nobody called for a vote-a very long resolution condemning the invasion of Kuwait. The resolution was an attempt by members of more than 80 Parliaments of the world, including representatives of the Iraqi Parliament, to put pressure on Iraq and the Iraqi people, as far as we could reach them, to see sense. </PARA>
<PARA> The resolution expressed concern at the invasion and subsequent annexation of Kuwait. It noted that this act of aggression, which challenged the very existence of a sovereign state, constituted a breach of international peace and security and threatened the integrity of every state in the international community. The resolution also affirmed the need to put an end to this occupation and to re-establish the sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of Kuwait. Further, the resolution condemned the systematic persecution, torture and killing of the people of Kuwait by Iraqi troops in an effort to intimidate and eliminate the legitimate population, change the demographic character of the country, and threaten the present borders of states and the geopolitical balance of the region-something that we have not heard enough about in this country and which the peace demonstrators ought to think about. That is a statement of fact which was never contested by the Iraqi parliamentarians or, indeed, anyone else present at the conference. </PARA>
<PARA> The resolution went on, amongst other things, to condemn Iraq's invasion and annexation of Kuwait and called for the immediate withdrawal of Iraqi troops from Kuwait. Finally, the resolution asked the Iraqi parliamentarians attending the eighty-fourth Inter-Parliamentary Conference to convey this resolution to the people and authorities of their country. I wonder whether they did. We know only too well the fate of others who have criticised Saddam Hussein or have given him bad news. He is a murderer who hesitates at nothing. Being responsible for the deaths of one million people is to him nothing; he does not even admit that that fact is there. </PARA>
<PARA> I know there are many genuine people out there on the streets, and I noticed in the galleries today, as much as I could see of them-apart from those who were being noisy and were here to draw attention to themselves and, surely, not to advance a cause-a number of people sitting quietly listening and nodding their heads at some of the interjections that came from the demonstrators. Nevertheless, I think that they were anxious and concerned people. The mindlessness of the slogans in these demonstrations makes me despair. One thing I thought that Australia had in concert with a few of the nations in the world-and which if more nations had would mean not so much war-was a reasonably educated population. When I see our young people walking along the street shouting, `No blood for oil', has it not crossed their minds to wonder about the Kuwaiti blood that was spilt for Kuwaiti oil by Iraqi troops? What about Kuwaiti blood? What about Kuwaiti oil? To talk about it being an oil war as though that condemns it out of hand, as though that puts it beyond any question of anybody getting involved, just shows how little these people understand. </PARA>
<PARA> Most wars are about resources. This country was nearly invaded by the Japanese over 45 years ago because Japan was a resource-starved country. Wars are usually about resources. Occasionally they are about religious bigotry, but usually they are about resources. The Iraq-Kuwait war was about Kuwait's resources, and nobody doubts that this war is indeed, at least partly, a war about oil. Nobody doubts, quite apart from the fact that Hussein now has 50 per cent to 60 per cent of the world's oil reserves under his control for as long as he is in control of Kuwait, that if he goes on to invade or dominate to the point of being able to dictate policy to the Saudis, the world will be hostage to this crazy murderer. One of the reasons that he has given for invading Kuwait is not just territorial but the influence that the Kuwait Government was having on the pricing of world oil, which he would not accept as being in Iraq's interests. It is one of the reasons he gave for invading Kuwait and inflicting this dreadful situation on the world. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to those peace demonstrators, the genuine pacifists, the people who really care: please go by the Iraq Embassy one day. Where were these people following the invasion of 2 August? Were the people in the streets then chanting at the Iraqis, `No blood for oil; give peace a chance'? Will these people please also go by the Israeli Embassy and say, `We deplore the indiscriminate bombing of citizens of a country that is not even in the war'? There are no military targets involved in Tel Aviv. Would those with genuine concern show it in all directions?</PARA>
<PARA> I want to comment on the Australian Broadcasting Commission (ABC) in particular and its coverage of the events in the Middle East. This applies to all the television channels, but our troops in the Gulf are getting the ABC news and they are getting long segments showing Australians marching down the streets chanting slogans against what we are doing. I am aware that some servicemen are anxiously telephoning their families in this country asking, `Are we the target of hatred from Australian citizens?' They are starting to wonder. It is right that it is reported; it is wrong that it is reported so disproportionately. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to address a comment to one of my colleagues in the other place, a person in regard to whom I have considerable personal affection and total respect for her pacifist views. Her action today was to me quite unacceptable. The Speaker had given instructions clearly to the attendants that anyone who interjected was to be removed from the gallery. This is a place of debate, not of shouting people down. My colleague sat in the gallery and shouted at the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and at those in this chamber. The attendants could do nothing because she is a member of parliament and covered by parliamentary privilege. That was an act of cowardice against the attendants of this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague has the right to speak in this Parliament for 30 minutes because she is a senator. She is one of the very privileged people in this country-just a couple of hundred at the moment-who can speak in Parliament and put a view. That is where she should put it. I believe she should at the very least apologise to the Speaker for her outburst here today. I know that she feels very strongly, but in choosing to depart from the normal reason of this place, as a pacifist I think she did herself and the institution a great disservice by shouting and by encouraging and leading on innocent people who are unaware of the norms of this place. She also demeaned the meaning of the parliamentary office that she is privileged to hold. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the most difficult decisions any parliament, any government and any political party-especially the Australian Labor Party-can make is to endorse the course of war and commit Australian men and women actively to it. In that light, I believe it is very important for Australians, both in this chamber and outside, to have this war in its proper perspective now and, very importantly, in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia did not start this war; the United States of America did not start this war; Israel did not start this war. Iraq did. It is as simple as that. Whether Australia supports the war or not, the fact remains that it would have happened. If, for argument's sake, Australia were to withdraw our ships that are now actively engaged in the Gulf, a withdrawal that the peace movement suggests, the fact also is that the war would continue. The catchcry of `Bring the ships home; no Gulf war' is simply misleading-very much so-in the Australian context. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I think all of us in this country at the moment are in danger of losing our perspective on this war and on just how small a part we are playing in it in material terms. All of us in this place-be we Labor, Liberal, National, or Democrat or independent in the other place-are in favour of peace. None of us advocate or like war. But peace is not some temporary lull in hostilities accompanied by one nation holding to the head of its neighbours a massive army, air force and missile capability; peace is a lasting consequence based on mutual trust and respect between nations. Plainly, then, the world was not at peace on 14 January and during those last final hours leading to the United Nations (UN) assault on the Iraqi positions in Kuwait and elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> History teaches us costly lessons, unfortunately. It is even more unfortunate that we seem to recollect only those lessons that centre on the big wars which, it is sad to say from our perspective, for the most part have actively involved Anglo-Europeans. The world was not at peace in 1931 when Japan invaded Manchuria, but it was of little interest to the West. The world was not at peace in 1935 when Italy invaded Abyssinia, and in 1938 it was certainly not at peace when Germany invaded Czechoslovakia. The lessons of those instances of history are simply that the failure to halt expansionist undemocratic militarist regimes at a time when their military strength was lesser rather than greater, at a time when they had not yet had the benefit of utilising and husbanding the resources that they so coveted and at a time before they had had the opportunity to deal out atrocities against innocent civilians must all be judged by history to have been great mistakes. </PARA>
<PARA> The parallels of those years are quite obvious in the present context regarding Kuwait. Speakers on both sides of the House today, including the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), have alluded to them. It leads us then, as one of my colleagues said to me recently, to assess that we have all in our own way been through the thought processes of those in the peace movement-of what they are advocating and what they are wishing. We have simply come to different conclusions on how to obtain a permanent peace. </PARA>
<PARA> We are led to the conclusion that, unfortunate as this war is-and it most certainly will unfold on our screens in the next few days-the United Nations has had no choice in this matter. Indeed, it would seem that the world has perhaps had to learn the unfortunate lessons of the past. It would seem that the world has decided as a community in the interests of collective security that Kuwait must not be, and will not be allowed to be, the Manchuria, Abyssinia or Czechoslovakia of the post-Cold War era and that Saudi Arabia, potentially to follow in the militarist wrath of the Iraqis should they get away with their invasion of Kuwait, must not be allowed to become the Poland of 1991. It is interesting to note-and the Leader of the Opposition referred to this today also-that when Japan walked out of the League of Nations in 1931 after its invasion of Manchuria the road to World War II was very clearly signposted. </PARA>
<PARA> Time is not on the side of peace in the Gulf, and it has not been since the start. The efficacy of the sanctions against Iraq has left so very much to be desired. Rather, time has allowed Saddam Hussein to dig in and to concrete his troop emplacements, to build, to prepare and to hone his war machine, perhaps tragically, if allowed to manifest itself in more and even greater weapons of mass destruction. That digging in, that concreting, that time to manifest effort in honing further his war machine means that a later war will inevitably cost far more lives of both soldiers on each side and innocent civilians. </PARA>
<PARA> It has to be remembered when we talk about the chance of sanctions producing a drive towards peace, a reconsideration from the Baathist regime in Iraq, that this nation has now attacked three other nations in the past decade: it launched a war against Iran; it invaded, occupied and annexed Kuwait; and in the last days, it has tragically attacked in an unprovoked manner the State of Israel. </PARA>
<PARA> Without doubt, the basic lack of any humanity that characterises the Baathist regime of Saddam Hussein in Iraq leads us to conclude quite rationally that this man must be stopped. This is not a man who has practised and attempted genocide against one race as the Nazis did against the Jews. This is a man who has tried it against two races, both in his own country-Kurds and Assyrians. </PARA>
<PARA> Today, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and my colleague the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) referred to the Amnesty International report of the brutal atrocities perpetrated by the Iraqis upon Kuwait. This really goes to the heart of the issue of timeliness in the Gulf war. The atrocities of the Nazis upon the Jews of Europe, of Idi Amin upon Ugandans and of Pol Pot upon Cambodians are just three instances that have stood out in the twentieth century. </PARA>
<PARA> It can be argued that the world turned a blind eye and perhaps waited far too long beyond the limit of humanity's tolerance to undertake any sort of action. It is an indictment upon us all that, unfortunately, it is easy for the world, and particularly we in the Anglo-West, to turn a blind eye to such atrocities in other parts of the world that do not affect us directly. It would be very easy to turn a blind eye to the atrocities of Iraq in Kuwait and in its own country. This time it may well be that, rather than acting too soon or too late as has been the case in the past, or too soon as is suggested by some now, the world community, in the interests of collective security and basic humanity, might just have got the timing right. </PARA>
<PARA> One reason that Australia has had to play a role in supporting the United Nations' efforts towards establishing a new world order will be manifested in Australia having a recognised voice at the conclusion of this conflict in any post-war Middle East conference. All sides clearly will now be expected by the world community at the conclusion of hostilities to talk, to find lasting and sincere resolutions to longstanding disputes, including the security of Israel and the rights of the Palestinian people. It has to be said that for too long, on too many occasions, the fires of war have burned in the Middle East and have threatened to engulf the entire world. I hope, and I am sure that all members of this House expect, that Australia in the forthcoming years will play an active role in facilitating the processes that will bring about a permanent peace in the Middle East for all parties concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I must touch on one other issue; that is, to make a plea, as much as anything to my own part of the world in Sydney, for continued tolerance-tolerance from Muslim and non-Muslim Australians alike. That is the basic issue. We are all Australians. Some of us dress a little differently from others. In our district some women wear headcover because of their Muslim religion. That does not make them enemies of the state. In the vast majority of cases of Muslim Australians who I know, that does not mean that they are in any way sympathetic to Saddam Hussein; rather, these people are caught in varying stages of moral dilemma, in some cases seeing the cities and towns of relatives being bombed. It does not mean that they are disloyal Australians-indeed, they are not. At this time, tolerance by all Australians is essential. Tolerance, how we assess it now and how we go about achieving it now will be something by which our kids and our grandkids will judge us when this period of our history is studied. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is undoubtedly one of the most important debates that have taken place in this new Parliament House. The evidence of that can be seen on the speakers list, where we see the names of virtually every member of this House. We stand here as representatives of the Australian people. As representatives we have the honour to serve in a democracy, something that the people of Iraq have never known.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The most important point is that to commit Australian forces to war is undoubtedly the most serious decision that can be made by any government in a democracy. It is only appropriate, therefore, that all the members here should be participating in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been understandably-but I believe misguidedly-some dissension over the fundamental issues upon which this Gulf war is being fought. No normal person wants war. I grew up as a very young child in the Second World War. I was in Singapore in 1945. I was evacuated from my father when I was two years of age. I learned from my mother the cost of divided families and the real possibility of never seeing a father or husband again. I saw the impact of war in Vietnam. I served in the Middle East as a representative of the Australian government. I saw the impact of war there. It is to me certainly no stranger. </PARA>
<PARA> When people say to me, `Is this a just war?' I want those words to be very carefully examined because there is nothing new about them. In the thirteenth century Saint Thomas Aquinas wrote that a just war had three basic requirements: firstly, a just cause; secondly, a right authority for initiating the use of force; and thirdly, a right intention on the part of the party or parties employing such force. In more recent times, a few other elements have been added to that definition including that the resort to force must be proportioned-in other words, parties must not try to achieve more harm than good; it must be seen as a last resort; it is undertaken with the end of peace as its goal; and there must be a reasonable hope of success. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely, the essential elements in this Gulf War situation which we are debating here tonight are to be found in those precise principles that I have just enunciated. Firstly: a just cause. What can be more just than the right of people to live in peace behind their own internationally accepted territorial boundaries? What can be more just than for the the United Nations, as the representatives of the people of the world, to call upon the aggressor to withdraw from the territory of a small neighbour over which it has absolutely no right at all? That is a just cause, and that is why we are supporting this motion tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point was: a right authority for initiating the use of force. That is quite clear. Since 2 August last year, when Kuwait was invaded by its neighbouring state Iraq, there have been no fewer than 12 resolutions asking Iraq to remove its forces from Kuwait and to negotiate any disagreements it may have with that state. The first one was on 2 August, within hours of the invasion, when the representatives of the Security Council were literally dragged from their beds to appear in New York to debate and to condemn Iraq for its premeditated invasion of Kuwait. Resolution 660 condemned the invasion of Kuwait. It demanded that Baghdad withdraw its forces and begin negotiations. A week later, on 6 August, resolution 661 imposed an embargo on all trade with Iraq except for medicines and humanitarian supplies. On 9 August by resolution 662 the Security Council voted unanimously-what more can one ask for?-to declare Iraq's annexation of Kuwait null and void. Why? Because that very day Kuwait had been made the nineteenth province of Iraq. On 25 August, by resolution 665, the Security Council authorised member states to impose a naval blockade on Iraq and Kuwait. Finally, when the world's patience was running indeed very thin, on 29 November, after the passing of 5 1/2 months of fruitless diplomatic efforts, the Security Council, by resolution 678, approved the use of `all necessary means' to drive Iraq from Kuwait if it failed to withdraw by 15 January 1991. </PARA>
<PARA> Although Saddam Hussein was given a further six weeks to meet the demands of the United Nations, and despite the constant efforts by Arab states and other members of the United Nations, including its Secretary-General, at no stage-and I emphasise that-was Saddam Hussein willing to withdraw his forces from Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> The third principle: a right intention on the part of the parties employing such force. Our intentions in this matter are abundantly clear. They are quite simply described as our desire to see a withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait, the restoration of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the state of Kuwait, and adequate security arrangements for the Gulf in future. That is our intention. It is not to invade the Middle East. It is not to remain there any longer than is absolutely necessary. What those who abhor this particular international event tend to forget is that a significant number of the 35 states which are linked together in this effort are themselves Arab states, Muslim states, which are no longer prepared to tolerate in their midst a person who, time after time, has ignored the basic principles of international law. </PARA>
<PARA> For so long we waited. We saw what he did to his own people. We saw the destruction of the Kurds and the death of their women and children through gas attacks. We saw eight years of war between Iran and Iraq-and, regrettably, both sides got help from people who today probably wish they were not then involved. But the record over the last years during which Saddam Hussein has led Iraq demonstrates for all to see that we are dealing with a person who, to use the words of Winston Churchill, is `the embodiment of all evil'. We have seen his cruel use of gas, his development of gas and biological weapons-not to mention his attempts to develop a nuclear weapon-his aggression against Kuwait and more recently, in the last few days, against Israel, and again today against some of the trucial states, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. Tonight we saw the extent to which this man will go when he disregards even the Geneva conventions on the treatment of prisoners of war by his blatant use of those men, who have nothing to protect them, for propaganda purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> This false prophet, this embodiment of all that is evil, this destroyer of Islam under whose banner he has the effrontery to call a holy war, a jihad, against his own brothers and sisters in the Arab world, has turned logic on its head and offered us the bizarre proposition that by killing Arabs in Kuwait, he is doing something to help the Palestinians under the control of Israel. </PARA>
<PARA> Other issues have been raised in this particular debate to which I would like to draw attention. The argument has been put forward that sanctions were not being given a fair go. The fact that sanctions have been in place for some 5 1/2 months, as the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch) rightly said, has certainly given Saddam Hussein a great opportunity to dig in. But they did have some effect. There was a 10 per cent loss in the gross domestic product of Iraq in just over five months. But the key questions are: How long could we wait? How long would those who have used this argument be prepared to say we should wait? Another six months? Another 12 months? Another two years? Have they ever bothered to look at the ramifications of that? Who is going to pay for the multinational force in the desert for such an extended period? What about Ramadan in March, the most holy period of the Islamic world when hundreds of thousands of Muslim pilgrims will go to Mecca? How do we remain in the Saudi desert for another summer-which is always extremely difficult? These are fundamental questions which military commanders must address and which political leaders cannot avoid. Yet we are told that sanctions were not given a fair go. </PARA>
<PARA> Through all that 5 1/2 months, as I have stated, time and time again Saddam Hussein was given the opportunity to remove his forces from Kuwait and to enter into negotiations. At no stage did a single one of those approaches bring forth any success at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The other great catchcry we hear is `No blood for oil'. This is interesting. Let us look at the figures-not of blood supply but of oil. Saudi Arabia provides 25.4 per cent of the world's supplies at the moment, Iraq 9.8 per cent and Kuwait 9.5 per cent. If Iraq controls Kuwait, that gives it control of 18.13 per cent of world supplies. If it had had a further attack, as was contemplated-and I emphasise that-on the Saudi Arabian oil reserves, that could have given Iraq control of approximately 43 per cent of the world's oil supplies, while the total Middle East supply is 65 per cent. Surely, purely on the mathematics, that case should rest. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder how many demonstrators and others who use that argument want petrol which they can afford? I wonder how many of them have considered how we are going to help the Third World get out of its poverty and destitution, when it is the main victim of high prices for oil or any restrictions in oil supplies? These same people call on us to turn our weapons into ploughshares, but may I remind them that to do even that we need oil. Yes, oil resources are a factor in this dispute-that is undeniable-but there is much more. </PARA>
<PARA> Led by the United States-and I give it full credit for that-we are now in the position of there being the possibility of a new world order in which the people of the Middle East and elsewhere will have the chance to negotiate a settlement and bring peace to that important region of the world which since 1918 has known very little peace, but massive instability. I hope we will see Jew and Arab share the undoubted potential that those two great races have, not only to improve their own economic and social well-being, but also to give the whole world the opportunity, which we desperately need, for an era of peace, which we thought we had a mere 12 months ago with the breakdown of the East-West confrontation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A few months ago I had the opportunity to speak briefly in this Parliament in opposition to a motion concerning citizens' initiative. During that debate I indicated my belief in the parliamentary system and obviously part of that belief encompasses an adherence to majority party positions. I indicate grave concerns about the way in which this decision has been reached. I have been wrong many times before and I hope, very genuinely, that this is another one of those occasions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I cannot get carried away with a lot of the rhetoric about the regime in Iraq. I genuinely see many similar features in regimes around the world. I must say initially that I do not wish it thought for one moment that in any way I support the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. I am not interested in the Iraqi arguments about whether Basra ruled Kuwait at a certain period as part of the Ottoman Empire. Certainly, the internal regime in Kuwait is irrelevant with regard to its rights to self-determination. The taking of hostages must be deplored and the use of captured servicemen, as has occurred in the last few days, must be similarly deplored. But, as I said earlier, I feel that I must express some doubts about the great confidence in this new world order that many speakers today and this evening have shown. </PARA>
<PARA> I must express some concerns about whether it will really occur; whether we can be assured that there will be new standards of international conduct and that this is not a one-off situation determined by factors such as oil-and anyone with half a brain can see the significance of that to the world economy. Even in the course of these events, one must have doubts about a number of actions which have been taken around the world. We have a situation where Gaddafi, to some people's surprise, has been supportive to some degree of the United Nations initiative. I, somewhat cynically, believe that perhaps that is part of an agenda which saw pro-Libyan forces seize Chad, and for the first time, surprisingly, the French Government could not save the then entrenched regime as it had done on many occasions. In Lebanon, Syrian forces continue to cement their control over the regime, leading in the last week or so to the resignations of people from widely differing political forces in the government there because of the increased Syrian control of that government. </PARA>
<PARA> So I have some reservations about the genuineness of the abhorrence of this regime. Whilst the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) is a person who everyone in this House recognises is genuine in following the positions of Amnesty International, to be honest a number of people in this House and around the world have not been too concerned about the positions of Amnesty International with regard to a variety of other countries. I do not for one moment think the position of Amnesty International-which is a very reputable organisation-in genuinely deploring what is happening is all that relevant to the question of whether war is justified. As I have said, one can go through all of the regimes of Africa, as one could, at various stages, have gone through a variety of regimes in south and central America, and find government actions which are just as horrific. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been said that sanctions have not been given enough time in which to work. People have drawn many historical analogies, most persistently about Hitler and Mussolini. I think it is very important that it be said today that the failure of sanctions in the lead-up to the Second World War was not an accident. We have to be honest and understand that the failure of those sanctions revolved around the concerns of a number of European countries about the threat from the Soviet Union, and their belief that these regimes represented a bulwark against the Soviet Union. We could find examples even within our own country of political forces which were prepared to see the expansion of a variety of these European powers. They were prepared to see the defeat of the Republican Government in Spain at the hands of Franco, with German and Italian aid. </PARA>
<PARA> People look at analogies such as our not having stood up to Hitler, and deduce that if we do not do fight Saddam Hussein now, tomorrow morning he will take over the world; but I have not heard anyone put forward the proposition that he has anywhere near the military power needed to accomplish that. I think we can say that, whilst deploring the Kuwaiti expansion, there must be doubts about the intentions of an assault on Saudi Arabia. The invasion of Kuwait was preceded by a variety of arguments over oil boundaries, access to the water and so on. When we talk about sanctions in this case we are talking about this very unanimity which every other speaker has stressed here today; the world united against Iraq. I do not agree with the conspiracy theory put forward by one of the speakers opposite that Iran and Syria hate Iraq so much that they wanted to help Iraq break the sanctions so that she could be crushed even more. I think that whole theory is quite questionable. There has not been concrete evidence of the breaking of the sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA> An article in the Australian Financial Review last week by Andrew Mack cited a Georgetown University survey which found that in those areas where sanctions had succeeded, embargo levels of 23 per cent to 25 per cent had been necessary. We are talking about 90 per cent plus. We are talking about an economy that is highly dependent upon one product, and a country that is very dependent upon Western technology. </PARA>
<PARA> I again turn to the hypocrisy of this situation. We all know about the complicity of the Western nations and the Soviet Union in arming Iraq, but some of the facts are worth repeating. Business Week talked of 16 nations that had aided Iraq's armament. It cited the case of Interatom-part of the Siemens organisation-which was asked to supply autoclaves that were highly classified for the conversion of uranium and fluorine into uranium hexafluoride. The company had some doubts about that. However, that did not stop it from continuing to supply pipes for the handling of uranium gases. When the former German economics Minister, Helmut Haussmann, was questioned about the activities of German companies with respect to Iraq, he said that the policy of the Federal Export Office was `When in doubt, decide in favour of the company'. So there has been a series of actions by international companies. In the case of Germany, long after the event, there is talk of prosecuting as many as 50 companies for their role in building up Iraq's chemical and nuclear capacity that we now deplore so much. </PARA>
<PARA> We are talking about the United States saying that the coordinating committee on export controls should look at Iraq. I wonder why it is happening now. Why did it not take some interest in it when it was involved in Iraq's armament? We have a situation where by 1987, $10,000m in Soviet Union aid had gone to Iraq's military. In 1987, Iraq was the second greatest buyer of arms in the world. We have a situation where, in 1987, the New York Times exposed the US action of aiding companies with satellite pictures and false information. I in no way wish to defend that regime, but I wish to say that I do not quite go along with the belief that it is that much more repressive than many other nations around the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday morning, it was everyone's friend. When I support this motion I want to speak particularly about the Palestinian aspect of it. I do not support the connection because the Iraqi Government wants it. I support it because I see it as part of the whole problem in the Middle East. The situation is one in which a variety of powers have been able to utilise the Palestinian Liberation Organisation. Whether it be Tunisia, Iraq or Syria, over a period of time, the PLO has been dependent upon them for aid. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst we are talking about and reciting United Nations resolutions, we should perhaps remember a few others. When we are saying that there is going to be a new world order, that human rights are going to be basic, that countries' borders are going to be respected, there are a few other UN resolutions that we should consider which the United States, and more so Israel, have not been too keen on. Resolution 605 condemns Israel's crimes against the Palestinian people. Resolution 252 states that there should be no change to the status of Jerusalem. Resolution 476 declares null and void Israeli changes in Jerusalem. Resolution 446 condemns the construction of settlements in occupied lands. Resolutions 242 and 338, perhaps more famous, concern the question of the inadmissibility of acquisition of land by force. I think we have heard that kind of allegation in the last few days. </PARA>
<PARA> I subscribe to the view that those resolutions should gain some adherence, that there has to be some connection with the rights of Palestinians in all this. In my case, in 1973 I felt very emotionally attached to Israel. During the Yom Kippur war, I thought that I wanted to go to Israel to defend it. But, quite frankly, I think we have to face up to a few changes in the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not the land of everyone running around in kibbutzim patting each other on the back. It is not the land of people just arrived from the Nazi holocaust with deep liberal values. It is a country increasingly affected by external threat and by the fact that increasing numbers of its population have come from oppressive societies and have continued to hold their values when they arrive in Israel. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the country in which today we see a situation where the Jewish underground people have had their sentences reduced four times, where Reverend Mosue Levinger, after shooting an Arab shopkeeper point-blank, received a five-month sentence because it was deemed to be death by negligence. We have a situation where on 20 December last year, the Anglican, Lutheran, Catholic, Greek Orthodox and Armenian churches stated:</PARA>
<PARA>We deplore the fact that patriarchs and the heads of the Christian churches in the Holy Land are constant targets of attacks by Israeli officials and the Israeli media. We consider it our sacred duty to voice our concern about human rights violations in the occupied territories. </PARA>
<PARA>It is a country increasingly threatened by theocratic forces. It is difficult to catch buses or to go to cinemas and a variety of other things are severely under attack as conservative forces try to entrench theocratic rules in the country. It is a country where World Vision could quote the Swedish Save the Children Fund which has pointed out that one in 20 children in occupied territories suffered Intifada related injuries; that 50,000 to 63,000 children required medical treatment in the first two years of the Intifada. So when we talk about the horrific attacks on children in Kuwait, we should perhaps bear that in mind in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I have a belief that sanctions should have been tried for a longer period. We have heard about a 10 per cent reduction in Iraq's gross domestic product. We have a situation where there was almost universal support for those sanctions, far greater than what we saw in Rhodesia or South Africa where some of the same forces that are now so gung ho for action said that we should try longer and harder, that sanctions should have been given a chance. </PARA>
<PARA> We are here, months after we were told by our own Government and the American Government that there was value in sanctions and that they were going to be effective. Now, apparently, all the information we had was wrong. Despite international intelligence we were told that the sanctions were not going to work from the beginning. There were unidentified facets of the problem that we did not know about then and sanctions thereby failed. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a situation which might not have much occurrence in Australia. It is a position which had very strong support from the United States Congress. We should appreciate that amongst those who had grave doubts with the US position are people like Paul Nitze, Reagan's major arms negotiator, a person not known for small `l' liberal values or weakness in foreign affairs. This is a view which was supported by elements in the Democratic Party who have taken a bipartisan position in regard to America's security interests. There are people such as Nunn who similarly has never been identified with putting his partisan political position forward when it came to security issues. Obviously, a decision has been made by the Australian Labor Party. It is a position that I have grave doubts about. I do not have the same confidence as many people in this House that we are going to see this brand new world where individual countries' rights will be respected when they clash with superpowers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been in this House now for a total period of nearly 12 years. I have never witnessed, let alone participated in, a more grave debate than the one that we are engaged in today and which will continue again tomorrow. I think there can be no doubt in the minds of all of us in this chamber and in the other place that there can be no more serious resolution than one reaffirming the decision to commit our nation to war, however limited our current participation, especially when we do not know the magnitude or the duration of that war, both aspects which are very uncertain if, indeed, knowable at all at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I recognise that the full political weight of this decision is borne by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and his Government, shared by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and those on this side of the House. But the full consequence of our decision is currently being borne by the men and women of our Defence Force who are serving in the Gulf region. I think the full emotion of our decision is being experienced not only by them in the Gulf, but by their families and friends and loved ones who they have left behind who, perhaps on an hourly basis, are anxious about their future and the safety of their return. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason so many in this chamber are participating in this debate is because in a very real sense all of us share the weight of the decision, the consequence and the emotion. For those observing the debate or listening to it from afar, there should be no doubt about the fact that it is a decision that has been taken with the utmost gravity and seriousness. </PARA>
<PARA> As I make a contribution in this debate, let me say what I am not. I am not a foreign affairs or defence expert; I am not flush with all the nuances of international diplomacy. I am certainly not across the enormous technological detail of modern defence equipment and neither am I versed in the tactical or strategic considerations of modern war. Indeed, in a very personal sense, I represent a generation that was not even old enough to be eligible for the Vietnam ballot. </PARA>
<PARA> But I do know something. I know something about the people that I am privileged to represent in this place. They occupy the suburbs of south metropolitan Perth, the names of which most Australians would have never even heard of, let alone forget. And yet these are Australians just like the 17 million of us who are concerned about their families and their future. They want an opportunity to live their lives as they would wish and they have a hope and a desire that the rest of the peoples of all the nations around the world will have that same opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> The balance of representations coming to me over recent weeks is that Australians want peace but not peace at any price, and certainly not the price of appeasement. It is from this perspective that I know, with all the emotion that I can muster, that we are doing absolutely the right thing. As so many speakers from both sides of the House have said tonight, this war did not start a few days ago. It started on 2 August last year, when Iraqi forces, without provocation, marched into Kuwait, crushed the defence forces of that little nation, and since that date have been systematically destroying the Kuwaiti nation as we know it. </PARA>
<PARA> In the sense of bipartisanship that prevails in this debate, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Keating) got it right earlier today when he characterised Saddam Hussein's ambitions as being in four areas. He said that, firstly, Saddam Hussein was all about relieving Iraq of its debt burden to Kuwait as a result of the Iraq-Iran war. What better way to alleviate one's debt burden to one's banker than to go in and take over the bank? He also said that, secondly, Saddam was motivated by the desire to gain the present assets of Kuwait-an oil rich nation with substantial assets. Thirdly, Saddam Hussein has been motivated by a desire to have sea access to the Gulf. Fourthly-and it is a point that weighs very heavily on my personal decision to support the motion-Saddam is concerned to gain the buried wealth of Kuwait to continue to fund his giant war machine, which has been ticking over since 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> So many speakers have characterised Saddam Hussein that I do not need to repeat in detail what I believe him to be. He is a domestic tyrant of the very worst kind, and it is now clear that he has international ambitions and a willingness to ruthlessly pursue those ambitions by military force. </PARA>
<PARA> I listened to and certainly respect the disquiet expressed by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson). He has come to his judgment and I have come to mine. I firmly believe that Kuwait, so far as Saddam Hussein is concerned, is simply step one. Australia is many thousands of miles away, and after 2 August last year we could easily have turned our backs on the plight of the Kuwaiti nation, the plight of the Kuwaiti people, and washed our hands of the matter. We could easily have done that, but I am very pleased that the Prime Minister showed the leadership that he has, supported by the Leader of the Opposition and all parties in this chamber, and that we did not do that, because if we had turned our backs then for my money that would have been not the end of the matter but only the beginning. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some very simplistic analogies that I would bring forward in this situation, which are not found in the international textbooks and certainly not on the diplomatic cocktail party circuit but which equate to my understanding and what I believe is the Australian understanding of this issue. The analogy is the playground bully or the street thug. The first thing one does is report that person to the school principal or to the police. If they are ineffectual in disciplining such an individual there is only one course of action left open and that is to understand that such an individual recognises only strength and force. As regrettable as it may be, that is the position that we find ourselves in so far as Saddam Hussein is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> He has successfully subjugated his own people and on more than one occasion practised genocide of minorities in his country. It seems that it is almost inevitable that dictatorships start wars. Once they are in control of their own backyard they get an inflated view of their own world importance and look beyond their own picket fence. Democratic nations do not start wars but it certainly is the democratic nations of the free world which have a responsibility to stop dictators in their tracks because if we do not, it will only get worse. </PARA>
<PARA> If we were to adopt a course of action different from the one that we are confirming today, we would put at risk the regional stability and security of the Middle East, as troubled as it is today. Saddam unchecked would be like a desert lion, roaming around for the next kill-a totally unacceptable situation. We would be risking an oil hegemony dominated by Iraq, and previous speakers have spoken about the leverage that he would be able to exercise over the world's oil reserves if unchecked-a totally unacceptable position. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally-and I have more faith than the honourable member for Reid on this point-we would be abrogating our responsibilities to try to forge a new world order post-Cold War. If we adopted a different course of action, basically through our inaction, we would be signalling to every tin-pot, two-star dictator around the world that we, the free world, did not have the guts, gumption and wherewithal to stand him up in his place. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is a responsible member of what used to be known as the Western alliance, we are a responsible member of the world community, and we have a role to play proportionately commensurate with our size and our capability, and I am very pleased that this motion confirms that role. The United Nations, the world generally and certainly the United States led coalition have displayed enormous restraint. Resolution after resolution-12 of them in fact-has been passed by the United Nations General Assembly. We have had 5 1/2 months of the regime of sanctions but I am of the school which asks how much longer would we wait, especially when on our television screens throughout that 5 1/2 months we have seen Saddam Hussein laughing at the face of the world, flirting with hostages, obscenely parading them on nightly television, while all the while strengthening his military position. </PARA>
<PARA> Madam Deputy Speaker, I was pleased to hear your contribution to the debate, and I share with you the view that no-one wants war. This is not a chamber of warmongers. Even if we have no direct personal experience in that most horrid of human activity, we understand the death, destruction and waste that it brings in its wake. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the peace groups that if they are genuinely concerned about peace, and if they want to express that concern in a simplistic slogan, I have one for them: Saddam out. That is the slogan they should be chanting. If Saddam Hussein were to get out of Kuwait, to announce that tonight his time, we would have the prospect of peace beginning tomorrow. Regrettably, that prospect seems very far removed. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to pay tribute to the United States and President Bush. I am not one who is hung up with some ideological baggage about the United States. The free world can think itself terribly lucky that it has a leader of the stature of George Bush who has put together the coalition and driven the United Nations in the way in which he and the United States have. We can think ourselves lucky that the Soviet Union, while not being a direct participant, has supported the United Nations. We can think ourselves even more lucky that Israel, which has every right, is exercising restraint and not allowing itself to fall into the trap that Hussein is setting for it in trying to bring about an Arab-Israeli conflict. This decision is not one that we take lightly; it is not one that we take gladly; but we have a role to play, and a role to play we will. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That great historian of war, Thucydides, informed us two and a half thousand years ago about the nature of war:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>That war is an evil is something that we all know, and it would be pointless to go on cataloguing all the disadvantages involved in it. The fact is that one side thinks that the profits to be won outweigh the risks to be incurred and the other side is ready to face danger rather than accept an immediate loss. </PARA>
<PARA> War involves military conflict between those who attack and those who defend, order and position. This particular war started when Iraq attacked, conquered, subjugated and then looted Kuwait, killing up to 10,000 of its citizens and dispersing half of its citizenry, about 400,000 people. This was rape and pillage on a grand scale, Genghis Khan style. I fear that only the pyramid of skulls was missing. </PARA>
<PARA> An Iraqi withdrawal could stop this war. The Baath regime of Iraq is a military dictatorship run by a religious minority whose leadership derives from one region and is held together by the family of its personality cult figure, Saddam Hussein. It is a modern Sparta of 17 million people, one million in the military, with a huge arsenal of weaponry bought with oil revenue and a Third World industrial base. </PARA>
<PARA> The regime was built on the blood of consecutive coups against the Iraqi monarchy and then against and between the warring revolutionary factions. It has been sustained by massive domestic repression, including public hangings, aerial gassings and the dictator's own personal gun. It has developed or bought a full range of modern weapons of mass destruction from nuclear, through biological, to chemical, together with the long range artillery, advanced airplanes and surface to surface missiles to deliver them. It has used this massively armed repressive state apparatus to perpetrate conventional and terroristic aggression throughout the Middle East region by subsidising various terrorist sects, notably in the Lebanon, but including the Palestine Liberation Front and the Abu Nidal group, and attacking neighbouring states. Its 1980 attack on Iran resulted in about one million deaths with absolutely no change to the existing order other than impoverishment of both states. </PARA>
<PARA> Iraq destroyed Kuwait in order to acquire its massive oil reserves worth about $150 billion and to liquidate the debts that it had incurred to Kuwait as loans during its unsuccessful war with Iran. This, despite the fact that Kuwait was recognised as an independent state by its neighbours, the international community, the United Nations and by Iraq. Kuwait was, sadly, not a model democracy but then few, indeed no, states in that part of the world are. </PARA>
<PARA> The oil reserves of Iraq, plus Kuwait, comprise about one-fifth of total known world reserves. If the Saudi Arabian and Gulf fields were added to this figure it would be close to one-half of known world oil reserves. The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries would then be reconstituted and revived under the leadership of a state whose expressed intentions include the eviction of all Western influence from the region, the transformation of the international economy for its own enrichment and the total destruction of at least one neighbouring state, Israel. This is a regime capable of pursuing and reasoning geopolitics in terms of the resources and positions to be won, calculated against the mega-deaths and billions of dollars involved in costs. We in this country totally lack this tradition and perhaps lack the capacity to envisage it. </PARA>
<PARA> Iraq has demonstrated the intention, the motive and the capability to, if unresisted, acquire that 50 per cent of known world oil reserves and the international community has understandably acted with accelerated alarm in the light of its illegal, immoral and unjustified aggression against Kuwait. Thucydides would recognise that the Athenian League confronts Sparta. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 2 August 1990 the United Nations member states have continually called on Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. I repeat: compliance would produce an immediate end to this conflict. This has been continually repeated by leaders of the United States and the United Nations before and since the military action of 17 January. </PARA>
<PARA> Since August 1990 the United Nations Security Council has passed 12 motions condemning Iraq. The margins have varied from 15-nil to 12-2, when on 29 November only Cuba and Yemen opposed authorising a military action after 15 January. During that time the UN adopted a series of measures imposing and enforcing a series of economic sanctions by very similar margins in the vote and with Australia's support. It should be stressed that these sanctions had absolutely no effect. I do not mean that they had no effect on the gross national product, the import or export of goods or economic activity in different parts of Iraq; that is not the purpose of sanctions. The purpose of economic sanctions is to alter the behaviour of the state that is the subject of them. In this case they had absolutely no effect. </PARA>
<PARA> I read recently about one local expert claiming they were the most effective sanctions ever imposed. What nonsense! During their imposition up to 500,000 Iraqi military personnel fortified their positions in and around Kuwait in a manner that will make their dislodging extremely dangerous and, if undertaken prematurely, extremely costly in coalition lives. I should add, for enthusiasts of sanctions, that I can think of very few sanctions policies that have in themselves produced the desired results. The partial successes in Rhodesia, Zimbabwe and South Africa have been more the product of domestic revolts of the subject population. </PARA>
<PARA> On 29 November UN resolution 678 effectively committed that organisation's member states to a military action after 15 January in recognition of the impotence of the economic sanctions regime. This has the support of around 100 member states, 34 of which are contributing to the collective security action in the area. Contributing states, it should be noted, include Muslim, Arab, Communist, capitalist and democratic states from Europe, the Americas, Africa, Asia and Oceania. In the great democracies-the United States, the United Kingdom, France and other advanced countries-this action has been supported, and in the United Kingdom and America after very extensive debates in their legislatures. It should be noted that there was no public debate about the subject in Iraq and Iraq has the support, to my knowledge, of no other states. Even the Arab League states have overwhelmingly opposed its actions. It is, indeed, a pariah state. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has joined this process after the most extensive debates in this Parliament and within the major political parties which have produced overwhelming support for the Government's position. Opinion polls vary but so far have suggested fairly heavy public support. Within my own party support for the Government since 17 January has been expressed in my own bailiwick by a motion passed nem con at our State Council, the governing body, and nearly unanimously by the FEC executive. It should also be noted that the move to physical eviction was taken only after the most extensive diplomatic efforts failed. This is well accepted internationally, despite Iraq's efforts to depict the United States as condoning the invasion. It is a myth of such enormous proportions that I would not believe Iraq was even trying to perpetrate it had I not read it in The Independent, much to my dismay. </PARA>
<PARA> But despite this, it was again with great dismay that I heard from a live radio interview-as the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) will testify, since he saw me a couple of minutes later-that military action had been undertaken. As ready as I was to support and condone such action, when it actually took place I was stunned. Violence stuns everybody; no-one likes war. But we are dealing with a state that has violated the norms of international behaviour and has sought to threaten the fabric of the international trading economy on which world prosperity depends. One may say that is a tall order for such a small dictatorship. But geology, history and its own ferocity have combined to produce this. </PARA>
<PARA> In response, the United Nations has carefully taken steps to ensure that its war of defence of the pre-existing order is just, both in purpose and prosecution. I believe that within the limits of human contrivance, these aims have been achieved. Its purpose I have already canvassed. Its prosecution will involve three stages. The first stage is the destruction, by aerial bombardment principally, of the muscular structure of the Iraqi military machine: its air power; missile batteries; biological and chemical warfare capabilities; its nuclear weapons research centre; and its command, control and communications systems. Civilian targets have been avoided to the extent possible, and even the Iraqi regime claims fewer than 200 civilian casualties.</PARA>
<PARA> The second stage must unfortunately be the besieging and dislodgment of the Iraqi army of occupation in Kuwait which used the five-month period of sanctions and coalition building to dig in deep. I trust that many of the 2,000 aerial sorties which are being flown daily by the coalition are devoted to ensuring that this ground assault will be against fortifications whose structures and morale have been mortally damaged. I fear that in any case it is going to be a long and bloody campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> The third stage will involve constructing a post-conflict regional order in which this dictatorship cannot again threaten both neighbouring and distant states with its excesses of ambition. I should say it should be acknowledged that dismembering the Iraqi warfare state would assist that process no end. </PARA>
<PARA> The unfolding of the UN response since 2 August has been the classic and intensifying application of the doctrine of collective security against aggression. We on this side of the House take particular pride in supporting this doctrine since, after all, it was an earlier Australian Labor Minister for External Affairs, later President of the UN General Assembly, Dr Evatt, who helped create the institutional basis for it. Further, and despite peculiar isolated criticisms in the press and elsewhere about the Government's decision-making process, we all applaud the leadership being given by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). In turn, I should say that my colleagues and I welcome the support being given by the Opposition. Finally, in accord with collective security practice, we should repeatedly state that this war can be stopped and peace can be created by one simple act: the withdrawal or even the announced intention of withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> I should mention now a few of the red herrings that have been proposed by those opposing government policy outside this chamber. First, this is not the Vietnam war, nor is it even like it. The insurrection against a corrupt regime in the South Vietnam of the early 1960s should not have excited us or our American allies to the extent it did with such tragic results. It posed no coherent threat to international order or our material interests and was better ignored. Secondly, while I support the legitimate aspirations of the Palestinian Arabs for political self-determination, it is an issue which must be separated from the issue of Kuwait which requires our undivided attention at the moment. The solution to the problem of the Palestinian Arabs should deserve our immediate attention shortly thereafter. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, it is also the case that much of the arsenal of the Iraqi state was acquired from the West: some out of a previous strategic logic that then understandably preferred Saddam's survival to the regional hegemony of the then Iranian revolutionary mullahs; and some was acquired as a result of the excesses of the profit motive by some western corporations. We should learn one lesson from this situation of re-examining the possibility of the recurrence of these instances. Fourthly, that the boundaries of the region are artificial is suggested as some kind of mitigation for Baghdad's barbarism. This is the logic of the front bar wrapped in an Iraqi history primer. It is the logic of anarchy if applied to the world's political geography. </PARA>
<PARA> Fifthly, we hear that access to oil is not to be defended. Its defence indeed does deserve consideration, even by those transported to protest against its defence by internal combustion engines adorned in the oil derivatives they so despise: the plastics, the artificial fabrics, the fibreglass and the like. Finally, it is bemoaned that violations of moral order in Timor, Lebanon or elsewhere have gone unchecked. With this I sympathise. But the recent demise of the Cold War has afforded for the first time in 40 years the opportunity to construct a UN-based international order. We should not miss the chance to try. </PARA>
<PARA> We of the United Nations wage a just war in defence of both moral order and self-interest, those two aims of political action which, as we all know, are inextricably connected in a manner that only the naive or the tyrannical could ignore. But while there are just wars, there are few just armies. So I urge that, if the time arises for the Iraqi forces to be dug out of their fortifications in order to liberate conquered Kuwait, the United Nations commanders not be hastened by political considerations but rather minimise coalition casualties by a thorough and determined preparation because I fear it could be a long campaign. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity of speaking in support of the motion. As many honourable members have said before, this is very much an historic occasion in this House where both sides for the first time in the 15 years I have been here have given such a matter their support. I speak also as one who was a conscript in 1952 at the time of the Korean war. It is interesting to draw a comparison. It was only the intervention of the United Nations (UN) and the great resolution and intervention by troops of the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Australia and other allied countries that brought about a solution there; otherwise North Korea would undoubtedly have taken over South Korea and perhaps beyond. So we are not speaking about something tonight that is unique or unusual.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Could I also say that, in speaking as one of those conscripts, I am very much aware in this year of 1991 that the ramifications of this for three of the sons that I have is rather immense and bears on my position at this time. The motion itself, of course, is important because, as somebody has said already in this debate, it carries with it a commitment not only by this Parliament, but also by the Australian people. Our commitment is already there in the three ships that are in the Gulf and their crews. I would suggest that there is not one honourable member in this House who has not got a constituent actively serving on one of those vessels. There is not an Australian who will not be touched in some way or another, whether as the relatives of personnel in the armed services or perhaps on those boats or as a parent. </PARA>
<PARA> What I want to say is that non-intervention should be of greater concern to every person in the world because if this is left unchecked undoubtedly it will bear upon the six billion people in the world today. It also shows our commitment as a member nation to the United Nations, and that resolutions undertaken by the United Nations have in these instances to be reinforced by force. It also indicates our commitment to our international obligations. It is rather interesting to note that, just after the seventy-fifth anniversary of Anzac, Australians are again serving overseas in an international response to Australia's obligations. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people have already asked: why should Australia be involved? Because of our distance from the conflict in the Middle East, why do we have to be involved? Of course, we all know these days with the technology that is available that distance is no longer a disqualification as far as involvement is concerned. While we are an island, we cannot isolate ourselves against the reality of what is happening in the rest of the world, as our trade indicates to us in a normal sense. We have to treat Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and all those other Middle Eastern countries as neighbours who are in need of help, as we ourselves some time in the future might require that type of assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> The comment has already been made that there has not been enough time for negotiations. I ask: why was 5 1/2 months not been sufficient time to negotiate, if negotiations were possible? As others have mentioned, the war was not initiated in January; it was initiated on 2 August of last year when, without any provocation, Iraq invaded and occupied a foreign sovereign nation and soil. It did that with all the aggression, all the brutality and all the might that its war machine could muster, and followed it with a propaganda machine that has failed to convince the world of its view. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The negotiation time has long since expired. What has happened in that negotiating period is that further atrocities, which have been referred to by quite a few speakers in this House tonight, have been perpetrated by Iraq against the people of Kuwait. These atrocities have been evidenced by no less an authority than Amnesty International. It states that scores of people were hanged on the grounds of Kuwait University: six youngsters were hanged for distributing leaflets; four were shot for possession of a camera and a photocopying machine; a family of seven were shot for possession of a United States passport which was not theirs; and the manager of a food store was shot for not displaying a photograph of Saddam Hussein. All of these atrocities are documented.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We also had innocent people in Kuwait and Iraq being held as hostages to protect and secure armed installations. I understand that as late as the 10 o'clock news tonight there was some indication that prisoners of war might be used to serve in economic and scientific zones, quite contrary to what I understand the Geneva convention to be. Those sorts of things are still going on. Also in that 5 1/2 months the deadline of 15 January was set so that negotiations could be carried on. </PARA>
<PARA> Many people have drawn a comparison with the Chamberlain situation prior to the last war. I think we have learnt from that experience. Certainly there has been no reason to extend the Chamberlain phil-osophy to the Middle East. After 5 1/2 months what we have is almost a war by appointment-an appointment set not by the United Nations or by the United States but by Saddam Hussein himself. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the slogans of the people in the gallery this afternoon was `Blood for oil'. It is surprising that people should think like that because that has not been the reaction of the United Nations or the alliance to the occupation of Kuwait. In fact, it was Saddam's actions which showed that he would spill blood for oil. Kuwait is a great example of that because, by getting possession of its oil, Saddam has in his hands a great percentage of the world's oil resources. Blood was spilt by the Iraqis for the oil resource. One might say that it is blood spilt on the altar of Saddam's ambition, greed and fanaticism. </PARA>
<PARA> If it were not for the intervention of the United States-and again I pay tribute to the United States, President Bush and the United Nations for the manner in which they have led the world-Saudi Arabia also would probably have fallen into the hands of Iraq. Who knows what would have happened to the emirates of Oman and Yemen, which are within the Gulf region? I firmly believe that hadSaddam Hussein not been checked at that stage the picture in the Gulf would have been totally different. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the man's reputation, about which a lot has been said today-again, there is a lot of material on record-the suggestion of a holy war and Iraq's record. In the eight-year war between Iraq and Iran the losses were counted in millions. This was not a holy war between Muslims and Christians or Muslims and Jews. This was a war of Arab against Arab. We have heard talk of the murder of Saddam's own kinsmen and the murder of the Kurds in the northern part of Iraq by chemical weapons. Again, it was Arab against Arab. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Where were the peace protesters then?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0F4">Mr BRAITHWAITE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We might ask what their comments were then. What were their comments in connection with the atrocities enumerated by Amnesty International, both within Iraq and outside? An interesting article in the Australian newspaper last weekend states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Enthusiasm for unconventional warfare is only one of the characteristics of Hussein which should excite the outrage of peace demonstrators. When Hussein seized the leadership of the Iraqi Ba'athist Party in 1979 he moved against five of his closest supporters, had them tortured, staged public confessions, and then took part himself in their execution . . . Torture and execution of supposed dissidents became routine and most probably has intensified since the annexation of Kuwait. Religious and tribal dissent has been met with particular ferocity. Hussein butchered the dissident Muslim leaders of the Dawa. He used mustard gas and cyanide . . . against the Kurds . . . men, women and children-and then renamed the town after himself. </PARA>
<PARA>Where were the peace protesters when that was taking place? More recently we have seen the occupation of Kuwait. Again, it was Arab stock against Arab stock. Somebody has suggested that the occupation by Saddam was in order to relieve himself of the $20 billion debt burden incurred by Iraq in financing the war against Iran. I might also mention that some $600m has been lost to Australian trade and Australian farmers as a result of the declaration of war. I refer also to the more recent uncalled for and unprovoked strikes against Israel in order for Saddam Hussein to achieve his end of promoting himself as the leader of the Arabs in a holy war. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, we might ask the protesters who were here today where they were when those atrocities were committed. I think all we would hear is a thundering silence. I could describe some of the protesters in the gallery this afternoon as being rather selfish. They want freedom of speech and expression, and they had it today. They have the freedom to protest, which they did today. However, they exercise these freedoms under the protective umbrella of the Australian system-a social and financial security system and a system of civil liberties. It would be interesting to know how many of those people who protested today protest regularly at other events throughout Australia and how many of them are paid by the Commonwealth through social security, Austudy and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> I do know that those people do not have the answers. While those benefits are available to them under the Australian system, obviously they would deny those same rights to the Iranians, the Kurds, the Kuwaitis, the Israelis, their fellow Arabs, and, last but by no means least, the Iraqis themselves, who will suffer, as they have done before, on the altar of Saddam's pride, arrogance and ambition. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note the answer of some of these protesters, illustrated in a statement of concern that came into my possession and is signed by two of my constituents. The statement says that a full scale war could destroy Kuwait and not liberate it. I suggest that Kuwait is already being destroyed and is far from liberated. It also suggests:</PARA>
<PARA> Pursue United Nations' sanctions and negotiations to secure unconditional withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA>As I have said, nothing has happened in 5 1/2 months and nothing will happen in that regard. The statement goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> Give a commitment to oppose a pre-emptive strike on Iraq or Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that that pre-emptive strike was initiated on 2 August not by the alliance but by Iraq itself. The statement continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Support a negotiated withdrawal of military forces on both sides in order to reduce tension and the risk of war. </PARA>
<PARA>I think Saddam believes that his only way to save face is to enter into a war and lose it and try to establish himself as an Arab leader. The statement continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Support a negotiated regional settlement through the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, all that has been tried. So these people do not have any answers and do not offer anything conclusive that would relieve the world of the war situation we are now in. </PARA>
<PARA> I took part in the Prime Minister's fact finding delegation in 1988. I came back with a very healthy respect for many Middle East countries. Jordan, which was one of the countries visited, finds itself in the middle as a buffer between East and West. Six thousand years of confrontation and conflict throughout the Middle East has taught them nothing. But I have a healthy respect for Jordan. I admire, and we must recognise, the manner in which Egypt has given its support in the face of much hostility from the Arabs to the alliance. Finally, we must recognise Israel's great restraint in not retaliating. </PARA>
<PARA> I join with others whose minds and hearts go out to the Australians in the crews of those three ships and wish them everything of the best from both this Parliament and myself. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 2 August 1990, Iraq took possession of the sovereign state of Kuwait. In a short period of six months this Middle East conflict has been subjected to closer scrutiny and more detailed analysis than possibly any war in the history of mankind. So much has been said on tele-vision, radio and through the press that it is unlikely that anything new will emerge from this debate. This debate really does little more than enable each member of this House to state where he or she stands in relation to the Gulf crisis and provide reasons why that position is adopted. I am pleased and proud that the motion before the House has been supported so strongly by almost every member.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I majored in history at university and taught history in New South Wales high schools for more than 20 years. That background is not intended to convey any suggestion that I know all the answers, but it does say that I have spent some considerable time studying the reasons why nations engage in war. Wars can start accidentally or through misunderstandings, but more generally they are deliberately ignited. The causes of a war can be very complex, but far more commonly they can be attributed to the desire of one nation to establish hegemony over another. </PARA>
<PARA> There cannot be any shadow of doubt about the reason for the war currently being waged by an international force against Iraq. The international force is in the Middle East not as a perpetrator of war but as a force to aid world peace. Australia is in the Gulf as a member of a family of nations; a family as remarkable as any established; a family formed for one single purpose: to assist the United Nations to achieve its charter. Who could quarrel with the aims and purposes of the United Nations? What genuine lover of peace could argue against the role of the United Nations in promoting world peace and upholding the right of self-deter-mination of individual nations? One man, and one man alone, is responsible for the tragedy which is occurring in the Middle East. That man is Saddam Hussein, who is as great a threat to the world as was Adolf Hitler. </PARA>
<PARA> Comparisons can be somewhat risky, even dangerous, but the international community is justified in making comparisons between Hitler and SaddamHussein, this would-be Nebuchadnezzar, Saladin or Nasser, who intends to be the unrivalled leader of the Arab world. It would be unfair to blame all Arabs for Saddam's atrocities, just as it would be unfair to blame all Germans for Hitler's crimes. Both tyrants trampled over all opposition and anyone who opposed their megalomania and employed barbaric, tyrannical methods to silence voices of reason and sanity within their own countries. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot go into great detail about historical facts, but after World War I a praiseworthy attempt was made to ensure that the war to end all wars was the last war and that there would be no more wars of that nature or magnitude. The League of Nations was therefore formed to preserve world peace. Later, appeasement was pursued as a policy to prevent World War II, but peace failed. Peace failed because it is impossible to appease the Hitlers of this world, just as it is impossible to appease the Saddams of this world. Unfortunately, the League ofNations failed. Though it was created with such high hopes and did much good work, it failed ultimately because it had no teeth, no fire power. It failed because it could not call upon an effective international system or force to put out brush fires before they took growth and developed to set the world alight. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is not a major power. Who can say that at some time in the future we will not be threatened by a larger and more powerful nation as we have been in our past? We all know the wave of hope we experienced when the tension between the two superpowers ended. We all had created within ourselves a hope of a peaceful world well into the foreseeable future. Should we be prepared to allow Saddam to threaten that recently felt sense of security? Are we wrong to rejoice that there is a promise of a new world order where the United Nations will be able to call on an international peacekeeping force to halt naked aggression? Will the lovers of peace, those who loathe and detest the killing fields of the world, lament the exit of such people as Idi Amin, Hitler and Saddam?</PARA>
<PARA> As a member of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I appreciate the briefings provided to the Committee on the Gulf issues. There has been no demur, no argument, among members of that Committee. I applaud the handling of the question by the United Nations, the leaders of the other nations engaged in the coalition against Iraq, our own Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and his Ministers. Hard but necessary decisions have been made. There is perhaps not unanimity but a very solid agreement that we are acting justly, and I congratulate the Opposition for supporting the Government's viewpoint. It has adopted a very honourable position. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to impugn the motives of those people who attend peace demonstrations. Others have said that we cannot really question their sincerity. But it has been said-and this must be a repetitive debate because there are so many speakers and we are only debating one subject-that peace demonstrators have formed their views and made their judgments. I support their democratic right to express their feelings. But it is disappointing that they are prepared to listen to only one side of any argument and then regurgitate views which seem best designed to create divisions within Australian society. As others have said, there has been a deafening silence from the peace groups about Iraqi atrocities committed against Kuwaitis. We have all been provided with ample information about the barbarism, the plundering, the summary executions, the rapes and the torture that have been committed in that country. </PARA>
<PARA> Peace demonstrators will not believe the ample evidence that sanctions against Iraq were not working. I think most of us here realise that those sanctions, although they had some small effect, were not crippling Iraq and would not bring Saddam Hussein to his senses but merely provide him with breathing space to develop his chemical and nuclear weapons potential. </PARA>
<PARA> Peace demonstrators will not listen to arguments that the stakes in the Gulf are higher than oil or that Kuwait is a different proposition from Vietnam. I do not have the time to go into all the intricacies of those two wars. Perhaps we should not expect peace groups to listen to governments, but it is surprising that greater heed is not paid by the peace groups to such reputable bodies as Amnesty International. Amnesty has given a whole recital of terrible human rights violations. </PARA>
<PARA> Any and every war is a horror and only a megalomaniac or psychopath would desire its carnage. But it is an obscenity for any parliamentary member, particularly when that member does not have to make the hard decisions, to beat his or her chest and claim a monopoly thirst for peace. It reminds me of the New Testament story, `Lord, I thank you that I am not a sinner like other men'. There is something obscene and totally hypocritical about that. Similarly, it is an obscenity, an absolute hypocrisy, for any person to claim that no war can be justified. I am glad that my Returned Services League mates and all those who sacrificed their lives for their country did not merely sit around Australia's coastline singing `Give peace a chance' in 1942. If one had the time, one could go right through and enumerate hundreds of illustrations of just wars. </PARA>
<PARA> Is there no sympathy within the ranks of the peace groups for the people of Israel, no admiration for their admirable restraint?</PARA>
<PARA> Our Prime Minister has quite rightly made the point that peace and freedom are fundamental rights. Sometimes, tragically, we have to fight to retain them. The world in which we live is unfortunately less than perfect. Man has fought since the beginning of time, and perhaps we are being too optimistic in believing that we can prevent war and eliminate it from history. But the attempt to achieve that dream is worthwhile. Diplomacy will often succeed, but not when it comes up against a Saddam Hussein, whose intent on aggrandisement is totally inflexible. When diplomacy fails, the idea of an international force to arbitrate disputes and stop their escalation becomes an attractive alternative. An international disciplinary body may well work, and the conflict in the Middle East is its testing ground. It will be a sad moment for the world if the United Nations' endeavours in the current war do not achieve their desired effect. </PARA>
<PARA> Every balanced member of the human race detests war. The unbiased mind knows that the United Nations and the governments of all the countries involved in the campaign against Iraq did everything humanly possible to avert armed combat. There is incontestable evidence that Saddam Hussein planned to crush Israel and the whole of the Middle East had his rape of Kuwait been allowed to go unchecked. Given time to develop fully Iraq's chemical and nuclear potential, we can only ponder on Saddam's intentions for the infidel nations. </PARA>
<PARA> If there is such a thing as a just war, the attempt to bring peace to the Gulf region qualifies. But despite all the evidence, because of our abhorrence of war, we hesitated, we anguished, we agonised; we pursued diplomatic measures to the nth degree before we took action in an attempt to restore stability in the Middle East. I am no sabre rattler; I have said my prayers for peace, as I am sure all honourable members have. But, now that the war has started, I urge all Australians to pray for a swift and just result that will give us a chance for peace long into the future. I know that I share with all Australians the common thought that my loyalty is to my country and to the brave men and women who serve Australia. I support the motion before the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I drafted most of what I have to say this evening during the weekend at my home in the outer eastern suburbs of Melbourne on a beautiful summer's day, watching, with so many other Australians, the developing war on my television screen. As I sat there comfortable and safe, my thoughts were very much with our service personnel in the Gulf. I have personally been in similar situations on more than one occasion and therefore I have some understanding of what they are going through-the fear, the worry, the thoughts of home and in particular perhaps the dismay that they must be feeling about the lack of support from some sections of the Australian community being so extensively relayed to them on television.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Therefore my theme this evening is one of concern for our men and women in the Gulf. I will not restate all of the detailed arguments for or against the action taken by the United Nations; that has been done at length in the media and by others in this place. But I wish to offer some comments on three or four particular issues with emphasis on support for our armed forces. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the Government action to date and I endorse the statements of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). I am disappointed that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) took so long to recall the Parliament to debate the ever changing situation, because it is a long time since these matters were debated, in December, and much has changed since then. This is the forum for such debate and we should have been back here sooner. </PARA>
<PARA> But, that said, we need to examine the current situation. All sane men and women condemn Saddam Hussein's attack on Kuwait, his personal history of violence, his use of chemical weapons even on his own people and his aggressive conduct against Kuwait, including the rape, torture and pillage that we have heard so much about today. All of these actions are well documented. </PARA>
<PARA> All sane women and men deplore having to go to war. They recognise the horrors of war and they recognise the cost of war in economic, environmental, political and, above all, human terms. But the people in the Australian community at large, whilst sad at what has happened, whilst wishing there could be another way, have been saying to me overwhelmingly as I move around my electorate of Aston that they support the action of the coalition of nations under the United Nations resolution. They recognise a bully in Saddam Hussein and they understand that a bully must be stopped now before he has to be stopped further down the track at even greater cost to all of those involved. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I support the Government's action to date, I would like to flag matters that I suggest need attention from the Government fairly urgently. Firstly, there is the option of reviewing the level of our involvement in the Gulf. The Government should not say to our troops at this stage that, even if there is a demonstrable need, we will under no circumstances commit additional resources. If the Prime Minister believes it is right to commit our forces in the first place, then he has a responsibility to provide whatever additional support is necessary to ensure the successful outcome of the conflict. He must be careful that his public statements that we will not contemplate further resources are not messages of abandonment to our men and women already operating in the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA> I also draw the attention of the House to the effect the Gulf situation will have on our economy. Whilst one might argue about the extent, the timing, the nature and the impact, impact there will be on an economy already in bad shape. Therefore, I urge the Government to change the direction of its economic policy. Government members really must face up to our changed circumstances. As my parliamentary leader has said so frequently and so comprehensively, we have to put new economic policies in place. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to looking at our economic future, those opposite must also now give realistic thought to our position and our actions later on. All wars end and this war will end. Let us not be in a position of having to say at that point, `What do we do now?'. The Leader of the Opposition enumerated key issues in this area of debate, as did the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair). </PARA>
<PARA> In turn, I should like to ask some questions of some of the anti-war lobby. I would especially like to make a comment to the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Powell, and her followers. I say to the honourable senator, in particular about her appearance on the streets of Melbourne on Friday night, `You should have been here in this Parliament making those comments, not rabble rousing the mob in the street'. The interjection we heard this afternoon from the public gallery by another honourable senator was a cowardly abuse of parliamentary privilege. Today the Democrats Leader suggested that conscription was to be reintroduced. By that, she stands revealed as a person of no principle because it is patently untrue. Such actions are stabbing our troops in the back. The broad mass of Australians, those who are sincerely concerned, will not forget. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the protesters in the streets and those outside this place to put themselves in the position of our troops. How would they feel after learning of such activity back home? The actions that have been taken could do damage to the morale of our men and women in the Gulf. Just ask the Vietnam veterans how they felt when it happened to them. I ask the protesters: where were their protests on behalf of the people of Kuwait when Saddam Hussein invaded? Where were their protests on behalf of the people against whom Saddam Hussein used chemical weapons? Where were their protests when Saddam Hussein waged war on Iran for eight years? I ask: how anti-war were they then? I did not see them at the front of Parliament House then protesting against war. I say to the protesters that they are guilty of the double standards that they so often accuse the United States of America and the United Nations of. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the protesters: what if Australia had been overrun as has Kuwait? What if rape, torture and murder went on here for five months? Would they say, `Give peace a chance, try one more effort at talks, war is evil under any circumstances'? Would they say, `Give sanctions time to work'? Of course they would not. They would be the ones who want help from others from outside. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me briefly comment on some of the myths of the anti-United Nations coalition argument. Myth one: No blood for oil. Do the protesters really want Saddam Hussein taking over Saudi Arabia as well as Kuwait and controlling a major percentage of the world's oil supplies? Do they really want the consequent world economic blackmail that Hussein undoubtedly would have waged? Do they really believe anybody, including the Arabs or the Third World nations, could have benefited from that action? Of course, oil is an issue in addition to the moral issue of the bully taking over a small neighbour. </PARA>
<PARA> Myth two: We are asked why we should endorse this UN resolution in particular. Why did we not take action over East Timor? Why not over the West Bank? Why not over Latvia or Lithuania or innumerable others? We have to start somewhere. We had a unique degree of support for this action on this occasion, including from many Arab nations. It is the right thing to have done. Perhaps on other occasions we should have behaved differently but this time we had the opportunity and we have taken it. It was the right thing to do. Perhaps it will send a message to other despots to desist in future. Perhaps it will commit the world community to act more firmly in other situations in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Myth three: The environmental impact. Of course there is a potential for significant environmental, as well as human and economic, damage. I remind all Australians that it is not the coalition of nations that, first, shelled an oil terminal and left it burning on the first day of the war; second, threatened to set light to all of Kuwait's oil fields; and, third, plans to release vast quantities of oil in the Gulf sea and set it alight with mines. Why are the protesters not raising their voices in objection to Iraq on this score? Why are they not protesting against Saddam Hussein's international blackmail?</PARA>
<PARA> I have a special word for migrants in this country. I speak as a migrant. I speak as one who has been married for over three decades to a non-caucasian wife and, therefore, who with my wife and my children have suffered our degree of persecution and bias. I say that I deplore without reservation any-yes, any-attacks, verbal or physical, on Arabs or any other community group in this country. However, I remind some of the more emotional people in the community that in a democracy we can disagree publicly with the government of the day. But there is a fine line between protest and disloyalty and all Australians, no matter what their origin, owe their first loyalty to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to devote some of my limited time to the conduct of the campaign in the Gulf. The first thing to be said is that the impact of technology is apparent in weapons and delivery systems, in intelligence and in command and control, in communications and the precision of the bombing. One has to note the precision of the coalition targeting and bombing which is in marked contrast to Saddam Hussein's attack on civilian targets. One has to wonder, as we sit before our television screens, at the instant switching between live reports from Australia, the United Kingdom, the USA, Israel, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and, above all, Baghdad. One must admire the bravery of the reporters involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The immediacy of this electronic reporting will generate its own impact on Australians at home and on our views. As an ex-serviceman-I served for more than two decades, including periods in more than one active service area-I support the use of this high-tech equipment to achieve the military objective whilst minimising civilian casualties. With no sense of happiness I must say that I breathed a sigh of relief at the decision to allow the military, within overall proper political constraints, to fight to win and not to have one hand tied behind its back. Anything less would have invalidated the original decision to go in. </PARA>
<PARA> The war on the ground will be much tougher in many ways than the war in the air has been. Saddam Hussein has a lot of potential guerilla troops in Iraq. We have a long way to go yet. We must recognise the pain of the long haul. Ultimately, war is cruel and we just cannot refine it. Saddam Hussein is determined to use any means to achieve his personal aims. He must be stopped, and he must be stopped now. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I turn to the subject of support of our armed forces. I have deliberately saved my most important comments until last. I make these comments as an old soldier, or more precisely, as an old airman, one who in his lifetime has had to face what those in the services now face. I know the terror of active service. I know the fear, how these servicemen and women want to be with their families and how they need the support of those back home. My message to service personnel is quite clear. The vast majority of Australians support them. Forget the professional protesters. They are noisy, but they are few and I believe that they are not representative of the broader community. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever happens in the future-I believe that the UN will be successful-service personnel will not be abandoned. I, and many others, will be mindful of the need to commit more resources to help if needed. All Australians compliment our service personnel and their colleagues in the Gulf campaign on their proficiency, their bravery and their professionalism. We wish them a speedy and a safe return. Whilst they are away we at home will do all in our power to support their families. To the Prime Minister I say that he can do no less than fully endorse these sentiments. I urge him to ensure that our armed forces in the Gulf are reinforced if necessary, are provided with every possible support, both operational and logistical, and that they have the comfort of knowing that their loved ones are also being properly looked after. This is expected of the Prime Minister by our men and women in the Gulf, by our service personnel at home, by their families and by the overwhelming majority of Australians. Mr Deputy Speaker, I wholeheartedly support the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;January 17, 1991, is a day of mixed emotions for me. Like most members of this House and most Australians, I suppose, I first learnt of the allied operations in Kuwait and over Iraq shortly after they commenced, about 11 a.m. Brisbane time. For the rest of the day my staff and I spent the time listening, on and off, to the ABC radio coverage of that fateful occasion. I listened to the announcement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) of Australia's involvement in this conflict, and I listened to the United States President's explanation of why the war was necessary and how the war was justified. In many ways, huddling around the radio listening to this brought back memories to me of old footage I had seen about the beginning of the Second World War of Australian families around old electric wirelesses listening to Prime Minister Menzies announcing that it was his melancholy duty to say that Australia was at war.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> `Melancholy' might be an old-fashioned word not often heard today, but I suppose it was a very accurate word for 17 January, when it was with great sadness and with trepidation that I heard the announcement of this conflict. Again, I imagine they were emotions shared by millions of people around the world. Later that evening my emotions changed somewhat when my wife gave birth to a baby daughter. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members-Congratulations. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LG4">Mr LAVARCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much. It was, of course, a time of great celebration for me and my family. But it was also a time of uncertainty as I wondered, as I wonder now, about the sort of world that my daughter has been born into. We still have a world where conflict, aggression and war are common. Yet if my daughter had been born one year ago, I would have seen a new age of hope to be dawning. A year ago we saw the breakdown of communism in Eastern Europe. We saw what appeared to be a legitimate reform throughout the Soviet Union and the march towards democracy. We saw the first concrete steps, rapid steps, towards the reunification of Germany, and we saw the Eastern European nations, which had lived for 40 years under the yoke of Soviet tyranny, begin a process of self-determination, that they were at last deciding their own destinies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Throughout 1990 much of the world, I think, looked towards hope. We hoped that we might finally receive the peace dividend as the superpowers could start dismantling their great mechanisms of war and that some of the resources of which the superpowers for so many generations had turned towards machines of war might actually be turned into saving lives and improving lives rather than ending lives. All that changed in recent times. It changed dramatically on 2 August with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. I suppose, more recently, some of the actions of the Soviet Union in the Baltic republics are also a matter of concern about whether the reforms in that nation are as permanent and as real as we have all come to believe and certainly hope they are. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight we are debating the merits of Australian involvement in an armed conflict. When I was elected to Parliament in 1987 the last thing I wanted to be doing was deciding whether Australians should be going off to war. I was not elected, I hope, to make those sorts of decisions; I was elected to make decisions about education, health, the future, our economic direction, industry policies and things which were constructive and which led to a better standard of life for our citizens, not to make decisions about whether Australians lived or died in some far off land. Yet as a nation, as a government and as a parliament, we have now made that decision and we debate tonight whether that decision was right and whether it was justified. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a natural predilection against war. Like Australians of my age, I was brought up in the Vietnam age, in the horror of that conflict and its ending, and the fruitless involvement of Australia is very deep in my mind. I also had it drummed into me from a pretty early age that Australia had been involved in a couple of conflicts that we well could have done without. Certainly my family taught me long and hard about the folly of Australia's involvement in World War I and the great cost of Australian lives under the command of foreign nationals. At the same time, my family and I have always been strong believers in the role of the United Nations. If there was going to be an institution and an organisation that had some hope for the world, that could bring together parties of different ideologies, of different races, of different religions, and provide a forum in which people could sit down, get to know each other, discuss their differences and overcome them, then surely it would have to be a forum such as the United Nations. But it was always envisaged with the United Nations and the concept of collective security that there would be times when every other avenue was exhausted, when there could be no further recourse to reason and when force had to be used. I fully accept that as part of the United Nations. Therefore, all honourable members, regardless of their party and their various shades of belief, individually have to decide whether this is an occasion when the United Nations correctly acted in deciding to authorise the use of force to dislodge Iraq's annexation of Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly I believe there were numerous factors that led up to the Iraqi invasion. Maybe in some ways the West contributed to this. Maybe a number of wrong signals were sent out to Iraq. Certainly some of the media programs I have seen indicated that some of the advice coming out of the United States was that a conflict between two Arab nations would be regarded as an Arab matter and it would not concern the West or the United Nations, that it would be seen as some sort of border dispute and again there would be no involvement. Certainly the supply of weapons to that country by the West-by the United States, by France and by other countries-and certainly by the Soviet Union, has now been shown to be a great folly. But despite that, despite maybe miscalculations on the part of the United States and other Western nations, it was not the United States that decided to invade its neighbour; it was not the West that decided it wanted control of a larger part of the world's oil supplies; it was not any other country but Iraq and its leadership that decided that naked aggression was the order of the day and could be the way to solve a problem. </PARA>
<PARA> That is what has brought on this conflict. Some people try to construe it as some sort of economic war on behalf of the United States. I do not know what their motives are. Are they blind or are they just simply misconstruing the thing for ulterior motives? It is clear that what we have here is simple naked aggression where one country has chosen to invade another and annex it. There have been examples of invasions and aggressions before and the United Nations has been impotent in acting towards them. That has been a consequence of the Cold War, in that one or other of the parties involved in these conflicts would have support from one of the blocs in the superpower conflict and that the power of veto within the Security Council would be used to stop any effective actions, and the United Nations did not act. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely past failure is no argument for a lack of action in this case. How ludicrous it is to say, `Well, nothing was done in the case of East Timor, therefore we should do nothing now'. That is forever condemning the United Nations in any sense of collective action; that is saying that just because something in the past was not rectified we can never rectify current or future problems. That is a ludicrous argument which does not stand up to any scrutiny whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a solemn and a very hard decision to make and one which I have agonised over. But it is clear to anyone who looks objectively at the question of sanctions and through the 12 separate resolutions from the United Nations, which I have read, that in two years maybe some sort of economic impact could have been forced upon that country. But every day that passed saw the Iraqis simply digging further into Kuwait and making sure that their hold on that country was more impossible to shift. Everyone knows that time itself brings a certain legitimacy and that people would say, `It is part of Iraq now and there is nothing you can do about it'. That is exactly the situation that exists now with East Timor. It is too late to do anything about that situation because of the failure to act at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot be so chauvinistic, almost racist, as to say, `They are only Arabs, therefore they don't matter'. What sort of argument is that? I suppose that if it were happening in Europe-of course, the people there are caucasians-it would matter? That is another nonsense argument. The fact that it is occurring in another part of the world and involves another race does not make it any less important. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, the concept of collective security is extremely important to this country. We are a very small country in terms of our population and we live in a very uncertain world. Our future depends very much on there being a sense of collective security and the knowledge that if there is aggression it will be responded to. The fact that it may not have been responded to in the past does not mean we can throw away the opportunity that is now afforded to us by the thawing of the Cold War, the fact that both superpower blocs are now apparently committed to the concept of the United Nations, are willing to make it work and are willing to work together to make it work. That is something that we have not seen for 40 years. We cannot throw it away now because we face a bit of a hurdle. It might be a high hurdle, but we have to run at it and get over it. If we do not, if we let this opportunity pass, if we squib on it, if we say that it is too hard and that people will be killed and that it is too high a price to pay, we will pay that price again and again. There will be no end to war by not fighting this one. Let us not delude ourselves. But maybe, just maybe, by fighting this war we will have some chance at collective security. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not so foolish as to believe in the pie-in-the-sky view that there will not be future wars, conflict, or aggression, or that on every occasion the United Nations will act as some sort of shining knight. It will not. There will still be problems and on occasions the permanent members of the United Nations Security Council will exercise vetoes and follow their own self-interests instead of working for the greater good. That will occur, but that does not invalidate the position in which we now find ourselves. Australia has responded to those United Nations resolutions. It is a proper response. Again, our commitment is one that is commensurate with our size and our ability. On the balance of probabilities, it is likely that no Australian will be injured or killed as a result of the conflict-that is the likelihood, given the actual military situation. But that is not really the point. We have made a proper commitment. It is one which is genuinely and, I think, widely supported by the bulk of the Australian population and I pray and I hope that we succeed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At 11.25 at night, being the twenty-seventh speaker in a debate, one wonders whether there is much value in getting up to speak. But I must say that on this particular occasion I believe there is a lot of value in giving to every honourable member who wants to speak in this debate the opportunity to do so because we are sending a signal, I would hope, to other nations around the world as to where we stand and that we stand united as a parliament. I think it is significant that today this debate in the Parliament has been measured, considered and thoughtful and has given a very comprehensive explanation of why Australia stands very firmly where it does.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In trying to encourage that form of logic which has been a part of the Parliament and which has continued from speaker to speaker, I pick up on what the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) spoke about. He talked about collective security and its importance. I would like to pick up on the point that we do have collective security at this time, largely due to the very strong and effective leadership that has been given by President Bush. Certain times call for people of stature in the world to stand up and provide leadership to other nations. </PARA>
<PARA> Fortunately, at this particular time there was a world atmosphere, brought about by the ending of the Cold War between the superpowers, which enabled Bush to take the action which he did. Nevertheless, he had to give that consideration. He had to decide whether this was the occasion when a line had to be drawn in the sand and whether he would commit his country to war and provide the political leadership for the world to make effective one of the United Nations resolutions for probably the first time in 40 years. He took that initiative. I think all of us recognise the strength needed to take such an initiative in the world today. I think we ought to be applauding President Bush for doing that and for the measured way in which, over the last five months since 2 August, he has gone about encouraging adherence to the resolution by peaceful means rather than shooting very quickly from the hip. </PARA>
<PARA> The overwhelming majority of nations in the world have encouraged the Iraqi people and Saddam Hussein, in particular, to withdraw from Kuwait in a peaceful manner. We have waited, we have argued, we have encouraged, and we have pleaded, but Saddam Hussein has chosen not to listen and it would appear that he wants a war. That is why, as the Australian Parliament, we are here tonight, debating the motion before us. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to add my comments to some of those of the protesters whom we have witnessed in this Parliament and who have taken part in marches around Australia. The comments which were shouted out within the Parliament today all seem to relate to one side of the issue-it was either the United States and President Bush, or blood and oil. What credibility does the peace movement have when it did not show the same sort of antagonism when Iraq went into Kuwait?</PARA>
<PARA> We can go on with lots of other illustrations; other people have mentioned them already. But I believe we have to severely question the real motives of members of the peace movement when their comments are consistently one-sided. I have watched them for a period of years and they are consistently anti-United States, anti-virtually anything in which Australia sides with the United States. I do not believe that they have a credible position on this particular issue. One of the speakers here in the Parliament said that the slogan that ought to have been used was `Saddam Out' and I would add to that `Free Kuwait'. They are some of the slogans that ought to be seen out on the streets. The world would be at peace if Saddam Hussein had not attacked and overrun Kuwait or if Saddam Hussein had, under world pressure, pulled out. We would be at peace in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the protesters that we saw in this Parliament today do not appreciate the institutions of freedom and open democracy which we are privileged to have in this country. Even though I recognise the right of people to protest, I believe that there is a way in which that can be done. Quite frankly, even though people may feel deeply moved about their position-and I agree with people having strong emotions on this issue and I do not doubt that that is the case on both sides-I think some of the language and the way in which the protest was conducted here today were of no benefit at all to the peace movement. If anything, this only weakened any respect many of us had for it to begin with. I say to those people that while they have a right in this great country of ours to protest, there is a way in which it ought to be done, and there is a place for it to be done properly, and it should be done within the rule of law. It is an irony that we can have peace rallies here when I am sure they are not going on in Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> Although we on this side of the House fully support the motion, I want to make some comments about two aspects of it. I agree with the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) that point one says that the Security Council is directed to end the aggression of Iraq against Kuwait. I think it should not just be an end to aggression, but that Iraq be directed to leave Kuwait. We want Iraq to withdraw unconditionally. And even though point five in this motion relates to considering the Palestinian issue, I do not believe it ought to be understood by anybody that we are linking that issue to the resolution of this Iraqi conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> Today I was speaking to a person who reminded me of some of the realities of what I will refer to as the Vietnamese disease here in Australia during the Vietnam war. That relates to an equivocation in this country about our troops being at war. It was brought home to me very poignantly by this person when he said that 506 Australian soldiers were killed during that war and 1,600 suicided in the year or so after the war ended. He said that the reason many of those people suicided was not just because of the shock of the war that they had gone through, but because of the lack of moral support which they found when they came home to Australia. They were so disillusioned about where they had been. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder whether just sending sailors to the war and not giving consideration to the possibility that the Australian Army or the Royal Australian Air Force might also be needed is really a half-hearted approach and may lead to the same sort of thinking occurring in Australia again. If we as a nation believe that this is a very important issue for the world, to the point where we are prepared to cross the line and say that we are at war with another nation, then we need to be very careful that we do not tie our hands behind our backs and ask our soldiers or our armed services to go and fight in that manner. If the issue is this important, we should give consideration to further support, if the circumstances arise, to ensure that a just settlement can occur. </PARA>
<PARA> I encourage the Government to maintain the strong position that it adopted in this area so that it can maintain the support of the Australian people. I think it is vital that when a nation is at war there is unanimity and strength and that the Government does not backtrack from its present resolve. The servicemen who are sent to fight on our behalf to achieve those goals with which we agree should know unequivocally that they have our moral support. I believe that will be very important in the coming days. </PARA>
<PARA> Like many other honourable members here in the Parliament, I certainly express my concern about the circumstances which our armed service people face in the Gulf. I trust that they will be able to return to their families very soon and that there will be no Australian lives lost. But in many respects, unlike the honourable member for Fisher, I think that may be a faint hope, but it is still the desire of everybody in this country that that be the case. I therefore end this speech by saying that I fully support this motion and commend it to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak in support of this motion. Throughout the Middle East crisis, the actions of the United States (US) have been presented to us as having the justification of inevitability-that is, that no other choice was available. Yet at every point, alternatives were not only possible, but were commonly preferable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before amplifying that point, it is important to note that before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait the US may not have stated unequivocally its total opposition to an Iraqi incursion into Kuwait to the Iraqis. There are reports that the US Ambassador to Iraq may have been ambiguous or passive in discussing Iraq's conflict with Kuwait in July. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unlikely that we will ever know the full truth of that diplomatic contact, but in any case the actions of the US do not provide an unequivocal basis for predicting the US response, for the US itself has recently invaded both Grenada and Panama without United Nations (UN) authorisation or other justification under international law. Such neo-colonial aggression in its own sphere of influence does not provide a sound moral basis for protest about similar action by another country against its own small neighbour. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also important to note that many of the countries now in alliance against Iraq have supplied arms to that country-and Australia is one of those countries. One of the lessons of this conflict is the damage to our own interests that arms exports can cause. </PARA>
<PARA> Regardless of the ambiguity of precedent there is no doubt whatsoever that Iraq had no justification for invading Kuwait. Kuwait was an independent country with internationally recognised and accepted borders and a member of the United Nations. Iraq had signalled a conflict about its border with Kuwait, but had not used the available international forums such as the UN or the International Court of Justice in an attempt to resolve that dispute. Saddam Hussein is a megalomaniac and a ruthless dictator. Nothing in his behaviour or policies has suggested that he has any willingness to act reasonably in accordance with international norms. </PARA>
<PARA> Within one day of the invasion, the United Nations Security Council had voted 14 to 0 to condemn the invasion and demand the immediate and unconditional withdrawal of Iraq's troops. Three days later the Security Council voted to order a trade and financial embargo of Iraq and occupied Kuwait and a few days later declared Iraq's annexation of Kuwait null and void in international law. Therefore, in the most authoritative international forum the Iraqi invasion was unanimously condemned. That condemnation was given force through authorisation to the US and other countries to enforce the international embargo against Iraq and occupied Kuwait by halting shipping to and from those countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The US quickly began a massive military build-up in Saudi Arabia and Gulf waters. That was described as being necessary to defend Saudi Arabia. The US joint chiefs acted with spectacular speed, placing as many military personnel and as much equipment in the area within three weeks as had been placed in South Korea in 1950 in three months. President Bush said that was necessary. That build-up certainly demonstrated logistical virtuosity but it also created the impression of an aggressive rather than a defensive stance. It deployed large numbers of personnel who would have become restive if kept passive for long. </PARA>
<PARA> As well, the deployment was under US rather than UN control. The US should have adopted the proper procedure under the UN charter and secured the resolution under article 43. That would have created a United Nations force under the United Nations Military Staff Committee, and provided a more effective command structure. This would not have prevented the US from providing the general in command of the overall operation, because the US has been by far the greatest contributor. </PARA>
<PARA> The current command structure in the Gulf is a regression even from that which applied in Korea in 1950. In Korea, the UN General Assembly authorised a unified command under the US and the use of the blue and white UN flag. As George Ball wrote in the New York Review of Books on 6 December:</PARA>
<PARA>In the current Gulf crisis the presence of the United Nations flag would probably have provided some credible insulation from critics of the US while also making possible an authorised central command. </PARA>
<PARA>So not only would a UN command structure have given greater political authority to the alliance forces in the Gulf, it would also have created the framework which would have improved the effectiveness of the command structure. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's involvement should certainly have been more carefully considered before the decision was made and our involvement should have been conditional on deployment under a UN Military Staff Committee. In that way procedures for dealing with reasonable conflict in a post-Cold War world could have been established, which would have enhanced the collective restraint on aggressive action and clarified procedures for effective international cooperation in opposing and penalising aggression. </PARA>
<PARA> It is essential for Australia, too, to review independently and rigorously our response to the policies of our allies. For much of the postwar period there has been a tendency for Australian governments to accept whatever policy any US Administration chooses to adopt. Such a stance denies Australians the opportunity to determine our own judgment about our own long term best interests. There has been more debate about US policy within the US than within its allies. One lesson of this crisis for Australia is that we must break finally and completely from the habit of consenting to whatever policies any US Administration chooses to adopt. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the fact that comprehensive UN sponsored economic and financial sanctions were imposed effectively against Iraq, a second wave of US military deployment in the Gulf occurred in November. This was clearly no longer the `wholly defensive' deployment promised Americans by President Bush in August. That accelerated deployment was not necessary. We are told that the Central Intelligence Agency estimated that sanctions have stopped 97 per cent of Iraq's exports. Paul Nitze, who was President Reagan's special adviser on arms control, wrote only two weeks ago:</PARA>
<PARA>Under the current international embargo, only a trickle of goods is getting in or out of Iraq; oil exports and earnings are nil and civilian production is estimated to be down by about 40 per cent. In time, lack of spare parts will erode Iraq's military capabilities and civilian and military production will fall further. </PARA>
<PARA>Sanctions should have been given another six or nine months to work. This would have avoided the loss of life amongst both the alliance countries and Iraq and the terrible physical and environmental destruction and the massive cost of the current campaign. US Gulf Commander, General Schwarzkopf, has said that it could take up to six months to win this conflict and if it gets bogged down it could take longer. Paul Nitze estimates that such a campaign will cost from $A62 billion to $A75 billion. That compares with the current US annual aid allocation of about $A13 billion. President Bush claimed to be concerned about the `fragile economies of the Third World' in launching his attack. Far more could have been achieved by relying on sanctions, avoiding the massive financial cost of the war and using a portion of the funds in direct assistance for the Third World. </PARA>
<PARA> President Bush said in his announcement of war against Iraq that there was no choice but to drive Saddam from Kuwait by force. That was simply not true. Sanctions were working. He was certainly concerned about the attempts by Iraq to develop and enhance the effectiveness of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. That possibility is rightly deeply disturbing. Yet sanctions have been denying the Iraqis much of the equipment and material they would have needed to make those weapons, or make them more effectively. There would have been a risk in delaying the alliance attack that Iraq could have armed itself with more awful weaponry. Yet it is the judgment of many experts and many political leaders, including 47 US senators, that reliance on tight, effective sanctions would have been preferable to the current war. </PARA>
<PARA> The central issue we are debating today is what should Australia do now. I think that despite the misjudgment at several crucial points in the evolution of the current crisis, it is our responsibility to complete the task in which we are involved. The UN has authorised military action. Our Government has committed us to this involvement. To withdraw unilaterally would be destructive of the alliance and would appear cowardly. It is essential that we act in concert with our United Nations allies. </PARA>
<PARA> We can urge on these allies that the war be limited to the eviction of Iraq from Kuwait and that this be done with the minimum of destruction. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was absolutely right to urge Israel not to retaliate for Iraqi missile attacks. The involvement of Israel would extend the war to the whole of the Middle East and would greatly increase its complexity and probably its length. The survival of Israel may well depend on its self-restraint. There is no need for Israel to retaliate because the alliance countries are already doing so on its behalf. </PARA>
<PARA> Another risk now is that once the first phase of the war is over, the air attack, the second phase, the ground war, which will be necessary to force Iraq out of Kuwait, will be long and extremely bloody. On Friday Professor Des Ball said:</PARA>
<PARA>Sooner or later someone has got to go in and dislodge the Iraqi ground forces from Kuwait and disarm the major elements of the Iraqi forces in Iraq itself. </PARA>
<PARA>That is going to be a very long and drawn out task. It is going to be a task which in the end will alter the whole political shape of the Middle East. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I believe the next phase is really going to have seeds of great disaster. </PARA>
<PARA>I question whether it will be necessary for the alliance forces to disarm Iraqi forces within Iraq. That is a question which no doubt the strategists are now addressing in detail. Those most concerned with peace must urge restraint at every point. Certainly, the opportunity for Hussein to end the war by announcing willingness to withdraw from Kuwait must be kept open and publicised. </PARA>
<PARA> One constructive task available to those with expertise and concern is to prepare for the post-war Middle East world. One goal must be to make the Middle East a nuclear, chemical and biological weapons-free zone. That means not only disarmament by Iraq of its chemical and biological weapons capacity and the requirement that it ceases its development of nuclear weapons, but also that Israel give up the nuclear weapons which evidence suggests it has. As long as those weapons remain in any country in the region final resolution of the conflicts will not be accomplished. That resolution also requires that eventually there be complete United States withdrawal. That will doubtless not occur until stable relationships have been negotiated between Middle Eastern countries. That, in turn, requires some agreement between Israel and the Palestinians. A step towards permanent peace in the Middle East will have to be a conference on the future of Israel and the Palestinians. </PARA>
<PARA> As a participant in this war Australia has not only the opportunity but also the responsibility to think constructively about the post-war Middle East and to play a small but potentially significant role as an even-handed mediator in contributing to the resolution of the conflicts. War of itself will not provide the solution to those conflicts. At best this war can only force the withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait and ensure that would-be aggressors do not profit from invasion, coercion and force. </PARA>
<PARA> The future security of the globe depends on enhancing the effectiveness of United Nations dispute resolution procedures and increasing the effectiveness of cooperative opposition to aggression from whatever source it originates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like other speakers, may I say at the outset that I rise to give total support to the motion moved in this House by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and very ably and capably supported by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). There has been quite a lot said by many people. The honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) said that he was the twenty-seventh speaker; I am now the twenty-ninth. The day has been well spent. Nevertheless, it is important for us to voice our views and opinions and, where possible, to raise points that may be new or a little different from those already mentioned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today, and in reading the newspapers over the past few days and weeks, particularly over the last four or five days, one has to have concern, as has been expressed by a number of speakers, with regard to the very disturbing behaviour that has been undertaken by many in the so-called peace movement. We have seen a very hardnosed attack on the decision that has been made today and has been made over the past few days with regard to the actions of the Government and of the Parliament. I mention the Parliament and its decisions because the vast majority of members and senators, as we have witnessed today in the Senate and in this House, have fully supported that decision that was made by the Prime Minister some time ago to involve our ships. Therefore, I find it very disturbing that we have this attack being made in this country in such a disorderly way. I have no objection at all to orderly protests. I think everyone here would fight to his last tooth to make sure that people were free to protest against things that concerned them. We can all be well assured that such opportunities would not be granted to them if they were in Iraq today. </PARA>
<PARA> The attack being made by the so-called peace movement is a clear example of what I consider gross hypocrisy, naivety and very foolish engagement in dangerous propaganda. I have very good reason for expressing my indignation in this regard. I have just been reading the report of the Independent Commission on Disarmament and Security Issues entitled Common Security, a Blueprint for Survival. The report is also referred to as the 1982 Palme report, named after its Chairman, Olof Palme. This report has been adapted as the bible of the peace movement. I will read the last sentence of the inside back flap. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>This report could be described as a blueprint for survival. It will be the essential tool of the movement for peace. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, since 1982 it has become thebible of the peace movement. I found it very interesting reading. In Chapter 6, recommendation No. 4 is headed `Strengthening the United Nations Security System'. The section opens with these words:</PARA>
<PARA>We are convinced of the need to strengthen the security role of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 4.1 is headed `More effective use of the Security Council and the Secretary-General'. In elaborating this recommendation the report reaffirms within the United Nations that the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace and security rests with the Security Council. Recommendation 4.2 is headed `Collective Security-a first step'. Part of the elaboration of this point reads:</PARA>
<PARA>As distinct from peacekeeping operations collective security procedures would have anticipatory, preventive and enforcement elements. </PARA>
<PARA>That is all in this book. Just to elaborate on that particular point, I refer to references from the book that I am speaking about. For example, it says:</PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of substantial UN forces before the outbreak of hostilities would, in most cases, prevent violations of territory from occurring at all. Nevertheless, there could be situations where a violation of territory might still take place with an attack so sudden as to preempt the possibility of effective preventative measures. In such circumstances limited enforcement measures would become necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>Further on in recommendation 4.2 it says:</PARA>
<PARA> Full-scale collective security enforcement action would, of course, imply restoration of the status quo . . . through military means. </PARA>
<PARA>I am quoting from the bible of the peace movement. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>This is the ultimate deterrent enshrined in Chapter VII of the Charter. </PARA>
<PARA>This report was written in 1982 when the Cold War was in full progress, and we certainly did not have the thawing of relationships that we now have between the major powers. Recommendation 4.2 further states:</PARA>
<PARA>Although not realizable in the immediate future, it must remain a goal towards which the international community works. </PARA>
<PARA>That is very interesting. It also states:</PARA>
<PARA>The introduction of a ceasefire should be accompanied by an appeal by the Security Council to the aggressor state to withdraw its troops to its original borders. </PARA>
<PARA>That was written in this report in 1982, and this is again, I say, the very book that the peace movement holds so dearly, and yet it is confirming and supporting through its recommendations the very actions and activities that have taken place through the United Nations Security Council and which have led us to the very position we are in at the moment. So it is all very interesting. Recommendation 4.2 concludes:</PARA>
<PARA>In the event of a refusal to comply, the Council would immediately consider ways of enforcing its will through the other provisions of Chapter VII . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That includes, of course, sanctions which have been tried and found to be wanting. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the very disappointing aspects of this whole crisis throughout the world has been the very violent antagonism towards the activities of the Security Council and its sanctioned coalition activities in the Gulf. But it was very pleasing to read today and to see on television yesterday and again tonight that the supporters of the activities of the Security Council, people in the various countries who are members of that coalition, are rallying together now-the silent majority. I read tonight that over 10,000 people assembled outside the United Nations in New York in support of the decisions taken and the activities engaged in by the United Nations through the Security Council and the resolutions it has passed and, of course, the activities that are now being engaged in by the members of that coalition. </PARA>
<PARA> So I say to honourable members tonight that we ought to be undertaking activities wherever we possibly can to rally the Australian community, the people within our electorates, to get behind the United Nations, the Prime Minister and the Parliament of this country and support them in this very vital decision that has been made in terms of the need to come to grips with this terrible aggressor, and to let our troops and our sailors and all those people who are representing this country know that we are supporting them. Do not let the so-called peace movement get the spotlight, as it is doing at the moment in our society, trying to drag this country apart and influence it in very negative ways. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to have put a few more points with regard to the implementation of what I consider to be a just war and a wise one, with all the circumstances considered, but I urge the Australian people, particularly honourable senators and honourable members in their electorates, to support actively all that is being done by the Government as a member of this coalition that is confronting the aggressor in the Gulf, to do whatever possibly can be done to show their support in our community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the peace motivation behind the subject matter of the motion before the House, Australia's involvement in the multinational forces in the Gulf, and I respect the rationale of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) for the achievement of that peace and his sincerity in promoting that rationale. Indeed, I do not believe there is one person in this Parliament or in the outside community who does not condemn the brutality of Saddam Hussein and who does not want peace. It is a matter of how it is achieved, whether the end justifies the means, and whether the chosen means will in fact achieve the desired end.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not believe that the use of force, even that which is authorised by the United Nations, is the way to achieve peace. In fact, I have a deep-seated conviction that if I support the United Nations action in this instance, I will contribute to the perpetuation of that fabric of moral justification for war which stops our world, despite progress on other social issues, from coming to grips with this overwhelming social cancer. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot do this, despite my long-standing support for the United Nations and my conviction that the Hawke Government has done and will continue to do more to meet social needs in Australia than has any other government in our history. I cannot do it because every vote that I have given in support of good social policy will be as nothing if I do not vote according to my convictions on the issue which I believe to be the most important to face any politician-that is, the authorisation of war, even in the pursuit of peace. However, I do support the major portion of the motion, and I would like to address its various parts. </PARA>
<PARA> I certainly welcome the House's reaffirmation of support for an ongoing role for the United Nations in promoting world peace and the self-determination of nations. I was in New York for the 1988 meeting of the United Nations General Assembly when I was proud to represent the Australian Parliament and the Australian Government. At that historic meeting, both President Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev addressed the Assembly for the first time, signalling a new era of East-West cooperation. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans, led the contribution of the Australian delegation with distinction. It was during the course of this meeting that the announcement was made that the United Nations peacekeeping forces had been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in just recognition of their successful peacekeeping activities through the use of non-combat strategies, both past and present-for example, the resolution of regional conflict in Namibia. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, 1988 was a high point in the fortunes of the United Nations, which experienced a rejuvenation during the 1980s, a rejuvenation in which Australia played a leading role. This heightened recognition of the value of the United Nations was particularly to be cherished, given the lean decades when that body was regarded by its detractors as a toothless tiger unable to deliver non-combat strategies which effectively led to resolutions to conflict. The 1980s and 1990s saw the end of this tarnished image, with the United Nations developing its role as a problem-solving body with its implementation of a range of strategic peace plans-for example, the peacekeeping forces in Namibia and the peace plan for Cambodia, in which Senator Evans played a significant role following the aborted Paris conference on Cambodia in August 1989. The stalled peace process was reinvigorated by Senator Evans in November 1989 by his negotiation for a UN administration to be installed in Cambodia, pending the holding of elections there. </PARA>
<PARA> Given these and other successes of the 1980s in the implementation of non-combat strategies to assist in the resolution of regional conflicts, I believe it is most important that the United Nations is retained as an independent referee, a body which does not actively enter the field of war--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UD4">Mrs DARLING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But is available to implement supportive action and non-combat strategies without the risk of triggering the escalation of regional conflict to global proportions. This is made all the more important by the vacuum left following the close of the Cold War era.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am aware of the potential within the United Nations Charter; I merely do not agree with this particular aspect of it. I am not convinced by the argument that use of the UN potential to authorise combat forces will enhance that potential, but I will not pursue that point at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather, I wish to express my full confidence in and support for Australian forces serving in the Gulf, and for their loved ones here in Australia. Although the 24-hour television coverage of activities in the Gulf was depressing to many people to whom I have spoken and offensive to others, who saw the coverage as verging on the presentation of a spectator sport, it served the purpose of bringing home to Australians the war environment in which our forces are serving, the environment of the people who are serving their countries and the environment of the local victims of the attacks and counter-attacks. A 24-hour coverage of war is the reality. Those people cannot switch it off and they deserve and, I am sure, are sent the gratitude of every representative in this Parliament and the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one part of the motion which I do not support-that is, the use of force authorised by resolution 678 of the United Nations Security Council-certainly not before a longer trial of non-combat options such as sanctions. While some people declare that five months is time enough to trial sanctions, I believe the more highly regarded prediction for sanctions is up to 12 months. In such a serious situation I believe that more time should have been given for the sanctions to work before the option of force was drawn on. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to repeat some of what I said to the House on 11 October 1990. Today's military situation, while it can certainly be said to be complex, should not be viewed as beyond the realms of human possibility to change, particularly given the human contrivance which results in perpetuation of a culture of war based on armed services, arms manufacture and aid funding to mop up its devastating effects, including agricultural projects which provide profits for the donors. </PARA>
<PARA> It is surely not pessimistic but an inescapable reality to observe that no sooner does one war exhausted region slump into uneasy truce than another conflict is being conceived to take its place in the fabric or culture of war. And we all contribute, if not to its inception then certainly to its growth. If this were not so, world governments would not be so selective in their responses to appeals to assist regions in conflict, with the potential by their very presence to change the status of that war from regional to global. </PARA>
<PARA> So, while wars in the 1990s may be termed `internal conflicts', the power play is certainly worldwide. While the Cold War may appear to have been diminished . . . there is still evidence that there will be, or there is always on the horizon, another regional conflict which is part of a global power play.</PARA>
<PARA> I said further at that time that the effects of this situation are devastating. The link between war and socio-economic security is well documented with 1989 military spending in the developing world approximately 30 per cent greater than spending on health and education combined. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1989 report of the United Nations Children's Fund points out that for almost 900 million people, approximately one-sixth of humankind, the march of human progress has now become a retreat. In many nations development has been thrown into reverse and after decades of steady economic advance large areas of the world are sliding backward into poverty. It is time for decisive action by all nations to break the self-perpetuating war syndrome into which we have locked ourselves.</PARA>
<PARA> I still believe this. This is the reality of war. However, I believe that the war syndrome will not be broken while people in positions of authority who deplore war and its perpetuation nevertheless continue to contribute to it by passively accepting the rationale which accompanies and is part of the ethos of war. </PARA>
<PARA> Media support of the war effort can also be part of the tactic of war, its main objective to provide a united front, to keep up the morale of front-line troops and armchair strategists, and to promote the alleged rightness of war as the fight for peace. This is part of the language of war. But when one argument is sustained by the diminution of the alternative, an unhealthy balance can result. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) for recalling Parliament to give us all the opportunity to place on record our personal viewpoints. In this context, the so-called peace coalition has been reported in some media as misinformed, emotive people. Yet their reality of war is authentic and logical: a producer of death, disease, refugees, hunger and massive foreign debt. This reality should be continually before our eyes, for the world is pulling two ways, with enormous mental resources going into global issues such as the foreign debt crisis and its devastating effect on the Third World, while power plays continue to generate the conflicts which feed the manufacturers of arms, who are the only winners in war. </PARA>
<PARA> A halt must be called in the name of sanity, and this will occur only when certain supportive myths are debunked. This includes the myth of short, sharp solutions. A war has never started with the prediction that it would last eight years. World War I started in August and was meant to be over by December. As Campbell Reid pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA>No war this century has followed the script that military experts wrote for it. All were longer than expected. All killed more people than expected, and all turned up new horrors no-one could have anticipated in their darkest nightmares. </PARA>
<PARA>Fighting for peace is a phrase built not only into our language but also into our way of thinking. War for peace is seen to be a righteous act and a necessary component of safeguarding our democratic principles. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been said that appeasement has not worked in eradicating war this century. But this is not a logical reason for turning to force, for has war succeeded in eradicating war? Obviously, it has not. History this century has recorded that there is no such thing as a war to end all wars, as promised by World War I. The litany of wars since is tragic evidence of that. Apart from World War II, the Korean War and the Vietnam War, the world has been and continues to be pockmarked by regional conflicts, battles and civil wars. So any peace won is a fragile peace, a peace that can be maintained only by nurturing it, negotiating for it, and stalking it with patience and time. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to finish with a recognition that we all want peace; we are only looking at different ways to get it. I can see the rationale behind the people who are supporting the majority position in this House; it is just that I have another position. Decisions regarding war hold a broader responsibility, a responsibility beyond any other issue likely to be raised in this House. I cannot vote for war to end war because to me it is a tragic nonsense, proven by history to be so. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand the rationale that Saddam Hussein should be stopped in his evil efforts and that if he is not stopped, that they will burgeon. But, while this may be so, if anyone can offer a foolproof way of stopping him without sacrificing millions of lives, I would say, `Go to it', but I have not seen such a way. It would be naive in the extreme to believe that conflict in this dangerous zone would not spread, that it would just wipe him out without spreading. Given the fragile state of peace which exists in our world, given the number of inflammatory regional conflicts which exist, I believe that such a step as was taken should have only been considered following a longer period of trying for other alternatives. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Martin Niemoller was a German Protestant who dared to oppose the Nazis in the 1930s and found himself locked away in a concentration camp for seven years for his trouble. He penned these powerful words:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In Germany they came first for the Communists, and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Communist. Then they came for the Jews, and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a Jew. Then they came for the trade unionists, and I didn't speak up because I wasn't a trade unionist. Then they came for the Catholics, and I didn't speak up because I was a Protestant. Then they came for me, and by that time no-one was left to speak up. </PARA>
<PARA>I am convinced that it would be irresponsible for us as a nation to refuse to take a stand, on both moral and practical grounds, in the face of Saddam Hussein's adventures in the Middle East. For those reasons, I strongly support the motion before the House. I say this despite my abhorrence of war. Like the honourable member for Dobell (Mr Lee), who I thought made a particularly useful contribution earlier this evening, I am one of the younger members of this House who have been privileged enough not to have had to fight in any sort of war-thanks, I might add, in no small part to those like my own father who did in order that I and my generation might enjoy the benefits of freedom and peace. </PARA>
<PARA> So it is not as if I can claim to know first-hand just how dreadful war must be, and in that sense it would be easy to dismiss my views as all too easily expressed from the relative comfort and security of this place tonight. I confess that it is necessary for me to plead guilty to that charge. Despite that, though, I believe absolutely that there are such things as a just war and a preventative war. Those are the two themes that I earlier introduced-themes of moral involvement in a war and practical reasons for involvement. </PARA>
<PARA> If we refuse to confront evil through a desire not to know, or a determination not to care or not to get involved, we are in fact being stupidly and wrongfully selfish. To allow others to suffer injustice and cruelty is never excusable; nor is it practical and sensible. We ourselves may need help one day; we do not want to find that, as Niemoller put it, there is no-one left to speak or act for us should we ourselves need help at some time in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> It can never be right to turn a blind eye to what is being done to innocent people, wherever they may be. As the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) said today, no civilised country can ignore the appalling facts before us. Kuwaiti citizens have lost their homeland and have been brutalised. We have heard quite a bit about that today. Amnesty International has been referred to for its documentation of the most horrific torture, rape and killings that have been the mark of Iraqi rule over its small and conquered neighbour. </PARA>
<PARA> Here is the first point at which I must take serious issue with our protesting visitors in the gallery this afternoon. I find it personally abhorrent in the extreme to note that at no time did those visitors express any outrage at the way in which the Iraqis have behaved. Indeed, they chose to heckle and condemn the very mention of the name of George Bush and the American people, who are not the aggressors in this conflict, and yet chose to remain totally mute in relation to Saddam Hussein and his evil regime. </PARA>

This is worse than the distortion of moral equivalence; it is to paint the allies as the warmongers and the perpetrators of evil and to ignore the reality of Iraq's cruelty and aggression as plainly the wrongdoers who deserve and have the condemnation of all decent people right across the globe.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So those people, I hope not all wittingly, give comfort and succour to a first-class monster. As the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio)-again from the other side of the House-in an excellent contribution this evening said, this is the man who tested chemical warfare on his own people. This is the man who casually initiated and perpetrated a war with his neighbour which cost over one million lives-a war which he did not win and yet over which he showed no remorse at all; a war over which he offered his people no apology. This is the man who talks gloatingly of a holy war in which any amount of blood will flow in the streets or the deserts. This is the man who refers to Bush as the great Satan-the President Bush who has won accolades in this place today for having pulled together the most remarkable coalition of peacemakers that perhaps the world has ever seen. </PARA>
<PARA> I would hope that the more thinking and responsible anti-war activists will move as quickly as possible to distance themselves from the attitudes expressed by some of the people who have behaved, in my view, so irresponsibly here in the gallery today. Another thing that I could not help but notice about many of those people who made so much noise in here today is that they themselves appear to be consumed by hatred. Coming in here preaching the virtues of peace, they fairly bristle with hostility in themselves. Their hostility is towards the Americans, towards us in this place and towards those we represent who happen, by and large, to concur with the stand that we are taking. Why were there no denunciations, no catcalling, or no juvenile hissing from these people directed towards the `butcher of Baghdad' and instead directed only to the United States and to us?</PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps some of those hysterical women who displayed such an incapacity to cope with the rigours of living in and respecting the institutions of a free and open democracy such as the one that we are lucky enough to live in might stop to think how they would cope with the repressive cancer of an Iraqi-style repression, if it is allowed to spread. They might like to consider how much freedom they would enjoy under the sort of regime they are apparently happy to give comfort to.</PARA>
<PARA> Some of the men in the gallery today might like to give some thought about their own willingness to fight for things that they believe in-whatever they might be-and their willingness to fight for their loved ones, should it ever be necessary. If they were prepared to be rational and listen to the debate in this place, they might have learnt something about the cost of doing nothing in the Europe of the 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA> Chamberlain, as the Prime Minister of Britain during the late 1930s, lived amongst people to whom the harshness of human evil had ceased to seem real. Hitler gave Chamberlain and the British people more than adequate evidence that he was evil, unreasonable and bent on war. Yet, both Chamberlain and most of the people that he led could not and would not see it. Well-meaning, honourable, quoting Shakespeare all the way, Chamberlain earned the dreadful epitaph of `He could have stopped Hitler'. He could have, perhaps, but he did not, and World War II eventually became a catastrophe that claimed around 75 million lives. This was the price of not being prepared to act when it was obvious that action was called for. There are obvious parallels. </PARA>
<PARA> We live in an age, too, when we have got out of the way of recognising and being willing to confront unsociable behaviour on the world stage. Yet all the evidence makes it plain that Saddam is not for negotiating, not for the striking of reasonable agreements and not for the avoidance of conflict. He started this war on 2 August. He can stop it now, as he should have stopped it immediately it became obvious that he was out of line. As Santamaria wrote in last weekend's Australian, Saddam Hussein's declaration of war against Iran in 1980 should have left little doubt as to his unshakeable resolve. It cost his own forces and those of his Iranian enemies over one million lives. A man like that can no more be appeased than could an Adolf Hitler. </PARA>
<PARA> At no stage did Saddam show any willingness to move out. Sanctions seem to have been unlikely to have had any real effect for a very long time indeed, particularly given this man's inability to show any real regard for the hardships that his people might be facing. So it is that the use of force must now be seen as the best protection against a later, more protracted battle with an Iraq more fully armed than ever-and probably nuclear armed at that. </PARA>
<PARA> Another line which we have heard is that war never solves anything. I find this a particularly obnoxious sort of line and one particularly insulting to those Australians who gave up so much in previous wars that we might be free. Are we really to believe that the Allied response in World War II did not solve anything-that it did not end the ugliness of Nazism in the end, with its final solution approach to the Jewish `problem' and its attempt to dominate the world for 1,000 years? Are we really to believe that the Pacific theatre, including Australia, should have been simply surrendered to the Japanese?</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there are also some practical reasons, which have been well covered in the debate in this place today, for Australia's involvement in the Gulf coalition. I do not believe that we should be ashamed to admit that oil is important. It is important not just for the economic health and well-being of the West, including ourselves; the havoc wreaked on Third World countries has seen great hardship for many people already. If too much damage is done, starvation will no doubt result for many in the Third World. Again some of our peace protesters, with their emotive language about blood being on our hands, might do well to think compassionately about the need to see justice done for the weak and oppressed who do not have our capacity to confront Saddam. </PARA>
<PARA> Another practical reason, as I indicated at the outset, is quite simply that if we do not stand up for the little Kuwaits of today, we may not enjoy the privilege of having others stand up for the little Australias of tomorrow. We must therefore resolve to support those Australians in the Gulf in this crisis. We have sent them to do a job on our behalf. We owe it to them now to give them our rock solid support in order that they can get on with the job with which we have entrusted them. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, on the question of the need to find a better way than war, it is vitally important to seek to ensure that nations respect the rule of law and that force be used only as a final resort. I am sure that we are all agreed on that. But I want to wind up with a quote taken from General Douglas MacArthur's words of peace which he delivered when the Japanese surrendered on the decks of the Missouri in Tokyo Bay in 1945. I believe that we would do well to consider our progress since 1945 against these remarks. MacArthur said in what was regarded by many as the greatest speech he ever gave:</PARA>
<PARA>We have had our last chance. If we do not now devise some greater and more equitable system, Armageddon will be at our door. The problem basically is theological and involves a spiritual recrudescence and improvement of human character that will synchronise with our almost matchless advances in science, art, literature and all material and cultural developments of the past 2,000 years. It must be of the spirit if we are to save the flesh. </PARA>
<PARA>I support absolutely the motion before the House but acknowledge the urgent need to continue to strive to find answers other than war in the future. The best way to help that process in the current dilemma is to confront Saddam fair and square. </PARA>

Even somebody like Saddam Hussein, whose exploits had been written up in newspapers, who had been covered in television documentaries in the weeks leading up to that time, will realise the massive forces that have been ranged against him and established in those countries nearby his own. He will realise that to continue with his particular hold on Kuwait is futile. He will see reason and leave that country and peace will be restored. It will be a peaceful solution'. How wrong I was in my assessment as to what would be a just outcome for that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> In the time since, I have had an opportunity, as has every member of this House and every thinking person in this country, to reflect upon the events that led up to that declaration of war on 17 January. It led us to reflect upon the fact that on 2 August 1990 there was an unprovoked and illegal act of aggression perpetrated against the sovereign state of Kuwait, a small nation in the Middle East, by Iraq, a country which had waged war on another Arab neighbour for the seven to eight years prior to that. Iraq is a country which, as many honourable members have said today, has not been afraid to use poisonous gases and other forms of destruction and death to test its weaponry against its own people. </PARA>
<PARA> What we saw following that illegal act of aggression in the following months were the implorings of people right around the world-of people from Arab nations, from the Western alliance and of people who had come from what had been traditionally regarded as Iron Curtain countries. This happened through the magic people came to see as being the United Nations calling for the unconditional withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait. What we saw was 12 United Nations resolutions passed on the issue. What we saw was the unending stream of world leaders traipsing, some might say cap in hand, to Baghdad to see Saddam Hussein and beg him to consider his actions and get out of Kuwait. What we saw in the final hours was the United Nations Secretary-General stood up for 24 hours before he was given an audience, and yet those implorings fell on deaf ears. What we saw were foreign nationals captured and held against their will by Iraq and used as human shields in that country. </PARA>
<PARA> What we saw through the media that came out of that country was this great leader patting children on the head as if to say, `Don't worry, it's all right.' Meanwhile, the psychological scars probably will be left with those people for a lifetime. What we saw was a United Nations deadline imposed which gave clear and unequivocal signals as to what the outcome would be if this regime in Iraq did not back down. Yet what we have heard since is the ramblings and utterings of people who have not thought through this issue, and we have heard people in this place even tonight, sadly, saying that economic sanctions should have been given greater time to work, such as in South Africa. We are talking about 20 years of economic sanctions in South Africa and we have seen absolutely nothing from them. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard people say that we do not need to worry about the solution to this problem because it is an Arab problem. Let the Arabs sort it out. It is on the other side of the world. It has nothing to do with Australia. Again, that is nonsense and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and others have addressed that tonight and during this debate. For those who still sat back and said that it is a problem for two Arab neighbours fighting over disputed territory, since that time and since the aggression was to be thwarted with the allied response on 17 January we have seen the Iraqis rain down missiles on yet another country, this time a country that was not even involved in the war in the first place. The Israelis, who had taken the decision to stay out of the conflict, were to be drawn in, as if by magic again, by Saddam, who said, `I will destroy the Israeli state and I will turn this into a holy war where the Arab partners in the coalition will walk away and join me and we will ride across the deserts to victory'. </PARA>
<PARA> Innocent people have been affected. Scud missiles have been fired not at military targets but at people, at old people, at the heart of Jerusalem, at Haifa and at Tel Aviv. People say, `But only 12 or so people have been injured. It is not really a worry'. What absolute nonsense. In the last day or so we have seen that reign of terror being extended to yet another Arab country-this time Saudi Arabia. </PARA>
<PARA> What has the 5 1/2 months of negotiated settlement, or attempts there at, achieved? Unfortunately, it has achieved zero. Anyone who tries to tell me that negotiations were not being undertaken at the highest level and by those of the highest motives simply does not understand or does not want to understand the facts. We have all seen and heard of the history of this dictator in Iraq. Yet again today we have seen reports coming out of Iraq as to what Saddam Hussein would do with the people he has captured-those United States pilots, Italian pilots, British pilots and so on. These people are being paraded. They are being subjected to duress and also, according to expert testimony, to torture of various forms. Now they are to be used as human shields at some of the defence installations in that country. </PARA>
<PARA> This is somebody who does not want to escalate the war effort, somebody who wants a just peace for his own people! What absolute nonsense. As each day goes by, we see more and more examples as to why this country and the other 28 countries under the United Nations banner and bound by resolutions-12, including resolution 678-have taken the steps they have. </PARA>
<PARA> Much has been said during this debate about peace activists and the role they have played. Mr Deputy Speaker, you and I know their real concerns. You and I last Friday in our electorates were visited by a collection of peace activists from our Illawarra region and we sat down to discuss the concerns they have. I said to them then, I say to them now, and I say to those people who have this fervent belief in Australia not being involved and action not being precipitated at all to rid Kuwait of the Iraqis: did they demonstrate outside the Iraqi Embassy when the invasion occurred in the first place? Where were they during the eight years of the Iraq-Iran war when one million Iraqi people were wiped out through the use of chemical weapons? When the hostages were being used as human shields, where were they demonstrating, showing their solidarity for Australians who were also being used there, and calling for their release?</PARA>
<PARA> Where were they when Amnesty International was documenting the horrors of torture and murder being perpetrated on the people in Kuwait after the invasion? Where were they when 300 premature babies were murdered when their humidicribs were turned off after the Iraqi armies marched into Kuwait? Where can they be seen to be demonstrating this concern for peace? Perhaps they say that as this occurred in a foreign country, a long way from Australia, it had no significance for us. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the same questions of our friends in the other place. I ask questions of the Australian Democrats and some other members of the Senate who have taken on this issue and tried to confound the whole thing and cloud the basic thrusts of the argument and debate in this Parliament by saying that the Government will escalate our involvement and bring in conscription. What absolute nonsense. I absolutely reject it for what it is. I make it clear that, on this side of the Parliament, I for one will not support an increase in Australia's involvement under any circumstances. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note what the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel says by way of interjection. Many of those who have raised with me the issue of Aust- ralia's involvement say that we are the lackeys of the United States. Again I point out to them that Australia's role is commensurate with our position in the world. Australia has a role because of our relationship with the United Nations. Australia is there because of the United Nations and because of our belief in the United Nations. This is not a United States-led push simply for some other reason. This is a United Nations action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let nobody be under the apprehension that the question of economics and oil is not part of this issue: it is. It has been touched on by many people in this debate tonight. It is important. But what people must remember is that if we stand back idly and see the continued domino effect that may well have come through Saddam moving firstly through Kuwait and then Saudi Arabia and the other countries in that region, we will see almost one half of the world's oil controlled by a government which is unstable and certainly which will hold the world to ransom in an economic sense. </PARA>
<PARA> For the world, for the world's security, and for the collective security of the people of the Middle East, this motion must be supported and carried overwhelmingly by the Parliament. I am pleased to see the final paragraph included in the motion moved by the Prime Minister today. There is a need to address the overall issues of a Middle East peace and a need for a conference at the end of the conflict to discuss those issues. When that time comes, Australia should and must play a just role in those discussions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in support of the motion before the House tonight and in so doing commend the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) on his address this afternoon. I also commend the action of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in placing, as he did, Australian forces at the disposal of the United Nations multinational force to achieve the objectives which have been clearly set out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is interesting and significant today is the recognition by this Parliament of the traditions of Australia and the recognition that the majority of Australians are also aware of the long tradition that this country has of becoming involved in international affairs and in defending the rights of man around the world in the various wars of this century. </PARA>
<PARA> This House too, along with the rest of Australia, is deeply aware of the cost of war and the dreadful burden that is borne by so many people-so many of them innocent-who are caught up in warfare as it passes through or directly affects their country and their lives. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing to understand, which should be stated about this particular action, is that of course it is not a war of retribution, it is not a war of punishment; it is an action taken to restore the integrity of Kuwait, to release its people from the bondage imposed upon it by the leadership of Iraq, and to prevent the further pillage of that region of the world. There is indeed a perhaps unspoken, at times, but deep awareness of the strategic necessity of preventing Saddam Hussein from further adventures, and of course his reaction now and his endurance under this enormous weight of attack illustrate the strength of the war machine he has built up in the last decade or so of his government. This is available to him despite the obvious attrition and the resources Iraq had to use in its war against Iran. Obviously without check he would have been able to move significantly against the whole region and selectively take the resources of that area, and as well subject its people to the whim and brutality of his type of government. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to pay tribute to the nation of the United States of America and President Bush for the leadership they have given. It is perhaps interesting to reflect now on the consequences that have occurred since the last war and the leadership that the United States has given to the free world. </PARA>
<PARA> It was of course after the last war that the United States distinguished itself with the Marshall Plan and took on the enormous task of applying its energy, its resources and its funds to build up the shattered nations of Europe. At the same time it protected those nations with the installation and maintenance of large modern forces on the European continent. The early optimism which followed the 1939-45 war was soon shattered in the aftermath of that conflict by the menace of the intention of the Russian Communist leadership at that time to obviously dominate and take as much of the world as it could. The maintenance of forces by the United States and the enormous success of the Marshall Plan have perhaps seen their culmination in the emergence of the European Community, and in the success of that community economically in the example that it has set for the rest of Europe which has been, until recently, subject to Russian dominance and involved with the Russian empire. So Europe has emerged-because of the successful, determined, long range leadership of the United States-to what it is today, a successful community giving a lead to the emerging nations of eastern Europe. Whatever the future of the Russian empire may be, it is no longer in a sense an empire, because that government can no longer use massacre to maintain the strength of its domination. </PARA>
<PARA> But some others in the world still use force-and hideous force-when they are not constrained by the sorts of comparisons with which eastern Europe has been constrained in the last year or so. The Government of Iraq, under Saddam Hussein, is one of those which is not constrained by comparisons; nothing will constrain or force him to lead a government which recognises decency and the rule of law. </PARA>
<PARA> So now we have a situation where we are at war because sanctions did not work. The irony of sanctions, of course, is that we endeavoured, through the United Nations, to put Iraq in a situation such that it could not proceed to the stage at which we have now arrived. How much better it would have been if the world had been able to arrange sanctions on arms supplies rather than waiting until the arms were already in place before trying to arrange sanctions to prevent their use. </PARA>
<PARA> If there is one thing that we should perhaps look forward to when this conflict is settled and, hopefully, there is a new order under the leadership that the United Nations has been able to give, it is a sanction on arms supplies so that situations will not arise whereby dictatorships can assemble such a mighty force of arms, as Iraq has now done. </PARA>
<PARA> We have committed a significant volunteer force from the Royal Australian Navy and we are proud of that force. This House today, through its members, has shown its strong support, both morally and practically, for what has been done in support of the United Nations resolution. However, the strains of war of course bring out, as we have seen today, those people who oppose action-no matter how much their opposition may amount to appeasement and no matter how much it may, at times, undermine the position of our volunteer force which is in the service of our nation. Some of that opposition is of a political nature; it is an anti-United States ideology. I think there is little that can be done for those people, except let them fester in their rather twisted political views. </PARA>
<PARA> Others, of course, believe that there ought to be a better way. Of those people I think one has to ask the question: why are we free now? The obvious answer is that we in Australia are free now because of certain actions that this country has taken in previous conflicts and because of the sacrifice of people who fought in those conflicts. So we would not be free if we had taken the road of appeasement then and we will not be free at some time in the future if we take the road of appeasement now. </PARA>
<PARA> But there is a particular question that one could put to those who believe that there should be a better way. If they do not believe in acting collectively, how would they defend Australia if we acted in our own defence in isolation? The obvious answer is that if we do not accept the collective road to security in the world we would have to face the burden of our own security ourselves sometime in the future. Have those people considered the nature of the Australian defence forces that would be required if we did not have collective support that would act in our interests in our time of trouble?</PARA>
<PARA> What those people are actually recommending by their vision that we should not take part in collective force is that we should have an enormously expanded Defence Force. I do not believe they would admit that, but that is the obvious result of their proposition in opposing our action and the United Nations' action in Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been said before here today, and it is obvious, that this war could end very soon-within hours-if one man and one government took the required action to comply with the United Nations direction; that is, Saddam Hussein could begin the withdrawal from Kuwait. Therefore, it is in the hands of Iraq as to whether this war will end immediately and if it does not respond to the force arrayed against it, quite obviously it will end with its defeat. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the House will give a resounding vote in favour of this motion. Most speakers here tonight and during the day have given their support to it for the various reasons that they have brought forward. I would say that this is perhaps one of the most united debates that I have heard in the Parliament, considering the seriousness of the subject which is under discussion. It is not with pleasure that any of us associate ourselves with this motion; it is for the utter necessity of the protection of our interests and the interests of people in the other important region of the world where the conflict is taking place that we support this motion in the House. </PARA>
