<TITLE>Government Funding of Abortions</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned Australian citizens shows that:</PARA>
<PARA>- Every abortion kills an unborn human baby. More unborn Australians are killed every year (80,000) than the Australian death toll for the whole of World War II (30,000).</PARA>
<PARA>- Australia's population is ageing. Our live birth rate is below replacement level.</PARA>
<PARA>- About 98 percent of abortions in Australia are performed for nonmedical reasons (see SA Health Commission statistics).</PARA>
<PARA>- Post abortion depression is a silent epidemic and is linked with the growing incidence of child abuse by mothers who have previously had abortions.</PARA>
<PARA>- The Australian Government should not fund the killing of future Australian citizens.</PARA>
<PARA>- Mothers with problem pregnancies need positive help to carry their babies to full term.</PARA>
<PARA>Your petitioners therefore pray that your Honourable House will:</PARA>
<PARA>- pass the Abortion Funding Abolition Bill 1990, and</PARA>
<PARA>- help pregnant women with problems to continue their pregnancies.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<TITLE>United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA>The Petition of the certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House their deep concern that the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child:</PARA>
<PARA>1. (a) makes inadequate provision for a subjective judgement by parents as to what is in the best interests of their children,</PARA>
<PARA>(b) makes inadequate provision for parents to use their discretionary powers to act on such judgements.</PARA>
<PARA>2. creates the potential for conflict between parent and child (rather than the atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding mentioned as valuable in the preamble).</PARA>
<PARA>3. will produce closer monitoring by Government agencies of relationships between parents and children.</PARA>
<PARA>Your Petitioners therefore pray that:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. By Act, Parliament ensure that all international treaties (excluding national security) are debated by the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The Parliament take action to have the Convention amended in order to pay the highest regard to the importance of the family unit, and to the rights and responsibilities of parents.</PARA>

<PARA> We believe that the government bears total responsibility for the funding of tertiary education and that it should be accessible to all sectors of the community, we are concerned about the continuing decline in both the quality and the accessibility of tertiary education due to inadequate funding, the introduction of H.E.C.S. fees and insufficient student income provisions (such as Austudy), therefore, we call upon the assembled members to ensure the Federal Government implements the following:</PARA>
<PARA>- abolition of the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (H.E.C.S.)</PARA>
<PARA>- issuance of an official statement opposing the introduction of upfront full fees</PARA>
<PARA>- elevation of student income provisions, such as Austudy, to at least the poverty line</PARA>

<PARA> The Australian Government proposes to remove the husky dogs that serve the Australian researchers in the Antarctic, possibly by destruction. Because the international community has demanded this in return for a ban on mining, according to Minister for The Environment Mrs Ros Kelly.</PARA>
<PARA> To the honourable members in Parliament assembled. We the undersigned wish to protest against the proposed removal of the Huskies from The Antarctic and their replacement with machines. We find the proposition:-that such action will be more environmentally acceptable, ludicrous in view of the dangers posed by machines, and their pollutants. We find it difficult to accept that an international community genuinely concerned for the preservation of Antarctica would force such unacceptable conditions on The Australian Government, before agreeing to desist from despoiling the continent any further. These animals have in the time honoured tradition of all working dogs served their purpose faithfully. The members of the research team who depend upon their service have not been consulted, nor has any expert evidence been quoted to support the contention that these animals are a more severe threat to the environment than machines. Quite contrary evidence does already exist to prove that vehicles and their fuels have been of great detriment to Antarctica in the past. We urge honourable members to resist with all possible urgency any legislation that attempts to coerce The Australian Government in this matter. And your petitioners as in duty bound shall ever pray.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Privatisation is an economic movement sweeping the world. It involves the transfer of the ownership of government enterprises from the public sector to their employees and private sector investors. It also involves the contracting out process, that is, functions performed for government by government are better performed for government by the private sector. These are mechanisms to enhance competition and, as a result, generate greater efficiency, higher productivity, lower prices and better services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Privatisation means that there will be no further call on the inevitable funding requirements for these enterprises from the taxpayers. It means that there will be leaner government; it means that there will be lower public sector debt; it means that there will be wider share ownership in the community; it means that the effectiveness of the capital markets will be increased; and it means that there will be involvement by enterprise employees through share ownership and enterprise bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA> The enterprise bargaining aspect of employees' involvement is particularly important for the coalition parties as it will form part of our new industrial relations framework, which will lead to our labour markets becoming more responsive to competitive pressures, thus enabling us to compete more effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> The current Labor Government is giving privatisation a bad name through its laborious and mishandled assets sales program. Labor is involved in a money-grubbing exercise rather than improving the nation's economic efficiency. There is no real commitment in the Australian Labor Party to the privatisation program, which it sees as leading to a breakdown in its much desired, but failed, centralised control model. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth-Owned Enterprises Bill will establish an appropriate privatisation framework. The principal objects of the Bill are to facilitate the transfer from the public to the private sector of certain government business enterprises and to set guidelines to enable the establishment of other government business enterprises. The Bill clearly demonstrates that the coalition parties are ready for government by having before the Parliament the enabling legislation in the privatisation area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill removes all legal impediments to the privatisation of the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation, formerly Telecom and OTC, AIDC Ltd, Commonwealth Bank of Australia and Commonwealth Funds Management Ltd. The Bill also allows the formation into public companies of other Commonwealth-owned enterprises targeted by us for privatisation, namely the Federal Airports Corporation, Medibank Private and the Pipeline Authority. It should be noted that there are no apparent legislative impediments to privatisation of some other enterprises already on our target list, namely Australian Airlines Ltd, Australian National Line Ltd, Qantas, the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation Ltd, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Ltd and Aussat. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill shows that we are poised to do those things in government that will assist in the recovery of the Australian economy that has been subjected to scorched-earth policies by the present Labor Government. This Bill sets the framework for our massive program of privatisation. Shortly after the next election we will be in a position to implement that program. I commend this Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are resuming debate this morning on a motion that the Australian Government should allow the restoration of normal sporting links with South Africa. Australians have always shown with considerable elan their love of sport and they share this with the South African people. In fact, the spirit of competition which sport has managed to engender internationally has no doubt helped to develop relationships between nations and peoples for many generations. If we were to ask an Australian rugby union or league crowd whether they would want to watch Australia versus the Springboks, I have not the slightest doubt that we would receive a resounding vote in favour of that proposition.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QF4">Mr CONNOLLY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In fact, my colleague at the table has made his feelings on this absolutely clear. The question of sporting contacts with South Africa is, therefore, something of considerable domestic interest. It also involves Australia's relationship with the Commonwealth and with the world at large on the whole issue of sanctions against South Africa over the question of apartheid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Sporting boycotts of South Africa go back to when the country was banned from the 1964 Tokyo Olympics. The world called for South Africa to eliminate apartheid from sport, for its teams to be selected on a non-racial basis and for black South African sports persons to be allowed to represent their country on the international stage. </PARA>
<PARA> Today there appears to have been significant progress made towards achieving a unified non-racial structure for South African sport. I was concerned to hear Danny Craven saying only last week that the progress, especially in the context of rugby, has apparently run into some snags for what can only be described as domestic political reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> It is well established that the effective sporting boycotts imposed on South Africa have been profound. The whites of South Africa and their Government have attached enormous significance to maintaining sporting contacts with the outside world. Racial discrimination in South African sport, regrettably, has been solidly entrenched for far too long. That this was acknowledged by the Director of the South African Sports Office, Mr Eddie Barlow, on behalf of 90 South African sports organisations, when he announced a declaration of intent to combat apartheid in sport. </PARA>
<PARA> The South African Government has strongly supported any moves made by South African sporting authorities and entrepreneurs to re-establish sporting links with the rest of the world in an effort to restore its reputation in world opinion. The black majority, some 77 per cent of the total population, is still denied the right to vote, as we were reminded by Mr Walter Sisulu, who was here only a few days ago, and by representatives of the ANC and the black African community. However, I question whether it is appropriate at this stage, in the context of the very real progress that has been made by the South African Government over recent months, to persist with a policy of absolute gradualism-if I may use that term-in the context of sporting relations with South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition parties were, in a sense, ahead of most of the world on this subject. In December last year we called for the removal of all sanctions against South Africa with the exception of those relating to the UN arms embargoes. We believe that those sanctions should be lifted for a number of reasons. Since late last year we have seen passing through the South African Parliament, albeit a racially dominated South African Parliament, a range of laws which have effectively removed from the statute book the very pillars of the apartheid system. For example, the Group Areas Act was one of the most interesting and significant pieces of legislation which the Parliament has abrogated. </PARA>
<PARA> Walter Sisulu and his wife were here two weeks ago. They tended to take the view that nothing had really changed. My response to them was, `Yes, perhaps in the immediate environment change is slow in South Africa'. Limited though it may be, this is a nation that is still governed by the rule of law. The law has now changed. What we want to see is that the South African people are prepared to back up those legal changes with an attitudinal change, which is obviously fundamental to any deep-seated removal of the scourge of apartheid from that country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition parties, along with most of the world's population, I have no doubt, believe it is fundamental that all the people of South Africa must be given equality of opportunity, equality of rights to citizenship and the opportunity as citizens of South Africa to play a full role in the political direction of the state. Obviously, that means there must be constitutional reform. Those reforms are now at least in the process of being negotiated. Again it will take time. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are facing is that fundamental question: are we going to make no progress-or slow progress-towards the removal of the apartheid structures, on the one hand, or are we at the international level going to encourage the South African Government, especially President de Klerk, to make that progress and to keep that momentum?</PARA>
<PARA> We have seen in the last two weeks the damaging impact of a right wing response to the reforms of de Klerk. As politicians ourselves, surely we are aware of the realities of public opinion. We know that a government can move only as far is its general political base will allow it to move. Therefore, we know that the international role of bringing and maintaining pressure on the South African Government is of fundamental importance to making those changes which we all regard as so important. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, as I said, changes at the legal level, at least, are being made. Certainly in the context of South African sport, most of those 90-odd sporting organisations have publicly abrogated any support for apartheid in South African sport. Saying that is one thing; being able to apply it is another. </PARA>
<PARA> There are fundamental difficulties in regard to sport in South Africa. For example, soccer is essentially a black sport. Cricket, on the other hand, for some time has been a multi-racial sport. Rugby creates problems as there are simply not enough facilities-training facilities, sports facilities-for the significant black populations, especially in the townships outside Johannesburg, Cape Town and so forth, to actively increase their capacity to play the game. When talking about multi-racial teams, if we assume a team is to be selected on the basis of ability as the prime consideration, there is still a problem in ensuring that the facilities and the opportunities are there for black sportsmen and sportswomen to be able to upgrade their qualifications and their standard so they can be part of a racially non-selective team representing all the people of South Africa. That is our goal; that is what we want to see. </PARA>
<PARA> The next Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, which will no doubt be attended by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) will no doubt decide what the Commonwealth's attitude should be to future relations with South Africa and the question of Commonwealth sanctions. The Opposition is firmly of the view that at that meeting the Prime Minister of Australia should express the view that the time has come to remove those remaining sports restrictions on South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason we say this is quite fundamental. When the Gleneagles Agreement came into place in 1977, the Commonwealth countries identified what they saw as the minimum conditions that would have to be met by the South African Government to achieve the removal of those sanctions. I suggest to the House that those minimum conditions are well on the way to being met. The question we have to ask is: are we prepared now to support the changes which are in motion? Are we prepared, as an Australian parliament, to support the efforts being made by President de Klerk against the extreme right wing elements within his own political environment? Are we prepared to support those changes that we know are in the interests of all South African people? To that I think there can be only one clear answer and it has to be a resounding one-yes. </PARA>
<PARA> The time for change has come; the time for fundamental change in our policy has arrived; South Africa is on the move. The changes which have taken place deserve our support. If we want to see that progress further to the position where all the people of South Africa have equality before the law, equality of opportunity and all basic human rights which we take for granted, then surely it is in our interests to support President de Klerk and those people in South Africa who are wedded to the need for change. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was very clear to me in early 1983-84 that those opposite were really delighted that Malcolm Fraser took the decision to resign because since that date there has been a constant attempt to reverse so much of what I believe were his major personal achievements in international relations. The fact is Australia has a role to play in the South African sanctions, both sporting and otherwise, which is almost unique in the world. It is shared perhaps by only three other countries-New Zealand, Canada and the United Kingdom-all of which are predominantly white countries in the Commonwealth of nations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst many aspects of the old British Empire and the Commonwealth may have had a lasting and not beneficial effect on world development, one particular aspect has contributed greatly to world affairs. I refer to the fact that Commonwealth countries have shared a sense of fairness and a sense of equity from a non-racial basis. It is a unique organisation; it is a unique relationship. Australia has long accepted its pivotal role in that process. Malcolm Fraser, to his lasting credit as a Prime Minister of this country, did Australia proud by recognising the significance of that role. He recognised that unless countries like Australia were prepared to share with their Commonwealth partners their concerns about equality, fairness and democracy, they would make a mockery of the whole concept of democratic freedom. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been made clear by previous speakers that in South Africa sport is a major issue. The South African Government has spent enormous amounts of energy and effort, and quite large amounts of money, on trying to maintain its major activities in international sport. That is why the sporting sanctions were so important; sport was an important part of South Africa's political process of trying to justify the apartheid regime. That is why Australia has had to play an important and pivotal role in what has taken place. </PARA>
<PARA> It is rather ironic that the refusal to admit Basil d'Olivera in the 1970s was the catalyst that generated the Gleneagles Agreement and subsequent sporting sanctions. I say it is ironic because subsequently, under the Thatcher Government, England shirked its responsibilities in terms of other sanctions. It is ironic also because one of the great multicultural nations in the world, America, has always been reluctant to play its full role in imposing sanctions. Just this week America was prepared to mobilise all its possible trade sanctions against the right wing regime that was emerging in Russia, yet there has always been a reluctance to play such a strong role in relation to South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear now-years down the track, years since Gleneagles-that the Ministers who met and formulated the Gleneagles Agreement were correct. The Agreement meant that they understood that sporting sanctions had a role to play in changing South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> This motion under debate was moved last year, when we were being asked to lift sporting sanctions on the grounds that things were okay. That makes it rather ludicrous for the previous speaker, the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), to say that things are now okay and we can now change. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 12 months or so since this motion was introduced-and not for the first time-there have been dramatic changes, which is why the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) announced in early August that the three stages of changes-first, the lifting of sanctions on people; second, the lifting of sanctions on trade; and, third, the lifting of sanctions on arms-were under way. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly the fact that the International Olympic Committee and the International Cricket Council have accepted South Africa back into their organisations indicates that changes are happening. But the example set in the 1970s by the Fraser Government, with the Gleneagles Agreement and by working through Commonwealth relationships and CHOGM, must be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> We must continue to work with Commonwealth countries in relation to the South African situation. Australia must not be the sole judge. The Commonwealth has a unique role to play, and that is why I support very strongly the maintenance of the Commonwealth; it is one of the forums in the world that bring together a variety of cultures, backgrounds and continents so diverse that, when the Commonwealth reaches agreement on issues, its decisions have much more meaning than those of either the United Nations or the European Community. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent times we have seen that the world can influence countries in the way they treat their people. The fact that in South Africa three-quarters of the population have no rights and no votes and do not participate in their governments has been of concern to most of us for a very long time. Obviously it is not such a strong source of concern for those opposite, who oppose sanctions and who, since we came to government, have been calling for reductions, removals, weakenings and softenings of sanctions on the grounds that sanctions will not help change the situation, that world opinion will not change South Africa and that, therefore, we are wasting our time. The argument that maintaining contact would influence the South Africans more has been proven to be false; it has been proven to be a wrong judgment. </PARA>
<PARA> In effect, we are seeing in this motion, and from those who have put it forward over the last eight years, basically a right wing move to support right wing regimes with right wing activities and values. That is what it has been about. The fact that the world, and particularly Australia and the Commonwealth, has persuaded South Africa that the future must be democratic, freer and non-racial has now proven correct. </PARA>
<PARA> In the same way, events of recent days in Russia have been largely influenced by the outside world and its reaction to what was happening in Russia. Events in South Africa have been significantly influenced by what other countries have done and how they have treated South Africa. Australia has a proud role to play, and it is one that we must always give credit to. It was initiated and sustained by Mr Fraser who understood the key role that Australia played in the Commonwealth. He understood that if we shirked that role the Commonwealth would disintegrate as a meaningful body. </PARA>
<PARA> The maintenance of sanctions on South Africa-sporting and otherwise-has maintained the Commonwealth of nations when all the forces were against its survival. The Commonwealth survived and has ensured that the future for South Africans, whatever their race or background, will be much more democratic and freer. I look forward to Australians and South Africans competing in sport-both here and in their country-but on a basis where we understand and share the same sense of freedom, the same sense of democracy and the same sense of participation in the events in our countries. Until that is the case, then clearly this Government has been right. </PARA>
<PARA> The call by the honourable member for Bradfield for some announcement for the lifting the sanctions was rather pathetic, given that this announcement has been made. Australia's view has been made clear-that is, Australia will and should act in concert with Commonwealth countries. I expect that the next CHOGM meetings will start to formalise the Commonwealth arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, it has been rather tragic that the United Kingdom, which was the initiator, the founder of the Empire and then the Commonwealth, has taken such a despicable role, not so much in the sporting sanctions area, but in the trade sanction area. It is unfortunate that Britain has never understood or accepted what the Commonwealth meant to other Commonwealth countries. Unfortunately, I think that Britain still sees the Commonwealth as a group of colonies, rather than as a group of sovereign countries with a great deal in common. The attitude towards South Africa is something that Australia shares with all of those Commonwealth countries. It has been a proud period in our national and international development.

In fact, that Government, under the leadership of President F.W. de Klerk, has made substantial progress in the process towards new constitutional dispensation for South Africa. All but a few of the conditions necessary for a fully representative and unfettered multi-party, round table constitutional conference have been met. A working group comprised of the South African Government and the African National Congress has been engaged in the process of resolving these difficulties since May 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> A speedy program of reform, beginning with the unbanning of the ANC, PAC and South African Communist Party in February 1990, and including the repeal of the Population Registration Act 1950, called the `last pillar of apartheid', in June 1991, attest to the Government's serious intent. Subsequently, the 10 July lifting of the United States sanctions legislation as announced by President Bush suggests that the US Government correctly believes that the time for punitive measures against South Africa is well and truly over. I believe that it would be in the interests of all South Africans, black and white, if Australia followed suit in all respects, including the removal of sporting bans. I am certain that this view is shared by many other people throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Garnaut, Professor of Economics at the Australian National University, was quoted in the Weekend Australian of 17 August as saying that sanctions against South Africa were no longer helpful in the cause of dismantling apartheid. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Sanctions have ceased to be productive agents for democratic change and it is appropriate for Australia to be part of an international process of early withdrawal from them. </PARA>
<PARA>It is to be hoped that the Deputy President of the ANC, Mr Walter Sisulu, who recently in Melbourne called on Australians to stop a South African team from playing in next year's cricket World Cup, will not be accommodated. Even though in the past it would appear that Senator Evans has taken a pro-ANC line on occasions, I was pleased that a spokesman for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade recently stated that there should be no impediment to South African cricketers playing internationally, because the International Cricket Council had recently readmitted South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> Already in South Africa many sports are unified; we should not lose sight of that fundamental fact. With regard to Olympic sports, statistics compiled recently by the Department of National Education in South Africa indicate that 97 of the 126 types of sport already have a single structure. Of the 29 types of sport which have opposing control bodies for blacks and whites, 27 are already engaged in discussions to bring about unity. Many of these discussions have reached a very advanced stage of deliberation. </PARA>
<PARA> On 16 June this year the International Olympic Committee agreed to invite South Africa to compete at the Barcelona Games if apartheid laws were scrapped and unification was effected in national sporting bodies. Subsequently, the IOC, at a meeting in Lausanne on 9 July 1991, announced the unconditional readmission of South Africa into the Olympic movement. </PARA>
<PARA> The English Rugby Football Union has scheduled a short tour of England-five matches with one test-by the Springboks in October 1992 and full tours in 1994 and 1997. Furthermore, the New Zealand Rugby Union Chairman, Mr Eddie Tonks, has stated that he was optimistic that the All Blacks could tour South Africa in 1992. </PARA>
<PARA> In July, Dr Danie Craven stated that a Romanian national rugby team will play four matches in South Africa in November, including a game against the junior Springboks. The joint steering committee of the new South African Rugby Football Union, however, still has to approve the tour. </PARA>
<PARA> In tennis, South Africans Gary Muller and Christo Van Rensburg have been admitted to the Suntory Japan Open for the first time in their eight-year careers. In May of this year the President of the International Tennis Federation, ITF, Mr Phillippe Chatrier, proposed that the ITF congress in Hamburg in July should admit the new single South African tennis body. </PARA>
<PARA> The International Boxing Federation, IBF, ended a five-year ban on title fights in South Africa on Saturday, 27 April 1991. In addition, on 10 July 1991 the International Cricket Committee announced that South Africa is to be readmitted immediately to international cricket. This was proposed by India and seconded by Australia. However, uncertainty remains as to South Africa's participation in the World Cup in February 1992. The Action Cricket Organisation announced in Johannesburg on 1 August 1991 that a South African indoor cricket side will tour England in October and November, playing three internationals. </PARA>
<PARA> My final example of a genuine relaxation of attitudes towards South African sporting ties is that of the International Ice Hockey Federation, which on 1 May this year lifted South Africa's suspension from international ice hockey-the first international body to take this very important step. </PARA>
<PARA> I now return to my original premise by emphasising to this House the unifying aspect of sport. Sportsmen and sportswomen are adored by young people the world over. Black children love white sports heroes as well as those of their own colour, and vice versa. South Africa needs unity now more than ever before to steer it through difficult economic, political and social circumstances. It is imperative that we here in Australia join the movement to normalise our sporting links with South Africa. I therefore urge the Australian Government to allow the restoration of sporting links with South Africa immediately. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, may I say that failure on our part to reciprocate the positive steps being taken in South Africa could well play into the hands of the hardliners there such as the neo-Nazi AWB, the Afrikaner resistance movement. Recent events in the Soviet Union illustrate to us very clearly the reality of that grim possibility. We do not want a repeat of that horrific occurrence in South Africa. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-This matter was first debated on 11 October 1990. Much has changed since then but much remains to be changed. Some weeks ago I attended the first African National Congress conference in 30 years held in Durban in South Africa, and while there I took the opportunity to investigate some of the matters about which I have spoken on many occasions in this House, including sporting links with South Africa.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Like a pack of cards, sanctions against South Africa are tumbling. Unfortunately, the United States' lifting of trade sanctions was a signal to other countries that it was now respectable to do so. Now there is a rush as countries want to secure a place in the perceived lucrative South African market. As sanctions go, in come the trade missions. While I was in South Africa there were trade missions from the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan and India visiting that country. </PARA>
<PARA> As with trade, so with sporting sanctions. Not only has South Africa been welcomed back into the Olympic fold, but already there is talk of Cape Town bidding for the Olympics in the year 2000. The bans against cricket links have fallen and they are about to fall against soccer. Can tennis and squash be far behind? From a personal viewpoint, I would have preferred soccer to be first to be welcomed back as there is much more multi-racial participation in soccer than there is in cricket. </PARA>
<PARA> Those who were among the last to impose sanctions have been among the first to lift them. This must raise the question of how genuine their commitment was to the process. One does not have to be unduly cynical to suspect that many governments have been more interested in dollars than in the well-being of the black South African population. But it would be churlish not to admit that there has been change, and significant change, in South Africa. It is unlikely that South Africa will return to the racially divided country that it was. No longer do black and white people live as total strangers in the same land, but they are still strangers. </PARA>
<PARA> Equally, it is misreading the situation to think that life for the vast majority of South Africans-black, Indian, coloured or white-has fundamentally changed. It has not. The degree to which the years of apartheid have divided and compartmentalised South African society is astonishing. The living standards in South Africa's white cities and towns must rank amongst the highest anywhere. Those of the black townships which surround them defy description in terms of living standards. The best that can be said of the black situation is that at some time in the future there is the prospect for genuine change. Nelson Mandela, feted around the globe as a world leader and an inspiration for millions, still does not have the vote in his own country. </PARA>
<PARA> The repeal of the hated pass laws means blacks can be seen in white areas, but they are usually there as gardeners or domestics. The removal of the Group Areas Act means in theory that blacks can buy houses in former white only areas, but economic constraints make theory and reality far apart. It will be many years, perhaps generations, before any but a tiny minority of blacks can afford to buy into the white areas. No-one should be deluded into believing that there has been a sudden change of heart by the Nationals in South Africa.</PARA>
<PARA> The one overriding reason why anything has changed in South Africa is that economic sanctions were hurting. The economy is in a mess. President de Klerk and his cabinet knew the country was facing economic ruin and that if this was to be avoided not only would the flight of foreign investment have to be halted but also foreign investment would have to be once more attracted to South Africa-an impossibility while the pillars of apartheid remained in place. President de Klerk and the Nationals have never admitted that apartheid was wrong, merely that in the end it did not work. There has never been any apology from the Nationals about apartheid. </PARA>
<PARA> Interestingly, when Vorster and Botha each suggested minor changes to the system, significant numbers of Nationals left the party. President de Klerk skilfully has carried his party with him without a defection-evidence, some suggest, that fundamentally nothing will happen. This has led to the suggestion that the whites have won the apartheid struggle. President de Klerk is ensuring that the whites will continue to enjoy their privileged lifestyle. That is why he enjoys the support of most of the white population and the total support of his party. </PARA>
<PARA> Sanctions have had an impact and those who for years opposed sanctions and were apologists for the apartheid regime in South Africa must ask themselves this question: without sanctions, would the majority of South Africans ever have had the opportunity, as now promised, if not yet delivered, of being fully participating members in the country of their birth? The same applies to sportsmen and sportswomen who competed in South Africa during the years of sporting isolation. They hindered, not helped, the full integration of sport now occurring in South Africa. This has been recognised by the cricket authorities, who have kept the five-year ban on those cricketers who toured South Africa for lucrative fees as the so-called rebels. Sporting sanctions have been very important, especially in Australia's situation. The trade with South Africa is not so important for us, but sporting sanctions, and Australia's role in supporting sanctions, have been very important. The scars of the apartheid system will remain for many years, many say for generations. </PARA>
<PARA> Nothing prepares one for the shock of the townships. Places like Alexandria, only a mile from, but carefully screened from, Johannesburg's better suburbs, are unbelievable. It is not hard to understand why many visitors to South Africa can leave the country enchanted by its natural beauty and impressed by its economic achievement, yet oblivious to the scale of human tragedy that is the result of apartheid. On any analysis it must mean that white South Africa cannot continue with its indulgent lifestyle. What happens, for example, when domestics are paid a living wage? Would the lawns be so manicured and the gardens so superb if the `boys' were paid a wage that permitted them to live in dignity? If realistic wages were paid, would the cars be so clean? One rarely sees a dirty car in South Africa-the `boys' see to that. </PARA>
<PARA> Our embassy in South Africa is well regarded and, I believe, respected. The current ambassador, Colin McDonald, has gained much admiration for his work, especially on the sports front. In fact, at the cricket unity dinner in Johannesburg, which I attended, just prior to the ANC conference, he was the only ambassador publicly praised for his efforts. His term of office expires at the end of this year. His replacement will be crucial to Australia's relationship with South Africa. Despite the unfavourable newspaper comments it would generate in Australia, I believe that the appointment of our next ambassador to South Africa should be a political one. I personally believe it should come from either the Prime Minister's office or from Senator Gareth Evans's office. It is essential that whoever is appointed to this post be someone who has ready access to both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Foreign Affairs on a personal basis. </PARA>
<PARA> I urge the Prime Minister not to visit South Africa later this year, as some reports suggest he might. This would give too much credibility to the de Klerk regime. We do not want the Australian Prime Minister doing a Margaret Thatcher in South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> The next few years will be a testing time for South Africa, but one suspects it will be many years before the black majority really enjoy the benefits of what could be one of the most prosperous nations on earth for all its inhabitants. On the other hand, South Africa has the opportunity to show the world that a truly multicultural, multi-racial democratic society can exist and prosper. </PARA>
<PARA> Provided the South Africans integrate sport at all levels, provided the blacks are agreeable, I can support the restoration of sporting links with South Africa. At this stage I do not believe that there should be a full lifting of economic sanctions. Too many people have struggled for too long to give in too easily. Like other speakers here, I look forward to multi-racial tours from South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> It is wrong in this debate, when we deal with sport as an overall entity, to say that we should lift sporting bans. I believe the correct policy is being followed. Sporting bans are being lifted one by one. When the criterion that has been set and universally agreed upon is met those sports will be welcomed back into the international community. That has occurred with cricket; it is occurring with other sports such as tennis, although I have my doubts about that; but I believe it will be many years before rugby is fully integrated. Much has changed since the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) introduced this motion but much remains to change. Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Nehl)-Order! The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting Thursday. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this House proposes that the Government extend the national system of nature conservation reserves so as to maintain viable populations of Australian animal and plant species. </PARA>
<PARA>Scientists describe Australia as a mega-diversity country. Our continent contains an extraordinary range of plant and animal life. The ancient age of the land, the isolation from other continents, the diversity of climate and the range of geology and soils have caused this extraordinary diversity of species. Many of these plant and animal species are highly vulnerable. Australia has the world's worst record for extinction of mammals, according to the CSIRO. About 20 species of mammals, seven birds and about 100 species of flowering plants have already been lost. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue addressed in this motion is: are we doing enough to slow the rate of habitat loss so that adequate natural habitat is maintained to ensure species survival? A national nature conservation reserve system has an essential role if biological diversity is to be sustained. At present, about 5 per cent of the land surface of Australia is preserved in nature conservation reserves. That nature conservation estate includes areas which are managed by the Commonwealth, the States and the Territories, Aborigines and various combinations of these. There are over 40 different types of nature conservation reserves, including not only national parks but also conservation areas, fauna refuges, forest reserves and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> The legal basis for each of these types of reserves is different under Commonwealth, Territory and State legislation. That variety in the statutory basis for nature conservation reserves causes some problems but the central issue is whether those reserves are sufficient to preserve and maintain comprehensive and sustainable populations of all or most plant and animal species, and of course they are not. </PARA>
<PARA> There are very wide differences in the extent to which various types of landscapes and vegetation have been included in those reserves. For example, in western New South Wales-that is, all the area inland of the Great Divide-there are very few reserves. Existing reserves contain samples of only 28 per cent of the major ecosystems of that area. Only 13 per cent of those ecosystems occur in national parks and nature reserves to the extent that is adequate to ensure their survival. A similar situation exists in south-west Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Those examples illustrate that a representative nature conservation reserve system still does not exist in Australia. Scientists who have studied aspects of Australia's ecology have been calling for a more comprehensive national system for many years. For example, a symposium organised by the Academy of Science in 1974 called for urgent action to protect threatened ecosystems and the establishment of ecological reserves which are large enough to remain viable and which are representative of several interrelated landscape types. Those recommendations have been reiterated many times since then.  This year Dr Peter Bridgewater, the Director of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service, and other senior officers have called for a management plan for biodiversity conservation. Such a plan must include establishing a representative nature conservation reserve system. They suggest that such a system would contain areas that are typical of the major landscapes and seascapes of Australia. This system would provide the best possible basis for national environmental monitoring for conservation, research and environmental education, as well as conserving biological diversity. </PARA>
<PARA> Already work is under way gathering the data needed to make decisions about such a system. The environmental resources information network-ERIN-of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service is preparing comprehensive data on distinctive landscapes based on climate, soil and topographical profile. This will provide an overview of Australian landscapes. The selection of reserves will require more detail. Decisions have to be made about just what should be represented and what comprises an adequate representation. </PARA>
<PARA> The professionals in the area emphasise that it is important to recognise that very few parts of Australia have not been changed in some way or another by the activities of humankind. The idea that only minimally disturbed or remote areas contain significant biological diversity is really mythology. The experts emphasise that landscape rehabilitation is a real part of conservation biology. If they are to survive, many native plants and animals must live in areas that have already been disturbed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has already demonstrated a strong commitment to the preservation of biological diversity through the endangered species program, the funding of which was doubled to $5m in the Budget. Also the formation of the National Biodiversity Committee provides a source of professional advice to the Government about requirements for species conservation. An essential component of that Committee's recommendations must be to determine the location and extent of additional reserves. Much research has already been done on this subject, both by scientists and by non-government conservation organisations such as the Australian Conservation Foundation, which has a list of areas that it considers to be of high priority for reservation. </PARA>
<PARA> The UNESCO concept of the biosphere reserve offers a framework for planning additional reserves. The ideal outcome of the work of the National Biodiversity Committee would be a continent-wide system of interconnected representative biospheres. Connections between them would be provided by green corridors through which wildlife could move relatively freely. </PARA>
<PARA> The acquisition of new nature conservation reserves may not be as impossibly difficult or as expensive a task as it first appears, for approximately 70 per cent of Australia belongs to either Commonwealth, State, Territory or local government. Each of those tiers of government should be involved in the final detailed selection of sites on the basis of the broad recommendations of the Committee. Of course, a considerable Commonwealth commitment would be required to fund those reserves, filling those gaps in an adequate national nature conservation system. The National Parks and Wildlife Service experts say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . no reliable estimate of land acquisition can be made until a variety of analyses are completed. The rough assumption can be made, however, that there will need to be at least thirty terrestrial biosphere reserves and ten coastal and marine biosphere reserves . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That would make a total of 40 in the national system. Designation of those reserves would be only the first step. Effective management is also an essential component of this proposal, including protection and appropriate access. Such a system would, of course, also generate some income from admission fees, concessions, publications and other similar sources. Indirect income would be generated from tourism. </PARA>
<PARA> Much scientific research has gone into the selection, siting and size of nature reserves in order to ensure species preservation. Sophisticated methodologies are available to help with the process. However, some tough issues of principle will be involved in the selection, most notably whether the proposed national reserve system should be sufficient to attempt to preserve all species or just most of them. </PARA>
<PARA> The absolute goal of retaining all species is probably not feasible, even though it is desirable. For example, Dr Chris Margules estimates that nearly 70 per cent of the remaining native vegetation in South Australia would have to be set aside for nature conservation if complete and adequate representation of all remaining species were to be achieved. Compromises will be required, but there is undoubtedly strong community support for establishing sufficient reserves to retain a very high proportion of the existing plant and animal species. </PARA>
<PARA> The diversity of life is an irreplaceable asset for the future of humanity and the biosphere. It provides both immediate and long term benefits. Its maintenance is essential to sustainable development. A national nature conservation system on the biosphere model connecting vegetation remnants and landscaped by corridors or greenways is essential to the maintenance and management of biodiversity, especially genetic biodiversity. A national conservation system is only one part of a comprehensive approach to ensuring conservation of biodiversity. However, it is an essential component. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion and applaud the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) for his well-known concern on issues of conservation and the preservation of flora and fauna in Australia. But in so doing and in listening to his remarks today, I am particularly concerned about the cost to the community of, as he himself described, what could be seen at first as a difficult and expensive program. However, it did please me to hear he was prepared to look at Federal, State and local government bodies and government owned land and properties where there could be already an existing connection on a national level. So I hope the thrust would be for the national control and the linking up-his proposal is that we link up-of the facilities we already have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am particularly concerned about using our current assets, including some government bodies which have taken up this matter of ecology in a most dramatic way, and today I want to refer to one specifically as an example of what can be done in Australia, in Victoria, at a local level and in our backyards. </PARA>
<PARA> On a recent tour of Murdoch University-I hope the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) is not going to use this example in his speech in a few moments-I asked about the development of the grounds. I said, `The grounds here are magnificent; you have indigenous species, I see, that are natural to this area; you have done a lot of work in preparing the gardens here, although they are very natural and easy to care for-an Australian native garden'. In reply I was told, `Yes. What is more, we have attracted species back to this area which we believed no longer existed'. I think that can be done at a local level. There is an educational institution, a major university, which has got into the program. </PARA>
<PARA> The Dandenong Valley Authority, and Dandenong Valley and Western Port Authority as it is now known, after consultation over a few weeks has taken up this program. Many of the local areas around the Dandenong Valley are directly represented by their commissioners on the Dandenong Valley and Western Port Authority which, as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, has now been taken over by the State Government. We do not know the future at this stage for all water boards and allied activities because there is a major problem with funding in Victoria, as each Australian Labor Party member here would know and each member of the Victorian community would know because of our increased charges.</PARA>
<PARA> Returning to the point before us today: they have begun a major community tree planting program. They have done it because of a concern by the commissioners and the officers of the organisation in response to community demands for public authorities to take action. It is not a result of exhaustive public meetings; it is just a group of people, a number of officers and commissioners, who got on with the job. They spoke to the people and they put articles in newspapers asking for expressions of interest. They had 117 phone calls in a very short time; they had responses from eight shire councils, 17 private people, five community groups, eight other groups with written replies, and five politicians, would you believe. That is amazing: five politicians are actually prepared to do some hands-on work to change the ecological nature of the whole of the Western Port area. So 43 replies were received, and 36 letters were sent to various groups saying that the Dandenong Valley and Western Port Authority would be prepared to support their program. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of groups will be given assistance through this tree planting program: private landowners, 13; schools, one; wetlands, three; service clubs, two; other clubs, hospitals, girl guides, government departments and corrective services. Twelve of the private properties have been inspected and plantings will take place in August and September. Many more groups and individuals have shown interest but have not yet made written replies for the services of the Dandenong Valley and Western Port Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Chief Executive Officer, Rob Skinner, and his staff for the work they have done to encourage hands-on work that may help to achieve the aims of the honourable member for Fraser, beginning immediately. We should work to establish these ecological enclaves to protect our fauna and flora, from backyards to streets and roads, to community areas such as those areas controlled by government authorities, sometimes called quango bodies. People working for the community, usually unpaid, are doing this hands-on work. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Fraser mentioned, by using the information that is already available, as well as ongoing inquiries, we will be able to plant in specific areas the indigenous species that are important to that area and recreate the ecological model that is best for the soil and for production in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot go into every individual project but I would like to mention a couple. Mr MacDonald has carried out tree planting on 600 metres of river frontage and he has fenced the land himself. Mr McKay at Poowong has carried out tree planting on 700 metres of Lang Lang River frontage on both sides of the river up to 40 metres wide, with assistance with fencing from the Dandenong Valley and Western Port Authority. The McKay farm is being used as a demonstration farm for other groups to show the community what can be done with tree planting on farms and the damage that has been done by the removal of trees from the riparian zone. Peter McKay has also successfully planted extensive plantations throughout his property for windbreaks and fauna reserves and refuges. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a magnificent group of land care people on Phillip Island who are addressing the salinity problem through their knowledge of the sorts of grasses that should be planted to overcome the problem. They are doing marvellous work and are extending their knowledge to other people so that it can be used further down the line. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very lucky in my seat of Corinella to have a number of groups who are hands-on operators. They are not talkers; they are doers. They stretch from Wonthaggi all the way down to Phillip Island. This new program gives everybody in the whole of my electorate, through the Dandenong Valley and Western Port Authority, an opportunity to change the environment in their locality. They may choose to do it as a school, they may choose to do it as a group of farmers, but they get the opportunity to do it through this organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> One might gather from the way I am speaking that I am rather excited that we are no longer talking about the environment but actually changing our environment. We are doing it with enthusiasm. People who are elected to local government are finding that the environment issue need not be one of confrontation. Rather, it can be a common cause that brings people together. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I resume my seat, I would like to bring to the attention of the honourable member for Fraser a sad matter which happens to be right off the subject that we are discussing today. Australia has a problem in terms of rubbish. Plastic rubbish which is put into the ocean is causing the death of penguins. Rubbish in our Australian communities is unsightly. Rubbish is thrown out by students. Rubbish is thrown out of cars by ordinary people who drive up and down our roads. I happen to live 1.8 kilometres up Jembrook Road. My front driveway seems to be the ideal place onto which people in cars can heave their rubbish. But this is a real problem. I do not know how the honourable member for Fraser can fit this into his program. But I think there might be an opportunity for this problem to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us face it: as Australians we have tried everything. We have tried to keep Australia beautiful; we have tried to keep our streets beautiful; we have tried community beautification. As a government, we have gone about as far as we can go beyond locking people up or fining them $500 a time. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, I would like to commend the Dandenong Valley and Western Port Authority for taking action at a local level. I have not mentioned the work that the Soroptimists and the Lions Club are doing on the Dandenong Creek. I have not mentioned the 200 people that the Department of Corrective Services has available to use on a tree planting program. This will be excellent community work. I would like to come back to this House and report that thousands and thousands of trees have been planted. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I apologise unreservedly to the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore). The notion of preserving biodiversity is central to the entire conservation movement. There are, of course, enormous differences of opinion as to how we might achieve that preservation of biodiversity. The honourable member for Fraser has, if you like, taken a particular means by which to achieve this preservation. I applaud his arguments, to the extent that they are particular means of achieving preservation of biodiversity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think we must remember that the Commonwealth's role in actually preserving areas of land is somewhat limited. We rely very much on State governments to declare national parks and nature reserves, which might themselves be part of the preservation of biodiversity if they are properly planned and if they cover a sufficient variety of species and types of animals in both the terrestrial and marine environments. I know that the honourable member for Fraser is absolutely aware of that. </PARA>
<PARA> I thought I might explain the degree to which the Commonwealth is presently seeking to achieve this notion of preserving the biodiversity of Australia's various environments. I want to mention the good work that is now being done in Queensland by the Minister for Environment and Heritage of Queensland, Pat Comben, in, first of all, simply mapping out the degree to which there are different biogeographic regions in Queensland and the degree to which each of those regions is represented in some sort of conservation reserve. Until we do some of that mapping, we do not really know whether certain regions, animals or particular sorts of environments are preserved in some sort of park system. I know we all agree that until we know some of that we will not have a sense of where we are going, how much it will take to achieve it and what the cost will be. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Fraser quite properly said that this is a massive task; that it is one that we may not be able to achieve absolutely. But if we know the important parts to preserve, at least we can work on those first and then proceed down the list. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) has appointed an advisory committee known as the Biodiversity Advisory Committee. This committee comprises scientific experts in the field, together with State, conservation and industry representatives, to advise on the development of a strategy to preserve biodiversity. I might tell the House that the draft strategy will be available for public comment by the end of this year. The strategy will examine all policy options for the conservation of the full range of our biological diversity. </PARA>
<PARA> The meetings of that committee to date have clearly indicated that in considering the issue of in situ conservation, the committee will address the question of the adequacy of Australia's nature conservation reserve systems for the maintenance of biological diversity at the ecosystem, species and genetic levels. Each of those has to be appreciated as a separate concept. </PARA>
<PARA> The strategy will consider not only the terrestrial but also the marine environment. This will be augmented by the Government's Budget commitment to a 10-year ocean rescue program. Through that program, the Federal Government, again working with the States and Territories, will establish a representative system of marine protected areas and will also establish a national marine conservation strategy. I can inform the House that the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority will be involved in that work. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole question of measuring what is in the marine and terrestrial environments is critical here. If we do not know what is out there, we cannot pretend to represent the various forms of biodiversity. What is most important here-and I think this was mentioned by the honourable member for Fraser-is the environmental resource information network (ERIN), whose work I have seen, within the ASETT portfolio. The network is developing not only the comprehensive data bases referred to by the honourable member for Fraser but also, through the National Parks and Wildlife Service a national index of ecosystems and, through the Australian Heritage Commission, a national wilderness inventory. They are most important Government initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, the Australian Heritage Commission, through the register of the National Estate, already provides an inventory of places of importance in maintaining existing processes or natural systems and those which exhibit unusual richness or diversity of flora, fauna or landscapes. </PARA>
<PARA> I might make the point that there is a huge difference between an individual preserving a certain number of trees on his or her property and the notion of the honourable member for Fraser's preservation of biodiversity. One needs to measure, for instance, the pattern of movement, breeding and feeding of a particular animal and study its environment in order to know how much of an area we need to preserve if we want to preserve that animal. </PARA>
<PARA> So we need to distinguish clearly from the nice warm feeling that we might have in planting a tree or preserving some trees in our backyard or along the roadside. This is really quite a different matter from preserving an environment where a particular animal or plant exists and can continue to exist. It is the maintenance of the biodiversity that we are striving for here. It is the ability to say how much of what naturally occurs can be saved where it now exists rather than re-creating environments to which, we hope, perhaps species of animals that already exist might flock. It is quite a different notion altogether. </PARA>
<PARA> I said that I would refer to some work being done in Queensland. Pat Comben, the Minister for Environment and Heritage, published a document entitled State of the Environment in Queensland 1990. He outlines-for the first time for Queensland-the system of nature reserves in Queensland and the extent to which nature reserves cover the various biogeographic regions of Queensland. We find now, for the first time, that we have been able to map out the degree-and the percentage-to which the current reserve system in Queensland already protects the various biogeographic regions in Queensland. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the table on page 22 of that document. It outlines the position. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

The percentage of the area of Queensland, and the size of the parks already, is listed in those 13 different areas. We are then able to draw up the percentage of those areas protected by parks. Pat Comben has now been able to achieve a basic measurement. From here on, that State Government knows how much it has to spend in order to preserve-at least, in that example-the plant community biodiversity in Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JT4">Mrs BAILEY</NAME><ELECTORATE>(McEwen)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.57 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I commend the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) for focussing this Parliament's attention on this issue and I support him in his desire to protect our native flora and fauna. As other honourable members have indicated here today, there is a superb amount of work being done at all levels of government. In my own electorate of McEwen, I have many active land care and conservation groups. I totally support and commend their work. However, I do not support the honourable member's call here today to extend our nature conservation reserves. Under present arrangements, there are already terrestrial, marine and estuarine areas which are managed primarily for these purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These combined areas create a total of 3,225 terrestrial reserves, comprising just over 400,000 square kilometres and 228 marine and estuarine protected areas-making up almost 400,000 square kilometres. In fact, more than 10 per cent of Australia's total land mass is a reserve where Australia's flora and fauna is managed and protected. The existence of these areas is proving successful to the continuation and protection of unique Australian species of animal and plant. I believe that we do not need to extend these areas. However, there is a need for further research into Australia's major environmental problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that it would be wiser to allocate more funds into researching the environmental problems of salinity, soil degradation and rabbit control. These are the areas which affect Australia's ability to have a successful and viable agricultural and primary producing sector-sectors which are essential elements of Australia's embattled economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost to Australia's standard of living, if we do not continue to address these problems, will be enormous. This is supported by a 1991 report by the National Farmers Federation entitled Agriculture, the Environment and Economics. According to it, ignoring the problem of land degradation will produce serious consequences for the farmer and the community. These problems include a weakening of Australia's regional economies, as well as national economic resilience; reduced production or greater costs, both resulting in lower national income; destruction of or damage to fences, roads and other community assets; the silting of streams, rivers and harbours; reduced storage capacity of water supply dams; damage to native flora and fauna habitats and atmospheric and water pollution. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1984 the Australian Society of Soil Science released a report entitled Future Research Needs in Soil Science in Australia. The report concluded that to maintain and improve Australia's soil resource as a productive base and to make the most effective use of Australia's limited water resources, a greater priority needs to be given to research into soil and landscape processes and the development of conservative soil management systems. There is a national responsibility to develop appropriate strategies to deal with these problems if our land resources are to continue to provide optimum productivity consistent with a stable soil base for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's biggest feral animal problem is the rabbit. Rabbits now populate over four million square kilometres of the southern half of the continent and are found throughout Australia. They have succeeded in helping to wipe out nearly two-thirds of mammals-excluding bats-from central Australia. Medium sized mammals, such as wallabies, have been almost decimated. Of these, 67 per cent are extinct, and another 26 per cent are rare or endangered. In western New South Wales, inland Queensland and north-western Victoria, 75 per cent of native rodents are extinct. Rabbits destroy their habitats and compete with them for food. </PARA>
<PARA> In some areas, countryside which was previously first class pastoral country carrying good edible shrubs is now almost barren-thanks to the rabbit. Rabbits eat seedlings and so stop plants from regenerating. Because of this, various plant species-particularly, the woodland trees and tall shrubs-are destined for extinction in certain parts of Australia. Rabbits also promote the growth of less desirable plants-species unpalatable to cattle-by selectively eating the desirable grasses and herbs. </PARA>
<PARA> Research is needed to find an effective way of eradicating these pests, as the introduced disease myxomatosis is no longer proving as effective. The rabbit has become immune to various strains of it. Until this is achieved, it is irresponsible to waste more government funds on extending more reserves. </PARA>
<PARA> It is evident that more research into the areas outlined is needed if we are to successfully overcome those problems. It is important that we do this because agricultural research plays a crucial role in maintaining the efficiency and competitiveness of agricultural production. It is also vitally important in developing systems of production which work towards achieving long term sustainability. However, in recent years, farmers have become concerned that there has been a persistent decline in fundamental agricultural research as government funds are channelled into politically sensitive industry sectors or away from research altogether to improve the Government's Budget outcome. </PARA>
<PARA> The CSIRO, which has been at the  forefront of rural research for many decades, has suffered government funding cuts of 31 per cent between 1982-83 and 1989. According to a 1991 report by the National Farmers Federation, generic research on the land resource has suffered because of this. Any reduction in research funding to agriculture would be a short term, false economy with long term implications for the quality of life for all Australians. It would have a direct impact on agriculture's ability to generate export earnings and develop more sustainable systems of production. </PARA>
<PARA> A 1990 report by the Australian Science and Technology Council lists 755 projects that were in operation last year by the Commonwealth Government, State government, industries and private and tertiary sectors and that were investigating flora and fauna-and that list is not comprehensive. There were more than 2,100 projects looking into other environmental areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government currently is involved in at least 12 major environmental inquiries, and the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) has announced more in the Budget. Of course, the preservation of our native flora and fauna is important, but we do not need to extend the reserves which, as I have already stated, currently constitute slightly more than 10 per cent of our land mass. I believe it would be a waste of money when that money could be more productively spent if it were directed to researchers to help find a solution to Australia's salinity, soil and rabbit problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 14 March, when I rose to address the motion moved by the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr), I had time only to indicate that, in my view, it was a put-up job, given that the Government had indicated its intention in regard to resource security for the timber industry. However, a few things need to be said as a result of listening to the honourable member for Lyons when he last spoke.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind the House that the honourable member for Lyons introduced a motion which called for urgent action. His motion, in part, reads `to introduce appropriate resource security legislation as a matter of urgency'. His speech to the House indicated his lack of intellectual grasp of what the resource debate is all about. If the resources of this nation were left in the hands of people with such a limited point of view, we would continue to plunder and rape this country, oblivious to the real needs of the country and our children. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the debate was interrupted there have been some important developments, which members would be aware of. Firstly, the decision not to allow the mining of Coronation Hill underscores that the great debate is also a debate about values and culture and not simply one about access to resources. Whatever view is held by honourable members on these big questions, it is clear that this House, as the place where many of these matters will be settled, has to make political decisions about matters in which the feeling and the emotion rise high on both sides. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently, while people were being arrested in Chaelundi forest in northern New South Wales for standing up for what they see as a rape of irreplaceable resources by the New South Wales Forestry Commission, the Forest Protection Society was holding a mass gathering on the New England tableland in the town of Glen Innes to strengthen support for the industry. There we have it-a debate where both sides are convinced that God is on their side. There needs to be a way of resolving such conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> It is pointless for the honourable member for Lyons to come into this House and fire grapeshot at the environmental movement by silly utterances such as, `What the environmental movement has concentrated on is a political campaign to try to stop development, to try to stop investment in this country, and to try to stop jobs from being created'. Just to say it is surely to realise the absurdity of the stereotype. </PARA>
<PARA> Another development since the debate was adjourned has been the publication of a number of important documents. The first, the draft report of the Resource Assessment Commission's forest and timber inquiry, needs to be looked at closely by anyone who holds himself out as someone with a contribution to the resource management debate. The second, the draft reports of the ecologically sustainable development working groups, is particularly important. For this debate, the draft recommendations of the various working parties are the place to start. I understand that shortly the National Plantation Advisory Committee is due to report on its considerations of plantation development. </PARA>
<PARA> Other documents, which are yet to be made available, dwell on the problems of important issues such as biodiversity, greenhouse gasses and climatic change issues. These reports are telling us that we cannot make decisions about how to use our resources or plan developments in a corner. We can no longer treat the resources which we have in this country as infinite. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths), in a recent speech-Australian forestry and forest industries; a vision for the 1990s and beyond-indicated some of the problems which surround decisions about resource security. He makes the valid point, which underlines what I have said about the clash of values surrounding timber resources, that we are at a crossroad in the forests debate. We are at a crossroad for many reasons which can be canvassed. </PARA>
<PARA> Past practices of using our timber resources without value adding has meant that we have had low return for what should have been a very valuable product. A good example of how that can be turned around comes from the town of Kyogle, outside Lismore on the New South Wales north coast. For years, potentially valuable veneer was peeled from logs and sent to Melbourne and Sydney, where it was sold at a pittance. Today that same mill, through the perseverance and foresight of people in the community-and helped by programs set up by this Government-uses the veneer in a process to produce valuable plywood. A bonus was the creation of some 80 jobs, which would have disappeared because the veneer mill on its own was unviable. That, although on a small scale, is a fine example of what this nation must do over and over again. Greater value adding is imperative to our longer term economic welfare. </PARA>
<PARA> There is probably nothing which is preventing investment in these industries as much as a lack of confidence. If the industry statement of 12 March does achieve anything, it is to provide the confidence for investment which will also assist in accelerating the transition from primarily old growth to primarily regrowth native forest resources and towards plantation development. If there is one glaring example of the misuse and the exploitation of forest industries in Australia, it has been the tortoise-like speed towards plantation development and exploitation of our native timbers by the timber industry. It has been at such a rush as to be non-existent. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Button has been quoted as saying, no amount of resource security, as proposed by the Government or the Opposition members from Tasmania, will see investment go ahead if the investors are too timid. A number of issues were raised by the honourable member for Lyons as to what was holding back resource development projects, but he seems to have overlooked the sociology of Australian industry-in particular, that of industry leaders. </PARA>
<PARA> I think Senator Button hit the nail on the head with his comments that were reported in the Sydney Morning Herald on Thursday, 14 March, that our investors are too timid. Senator Button pointed out that institutions had quite openly said to him, `If we are going to invest in a company which maybe has a good technology, we have to work so hard in terms of understanding its market potential, how the technology works-all those sorts of things-and that takes weeks'. The institutions also said to him, `Isn't it much easier to put the money into something else which we know about, which has been there solid as a rock for ages?'. The cringe that the industry leaders and the lending institutions have to overcome is that, if we are to become the clever country, we have to be prepared to invest cleverly in things that can go ahead, not only in those rock solid things such as real estate deals that we can flog to someone else when we get part of the way down the development track and put some profit in the bank to help please the shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Resources has indicated that this Government is committed to the development of a national forest policy by the end of 1992. The formulation of that policy will involve consultation with all the major players in the forest use debate, including the States, industry, unions and conservation groups. I agree with him that this is very desirable and I share his confidence that the establishment of such a policy framework will help to facilitate the resolution of forest use issues. It will do so in a transparent and predictable way and without the level of discord that has characterised past and present forest use debates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This motion was introduced by the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr) on 14 March this year. I would like to remind the House of its contents. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this House:</PARA>
<PARA>(1) impresses on the Government that the lack of appropriate resource security legislation is holding back urgently needed resource development projects;</PARA>
<PARA>(2) requests the Government to introduce appropriate resource security legislation as a matter of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA>All Australians today understand that something is seriously wrong with the economic performance of this country, whether it is measured by unemployment-we have over 800,000 people unemployed, and this week the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) has projected that it will go to well over 900,000-or whether it is in the record number of bankruptcies. I come from Victoria and, unfortunately, we have a record of which we are not proud, in that we have more bankruptcies than any other State. </PARA>
<PARA> One only has to go around my electorate in east Melbourne and notice the number of `For sale', `For lease' and `For rent' signs in businesses, houses and shops to see every day the evidence of the poor performance that Victoria has. In terms of debt, in the last seven years our debt has increased by 459 per cent. Unfortunately, we have seen in the Budget this week very little direction from the Government as to what we can do about that. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition does have a direction in a number of areas, one of which is through reforming the labour market to abolish some of the archaic work practices. We want to give more productivity and efficiency to a lot of our businesses and industries so that we can become competitive both in overseas markets and with imports. We want to introduce a number of pro-competitive policies in terms of incentives through taxation and privatisation. In particular, we want to restore the capacity to develop our great natural resources and to add value to those natural resources. To break that debt cycle this final point is absolutely critical. </PARA>
<PARA> A major factor of our problem in life and our lack of progress is that we suffer from paralysis by analysis. We find reasons why we cannot do things. They might be environmental reasons, they might be individually quite valid Aboriginal reasons, they might be work practice reasons, they might be some other reasons; but overall the result is that we tend not to go ahead with important projects. It is a formula for failure. The environment and the economy do not seem to go hand in hand with too many in our community. Yet we need a strong economy to be environmentally secure. We need a strong economy to have high living standards. We need a strong economy to play a significant role in our area of the world. To be economically strong, we need to be productive and enterprising and, therefore, we need development. Yet unfortunately, investment in the last year or two has gone through the floor. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 12 March statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) he promised resource security legislation. But where is it? Was it amongst those Bills guillotined through the House at the end of the last session? Certainly not. We have seen no urgency or priority at all coming from the Government. This generates a lack of confidence in business because the rules are constantly changing. The Government breaks its promises. If one has major projects, one needs long lead times to create some certainty about whether one can get a return on one's investment. Unfortunately, all too often, the truth is that, whilst frequently well intentioned, minority groups have made it a game of roulette. </PARA>
<PARA> The Resource Assessment Commission, I regret to say, is a failure. As the shadow Minister for environment, the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney), said publicly recently, we on this side of the House will abolish the Resource Assessment Commission when we come to government because, although it was established to provide a framework in which to make these decisions with some certainty, in actuality it has become case specific with different rules applying on different occasions. The Government should be making decisions based on the national interest and not on its own short term political interest by pandering to individual pressure groups. </PARA>
<PARA> Two recent examples underline the need for change if Australia is to prosper economically. The first one involves the intended investment of hundreds of millions of dollars in countries such as Zimbabwe, Mali, Brazil and Indonesia by BHP Minerals. The internationalisation of the operation of companies such as BHP is, of course, a great plus for Australia. But its choice of where to invest also sends some important messages to the Government. In the case of BHP Minerals, the company is operating in resource development, which is an area of Australian expertise and excellence. Clearly, investment outside our own mineral rich land is increasingly attractive. Construction costs in Australia are a part of the story, but the paralysis of decision making typified by the Coronation Hill decision is a sufficient example of the reasons why that company and other investors are shying away. </PARA>
<PARA> Even though reportedly a majority of Cabinet Ministers supported conditional approval, the decision to block mining was taken for one reason only, and that was to save Bob Hawke's leadership. There are no sufficiently strong environmental reasons to stop Coronation Hill, and the Resource Assessment Commission inquiry merely confirmed and strengthened the case put in the original environmental impact statement. That said that mining could proceed without significant risk to the immediate or the linked environment. The coalition has made it clear that all impediments to negotiations between the developers and the Jawoyn Aboriginal people should be removed. </PARA>
<PARA> Aboriginal concerns, of course, are an important part of the picture, but when it suits the non-development lobby to defend Aboriginal interests, they suddenly become paramount. Thus the Coronation Hill decision was taken primarily on the basis of protecting the interests of the Jawoyn people. That conveniently ignores the fact that the Jawoyn themselves are split on the issue and that some favour mining. In fact, the exploration and ore body testing has occurred with their agreement. All that was being sought by the agreement was the right to proceed subject to negotiating that satisfactory agreement with the Jawoyn people. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not go into all the detail of the Aboriginal Heritage Act, but I contrast the Aboriginal impact on Coronation Hill to their being bypassed totally at Jabiluka and Koongarra. For the Resource Assessment Commission it is already another layer on an already over-layered decision making process. </PARA>
<PARA> The second example is CRA, where we find a series of Australian based projects stalled while the company speedily develops coal and goldmines in Indonesia. One of the company's mines there produces coal with very low impurities and high calorific value. It is directly competitive with Australia's top export commodity. We simply cannot afford to lose investment in this area of Australia's comparative advantage. If we cannot succeed in mining and mineral processing, we cannot succeed anywhere. </PARA>
<PARA> The more extreme environmentalist might see this trend as a plus, the driving offshore from Australia of some of our more significant resource producers. That is short-sighted. Such a notional success does nothing to diminish resource exploitation on a global scale. Exploitation occurs elsewhere, but it is still on planet Earth. It just ensures that our country does not share in the economic advantages of that exploitation. Thus Labor's absurd three-mine policy effectively transferred uranium production from Australia to Canada-a splendid example of acting locally without a thought for the global implications. </PARA>
<PARA> To all those groups who talk about development and view it as anathema, I say: let us look at the facts. Population projections over the next couple of generations show that we will have a doubling of population to something like 10 billion people. We have an opportunity and an obligation to help service the lifestyle and living standards not only of our own people but of the population worldwide. Compared with 1990, we will have to increase oil production 1.6 times, natural gas 3.4 times, coal five times and probably nuclear energy more than 30 times. These figures drive home the need for greater efficiency in energy use, and they also drive home the fact that worldwide demand for energy will continue to grow. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia should be aiming at being the most reliable, cost efficient and technologically superior provider of these resources. We must really get into this market in a hurry because we recognise that, whilst we have to preserve our flora and fauna, we also must have the economic strength to provide that protection. Therefore, we in the Opposition plan to set targets for reduction in greenhouse gas ahead of the Government. We will set targets ahead of the Government in all sorts of other areas too. We do need to place fast-track procedures in position for establishing Commonwealth requirements in respect of major development proposals, requirements which, once met, preclude subsequent Commonwealth intervention. We need to reduce the layers of intervention generally, and we need to review the procedures to ensure proper protection is there for the environment and other things. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Until recent times it was very rare indeed for governments in Australia to lead in regard to policy formulation and our resources. Indeed, it has been this Government that has taken the lead in this regard. It can be understood that uncertainty has existed on both sides of the spectrum. By that I mean that the forestry industry itself wonders what sort of planning and stability exists in its industry, as do the conservationists on the other hand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no doubt that some of the practices that have existed in the past have no place in the modern day. We should not take the attitude: if it moves, shoot it, if it grows, cut it down. We need to have a process that is fair and equitable and is worked through so that both the conservation movement and industry come to understand the way in which that process works and everyone has an input. The reality is that in 1990 Australia had an annual trade deficit in forest products of something like $1.7 billion, representing almost 10 per cent of our current account deficit. We export largely low value woodchips and import high value timber and paper products. We have to change that; it is not good enough. That is what resource security and the Government have been about. </PARA>
<PARA> From an employment perspective, forestry and forest products provide jobs for something like 250,000 Australians. It is a massive industry of extreme importance. We need to understand that to forgo an industry in Australia means only that that industry will grow in another country. It means the transportation of jobs to another country. It also means that the global environment is necessarily affected because we now have the best safeguards in the world with regard to forest industries. If we transport those jobs offshore Australia misses out and the global environment misses out as well. The environmental problems we face today affect us all-whether we live in Latvia, in East Germany or in Australia. We need to be involved in a global sense. That is why the rhetoric that comes across sometimes does not add up. We need to have a strong, viable forest industry and we need to look at the global scene. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some genuine concerns that are now recognised. There is concern about regrowth, wildlife and flora. A component of our natural old growth forests needs to be preserved. I think the industry now actively engages in replanting and restoration in a proper manner. Most importantly, at the end of the day we have to recognise that the forest industry is indispensable and must survive. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is committed to several points: maximising the long term community benefits from all forest values; protecting the forests' ecological and cultural values; providing stability in resource access; facilitating the highest value adding process of forest products; and removing impediments to plantation development as a basis for long term industry development and expansion. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a few points on the resource security process I would like to mention in the brief time allocated. They include ensuring that the forest environment is adequately protected; facilitating world scale value adding investments; and creating more and better jobs for Australians who earn an honest living from this industry. I believe it is important to recognise that, rather than weakening the Government's environmental and heritage legislation, the elements of resource security leading to legislatively backed access to forest resources will actually strengthen the integration of environmental considerations. It will do so by ensuring that all relevant issues are addressed in advance of government decisions on forest use. </PARA>
<PARA> To be eligible, a project must involve a capital investment of at least $100m. This could include projects comprising integrated activities utilising wood harvested from the same resource area where a predominant proportion of the value of output is derived from activities other than logging or woodchipping for export. For example, a project proposal which included a veneer plant, world scale hardwood sawmills, a flitch mill, a woodchip plant, collectively involving a total investment of $100m and directed at import replacement or export, would be considered an eligible project under the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth envisages that umbrella legislation will be enacted and that conditions approved for individual projects will be set out in regulations. I think we can confidently look to that legislation being introduced in the near future to ensure that the industry is safeguarded. It is my firm view that the resource security policy will provide the industry with the certainty and stability that have been missing in the past. An additional $4 billion of investment in the hardwood pulp and paper sector would result in an increase in GDP of about $1.5 billion per annum; an increase in real wages of about 0.6 per cent; and an improvement in our current account. I think most rational people, when they go through the whole process and look at the way resource security is being set out, will say that it is fair and just. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a few points I would like to pick up from the remarks of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent). I concede that he has a genuine concern, as I do, to ensure that our resource sector expands. He seemed to be concerned that companies such as BHP were investing overseas. I do not believe that is our loss because Australian companies need to take commercial decisions and broaden their base. It is not necessarily the case that they are investing overseas because they do not have faith or confidence in Australia; it is that opportunities exist in those countries for them to expand. It is much better to see BHP investing in other countries rather than a competitor from Europe. The profits ultimately come back to Australia. Companies are able to hedge themselves better against commodity prices, and that is a long term benefit to Australia in many ways. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be more confidence in resource industries as a consequence of the resource security legislation, and I believe most honourable members on both sides of the House want to see that. At the same time we need to ensure that we have the highest safeguards for conservation of flora and fauna, and we have done that. We have played a leading role worldwide in preserving that environment, not only here but globally. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to have resource security, and I believe that more people are coming to understand that. Because of the short time left for debate, I will close so that the following speaker can put his views. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have much pleasure in supporting the motion of my colleague the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr). The motion before the House is an important issue for consideration by honourable members. At the outset, I recognise that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) offered an assurance in his industry statement to this House on 12 March 1991 that the Government proposed to introduce so-called resource security legislation for major new wood processing projects. In particular, the Government proposed legislation where, firstly, the project involves a capital intensive, value adding investment of $100m or more and is directed to export and/or import replacement; secondly, where the proponent of the project makes a commitment to adhere to environment, heritage, and Aboriginal policy requirements; and, thirdly, where State government agreements to enact parallel resource legislation are put in place. I quote from the Prime Minister's 12 March industry statement:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In this case, my Government has struck the correct balance between environmental concerns, to which our commitment remains vital and unambiguous, and the interests of one of Australia's largest industries. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable members will see this rhetoric as simply that-more hot air from the Prime Minister. It bears no resemblance to reality and will do nothing to prevent another Wesley Vale situation from occurring. Certainly it will do nothing to prevent another Coronation Hill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's proposals are totally inappropriate. The proposed legislation will complicate resource security development even more. It will probably make the whole process even more tortuous than we have witnessed in the past. Combined with the fact that the Government's proposed legislation will not extend to other industries-and specifically I am referring to the mining industry-this motion before the House is both timely and of major significance. </PARA>
<PARA> There is little doubt that the Wesley Vale project is the perfect example of why this country needs adequate resource security legislation. This project became a political farce. The completed project should have set new standards for pulp mill development around the world. It should have been a thriving expanding industry with the toughest environmental standards in the world, creating wealth and jobs for Tasmanians, and Australians in general. Instead it became a political football. The economic rationalists in the Labor Party wanted to see it go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us not forget the words of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) in October 1988:</PARA>
<PARA>We welcome the decision by North Broken Hill Holdings and Noranda Forest Inc of Canada, to proceed with the building of a world scale pulp mill in northern Tasmania. In many ways the investment decision is a watershed. </PARA>
<PARA>It was a short-lived watershed, because by March 1989 the political opportunists in the Labor Party were willing to sacrifice a magnificent wealth creating project for cheap green votes in the forthcoming 1990 Federal election. It is yet another example of this Government's trading its credibility and dignity for the price of a few cheap votes from the environmental lobby-cheap for the Labor Party, but at an incredible price for Tasmania and Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The greenies destroyed yet another wealth creating, job creating and environmentally sound project. The Hawke Government buckled under pressure from the greenies yet again. The Labor machine was more concerned with green preferences at the 1990 election than with issues pertaining to good government. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1989 the Hawke Government was willing to reverse its decision on the Wesley Vale project for the sake of green preferences. Only two years later the Prime Minister has the temerity to stand before this House and state:</PARA>
<PARA>Concern about future access to the resource has made new investment uncertain. Accordingly, the Government has decided to provide resource security for major new wood processing projects. </PARA>
<PARA>On the basis of the Prime Minister's industry statement on 12 March this year, I ask two questions: firstly, who created the uncertainty which has brought about the need for such legislation? Secondly, given the Government's performance in this area and the endless list of broken promises that is attached to this Government's record, would anyone trust this Government to enact appropriate legislation to prevent a Wesley Vale recurrence?</PARA>
<PARA> The answer to my first question is not difficult to find. The uncertainty which the Prime Minister refers to in his 12 March industry statement has been caused by the actions of his Government. If the Hawke Government had not played politics with the environment, we would not have had to worry about resource security legislation today. It is as simple as that. </PARA>
<PARA> The answer to my second question is an unqualified no. On the contrary, the legislation being processed by the Government will mean that each new development project will definitely become another Wesley Vale. Each project that is in excess of $100m will be assessed on a case by case basis. We all know that the whole affair will become a living nightmare for developers and investors. How many export dollars can this country afford to throw away? How many wealth creating and job creating projects can we shelve because we are running scared of greenies? This Government and the proposed legislation will be inadequate to deal with these important issues. </PARA>
<PARA> No-one trusts this Government to enact worthwhile legislation. We all know that it will be a botch-up. Each new project will become a political battleground with endless struggles between industry and environmental groups and between Federal and State governments, resulting in long and expensive court battles. The Government should introduce legislation that clearly establishes the guidelines for these important projects. Potential developers must know with certainty what the Government requirements will be. Once these guidelines have been established-and these guidelines should include environmental standards and foreign investment and export rules-it should be incumbent upon all parties to comply with these requirements. Potential investors should be able to approach these projects with a degree of certainty and a degree of confidence, and the rules should not be changed in midstream. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I am aware that certain environment groups are on the record claiming that they will oppose the Government's proposed legislation. My opposition to the Government's proposal is for different reasons. I implore those in the environment lobby to accept that we cannot turn our backs on development and progress for ever. This country needs wealth creating and job creating industries. As a nation we cannot afford to repeat the mistakes of Wesley Vale or of Coronation Hill. Anyone who disagrees with my position should take time to study Australia's unemployment figures, our rate of bankruptcies, our balance of trade figures and our foreign debt. The time for Government to enact responsible resource security legislation is now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), who I notice is not in the chamber today, for the opportunity to debate this motion before the House. It raises some very interesting questions about the role of the present Government in relation to the distribution of wealth in Australia. I acknowledge the genuineness of the honourable member for Denison in putting forward this motion. However, his concern only serves to highlight the failure of the Government on this issue. In his maiden speech, referred to in the motion, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) warned:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>We have moved inexorably towards that destabilised and dangerous position described by Disraeli as ``two nations'', the nation of the privileged and the nation of the poor. </PARA>
<PARA>The irony of this statement is that under his Government the gap between the rich and the poor has increased to the extent that we are indeed moving inexorably towards Disraeli's `two nations'. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Hawke Government we have seen the rise of two new classes-an underclass and a super-rich. We know about the Prime Minister's rhetoric-`saccharine rhetoric' was a phrase that he used in that same speech-so now let us look in detail at what has happened during this man's prime ministership. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to dwell on the 10 per cent unemployment level, because it was not a deliberate aim of the Government. However, the Government continued to use monetary policy as its only weapon in the fight against the ever growing current account deficit, even though it was warned by Senator Walsh, amongst others, of the likelihood of recession and of record high unemployment. This Government cared so much for the working men and women of this country that it did not even bother to listen. As Senator Walsh tells us, that reliance on monetary policy inevitably hit the blameless small majority. </PARA>
<PARA> Creating high unemployment is not the only way the Government has contributed to the inequality of wealth distribution in Australia. Between 1983 and 1989 there was a 21 per cent increase in the inequality in the distribution of income in this country. If Government members opposite-if there were any honourable members opposite-would like further clarification of that figure, I would refer them to a speech I made in this House on 30 May this year. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that in the first six years of the Hawke Government the gap between the rich and the poor grew by 21 per cent. What I cannot tell honourable members right now is how much it has grown since then. With hundreds of thousands out of work and on reduced incomes, I suspect it is much larger. Fortunately, we do not need a wealth inquiry to work it out. If the honourable member for Denison really wants to know the extent of his Government's culpability in this area, he can ask Mark Lombard from the Macquarie University, who will, I am sure, for a very modest fee provide him with the latest increase in inequality under this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> In the interim, I can provide the honourable member and his colleagues with a few more statistics on the growth of wealth inequality under the Hawke Government. When this Government came to office the top 1 per cent of income earners earned as much as the bottom 11 per cent. Six years later they earned as much as the bottom 21 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at it from the point of view of the ordinary worker, the man on the street who measures his wealth by the money in his pocket. In 1989-90 figures, in 1982-83 the annual after-tax earnings of an average family with dependent spouse and two children was $24,891. After six years of the Hawke Government, their average after-tax earnings, still in 1989-90 figures, had dropped $1,291 to $23,600. This drop increases the inequality of wealth. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it curious that a Prime Minister who talks so concernedly about the working man, the poor, the underprivileged and the disadvantaged chooses his friends from among the richest men in this country-that is, the new super rich who went fishing with the Prime Minister, had lunch with the Prime Minister, talked about the gold tax with the Prime Minister, and filled the coffers of the Australian Labor Party. The Sunday Age of 5 May tells us that election campaigns in Western Australia and the eastern States were financed by a secret $400,000 donation from Dallas Dempster, the former Perth casino boss; $150,000 from Alan Bond's Endeavour Resources; and the rest of the $2.67m by a host of others-now appearing before the Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters. This is not to mention the gifts of $300,000 from Laurie Connell and Yosse Goldberg. I must admit that it has not been a one-way street; the super rich have done very well from the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the honourable member for Denison, who is so concerned about the inequality of wealth in this country, why the Prime Minister did not reimburse all those workers in the tourist industry who lost their jobs and all the small business men and women who lost their businesses in the pilots' strike, but chose instead to reimburse Ansett $32m and East-West Airlines $2m. Both of these airlines are owned by Sir Peter Abeles, the friend of Prime Minister Hawke, the same mate who witnessed the dishonoured promise at Kirribilli. The Prime Minister's lifestyle, his friends and his new million dollar mansion are in stark contrast to his rhetoric, as are the lifestyles of some of his Ministers. For example, Senator Richardson's standard of living includes the London Carlton Hyatt at over $1,000 a night and $4,473 on car hire for two nights. His Parliamentary Secretary spent almost as much on accommodation during a ten-night stay in London as a full rate single pensioner receives in pension payments in an entire year. I think we might find some inequality of wealth there. </PARA>
<PARA> Here we are, back again at the wealth inquiry. I say `back again' because wealth inquiries have a habit of being raised by this Government. Every time it gives another kick to the middle class, another slap in the face to the poor, it starts talking about a wealth inquiry, as if somehow that would make everything all right: `We care, therefore you aren't hurting'. In 1983 the Prime Minister invited Professor Karmel, the Vice-Chancellor of the Australian National University, to prepare a proposal for a wealth inquiry. Professor Karmel did what he was asked and prepared a proposal for a five-year study. Then what? Nothing. We had the proposal, but no study. The rhetoric had done its job. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in 1986 things were looking bad again, and an interdepartmental committee, under the direction of a ministerial committee comprising the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), the honourable member for Batman (Mr Howe) and Senator Walsh, was set up to look at a wealth inquiry: it was all right, it did not matter what had happened because a wealth inquiry was going to make it all right again. A year later the ministerial committee still had not met. Four years later, in true Labor Party style, looking at what has happened to the poor, the workers and the disadvantaged of this country, the honourable member for Denison felt a wealth inquiry coming on. Well, it will not wash. </PARA>
<PARA> This country does not need a wealth inquiry but the creation of wealth. We need to get businesses back into business and workers back into jobs, and no wealth inquiry is going to do that. We do not need a wealth inquiry, we need this Government to address the problems facing the Australian economy. We need tax reform, labour market reform, waterfront reform, transport reform and telecommunications reform. We need to get Australia working again. For members of the Government to talk about a wealth inquiry-a wealth study-is a red herring, an empty gesture to direct attention away from the reality of what is happening in Australia today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Back in September 1990 the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), moved a motion in this House relating to the distribution of wealth in Australia. He called on the Government to collect and publish national statistical information regarding the distribution of wealth in this country; he also sought the commissioning of a study to give detailed consideration to and report upon measures available to reduce the inequality of wealth distribution in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He made his public call almost a year ago and I think it is fitting, despite the critical and often personal attacks made by the honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Gallus) just now, that this issue has returned to this House for debate. When the honourable member for Denison spoke in this House he presented some enlightened statistics which had been gleaned by a Mr Dilnot in an analysis published in the Australian Economic Review. The honourable member took up a couple of points. Firstly, he made the point that 30 per cent of Australians have no wealth at all. I am amazed that the honourable member for Hawker would get up and make such a contribution, knowing that that is the situation. He also pointed out that 10 per cent of the population holds 55.2 per cent of the wealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Hawker said that that is nonsense, a red herring. I urge the honourable member to look at a book called Common Wealth and Common Good. It is not a Labor Party document, some ideological purist position advanced by socialists or some extremist group, but a draft statement from the Catholic bishops of Australia on wealth distribution in this country. This document was produced by the Bishops Committee for Justice, Development and Peace. In my brief contribution I will outline some of the things the Committee advocates because they fly totally in the face of what the honourable member for Hawker has just been saying. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee set down the need, the urgency, the priority that ought to be given to a study of wealth in this country. Again, as I said, this was not advocated by members of the Labor Party alone but by Catholic bishops right across the nation. I find it amazing that the honourable member for Hawker would use her time to attack Ministers for their expenditure. If the honourable member wants to start that, let us open Pandora's box and look at the sorts of expenditure that previous governments have been involved in and at the electoral allowances and other things that present members of the Opposition are involved in. I do not want to do that because I do not think we would gain one thing from it. We ought to go to the substance of what the honourable member for Denison was saying and have a hard look at the advantages of the wealthy in this country and what those advantages lead to-the consequences in terms of the opportunities they get to minimise their taxation liabilities, the access that gives them to political power, and the social and economic opportunities and advantages they gain from their position of wealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The comments made last year by the honourable member for Denison are timely because of the points raised by the draft statement of the Catholic bishops. This statement was released in January this year, and I am surprised that the honourable member for Hawker did not even know about it. The headlines attracted me, as well as being something of an exposure of the situation. For example, in the Canberra Times of 20 January 1991 the headline reads, `Bishops call for taxes on wealth and tax reform'; in the Sun-Herald, `Bishops call for death duties'; and in the Age, `Australians must be less selfish'-again, the bishops' call. The important one, because the honourable member for Hawker has just attacked the honourable member for Denison for his call for an inquiry into wealth, was the Sydney Morning Herald: `Bishops call for an inquiry into wealth'. Is the honourable member for Hawker saying that is trite? Is she saying it is a red herring? Is she prepared to stand up and be counted and say that she attacks the position taken by the Catholic Church and the Catholic bishops across this nation as they understand the dilemma, the problems and the disadvantages facing the people of this nation?</PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of the recommendations in this draft statement. It is a call for self-examination for every Australian, for us as individuals and for Australia as a nation. The draft statement recommends in recommendation No. 1:</PARA>
<PARA>That the traditional concept of the common good linked with the ideal of solidarity, be the basis for any action taken to redistribute wealth in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>That is something that needs to be thought about very carefully. Recommendation No. 2:</PARA>
<PARA>That the full implications of the expression common wealth, as it applies to the ownership, control and the use of the nation's resources, be explored. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation No. 4:</PARA>
<PARA>That Australians be encouraged to be more generous in offering overseas aid, both through government and privately. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation No. 5:</PARA>
<PARA>That we all reflect seriously on our lifestyles in the light of papal and other admonitions about the materialism of the West and the consumerism practised in affluent nations. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 6:</PARA>
<PARA>That the wealthy and high income earners ask themselves if it is legitimate for them to aspire to an even higher standard of living at a time when serious poverty exists both at home and abroad. </PARA>
<PARA>Another recommendation that appeals to me is recommendation No. 8:</PARA>
<PARA>That in the light of well documented environmental and ecological damage, the sustainability of all forms of economic development be objectively assessed. </PARA>
<PARA>The Catholic bishops have gone to the essence of the problem. They have come up with recommendations, and one notes that the recommendations parallel the propositions put forward by Duncan Kerr, the honourable member for Denison, months and months ago. Yet the honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Gallus) stands here trying to make light of the matter, trying to ridicule and making personal attacks. I think she gains no kudos and she certainly does not have my respect for the position that she has taken. </PARA>
<PARA> There has not been an inquiry into wealth in this nation since 1915, and the bishops' report validates what Duncan Kerr and others have said in this House and what is the substance of that motion. Clearly there is here an independent position being taken by the Catholic Church outside of the political arena which argues strongly for the need of such an inquiry. We need to have an in-depth consideration of the wealth of accumulation trends. As the honourable member for Denison pointed out in his speech, 10 per cent of Australians owned 55.2 per cent of the nation's wealth; the Catholic bishops in their update point out that 10 per cent of Australians own 60 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I place on record my appreciation for what this Government has done. We talk about the reshaping of the tax system. This Government has lifted the threshold, so a vast majority of people do not pay tax at all. Single pensioners now are getting very close to $10,000 without paying tax in this financial year. There are lower taxes for low and middle income earners. We have attacked the rorts; we have eradicated most of those problems. We have gone to those issues such as fringe benefits, entertainment rorts and capital gains tax, which we have introduced, and we have required substantiation. We have toughened those areas up. We have given special assistance to the disadvantaged with family allowance supplements and rent allowances. We have indexed those allowances to keep pace with costs. There are higher pensions for the aged. We now have taxation exemptions for the unemployed. Whilst I place these measures on record and I give them the tick-I say, `Thirteen out of 10'-there is clearly a need to do more, for there is a constant challenge to improve the lot of the poor, the lot of those who are disadvantaged and to bring about changes. </PARA>
<PARA> For the honourable member for Hawker to say the things she said just makes the mind boggle as to what her priorities really are. I know her priorities-at least, I know her Party's priorities. Her Party on the other side is the Party that, if it gets into government, wants to slash $2 billion from expenditure. $2 billion! Think of the impact, the consequences on the families of this nation, on the unemployed. As to the unemployed, her Party wants to cut out all unemployment benefits after a person has been out of work for nine months. Then it looks at its priorities. It wants to impact negatively against ordinary families and the poor and, what is more, it wants to remove capital gains taxes, which are one way of distributing wealth from the rich. It wants to scrap Medicare. It wants to introduce a goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Hawker talks about friendships or some such thing with the wealthy. Clearly, the Liberal-National Party coalition over there is developing a golden bridge with the wealthy of this nation, for a goods and services tax will only benefit the rich. It just amazes me that we have an honourable member who makes those comments, critical personal attacks on members of the Government, and then espouses these points of view as those of her Party. For we know that the Liberal-National Party coalition is attacking the very support systems and safety nets for the disadvantaged in this nation. I think now is the time for an inquiry. I think we need to heed what the Catholic bishops have said and the motion moved by Duncan Kerr. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will come as no surprise when I say that I am totally opposed to this motion. Australia does not need an inquiry into the distribution of wealth. It simply is not necessary. Indeed, it is obvious that, in reality, this Government with its blow to bureaucracy by paper shufflers is more interested in punishing the wealth creators of this society than in allowing them the economic freedom to create the wealth that will ensure the future prosperity and security of the nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At its most basic level, the concept of wealth is synonymous with the accumulation of assets. It is reflected in such things as affluence, luxury, prosperity, abundance and command over money and resources. People who have large observable measures of capital are generally perceived as wealthy. However, while such observations may sometimes be instructive, it is simplistic in the extreme to assume that wealth is something that is so easy to define. Statistical rankings of assets owned provide us with very little reliable information about the relative earning capacity of individuals. People with significant observable holdings of assets, while possibly able to spend more in the short term, are not necessarily able to command greater resources over the longer run than those whose wealth is embodied in non-observable forms. </PARA>
<PARA> A correct economic definition of `wealth' makes it intrinsically non-observable. In other words, this intended inquiry into the distribution of wealth is, in reality, little more than a cynical exercise in bureaucratic interference aimed at further taxation of individual enterprise and achievement. Moreover, given the economic disaster that now confronts this nation, it would be difficult to imagine an exercise that would more effectively result in the creation of less rather than more wealth in this country. Only last week did the Bureau of Statistics reveal that most Australians have known for months that this country is getting poorer and that their lives are becoming more difficult. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the loony Left and the middle class trendoids of the Labor Party, whose knowledge of how wealth is created would hardly fill the back of a postage stamp, do not mind that their country, once the richest in the world, may well be reduced in the not too distant future to begging bowl status. Obviously their economic illiteracy is so great that they cannot comprehend the ultimate impact of our massive foreign debt, our punitive rates of taxation, our grossly over-regulated labour market, our pathetically low level of domestic savings and abysmal record of national productivity. So it comes as no surprise to find the spectre of an inquiry into wealth being raised by the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr). What a nasty and insidious attack it is on the creativeness and ingenuity of the men and women whose endeavours have allowed the honourable member to enjoy a level of security and prosperity barely imagined by his parents' generation. What a pathetic commentary it is on his ignorance of Lincoln's specific observation, `You cannot help the poor by destroying the rich'. </PARA>
<PARA> Encapsulated in those words is an economic and philosophical concept that is entirely foreign to those Labor-voting Volvo socialists whose middle class guilt continues to pervade the policies of this Government. Contrary to their naive assumptions, wealth is not measured just by adding up the estimates of worth of factories, buildings, mines, farms, collections of antique clocks or memorabilia from the second empire, since these are merely mechanisms that assist in the production of income. </PARA>
<PARA> What then is wealth? In short, it is cash deposited in a financial institution and assets such as property and shares in a business. Bank deposits, as we all know, attract interest, which, in turn, is taxed at high marginal rates on the spurious ground that it is unearned income. Savings are also adversely affected by inflation. So what might appear at a particular point in time to be a fabulously large amount in the bank may well disappear in a short time as a result of the insidious disease of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also important to recognise that the concept of wealth, like concepts such as poverty and inequality, is a relative and not an absolute term. By any standards the poorest Australians are infinitely better off than the poorest Ethiopians, but would, I imagine, describe themselves as poor in comparison with the Business Review Weekly richest 200 list. </PARA>
<PARA> As all members of this Government are well aware, Australia already has an avalanche of information on this matter. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright), went on about it for five minutes. Thanks to the socialist meddlers of the 1980s, the tax file number and census data already provide a massive amount of statistical information on all manner of subjects so beloved by intrusive big brother governments. Apart from the fact that much of this information gathering is an expensive and unnecessary invasion of privacy, it is absolutely ludicrous to be calling for another inquiry into wealth when Australians are already drowning in an ocean of debt and are facing levels of unemployment unheard of since the Great Depression. </PARA>
<PARA> As a nation, in both absolute and relative terms, we are becoming poorer. Contrary to the beliefs of most honourable members on the other side of the House, wealth-unlike bureaucracy-is a very difficult thing to create. In practice, there are only three ways: by digging it out of the ground, by growing it, and by manufacturing it. Of these three industries, two are in considerable financial difficulty, while the mining industry has to contend with the antipathy of a Government which has sold out to the tree-hugging troglodytes of the greenie left. </PARA>
<PARA> If the honourable member for Denison really wished to generate income to remove poverty, then the strategy he should adopt is not one which tinkers with the ownership of observable capital wealth in this country but one which fosters the process whereby all can accumulate wealth by the most efficient and fairest means possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the removal of poverty is not his real motive. However, being charitable and assuming that it is, I would suggest that it is entirely likely that taxes on observable forms of wealth, even more than punitive marginal taxes on income and savings, would have a negative impact on the generation of income streams, would reduce employment opportunities and frustrate the training and education of individuals who might otherwise engage in productive wealth creating activities. </PARA>
<PARA> It is imperative that Australia become a society focused on wealth creation, not wealth investigation. This will only be achieved when the reforms that even honourable members on the other side of the House know must be introduced in transport, industrial relations, taxation and education have been achieved.</PARA>
<PARA> Against the background of Australia's deepening recession governments can ill afford to hide behind the expensive inquiries and reports so beloved by our Yes, Minister clones in the bureaucracy. All this costs the community a fortune, but it creates no wealth. The last thing Australia needs is an inquiry into wealth. What we need urgently is the development of a culture which encourages and rewards the creation of wealth, since that is the only kind of society that can afford to provide for those who are unable to look after themselves. There is no doubt that the major issue concerning Australians today is the failure of the economy, particularly the horrendous rise in unemployment and the failure of so many businesses. </PARA>
<PARA> As the history of this century so clearly demonstrates, these problems will not be solved by more legislation and more bureaucrats. They can only be solved by less interference in people's lives and much less interference in the marketplace. It has not been to our advantage that much of the development in twentieth century Australia has been characterised by the growth of a culture which is inward looking and anti-competition. It is a culture in which the politics of envy dominates the collective psyche. It is a culture of featherbedded government monopolies and powerful unions. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a pity that the honourable member for Denison has not read Michael Porter's recent work The Competitive Advantage of Nations.  Had he done so he would realise the absurdity of the present motion. A major theme of Professor Porter's book is that the domestic market environment in product areas must be competitive, entrepreneurial and receptive to change. Another lesson is that we must foster more competition in skills and training and avoid the kinds of centralist regimes so beloved by the present Government. Government fix-it schemes, subsidies to exporters and bureaucratic attempts to pick winners are precisely the wrong directions to go-as are inquiries into wealth. Indeed, governments are notoriously poor operators of businesses and have almost never been able to secure a competitive advantage in the production of goods and services. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After the diatribe of prejudice emanating from the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Ford) all I can say is that we miss you, Bob Chynoweth. If those on the other side of the House say that a wealth inquiry is ludicrous, they should talk to the Catholic bishops. That was something raised by their own colleagues, the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Broadbent), in the earlier part of this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) moved this motion, he quoted an old saying: the best way to judge even the most affluent society is how well it treats its poor. In recent years our Government has endeavoured to alleviate poverty through a system of coordinated income support programs and has targeted assistance to the disadvantaged groups in our society. As a consequence of such targeting, and the intensive community consultation which preceded its determination, we now know much more about the less well off in our country-certainly more than we used to. This Parliament should be indebted to the honourable member for Batman (Mr Howe), who was then the Minister for Social Security, for ensuring that the necessary preliminary research was undertaken by Dr Belinda Cass under the auspices of the Social Security Review at that time. I know that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca), who is at the table, is very interested in this matter because he has quite a lot to do with people in this country who require assistance through benefits. I also acknowledge the presence of the honourable member for Denison, who originated this terrific motion. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it is true that we still know almost nothing about the wealthy in our society. Some people, like the honourable member for Dunkley, ask why we need to know about the wealthy at all. `They are succeeding, let them get on with it', he says, or words to that effect. But it is important to question the factors which enable these people to succeed in accumulating wealth on a continuous basis before we can categorically encourage them to get on with it. I have no objection to people being wealthy; I only have objection to them being wealthy at the expense of the poor. </PARA>
<PARA> As indicated by my colleague the honourable member for Denison in his original speech, A.W. Dilnot's paper shows that people with small amounts of wealth suffer higher effective rates of taxation-up to 47c in the dollar. These effective rates fall rapidly as wealth increases-and members of this chamber would obviously be seen to be quite wealthy in terms of the Australian population-with the top one per cent facing an effective rate of only 9c in the dollar. That serves only to increase and help maintain the inequality of wealth distribution. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious from these figures that the taxation system as a whole is assisting the wealthy to maintain their wealth to a greater degree than it is assisting the unwealthy to obtain or accumulate it. This trend will be difficult to reverse, but it is a problem which is worthy of our consideration, as members of parliament and as citizens of this country. I cannot help fearing that the Opposition and its individual members who have participated in this debate cannot see that that is in fact the case. </PARA>
<PARA> We must not pretend that any change in this area will be easy or necessarily quick to achieve. That has been obvious over the past years when people have tried to initiate a wealth inquiry. The wealthy have a vested interest in maintaining the taxation status quo and, as a consequence of their wealth, possess significant political power. Political will may well be lacking, as I think the honourable member for Corinella has indicated, towards the establishment of an inquiry into wealth in Australia. Nevertheless, the relative treatment of the wealthy and the unwealthy in the taxation system demands change and should provide sufficient justification for urgent remedial action. </PARA>
<PARA> To achieve a more equitable tax base, we must understand fully the distribution of wealth and the way in which it is held. We will not find this out unless we have a decent inquiry. I applaud the Catholic bishops for the inquiry that they have conducted at their own expense. They recognise that this is not an official inquiry. As a consequence of that inquiry, they have now decided to channel more of their church's resources to the poor. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the least that we can do as a government and a nation is ensure that more of our resources are channelled to the poor but we need to ensure that our resources are channelled in the right way. To overcome the problems that currently exist in the taxation system as a whole, we need to undertake an inquiry to find out where the wealth is and how it is actually accumulated. </PARA>
<PARA> While the capital gains tax introduced by this Government is a useful mechanism for taxing the increase in value of an asset being sold, it does nothing to extract tax from the appreciating value of a static asset-the type of asset which people have maintained in their family for generations. As the honourable member for Denison said, one of the most important contributing factors to the concentration of wealth in the top 10 per cent of the population is inheritance. Such assets are largely ignored and would be taken into account only in circumstances where an assets test is imposed in conjunction with an application by the owner for government assistance of some kind. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously we see that in the pension system where the age pension now applies only to people who comply with the assets test. Some people criticise that. But I think it is only fair that where people who have assets of their own are attempting to access the assets of the country, their assets should be declared and evaluated. </PARA>
<PARA> As was suggested by the honourable member for Denison in initiating this debate, the reintroduction of estate and gift duties would be a simple solution to the problem of wealth consolidation and would redress some of the present inequalities in the tax system. The Catholic bishops are also in agreement on this point. </PARA>
<PARA> Any new tax on inheritance would need to be specifically targeted so as not to affect the ordinary householder who would want to pass on a moderate estate to his or her children and family. It is a tax trap that needs to be set for the very wealthy only. I emphasise that. We are not interested in those people who are only marginally wealthy. I think it should be acknowledged that there are very wealthy people in this country. These people are the ones who should be contributing more than they currently do. </PARA>
<PARA> Another way to deal with the problem of unjust effective tax rates may be to resurrect the system of a differential rate of tax on earned and unearned income. The honourable member for Dunkley said that it is essential that our society concentrate on wealth creation. I agree with him. But I fear I have a different view of where wealth creation occurs. It is the workers of this country who are the primary creators of wealth. Every day they expend their energies and utilise their intellects in the service of the nation. It is only right, therefore, that our nation's taxation system should aid their ability to preserve as much of their earnings as possible during the course of their working lives. In conjunction with access to decent superannuation and ancillary income support via the age pension, they will hopefully then be able to expect to retire with some dignity and security. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever else we may disagree on in this place, I think it is fair to say that the majority of honourable members value the expectation of equal treatment of individuals that prevails in Australia. Although not a classless society in the absolute sense of that phrase, we certainly are not dogged by the class distinctions of some other countries and neither would we want to be. Nevertheless, that is one of the problems which can emerge if we continue to protect inherited wealth and privilege and allow the gap between the rich and poor to widen. We must at least ensure that some portion of wealth is redistributed to those at the lower end of our economic scale where everything has to be worked for, where everything has to be paid for and where so much may only be dreamed of. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposals to obtain data on wealth are not based on naive assumptions that every person necessarily could, or would even want to, attain the same level of wealth as every other person; or that there will not always be more incentive for some to attain wealth. The real point is that the taxation system should not continue to be skewed in favour of the substantive wealth accumulators at the expense of the battlers who have no option but to spend the major part of their earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> Once again, I take issue with the honourable member for Dunkley, who spoke earlier in this debate. The honourable member said that he thinks we should be encouraging people to keep their wealth. That is not helpful in a recession. Spending is what improves an economy in a recession. Any measure to tax the wealthy minority more would certainly assist people at the bottom end of the scale to continue spending on life's necessities and put money in the pockets of businesses. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am totally opposed to the motion moved by the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr). In fact, I find it completely and utterly abhorrent. I want to tell him that it is none of his business who has wealth in this country. I believe that governments and bureaucrats should operate on a need to know basis. Despite the best rhetoric of those supporting this motion, including the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen), whom I frequently follow in these sorts of debates, this is not information that Big Brother should have. In fact, I believe that it would be positively dangerous for Big Brother-particularly as he is represented by those on the other side of the House-to have this information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that this information would be used to reinforce old fashioned notions about the threat by the rich to the great egalitarian dream of those opposite. As far as I am concerned, that is pure Marxism. But Marx has been discredited. Honourable members opposite may not have woken up to what is going on in the world today. However, I can tell them that Marx has been discredited. The rich do not necessarily get richer at the expense of the poor. This discredited ideology is constantly pushed by those on the other side of the House. In my view, information is power. Power can be abused, and it often is abused. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of seriously flawed assumptions in the honourable member for Denison's motion. The motion assumes, wrongly in my view, that there is something inherently wrong with being wealthy. It assumes that somehow there is a correlation between wealth and happiness. It assumes that poor people are somehow unhappy. It assumes that if we take from the rich and give to the poor, hey presto, life will suddenly be worth living. This is absolute rubbish. </PARA>
<PARA> The words in this motion may be innocuous, as words often are. But we need to look beyond the words to the true intention of the motion. The intention is clearly insidious. I believe that it is really all about simply finding out who has got the wealth as a prelude to taking it from them. The honourable member for Denison talks about death duties and all sorts of other wealth taxes. There is no other justification for this other than pure greed. </PARA>
<PARA> Socialists-and I see many of them in the House; I suppose that the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), who is to follow me in this debate, is an archetype-are inevitably preoccupied by wealth. They spend their lives trying to get their hands on other people's wealth. Then, inevitably, they waste it on social engineering which has inevitably undermined the family, which is the very fabric of our society. If they cannot get it from people when they are alive, they want to get it from them when they die; they want to get their hands on it then. That is what the people opposite are all about; and that is what the honourable member for Denison's motion is all about. It does not fool me for one moment. </PARA>
<PARA> The attack on wealth is, after all, ultimately an attack on the free enterprise system, the system which, more than ever, has been proven to work simply because it gives people-all people; everyone-the opportunity to accumulate private wealth. If this motivation is removed, the nation as a whole ultimately fails to accumulate wealth. If the honourable member for Denison and the honourable member for Banks, who I assume will argue for the motion, have not learned that, they have not been around in the last few years. </PARA>
<PARA> The real answer to the honourable member for Denison's problem, to the extent that he has one, is not to make the wealthy poorer, it is to create an environment in which the poor can improve their standard of living. From my point of view, that means providing a conducive economic environment: an environment in which real jobs are available; an environment in which the tax system is fair and equitable and provides incentives for people to work harder. And that, after all, is everything that this Government has not done. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Denison and those who have spoken in favour of this motion have an unhealthy preoccupation with capital gains tax. I find that very revealing because that is their true motivation. They believe they will solve all of this country's problems and all of this society's problems by finding out who has the wealth and taking it from them. It will not work. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support wholeheartedly the motion before the House moved by the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr). In recent years there has been in Australian society a polarisation which has seen the rich get richer while the poor become poorer. Some members in this chamber would have us believe that the nation prospers if its individuals prosper. I do not subscribe to this point of view. The 1980s, a decade of excess and greed, saw many individuals prosper but no lasting prosperity for the nation. If we are at all serious about creating a just and equitable society, national interest must be put ahead of self-interest and sectional interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In Australia there is a scarcity of information concerning the distribution of wealth. What research is available tends to reinforce the same message, namely, that the wealth of the nation is concentrated in the hands of a few. For the Government successfully to introduce measures to reduce the inequality in the distribution of wealth, it is imperative that it have current statistical data on which to base policy. Inequality of wealth leads to inequality of opportunity, which in turn affects the quality of life. </PARA>
<PARA> A progressive tax system is essential if the current inequality is to be overcome. A progressive tax system is fair and equitable because it compels all people to pay their fair share. The greater the wealth, the greater the tax that should be paid. In the era of creative accounting, we find our wealthiest individuals and companies paying as little as 5c in the dollar in tax, while pay as you earn workers are paying up to 48c in the dollar. Where is the equity in this? Wealth provides people with the opportunity to minimise and avoid paying their fair share of tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The studies that are available highlight the fact that our wealthiest 10 per cent inherited most of their wealth. It was not through their toil and endeavour that they prospered; it was, rather, an accident of birth. An inheritance tax is essential if we are to restore some balance and equity into our tax system. Australia and Canada are the only OECD countries which do not have an inheritance tax or some form of death duties. Even the United States, that great bastion of free enterprise, has a wealth tax. The arguments espoused by those who oppose some form of inheritance tax are hollow and vested in self-interest. </PARA>
<PARA> Correctly administered, an inheritance tax would contribute towards a progressive redistribution of income; it would also reduce the inequality of opportunity that favours those who inherit their wealth. Income should be treated equally regardless of how it is derived. People who have worked hard and planned for their retirement by contributing to a superannuation fund are taxed when those funds are withdrawn upon retirement. A person can inherit exactly the same amount of money and not pay a cent in tax. Where is the equity and fairness? An inheritance tax will partly address this glaring anomaly. </PARA>
<PARA> I am encouraged that some Opposition members have supported the motion before the House, but I am somewhat confused when they profess a desire to redress the current bias in the tax system. The fervent desire of the Opposition to introduce a consumption tax on goods and services is well known. A consumption tax is regressive, not progressive. Rather than overcoming inequalities, it will create even further inequalities. </PARA>
<PARA> On 14 February 1991, the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Broadbent) stood in this chamber and said that he spoke on behalf of the window cleaner. Under Opposition policy, the window cleaner will always be on the outside looking in. The introduction of a consumption tax will not be of any benefit to him or the millions of fixed, low and middle income earners in our society. A person earning $1,000 a week will pay the same tax on bread, milk, sugar, clothes and other essential living items as a person in receipt of a pension. </PARA>

<PARA> I want to express my very great pleasure and, indeed, the feeling of joy and excitement that I am sure many in Australia feel today at the latest news from the Soviet Union. I know that I express that view on behalf of my constituents. I will shortly have the privilege of being one of the members representing this Parliament at an Inter-Parliamentary Union conference and I will take great pleasure in expressing to the delegates from the Soviet Union the view of Australian parliamentarians on the triumph of freedom over dictatorship in their country in the last couple of days. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now a matter of historical fact that Australia's present Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) made a deliberate decision not to tell the truth to the Australian people during the last election. It is now part of the public record that, when asked how long he would serve if he was re-elected Prime Minister, he unequivocally declared that he would serve a full term, despite having given a secret undertaking to the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) to step down in his favour before that term expired. </PARA>
<PARA> The justification the Prime Minister gave when this unconscionable deception was revealed three months ago was that he did it `for the good of the Australian people'. The fact that what he perceived to be of greatest benefit to the people also happened to be what was of greatest benefit to himself-that is, retaining occupancy of the Lodge-as well as being of greatest benefit to the Labor Party, demonstrates as clearly as need be the real nature of his altruism. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not surprising that a Labor Party politician would think that what is best for the Labor Party-namely, being in government-is best for Australia. Unfortunately, this form of political conceit happens to completely deny the essence of democracy, which is the people deciding for themselves what is best for them and then expressing that view through the ballot box. If democracy assumes that the people are informed about the issues about which they will be asked to express their will, it goes without saying that the information available to them on which they will make their decision must be the truth. To deliberately state as fact what one knows absolutely to be untrue is to pervert and deny the democratic process. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister appeared to have gotten away with this monstrous deceit-but the heavens did not fall, did they-and now it seems that this is to become the hallmark of the Prime Minister's campaign style. I refer to his vigorous and blatantly untrue campaign of misrepresentation of the coalition's tax reform package. </PARA>
<PARA> The real tragedy of this course of events is that the Labor Party is blindly following the Prime Minister's lead and honourable members opposite are tamely allowing themselves to be led into the error of a campaign of blatant untruths. Statements they are making now about the goods and services tax will surely come back to haunt them as the community becomes more knowledgeable about the whole proposal. For example, the statement `A trolley load of groceries which cost $100 today, will cost $115, under the Liberal's consumption tax' is untrue, and unforgivably so. Any politician who has taken any notice of the public debate on the GST issue would know by now that an offset to the effect of the introduction of the GST will be the abolition of the present wholesale sales tax. Yet the statement I have just quoted was made by the Deputy Premier of Queensland, Tom Burns, on the Rod Henshaw program on Brisbane ABC radio this week. There is no way that Tom Burns does not know better than that, but he is making the error of echoing his Party's national leader, namely, Prime Minister Hawke. </PARA>

<PARA> The coalition's tax reform package-which includes the abolition of the wholesale sales tax, as I have already mentioned, the introduction of a goods and services tax, lower personal income tax, and measures to offset any adverse effect for people receiving low incomes-will set the scene for Australia's long term recovery. Gone are the days when one could optimistically expect to retain some reasonable portion of take home pay as savings. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the facts of the Hawke Government's tax record? An Australian family with two children endures one of the highest average rates of income tax in the industrialised world. It is estimated that the so-called `black economy' means that the average PAYE taxpayer now pays as much as $45 per week more in tax than she or he would if the cash economy bludgers could be made to pay their fair share. The revenue from the wholesale sales tax has increased from $3 billion in 1983 to $10.6 billion in 1991-a massive 350 per cent increase which Labor has made no attempt to offset for those very same people on low incomes for whom it cries crocodile tears when it debates the GST. </PARA>
<PARA> Although it will not admit it, this Labor Government is aware that the structure of its present tax system is a shambles, and effectively encourages an individual's participation in the black economy. The GST confronts this problem and ensures that these tax dodgers will at last contribute to the Government-funded services they enjoy along with everyone else in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Of great concern to me is the Government's scare campaign aimed at the elderly, which has been designed to cause confusion and anxiety amongst our senior citizens. The income source of many of my elderly constituents is an age pension, income from investments, superannuation, and those who receive a part pension to augment modest superannuation or other income. Those who are ineligible to receive a full or part pension presently pay substantial income tax. Offsetting the GST for this section of the community can be simply achieved through the taxation system by increasing that part of their income which is tax free-that is, by raising the tax threshold. </PARA>
<PARA> Likewise, superannuants who receive a part pension will have the GST offset through both the taxation system and an increase in their pension entitlement. For those on a full pension, the GST is offset simply through increasing pension payments. The Government has based its campaign of untruths on the supposition that, `Because we can't work it out, neither can you'. I remind the Government that just last week Don Chipp said that anybody who could not work out a way of compensating low income people for the effects of the goods and services tax should not be in the game. That just about sums up the Labor Party's position on it. Because it cannot work out how to do it, it should not be in the game. After the next election, the Labor Party will not be in the game. </PARA>
<PARA> If the coalition had set its sights on gaining government at any cost, it could have abandoned the GST proposal long ago, given the scare campaign mounted by the Labor Party. However, our prime interest lies in creating a solid foundation for Australia's future prosperity. The coalition believes the great potential for growth in Australia-presently struggling under the weight of government interference-can be revived through its tax reform package. If it does not succeed, I am afraid Australia can forget about ever achieving meaningful taxation reform, let alone reviving its prosperity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in this grievance debate today to bring to the notice of this Parliament the hypocrisy the New South Wales Government has shown in regard to the deepwater submarine outfalls project. Despite having criticised the then Labor Government that implemented the project, the New South Wales Government now claims it as its own victory towards cleaning up Sydney's beaches. Last week, Premier Nick Greiner officially commissioned the Bondi deep ocean sewerage outfall, and amidst a true media circus claimed that:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Australia's most famous beach now has clear blue water for the first time in 101 years. </PARA>
<PARA>What Mr Greiner, of course, failed to say was that it was the Wran Labor Government's initiative-which Mr Greiner himself criticised continually in 1985 and 1986-that has allowed him to make such bold statements. Mr Greiner also claimed last week that the commissioning of the last of the three deep ocean outfalls was:</PARA>
<PARA>An historic environmental trifecta-</PARA>
<PARA>which would-</PARA>
<PARA>play an important part in the Government's comprehensive program to clean up our beaches and waterways. </PARA>
<PARA>These words are, of course, quite different from those flung at me when Greiner was the Leader of the New South Wales Opposition and I was the Minister for Water Resources. Mr Greiner was continually telling the Labor Government in 1985 how the deep ocean outfalls were not the answer to Sydney's water pollution problems and how the Water Board, under my direction at that time, was wasting millions of dollars of taxpayers money. Mr Greiner went so far as to say in November 1985:</PARA>
<PARA>After 10 years of Government, two years of this Minister, the reality is that the situation is worse than it has ever been in the pollution control section of the Water Board. It is as bad as it has ever been. The Government has been trifling with both the health of the people of Sydney and the environmental quality of its ocean and inland waterways. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet this trifling is what Greiner is now standing up in front of the people of New South Wales and claiming to be part of the master plan of the Liberal Government. It means nothing that it was the Wran Labor Government which directed the construction of a first outfall at Malabar to commence in 1984. It is nothing less than hypocritical, in view of Greiner's past comments on the deep ocean outfalls, that he could say that his Government is proud to have taken the lead with a comprehensive pollution strategy for the beaches and Sydney's waterways. This is the man who told the House in 1985 that:</PARA>
<PARA>While submarine outfall tunnels may provide an answer in the 1990s, there are many environmental problems to be overcome in the meantime. </PARA>
<PARA>Greiner has now had his chance to do something about these problems, but what has he done? Nothing. More was done for Sydney's waterways, beaches and sewerage system in my time as Minister for Water Resources than has been done in the whole time Greiner has been in Government. It is not only Mr Greiner who is hypocritical. His Minister for the Environment, Mr Tim Moore, in October 1986, said:</PARA>
<PARA>We believe there is a need . . . for a positive investigation for the installation of a secondary treatment system within the Sydney ocean outfall system; and that is vital for the rectification of our beach pollution problems. </PARA>
<PARA>Those were his words, not mine. Although Mr Moore's Party has been in Government since 1988 in New South Wales, nothing has been done in regard to installing a secondary treatment system within the ocean outfall system. Sydney remains the only capital city which does not treat its sewerage beyond the primary stage. It just goes to show that some people talk about what they think should be done and others go ahead and do it. </PARA>
<PARA> If it had not been for the Wran Labor Government, Greiner and Moore would still be talking about having an ocean outfall system and cleaning up Sydney's waterways, but would be doing nothing about it. Governments need builders, not talkers. That is all that the Greiner Government has done-talked. It talked about how wasteful it was to build an ocean outfall for Sydney's sewerage in 1985 and 1986. It talked about how the Labor Government should upgrade Sydney's sewerage treatment works, and now it is talking about how wonderful it is that it has commissioned the last ocean outfall in Sydney. But the Greiner Government also talks about how it does not have enough money to upgrade the sewerage treatment system and build secondary treatment plants to screen the waste before it is pumped out to sea. The hypocrisy of the Greiner Government just goes on and on. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite saying in 1986 that the construction of deep water ocean outfalls would not solve Sydney's beach pollution problems, now that Greiner has the chance to continue the work the Labor Government started, he has done nothing more, apart from claiming the fruits of Labor's toil as his own. Greiner's words in 1986 were:</PARA>
<PARA>There is simply no guarantee that this expensive outfall system will completely solve the problem. </PARA>
<PARA>I wonder whether Mr Greiner still believes this. After all, he did tell the media last week that, as a result of the outfall system, this coming summer would go down in Bondi's proud history as the year Australians began repaying nature for the toll that generations had inflicted on the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> Again in 1986 Greiner accused the Wran Government of opting for the short term cosmetic plan of simply building the ocean outfalls without tackling the real problem of adequate sewage treatment before it was pumped into the ocean. What plans does the Greiner Government now have for tackling the problem? In 1986, Tim Moore said:</PARA>
<PARA>Sydney still stumbles along trying to get by with a largely primary treatment based system. </PARA>
<PARA>Why not do something about it now? He also said then:</PARA>
<PARA>The State Government and the Water Board should use the opportunity afforded by the time and money savings on the ocean outfalls to start proper upgrading of Sydney's sewerage disposal treatment system.</PARA>
<PARA>Under the Greiner Government, water ratepayers are now paying an extra $80 a year environmental levy, yet it has still not put into practice what it preached during my days in government in New South Wales. Moore also criticised the Wran Government for spending money on tunnelling deepwater ocean outfalls that would simply move the existing pollution problems of Sydney's beaches about three kilometres offshore. However, his Government is now quite content to say that these outfalls are the answer and will help Sydney's beaches. </PARA>
<PARA> Ocean disposal of sewage has been practised in the Sydney area for more than 90 years. At the time of the construction of the major cliff face sewage outfalls at Malabar, North Head and Bondi, the population served was comparatively small and the discharge of raw sewage to the ocean was an acceptable solution. It was the Wran Government that recognised that, with the expansion of the Sydney region, the quantity requiring disposal was steadily increasing. Over the years, the popularity of surf swimming has also increased and many of our Sydney beaches have now become world famous for recreational playgrounds. </PARA>
<PARA> In recognition of this, the Water Board many years ago adopted a policy of providing primary treatment facilities at the major ocean outfalls with a view to constructing deepwater outfalls as a final stage in the process. The Wran Government saw that the provision of submarine outfalls would preserve the recreational value of those beaches that were threatened by pollution of sewage origin. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to assess the impact of the existing shoreline discharge and the feasibility of constructing deepwater submarine outfalls offshore from Sydney, the Water Board conducted an extensive program of oceanographic and marine studies during the period of 1972 to 1979. These studies culminated in the preparation of environmental impact statements for the three outfalls and concluded that the most cost effective, environmentally acceptable means of meeting our Water Board's water quality objectives and those laid down in the Clean Waters Act was the disposal of treated sewage in deep water offshore. However, it was not until the Wran Labor Government came to power that anything along these lines was done. </PARA>
<PARA> In June 1982 the Water Board sought approval under section 19 of the Clean Waters Act from the State Pollution Control Commission. The Commission, in granting approval, emphasises endorsement of the construction of extended ocean outfalls at Malabar, North Head and Bondi. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am proud to say that when I was Minister the Wran Government committed itself to having the three ocean outfalls constructed and ready for final commissioning during 1990, provided that the funds and the manpower were available. </PARA>
<PARA> We put that scheme into operation. Over 400 people, 170 of whom were from the Water Board's project team and the rest of whom were contractors, worked on the 10-year project. Together the three submarine ocean outfall tunnels will shift one billion tonnes of sewage a day out to sea. The Bondi outfall alone will transport the sewage of over 210,000 people-160 million litres a day-60 metres under the seabed and in excess of 1.7 kilometres out to sea before diffusing it with massive jets. </PARA>
<PARA> Studies have also shown that only three weeks after the Malabar outfall tunnel was opened there was a 90 per cent drop in beach pollution at Manly. Without a doubt, the Wran Labor Government initiated perhaps the most ambitious and innovative program in the submarine ocean outfalls towards the maintenance of Sydney sewage in New South Wales history. The Greiner Government is now attempting to take the credit for this program in, I believe, a most despicable and hypocritical way. It is time that members of the Greiner Government put their money where their mouths are and did something off their own bats about Sydney's water and sewerage system instead of, as they have continued to do, just claiming the efforts of their predecessors as their own. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today on behalf of my constituents to stake a claim on part of the $56m to be spent this year and $816m to be spent over the next few years on the better cities program. It is part of a porkbarrelling exercise by the Hawke Labor Government running up to the next election campaign. It is probably the first time in a Budget that funds have actually been set aside for some pork-barrelling and vote grabbing.-I also intend to show how the incompetence, arrogant ignorance of the effects of their policies, and mistakes of the Hawke and Kirner governments combined continue to offend families and small businesses in my electorate of Corinella, with ramifications that reach right across Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Remember the remarks of the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), about our problems in Victoria and how they had contributed dramatically to Australia's recession? Remember the State Bank takeover by the Commonwealth Government through the Commonwealth Bank? Remember the $2.5m loss of Tricontinental; the collapse of the Pyramid Bank and the involvement of Cain and Jolly in that; the estate mortgage collapse; the VEDC losses; WorkCare and its $2,000m of unfunded liabilities; and, recently, to the shame of us all, the Brian Mier affair?</PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke-Kirner Government has, to this point, been all talk and no social justice-all words and no action. The Labor Government of this nation acquired the State Bank of Victoria from a bankrupt debt-ridden company called the Victorian Cain-Kirner Government-a bankrupt government. That asset, which was then owned by the people of Victoria, was consumed by the Commonwealth Bank and, in turn, sold back to the Victorians and other Australian people at a profit. </PARA>
<PARA> Shares in the Commonwealth Bank have just been floated at a profit of $15m-that is the interest gained just for holding those funds for a few weeks before the distribution of shares. The Commonwealth Bank in Victoria will reduce staff and sell off the assets of the once proud State Bank. This is the Hawke-Kirner Government's program of social justice. There will be fewer jobs and lost opportunity for employment in all those State Bank branches right across Victoria. That will have direct effects on the opportunities for employment for each family, especially in the smaller towns and cities. </PARA>
<PARA> This better cities program is bereft of detail. One can only wonder why this $816m has been put aside. I hope that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is genuine in his apologies to this House for the enormous unemployment, the burden of which falls on areas such as Dandenong through to Wonthaggi and Phillip Island in my electorate, and the effect that that is having on families in every street, in every town and in every part of my community, considering the type of major industries we have. Has the Government, in its run up to the next election, actually allocated this $816m for pork-barrelling, as I have previously suggested?</PARA>

I hope that the Government will provide a rail line from Dandenong to Cranbourne. It would give people access to jobs-access which is currently unavailable. Some of those hidden unemployed would be able to register because they would have proper public transport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is the program really for inner city seats such as that of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), so that he can sell a few promises to the electorate of Hotham? Is it so that a few extra dollars can go to retaining the seat of the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding), once a Minister? Is it for Jagajaga, the seat of the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) and other marginal Labor seats?</PARA>
<PARA> Is this Government serious about provision for the future support of people in our community of Corinella? Would the Government really consider putting some of these funds into appropriate health care for our community? Our community health centre at Cranbourne has been asking for funds for ages. We need extra funds for aged care. We need transport services for an outer urban area. Certainly, we need that train service from Dandenong to Cranbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> There was nothing in this Budget about the family resource centres. Has the $1m to coordinate these services in these areas been forgotten? Will the Government supply that $1m? If it will, we need the services, not the coordination of services. I ask the Minister at the table to address that matter. That $1m could go straight to the people in my area who need it most. The Minister should ask Debbie Podbury at the Cranbourne Community Health Centre just how it could use that $1m. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to allocate the resources that have been dropping under the Labor Government for so long. The honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) talked about the window cleaner on the outside of the window who was unable to get in. That window cleaner has a wife and two children. Under the Government's policy and regime, let us call it, that man has shouldered the burden of taxation in this country for too long. The honourable member for Banks knows that. That is not social justice; the Government's social justice is a ragtag display of corrupt, inept activity. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last two months, nearly 100 so-called middle-class families in the Cranbourne area approached the local Salvation Army for food. Under this Government, middle-class families had to approach the Salvation Army for food. These people had never before had a claim on the public purse, yet they had to ask for food. They have lost their jobs; they are Australia's new poor. It was mentioned by the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) as recently as two days ago. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Government has no idea of the problems it has caused small business. The remoteness of this township of Canberra, the remoteness of those in control of the purse strings in Canberra and the deals that they do behind closed doors are now affecting small businesses right across my electorate of Corinella. </PARA>
<PARA> On page 12 of the Budget Speech the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) referred to the Government, the ACTU and the major employers, making it clear that all this Government is interested in is big government, big unions and big employers. I know of an earth-moving contractor who is doing only one-third of the work he was doing 12 months ago. He is desperately trying to keep his people employed. I know of a retailer whose figures are down by more than $900,000. Many of his staff are now doing part time work instead of full time work. They are not on the Government's unemployment list. No wonder the spectre of the unemployed haunts the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Those people who have jobs now fear that they may not keep them and that if they lose their jobs, they will not be able to get other jobs. Honourable members on the other side of the House know that to be true because they would have been getting the same letters that I have been getting. People are complaining that they are paying too much tax; that they have not got the right support facilities for their children; that there are problems for education, with the Victorian Government removing subsidies for children because it ran out of dough through mismanagement. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is making decisions behind closed doors that affect every manager of every small business and every medium sized organisation. I do not want to go into the detail of that because that can take a full half-hour speech. The Minister at the table has never earned a dollar in his life or employed anybody. He has never borrowed money and put it into a business. Most of the people on his side have never done that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Tuesday's Budget has focused much public attention on the issue of superannuation; the previous speaker, the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Broadbent), also canvassed this subject. The debate so far has centred-as did the previous member-on the impact of the new proposal for increased superannuation on employment, on the wages outcome and on general retirement issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is, however, another side of the Budget decision which has not attracted immediate interest, but which relates to a crucial change in the make up of the Australian paid work force, and that is the coverage of women workers by superannuation and the extent to which current superannuation schemes discriminate against such workers. </PARA>
<PARA> On 23 June, the recent amendment to the superannuation exemption contained in the Sex Discrimination Act was given royal assent. The new provision came at the end of a five-year process of inquiry and strident opposition from the superannuation industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Today I wish to canvass a brief history of the exemption of superannuation from the provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act and then detail where I believe further provisions are necessary in the light of the evidence given before the current inquiry of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs into the status of Australian women. </PARA>
<PARA> While applauding the Budget decision on superannuation for the impact it will have in ensuring that a large percentage of women currently without coverage will at last be provided with some retirement security, I also highlight the need to remove the indirect barriers which continue to inhibit access to superannuation by women. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, in striving for a national retirement policy, must now call on the insurance and superannuation industries to make available policies which recognise the work patterns of women and which have the same retirement options and financial security as those of men. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1983 the then Attorney-General, Senator Gareth Evans, tabled the Sex Discrimination Bill for the purposes of public comment and consultation. The Bill provided that superannuation schemes be exempted from the provisions of the Bill for two years. The Government received a large number of representations from the superannuation industry to the effect that the existing schemes would have great difficulty complying with the provisions of the Act. In response to these issues, the then Attorney-General replaced the two-year exemption with a blanket exemption. </PARA>
<PARA> In doing so, the Attorney-General advised the Senate on 20 October 1983 that the Government would not remove the exemption `until an inquiry into the problems raised by the life insurance and superannuation industry associations has been held and the industry's major concerns have been examined and where appropriate met'. The Attorney-General went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>At the same time the Government is signalling its intention in principle that the Sex Discrimination Act should and in due course will, cover superannuation schemes. </PARA>
<PARA>The inquiry which the Attorney-General referred to was undertaken by the then Human Rights Commission and presented to Parliament in November 1986. Amongst other things, the Commission recommended that the exemption be replaced so that superannuation schemes be made to comply with the anti-discrimination provisions of the SDA and that a transition period of three years be allowed for the industry to remove discriminatory arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The next relevant event was the March 1987 national wage case decision, which delivered the huge growth in superannuation in Australia by awarding the 3 per cent superannuation benefit in return for productivity gains. </PARA>
<PARA> Award-based superannuation, together with the significant growth of female employment, made superannuation an even more vital issue for Australian women. This was recognised by the Government's National Agenda for Women released in 1988. This document sets the agenda for action to improve the status of women to the year 2000. It spoke at some length about superannuation. The agenda stated that:</PARA>
<PARA>The security and independence of older women can be enhanced by the removal of discrimination in occupational superannuation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It declared this `a priority area for government action'. In the action plan for the next five years-that is, from 1988 to 1993-the Government committed itself to proceeding with legislation to remove the total exemption of superannuation funds and schemes from the Sex Discrimination Act and to replace it with far more limited exemptions. These changes announced in the action plan were to have a two-year transition period. They reflected the concerns of the superannuation industry. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not until May 1989 that the Commission's recommendations saw the light of day in a Bill before this House. It should be remembered that this was some six years after the provisions in the original Sex Discrimination Bill, which purported to give a two-year exemption to the superannuation industry. The May 1989 Bill was never debated and lapsed with the dissolution of the Parliament for the 1990 election. A second Bill was introduced in September 1990, but was withdrawn in favour of the current amendments, which were passed a few months ago. It took some five years after the report of the Human Rights Commission before there was some final action in getting these amendments through. </PARA>
<PARA> The new provision removes the blanket exemption which was in section 41 of the Sex Discrimination Act and replaces it with new section 41a, which provides for much more limited exemptions for particular practices within the superannuation industry. The effect is to make most forms of direct discrimination unlawful, while indirect discrimination in this important area remains exempted. I believe that there is a need to remove this exemption; the issue will be addressed by the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee's report on this area. </PARA>
<PARA> The evidence before the Committee is that indirect discrimination represents the major barrier facing Australian women. It is the `glass ceiling' of apparently gender neutral requirements that reflect institutional discrimination that limit opportunities for women. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of the facts regarding superannuation coverage in Australia. In 1986, 25 per cent of female workers were members of superannuation schemes, compared with 49 per cent of male workers. In 1986, only 4 per cent of part time workers were members of superannuation schemes. Women comprised 80 per cent of the part time work force. There has been a massive increase in the number of women covered by superannuation, however even now they remain much less likely than men to belong to superannuation schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> In every category of the Australian Bureau of Statistics survey data about sector, income, industry, occupation, hours worked and age, women workers have a lower rate of scheme membership than men. Women's coverage decreases after the mid-twenties and, on average, recovers after they turn 45 years. In contrast, the rate of superannuation for men increases with the age of the male labour force. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently, women's superannuation coverage has increased slightly, but the figures do not cover part time work, where most of the employment growth has occurred. The majority of part time workers still do not have access to employer sponsored schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes announced in the Budget, which require a compulsory levy, and the recent amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act, which enable employer sponsored schemes to be offered to part time employees, will bring about a significant change in the number of women who have superannuation coverage. Women who belong to superannuation schemes also have their problems, but a great number of women do not even belong to any scheme. The problems result from the broken pattern of women's time in the labour force. Often women workers will not initially claim a retirement benefit, for they will leave the work force after a period of five or six years, for example, when engaged in full time child care. Those women who do have a longer career path-and that, of course, is now the majority of Australian women-on retirement will still receive on average a smaller benefit than their male colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA> Women who currently do not belong to superannuation schemes remain uncovered for a wide variety of reasons. First, many women are not in the paid work force and are not eligible for superannuation. Second, as workers, women may not have been eligible to join superannuation schemes because some schemes directly discriminate against women-fortunately, that problem has now been tackled and is becoming more rare. Finally, women may remain uncovered by superannuation because they lack access to schemes due to the sex segregation of the work force. Many women typically work in a narrow range of jobs where there has been no employer sponsored superannuation. It is for this reason that the Treasurer's announcement of a compulsory levy is of vital importance to Australian women. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act, a great deal still needs to be done. This matter is of vital interest to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs inquiry. The Committee will be looking at a range of changes to the Act and at the way in which superannuation schemes operate, with the idea of recommending these changes to the Government. Hopefully the coverage of superannuation for Australian women will improve. The achievement of this is a vital social justice goal. The Government has already moved enormously along this path. Tuesday's Budget is another major step and I am confident that the Government will put in place policies which will improve the status of all Australian women. </PARA>

<TITLE>East Wanneroo: Urban Planning</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I bring to the attention of the House an issue of extreme importance to many people in my electorate. The State Government of Western Australia has identified a significant amount of land for rezoning in East Wanneroo, a hitherto rural and semirural locality on the fringes of metropolitan Perth, for urban usage as part of the north-west corridor structure plan. The responsibility for the implementation of the plan lies with the State Government's Department of Planning and Urban Development, which, with consultation from local government, will preside over one of the most significant urban development proposals that the State of Western Australia has seen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Concern over certain elements of the plan have been brought to my attention by a number of local residents. As a result, I conducted a survey of residents' attitudes about sections of the plan relevant to the area of East Wanneroo. </PARA>
<PARA> To its residents, East Wanneroo has always been a locality where the nature of the land itself provided the reason for their choice of residential or commercial location. East Wanneroo residents include market gardeners or those whose livelihood depends on their land, people who own hobby farms, and people who have opted for a semirural lifestyle that is not usually catered for in traditional urban environments. </PARA>
<PARA> As from December 1990, this land has been officially earmarked for urban development and the construction of a six-lane highway through a portion of the East Wanneroo region. Plans for development of the northern corridor are not new to the residents of north metropolitan Perth. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1977 a north-west corridor structure plan was drafted by the then Metropolitan Region Planning Authority, now known as the State Planning Commission. In 1987 these proposals were further refined and the product of these reviews-known as the Metroplan-was produced in December 1990. It was only in this final review and in the resulting December 1990 plan that proposals for the urbanisation of East Wanneroo were first officially produced to the public. </PARA>
<PARA> Under these plans, between one-third and one-half of the East Wanneroo area of approximately 150 square kilometres has been earmarked as physically suitable and may ultimately become available for urban development. This area is ultimately expected to accommodate a population of around 109,000 to 110,000, representing a 630 per cent increase on the 1990 population figure of just under 15,000, and a 25 per cent increase on the figure estimated for the year 2021. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the major implications of the plan for urbanisation in East Wanneroo, and due to an increasing amount of public concern over the lack of consultation on the part of the authorities involved in the plan, I initiated a survey to test public opinion about the possible effects of the Government's proposals on residents' businesses and their lifestyles. </PARA>
<PARA> The survey is by no means scientifically conclusive. However, it does give a broad picture of the discontent that many residents are feeling about the State Government's proposals for their area. The survey was sent to all households in the East Wanneroo area, and a record of comments from a large number of people has been collated for submission to the Department of Planning and Urban Development. </PARA>
<PARA> This survey is not the first of its kind. At least two other surveys directly relating to the urbanisation of East Wanneroo were conducted-one in 1988 by the Shire of Wanneroo and the other in 1990 by the then Western Australian College of Advanced Education. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in my survey the following has become apparent in the results. Ninety-six per cent of respondents to the latest survey were aware of the Government's plans for the rezoning of East Wanneroo under the north-west structure plan. Over 65 per cent of residents considered that the proposals directly affected their properties. Twenty-four per cent of the people on these properties were employed as a result of work undertaken on their land, many of these people being involved in primary production or associated industries. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most significant results of the survey was that a number of residents believed, when they purchased their properties, that the rural land in East Wanneroo would remain permanently zoned for rural or semirural purposes. Over 70 per cent of respondents thought that this was the case. This clearly shows a perceived lack of proper advice and consultation on the part of the authorities involved as a result of the decision to redefine land usage in East Wanneroo. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Planning, David Smith, and the State Government have gone ahead with little warning and little or no regard for the likely effects of the decision on people's lives and have told locals that their land is probably going to be developed for urban usage. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not the first sign of insensitivity to local community concerns on the part of the Planning Minister in Western Australia. The experience in relation to the Hepburn Heights case, which went on appeal before the High Court recently, clearly demonstrates the insensitivity shown by the Minister to the local residents' fight to protect a valuable piece of native bushland in their area. </PARA>
<PARA> Local residents in East Wanneroo have planned for the future. They have planned for their lifestyles. They have put their savings into these dreams and are now being told that their lifestyles will be changed and they feel helpless to do anything about these changes. We are talking about people's lives. Planning is not just about producing beautifully coloured maps. Planning involves people's homes, their lives, their work and their families. One can understand the very high level of emotion shown by many residents in the East Wanneroo area at the perceived lack of consultation on the part of the authorities. It seems that, although the Government has invited submissions from the community, many residents feel impotent or unable to readily affect the final decision-although I must say that it was encouraging to see that many respondents to my survey still hoped that their submissions to the State Government would make a difference to the results. </PARA>
<PARA> From our survey, we found that some people had still not been adequately informed of the consequences of the urbanisation plan even up to the last six months period in 1991. The survey also showed that in the last half year over 50 per cent of the respondents had actually made improvements or developed their property to some extent. These people had sunk hard-earned savings into their homes and their land that may well have been of little to no avail. Of this 50 per cent, over 55 per cent would not have carried out those improvements or undertaken development if they had been better informed of the Government's plans for urbanisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Over 70 per cent of respondents believed that it was possible to retain semi-rural areas amongst the urban sprawl. An overwhelming 72 per cent of the respondents did not support the construction of the proposed six-lane highway in the area and many suggested that the highway should be routed through nearby State Government forest land. </PARA>
<PARA> It is quite clear that the perception of the respondents was that the State and local governments had taken it upon themselves to implement very far-reaching changes to people's lifestyles without clear consultation throughout the process. As late as December 1990, local residents did not know that East Wanneroo was going to be urbanised. The Government has made a grave planning decision and, although the public have been invited to have their say, in all likelihood the development plans will still go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> Many locals, when originally purchasing their rural blocks of land, were informed that their land would be permanently zoned as rural or special rural and have acted on this belief to date, even though the Government's rezoning plans were made official last year. Local land that falls under the urbanisation proposal was being advertised as rural land as recently as six months ago. According to some respondents, there are still blocks of land being advertised as rural retreats even though the likelihood of a six-lane highway boring through their front garden is very real. </PARA>
<PARA> So as to add a little colour and give a clear picture of the major concerns being expressed in the responses, I quote from one of the many responses to the survey. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>The plans for the highway and urbanisation of East Wanneroo were made without consultation with the residents-that is, with no consideration being given to the people's business commitments, desires or aspirations for their own area. Market gardeners, horticulturalists, rural residents, special rural residents and suburban residents alike live here (in East Wanneroo) because of the unique rural environment and all that it offers . . . the bottom line is that the special rural residents have been sold a lie. We were informed that the area was planned to be ``long term rural'' . . . Families have invested heavily in this area upon the previous advice of authorities, and we expect that we should be able to carry out our commitments and enjoy our choice of lifestyle . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Strong responses such as this are evidence of the lack of community consultation and insensitivity to those concerns shown to the residents of East Wanneroo by the State Government in its planning proposal. Not only has the Government failed to forewarn adequately residents of the implications of the north-west corridor structure plan, but it appears to have shown no respect for those people's lives and their futures. </PARA>
<PARA> The $64,000 question in relation to any purchases or resumption of land in the area is whether the cash-strapped State Labor Government, having suffered the losses associated with WA Inc., will have the money to compensate those people when it comes to resuming or purchasing that land for urban development. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the next Federal election the people of Australia will be faced with a stark choice between the philosophies and policies of our conservative opponents and the well-proven policies of the Hawke Labor Government. Elections are always lotteries-for us personally, for the people of Australia and for the State. Yet at least in New South Wales the people will have a model to follow, for the New South Wales Greiner Government is implementing the policies that our conservative opponents would impose on all Australians. Nowhere are these policies more apparent than in the Illawarra region of New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Greiner Government, with great enthusiasm, has set out to slash and cut services in this region. Services such as health, education, welfare and transport are all being cut. Yet the Illawarra, of all regions in New South Wales, vitally needs these services. Yesterday in Wollongong thousands protested at the massive cuts in welfare and these protests will continue. </PARA>
<PARA> No region in New South Wales has been so targeted by the Greiner Government as the Illawarra region and no region has contributed more to the economy through the workers of the area in heavy industry. Yet this attack on the Illawarra did not start after the last New South Wales State election. It must be stated that the Greiner Government in New South Wales has been embarking on a policy of punishing the Illawarra from the day it was elected to power. Why, we might well ask, is the Illawarra being singled out? We are not such dreadful people, yet the Greiner Government is singling us out for punishment. I have thought long and hard about this and the only conclusion that I can come to is that, as the Illawarra has consistently returned Labor members, State and Federal, the Greiner Government has decided that the people of the Illawarra must be punished for this. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I might be paranoid but I live in the Illawarra. My family, friends and I suffer from what the Greiner Government is doing in punishing the Illawarra by cutting services. I would ask my friend and colleague the honourable member for Cowper to come to the Illawarra and contrast it with his electorate, a National Party electorate. I know that area, as he well knows. The Greiner Government is pork-barrelling there; it is pouring money into his area at the expense of areas such as the Illawarra where services are being cut and slashed all the way through.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Within days of being elected, in an act of unprecedented stupidity, the Greiner Government stopped work on the Maldon-Dombarton railway. This rail link would have enabled coal from the southern fields to be readily transported to Port Kembla instead of, as at present, having to trundle through the Sydney suburban network, then down the dangerous and overcrowded south coast line. I use the words `unprecedented stupidity' deliberately. This is something that the Opposition is going to do, too-stop public works such as the work on the Maldon-Dombarton railway and pay millions and millions of dollars in compensation to the contractors. The millions paid in compensation to the contractors would have almost completed that line. </PARA>
<PARA> What have we got with the Maldon-Dombarton line at the moment? We have a line one-quarter complete, a tunnel started and nothing else to show for it. Yet the money that the Greiner Government paid in compensation for stopping that work would have finished it and today we would have that whole Maldon-Dombarton line completed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Greiner Government also refuses to give priority listing to a replacement road for Macquarie Pass. Port Kembla, as is well known-and I do not think this is a matter of dispute-is one of Australia's major ports, yet its southern access down the Macquarie Pass is little better than a goat track, and a very dangerous goat track at that. Every time it rains a little there, the road is closed because of mud slips and the like. A site has been selected for a replacement road and this site is known as Caloola Pass. </PARA>
<PARA> I have had extensive discussions with the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) on the matter and he has made commitments to the Illawarra. He has admitted that the proposed road meets all the guidelines and has said that, provided it received a high priority listing from the New South Wales Government, it would be funded under the rural and provincial road system. Yet the Minister for Transport in New South Wales, Mr Murray, has consistently refused to give this road any listing at all. A road could be constructed there that would not cost the New South Wales Government one cent, yet in an act to punish the Illawarra it refused to give the road priority. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite recently I was somewhat staggered to learn that the Roads and Traffic Authority in New South Wales is no longer going to tender for work on road construction. A report in today's Sydney Morning Herald actually shows that the work force of the Authority can do the work on these roads much cheaper and much better than private contractors, but in the New South Wales Government's mad push to privatise everything, it has decided that it will no longer use that work force. So again the Illawarra is going to have suffer from that decision. The Bomaderry depot is going to lose something like 30 workers and the Bellambi depot will also lose a similar number of workers. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the outset of my speech, this model is one that our conservative opponents are going to implement throughout Australia. What the Greiner Government is doing in New South Wales is nothing compared to what the coalition plans to do. Two weeks ago in the Bulletin there was an eight-page article-they must have been a little bit short of copy-giving a run-down of the shadow Ministry. I remember seeing that the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), who is at the table, was featured in that article. I was a little surprised at how strongly and passionately he held some of his privatisation views. It was a frightening document. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, they all got a mention. It was a frightening document. I read it on the way back from the United Kingdom, where I was on a study mission. When reading that article, I felt a chill go over me because I had been in the United Kingdom looking at some of the results of Thatcherism. Believe me, what the Opposition is planning for privatisation and the like would make Thatcher appear to be a progressive, almost a socialist. In fact, I am going to use that document quite extensively from now until the next election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been speaking about what the Greiner Government has been doing in New South Wales and especially what he has been doing to the Illawarra. In the unlikely event that our conservative opponents ever gained the treasury bench, we would have the double whammy of Greinerism and the plans of our conservative opponents. It would be a very frightening thing. In view of the Opposition policies on privatisation and a consumption tax, the Australian people would never be so foolish as to even contemplate putting the conservative crowd opposite on the treasury bench of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this grievance debate I raise an issue on behalf of many of my constituents and, I am sure, on behalf of many of our fellow Australians. It is a matter of great concern regarding the Telecom 0055 sex and fantasy recorded services. In passing, I pay tribute to the work being done on this issue by my colleague the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have had calls from many outraged people, including the Reverend Roger Bush, who said he was absolutely disgusted that these sorts of services were available and were being taken advantage of by children, unwittingly in many cases but very often because they see the numbers advertised and their natural curiosity makes them call. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the 0055 services provided by Telecom are indeed excellent. I certainly support the service to that extent. I refer, for example, to 0055 numbers giving information on cancer, such as `Coping With Cancer', `Early Warning Signs', `Skin Cancer', `Treatment For Cancer'-the list goes on. We can make complaints. We can call for information on choking; condoms and safe sex, which is part of the AIDS program-I am in favour of that; contraception; food poisoning and so on. These are worthwhile and valuable services. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, one does not find recorded 0055 adult messages on sex and fantasy in the phone book. I am pleased that that is the case. But in the Truth on Saturday 17 August people were invited to ring the following: `Susie Tells All', `Hot Housewives', `Adult Contacts Kinky', `Hot Nurses' or `Sex Smorgasbord'. I certainly do not propose to take an hysterical approach to this. I understand that adults may want such messages, but I am concerned about the youth and children of Australia. Again in today's Canberra Times there are advertisements for adult services such as `Banned XXX', `Hot Housewife', `Night Nurse', `Don't Ring Mel'-whoever Mel is-`Uncensored' and so it goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday and today I actually called one or two of these numbers, because I believed that while I had the obligation to speak out on behalf of my constituents, I could not do this from a point of view of ignorance; it is not my practice to speak about something that I have not encountered. So I called `Hot Nurses', `Hot Housewife' and `Banned XXX' and I found these recorded messages to be totally boring. Quite frankly, I cannot believe that any intelligent adult would waste the time or the money to listen extensively to this load of garbage. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, I am not advocating an hysterical reaction to these messages, but I believe that there is a certain bias in the way these recorded messages are scripted and in their delivery that is designed deliberately to appeal to children and to juveniles. Adults do not need that degree of protection, but the complaints that I have been receiving have been with regard to access by children, even quite young kids. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, my concern is with children, with the youth of Australia, and I believe, having listened to several minutes of this garbage, that the providers of this immorality are deliberately seeking to titillate our innocent youth and take the money off their parents' and grandparents' phone bills. Many instances of this have been reported. I think that Australian youth are being exploited and that the youthful curiosity of our kids is being taken advantage of. </PARA>
<PARA> The final report of the review into Telecom's 0055 message content and advertising standards conducted by Janet Strickland and Associates on October 1990 states:</PARA>
<PARA>Most children, from quite a young age, are familiar with and often fascinated by, the simple operation of the telephone in the home. It is therefore not only quite possible, but highly likely, that children can and do have access to a range of 0055 telephone messages which might be regarded by many to be, at best, ``unsuitable'', and at worst, actually harmful. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not just a question of being possible or highly likely-it is fact. This is happening, and there are reports coming in all the time. Having listened to some of these, and having been bored to death, I believe that they are deliberately written and designed for juveniles. Of course, the question has to be asked: who profits? The basic answer is that, of the revenue, 60 per cent goes to the service providers and 40 per cent to Telecom, where it is absorbed in its general revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to say that Telecom applies some standards, and already six services have been disconnected for breaches of the operational requirements. These include `Uncle Bouncy' by Informatel, `When It Feels Hard' by Omnicall, `Electric Blue' by IDS and `Pin-Up Competition' by Intelcom. But who are these providers? Who are these companies? Informatel Pty Ltd of 187 Johnston Street, Fitzroy, Victoria, has a contact name of Mr Eric Butt. Mr David Hayes is the contact for Information Dialling Services Pty Ltd of 88 Bourke Road, Alexandria. Mr Sam Galea is the contact for Intelcom Pty Ltd of GPO Box 4088, Sydney. Ms Sheryl Irving is the contact for Omnicall Inc., of Suite 2, 9th floor, 15 Collins Street, Melbourne, Victoria. That is basic information on who provides the services and who the contacts are. But the important question is: who owns these providers, who are the shareholders, and who is really getting the profits out of this possible potential corruption of our youth?</PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that a Senate committee is investigating this matter. I look forward, with a great deal of anticipation, to its report. I hope that that committee pursues in some detail and follows up the question of ownership of these services. </PARA>
<PARA> The review by Janet Strickland and Associates, referred to previously, makes the point that in June 1990 the United States Federal Communications Commission introduced legislation to make it an offence to `knowingly make available indecent communications by telephone for commercial purposes to persons under 18 years of age or to adults without their consent'. This was in response to the rapid growth of telephone information services in the United States of America including `Dial-a-Porn'. Now such services in the United States of America can be provided only by request. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that in Australia adult telephone information services be opt-in rather than opt-out services. If one wishes-and, I suppose, for a fee-one can say to Telecom, `I want to opt-out', and Telecom will put a bar on one's phone so that it cannot access 0055 numbers. But of course, that also means one cannot access the decent information services, the good ones. So perhaps the option should be the other way around. Adult messages should have a number different from ordinary 0055 numbers. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as I am concerned, the decent people of Australia must make themselves heard on this important issue. It is a time when concerned people should stand up and be counted. Copies of a petition on this matter are available from my office and from the offices of many of my colleagues. I say to the people of Australia: please join me in fighting this depraved attempt to corrupt our children. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Sunday was Vietnam Veterans' Remembrance Day. As the patron of the Central Coast and Hunter Valley sub-branch of the Vietnam Veterans' Association, I had the honour to be asked to attend a Vietnam Veterans' Remembrance Day wreath laying ceremony in Gosford. I was also pleased to note that my colleague the honourable member for Robertson, the Hon. Frank Walker, QC, was also in attendance, as were the State members for Gosford, Peats and The Entrance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It certainly was very moving to hear addresses at that ceremony by two young students from Berkeley Vale Community High School within my electorate. The many hundreds of local residents who attended that ceremony will congratulate the two students who gave very moving addresses to everyone present. The president of the Central Coast and Hunter Valley sub-branch of the Vietnam Veterans' Association, Mr Gordon Reeds, and all of his executive should be commended for organising another very successful remembrance service for the veterans and families who were affected by the Vietnam War. </PARA>
<PARA> In the very near future a group of students from St Marys Primary School at Toukley in my electorate will be entering the gallery to listen to the debate which will take place this afternoon. Recently I was subjected to a very intense interrogation from year 5 and year 6 students from St Marys. They were asking me questions on how the Federal Government works, and I am sure that their visit today will ensure that they get a better appreciation of what happens in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish now to send a cheerio call to one person who is not in the gallery: the Hon. Neil Pickard. I understand that Mr Pickard is not in the gallery because he is somewhere in the United States, possibly Washington, on his way to take up the position of Agent-General for New South Wales in London. The reason I send Mr Pickard a cheerio call is that I think he contributed greatly to the Labor Party's perhaps surprising success at the recent New South Wales elections. Why is that so? Mr Neil Pickard was the best example of the hypocrisy of the Greiner-Murray Government. Before the 1988 election, Nick Greiner, Leader of the Liberal Party, promised that under his Government there would be no jobs for the boys; under him people who are members of the Liberal Party or the National Party would not be rewarded with highly paid jobs simply because they were members of those parties. What happened during the redistribution after that election when Mr Greiner was elected Premier and had control of the Government? Unfortunately, Mr Pickard's seat was abolished. Mr Pickard would then have had to contest preselection against Mr Greiner. To solve Mr Greiner's preselection problems, the Government of New South Wales decided to appoint Mr Neil Pickard as the next New South Wales Agent-General in London, breaking all the promises which the Liberal Party had made that it would not appoint people to these jobs unless they were qualified. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people might ask, `Is Mr Pickard not qualified to fill such a job as this?'. We might examine Mr Pickard's record as a Minister of the Crown. I suppose he was most famous for his promise, his guarantee, to the people of the Illawarra that the Tallawarra power station would not close down. Within two weeks the Tallawarra power station was closed down on the decision of that Government and that Minister. It got a fair bit of media attention because Mr Pickard refused to speak to the press at that time and he went from success to success with various increases in taxes and charges in his area. Nevertheless, I am sure that Mr Pickard will do the best job that he is able to in London. The difficulties he will encounter in London, of course, will be ameliorated by the very high salary which is paid to the New South Wales Agent-General in London and the fact that he receives a luxury apartment and, of course, a chauffeur driven car to make sure that he is able to attend all of the important meetings that someone in that position must attend. </PARA>
<PARA> The appointment of Mr Pickard to that position went a long way to help the New South Wales Labor Party come within one seat of winning government. The one seat which made the difference was the seat of The Entrance, which is in my own Federal division. In that seat of The Entrance, the Labor Party lost by a small number of votes, and those of us on this side of the House are very confident that before too much longer there will be a by-election in the seat of The Entrance. If that by-election takes place, that will be the first time any voters anywhere in Australia will have a chance to pass judgment on the Liberal Party's consumption tax, because the New South Wales Liberal Party has now endorsed John Hewson's consumption tax; the Liberals have now said they are right behind it.

<PARA> Thankfully the Stalinist surge by elements of the Red Army and KGB has been short lived and the will of the Soviet people has prevailed. The honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) earlier in this place paid tribute to Boris Yeltsin. I hope that the House and the nation will join me in paying tribute to Russian President Boris Yeltsin and his followers. Without their persistence and unassailable commitment to democracy, the re-emergence of an ideological Cold War would have been a distinct possibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The Soviet Union's best hopes for the future lie in continuing the process of democratisation, enhancing political autonomy in the republics and the Baltic States, decentralising economic control and opening itself up to the gamut of international enterprise. We hope that with President Gorbachev's return to Moscow he is once again allowed to get back quickly to these important tasks. Clearly, the abortive coup must leave the Soviet hardliners with one irrefutable message: the communist state of an elite is as dead as Stalin's bones. </PARA>

The foundation has been providing Melbourne's homeless children with health care, accommodation, counselling, legal advice and employment for 15 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The foundation is headed by Father Bob Maguire, who was awarded the Order of Australia for his work. The foundation needs $300,000 to keep its doors open and has warned staff they could be sacked by the end of the month if the necessary funds are not found. More than 200 volunteers work at the foundation and they support more than 1,000 young people and their families. They are calling on this Government and the corporate sector to help finance this service. In these harsh economic times, and when the Government has ignored the plight of the homeless in the Budget, and did not even mention youth unemployment, the closure of this service would be a tremendous loss to the entire community. Not only will this put more pressure on those welfare and support agencies still in operation, but it is generally agreed that if this service is forced to shut down, children on the streets will have no one to turn to for help and crime will rise as the result. </PARA>

For that reason, we have embarked on a reform program that is going to reform the entire tax structure. </PARA>

It has been proposed that the Secondary Education Authority reduce the number of markers from two to one, thereby vastly increasing the potential for error in relation to year 12. I am sure that all people would understand that year 12 is very important in terms of the careers of young people. The Authority has advised me that it intends to keep two markers on for essays. I am, however, concerned about what will happen to short answers and I am concerned about marking generally. I understand the Authority's cost pressures. I understand the difficulty it has in terms of managing its own budget. But it would be a very false economy to reduce the number of markers of subjects in year 12, a very important year for students, so that neither the parents nor the children could be certain that their results were going to be assessed thoroughly and accurately.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that moves are finally being made to recognise the critical contribution of Aboriginal stock workers to the cattle industry in the great north-west of Queensland. The Stockman's Hall of Fame Chief Executive, Roger Steele, is touring the north-west seeking out Aboriginal stockmen and stockwomen for inclusion in a book about the contribution of Aboriginal stock people to the development of northern Australia. For many Aboriginal people who were driven from their land because squatters used waterholes for cattle, the only way to survive was to become virtual slave labour for the early white station owners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For decades, Aboriginal stockmen and stockwomen drove cattle thousands of kilometres around the north-west. Payment was generally in kind-rations for the workers and his or her family. It was only in the 1960s that Aboriginal stock workers were granted the right to equal pay for equal work. I am especially pleased to see that Mr Tommy Seville, who worked for decades at Rockland Station on the Barkly Tablelands near Camooweal, was voted at a public meeting in Mount Isa this week to be the first candidate for inclusion in the book. Tommy is now retired and living in Mount Isa. He is only one of thousands of Aboriginal stock workers who, until now, have gone unrecognised for their contribution to the northern Australian cattle industry. I hope that Tommy is included in the book so that his life story will read as a lesson to us about just how indebted we are to Aboriginal stock workers in the great north west of Queensland. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this Budget week, it has been very interesting to note, as I did on my television monitor, the comments of the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). He was somewhat critical of honourable members opposite, particularly some of my colleagues from the front bench who were featured in the last issue of the Bulletin and were advocating much of the responsible privatisation that characterises the coalition parties. I was therefore pleased when, as the member for Wakefield, I visited the Nuriootpa Post Office in the Barossa Valley in my electorate and there found a taste of privatisation and commercialisation at work within posting enterprises. Nuriootpa is the only post office in country Australia where the post office has gone about some form of self-service of postal facilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one goes into Nuriootpa Post Office, instead of meeting what is normally the staid post office atmosphere, one will see a self-service environment with stamps, ready packaged, lined up on hooks, with Postpak cylinders available to anyone who comes in, in order to allow the post office to be commercialised. I indicate to you, Mr Speaker, and to the House that this exercise in commercialisation of Australia Post at Nuriootpa in the Barossa Valley has been a resounding success and that as a result of it, post office turnover at that place in my electorate has gone up three times.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I report on a letter that I have received from a country storekeeper from Candelo about the effect of the consumption tax. In a city supermarket, a washing powder could be $2.07. In a country convenience store, it would be $3.22. The difference between the total tax paid by a regular shopper at a city supermarket and a regular shopper at a country convenience store could be as high as 55 per cent. This is hardly equitable. While the goods and services tax may work in geographically small countries, such as New Zealand and the United Kingdom where the cost of transport is less significant, the implications for country Australia are obvious. It is strange that the National Party members have not picked it up.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that I speak not only for the Government but also for the House and the whole Australian nation when I express our delight and profound relief at the defeat of the coup in Moscow. I would not say that we are surprised. From the start of the crisis on Monday we believed that there was a strong likelihood that the coup would fail. But we are delighted that the crisis has been resolved so quickly and so decisively, with the restoration of the legitimate government of the Soviet Union and the reinstatement of its President, Mr Gorbachev. We certainly are relieved that this has been achieved more peacefully than we dared to expect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are delighted and enormously heartened that the defeat of the coup has preserved the processes of political and economic reform and the spirit of international cooperation that has been created under President Gorbachev. Indeed, the defeat of the coup has not only removed a major and immediate threat to those processes but also discredited the conservative opposition to them. We believe it will now open the way to even stronger progress towards the development of democratic institutions and a free and efficient economy in the Soviet Union.</PARA>
<PARA> As ONA said in its assessment for me this morning, the failure of the coup will ensure the success of everything the plotters were trying to prevent. The defeat of the conservative coup shows that President Gorbachev's reforms have already fundamentally changed the Soviet Union. It shows that the commitment of the Soviet people to political liberty and democratic institutions has been deeply entrenched. Their commitment forms the foundations of a new society which are already too strong to be swept away.</PARA>
<PARA> This is a victory for the people of the Soviet Union and we pay tribute to them for their courage and commitment. We also pay tribute to their leaders, particularly to the President of Russia, Boris Yeltsin. I believe that he and his followers have earned a place in not just the history of their own country but the history of democracy. Fittingly, the people of the Soviet Union will be the principal beneficiaries of their victory through the process of political and economic reform. In particular, I mention the process of building new relationships between the centre and the republics. It was the imminent signature of a new union treaty which apparently prompted the coup and we would hope that that process can quickly be resumed.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we are particularly concerned about the situation with the Baltic states, whose clear demands for independence must be addressed. The international community has also made a contribution to this victory. This week the world has shown again, as it did in August last year and in the anxious months that followed, that we are a community of nations which shares values and principles, and that we can stand together to protect the things that we share.</PARA>
<PARA> This week we have been reminded that one vital way in which the world community can contribute is through the international free media. They played a crucial role in this crisis and are to be congratulated. In particular, our own Australian Broadcasting Corporation, whose coverage from its Moscow bureau has been outstanding, is to be congratulated.</PARA>
<PARA> The international community will benefit enormously from the preservation of President Gorbachev's achievements and the promise that those achievements can be built upon to strengthen international cooperation even further. With the defeat of the coup, this morning I have given directions to cancel all measures we took to put on hold cooperation with the Soviet Government.</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I say on behalf of the Government-and I know with the support of the Opposition-that we rejoice at the restoration of President Gorbachev and at the promise which that victory holds for the future of reform in the Soviet Union and further international cooperation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me make it clear to all members of this House and to all Australians that the introduction of universal superannuation will be recognised as one of the great reforms of this Government. It is a process which has been advanced by this Government through the life of this Government. It is fairly and squarely aimed at guaranteeing the quality of life of those Australians who will retire in increasing numbers in the future. In short, this initiative is fundamental to securing financial reserves for retirement in the future. The Government, employers and the ACTU all recognise that improvements in superannuation will be taken into account in future wage negotiations. That is why it is impossible to assume that increases in superannuation will be added to the wage costs of employers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind honourable members that in 1986 increases in superannuation were taken instead of a general wage increase. Let me spell it out for those people who are struggling on this subject. A general wage increase was directly traded off for an increase in superannuation. Through the accord, the Government and the ACTU continually delivered on the aggregate wage outcome. The relationship that has delivered these outcomes is as strong as ever. The Government and the ACTU understand that this country has to reap the benefits of low inflation. Equally, the Government and the ACTU understand that employment has to increase. Therefore, increases in total wages will be sensitive to these fundamental requirements.</PARA>
<PARA> Australians have to understand what is driving the Opposition on this issue. It is ideology at its worst; it is ideology at its most vicious. The Opposition believes that market failure never exists and that the choices made by individuals on savings through time obviate the need for universal superannuation. The basic bankruptcy of the Opposition's position is revealed more fully by Senator Alston, who reckons that Australians do not need superannuation for their retirement. Instead he believes:</PARA>
<PARA>Low income earners would be much better off paying off their mortgages and their credit debts than being forced to pay another three per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps Senator Alston believes that all Australians should buy a second house as well. Presumably, Australians would then be doubly secure in their retirement. It is pathetic. In their hearts the Liberals believe that property speculation is a safe, sensible and viable way to secure the retirement incomes of aged Australians. It is pathetic, but I guess it is only to be expected.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government rejects that philosophy, the ideology and the bankruptcy of the Opposition. We remain committed to universal superannuation, and we are committed because it is an essential reform. I will say this: the response of the Opposition on this issue shows honourable members opposite to be exactly what they are, a cross between the Dodgy brothers and Sid Vicious.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services in relation to the general practice reform package announced in the Budget. I ask: when the Medicare benefit is further reduced on 1 November 1992 to make the total reduction $5 instead of the $3.50 as from November 1991, will doctors still only be able to charge patients up to $3.50? If so, what will be the impact on bulk billing?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="363" SPEAKER="Howe The Hon B.L." NAMEID="EH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BATMAN" MINISTERIAL="DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER; HEALTH, HOUSING AND COMMUNITY SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The general practitioner reform package announced in the Budget had three major interdependent elements: a reduction in the Medicare rebate; proposals to hold discussions with the medical profession on restructuring benefit arrangements to enable major reform of general practice; and provision of a more comprehensive safety net and exemptions for low income earners and card holders. In relation to the rebate, the Medicare rebate for general practice attendances provided to non-concession card holders will be reduced by $3.50 from 1 November this year, with a further reduction by $1.50 to $5 from 1 November 1992. When doctors bulk bill for those services where the benefit has been reduced, they will be permitted to charge a co-payment of up to $3.50. The maximum co-payment permitted will be $3.50.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am aware of reports which say that this charge will discourage bulk billing and encourage doctors to lift their fees. I must stress that the Government does not control or determine doctors' charges or whether they bulk bill or raise an account to the patient. These things are determined by the competitive forces of the marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA> The national health strategy background paper No. 5 on the effect of co-payments on medical care clearly demonstrates that the major reason why doctors bulk bill is the competitive pressure on them to do so. Doctors who bulk bill do so now because they know it is attractive to patients and they wish to maintain a viable practice. There is no reason to believe doctors will change these practices under the new arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the supply of general practitioners is currently growing at 5 per cent per annum. This will guarantee that competitive forces on general practice will remain strong and, indeed, will increase if the Government does not act to address the supply side. In discussions with the profession the Government is prepared to address the supply side but will agree to nothing which puts at risk patient access to health care at a minimum cost. So while bulkbilling decisions are for individual doctors, I am confident that Medicare will continue to operate to ensure very high rates of bulkbilling. Furthermore, it is for these very same reasons that I believe that many doctors will choose not to charge the $3.50 co-payment when they bulkbill.</PARA>
<PARA> In closing, I reiterate there will be no change to Medicare arrangements for pensioners and card holders. Where card holders are direct billed for out-of-hospital general practitioner services they will continue to receive such treatment without cost. A card holder will be required to make a payment only in the same circumstances as currently apply, that is, where the general practitioner chooses not to direct bill and an amount above the 85 per cent Medicare benefit level is charged. By way of conclusion, may I say that pensioners who are concerned about the changes can ring a special pensioner health hotline on 008 020613.</PARA>
<PARA> The changes that have been announced follow a clear policy, and the Government is more than happy to work through the issues with the representatives of the professions. Indeed, it is important that people understand the principal purpose of what the Government is about-the improvement to general practice to the benefit of patients.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="364" SPEAKER="Baldwin The Hon P.J." NAMEID="MD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SYDNEY" MINISTERIAL="HIGHER EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday I described the measures that we were implementing which will impact on the higher education system. I did not go into any detail on student income support measures, which are very significant. The measures will produce a better targeted system, one that is simpler and more flexible, and we will remove a number of longstanding anomalies. The measures have been warmly welcomed by student organisations. They represent the first stage of a two part review of the structure of Austudy that the Government is undertaking. The second part is being done at the moment in the form of a consultant having a look at some of the more fundamental issues to do with the structure of student income support. We hope to have the material on that as an input into next year's considerations in the Budget context.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Specific measures include a 25 per cent increase in the level of personal income to apply from 1 January next year for Austudy, the personal income test; introduction of a dependant child concession under the spouse income test; access to the $30 a week education supplement to sole parent pensioners undertaking part time study; better availability of Austudy to people with overseas qualifications not recognised in Australia; special concessions to allow people to undertake a degree course after doing an associate diploma; simplification of Austudy to assist students who transfer between courses or who are unable to complete their studies in the minimum time; the extension of Austudy to accredited private providers of TAFE equivalent courses; simplification and better targeting of assistance for families with children over 16; and, lastly, the introduction of a hardship provision so the assets test will not apply if a student's parent or spouse is receiving social security or veterans' pensions or benefit or household assistance under part C of the rural adjustment scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> In total, those measures amount to a very significant and very well regarded improvement in the structure of the scheme. When I briefed the student constituency on that, quite frankly the response was one of incredulity that we could get up such a comprehensive package in the context of what was going to be a pretty stringent Budget.</PARA>
<PARA> What has been the Opposition's response to all this? The only comment so far from the honourable member for Goldstein relates to the hardship provisions, which he has characterised as being too little, too late. I refer honourable members to the Senate debate on a motion on a hardship provision that took place several weeks ago. In speaking to this motion Senator Teague referred to the hardship provisions applying under the social security legislation and stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition's amendment in respect of educational allowances calls on the Government to immediately implement a parallel set of hardship provisions.</PARA>
<PARA>Not only have we done this, but we are also extending assistance to an additional category of families, that is, those who are recipients of assistance under part C of the rural adjustment scheme. In other words, those opposite are attacking us for doing too little, too late. In fact, we are doing what they called on us to do, plus a significant amount extra. That illustrates the bankruptcy of their position.</PARA>
<PARA> What is more, they have had absolutely nothing to say about the broader issues to do with student income support. They have nothing on the record on that. We do not know what their position is. In so far as there has been any view expressed from the Opposition, the honourable member for La Trobe has made some running. He has called for things such as the complete abolition of all income support for secondary students and the conversion of remaining payments to loans repayable regardless of capacity. In other words, the only Opposition member who has had anything to say is calling for changes that would massively degrade the equity of that scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> All this, when considered together with the Opposition's commitment to further major spending cuts, means that students have obviously got a great deal to fear from the prospect of the honourable member for Goldstein becoming Minister for education. In fact, like Count Yorga, the character of B grade movie infamy, he will have his fangs into student finances. It is very easy to imagine this character running around at night with a cape and a cap.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Based on this assessment, recommendations were made concerning environmental requirements to apply to the airport development at Badgerys Creek.

The conceptual design report released on 20 August represents the first phase of the design process for the staged development of Badgerys Creek. It was prepared in response to the Government's March 1989 strategy for meeting the future airport needs of Sydney. The strategy includes the construction of the third runway at Sydney and the staged development of these facilities at Badgerys Creek.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is relevant to note that the concept design report states that in preparing the concept design particular attention has been given to ensuring that the planning parameters were consistent with the environmental assessment of the second Sydney Airport site selection program.

<PARA> With respect to the proposal contained in the Badgerys Creek concept design report, this proposal has not been referred for consideration under the Act.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question and for his obvious concern about this issue. It is too early to judge how this fire started and what could have been done to prevent its occurrence. The heart of the issue is not merely the cause of the fire but the presence of such a large amount of chemicals so close to a residential area. I understand that my colleagues, particularly the honourable member for Melbourne, Gerry Hand, and the honourable member for Gellibrand, have already made representations about the siting of this chemical installation and have had considerable discussions with their constituents in relation to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Victorian Government has been aware of the problem and is now taking steps to have the storage areas moved to remote parts of the bay. In the light of this fire, it is hoped that all governments will look at the adequacy of chemical storage facilities in their States.</PARA>
<PARA> The second important issue is the question of land use and the most appropriate locations for chemical storage sites. However, I do not believe that this issue can just be left to the States. The Federal Government has a role to play in identifying where potentially dangerous chemicals are stored and in developing strategies with State and local governments to reduce the risks they pose to the environment and human health and safety. This is one of the functions of the new Commonwealth Environmental Protection Agency, which has been funded in this Budget.</PARA>
<PARA> One of its key roles-and a very early role-will be to develop a national public register recording both the location of dangerous chemicals and emissions which are occurring. In developing this register we will be paying particular attention to the toxic inventory register maintained by the United States EPA. The information which this register will contain is basic to the development of long term strategies which remove the potential for this sort of disaster. Some States already collect this type of information, but it is not done by all States, and it should be.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has also considerable expertise on land use planning which can be brought to bear in the development of appropriate strategies. The Commonwealth Environmental Protection Agency will be maintaining a very significant focus on the quality of the urban environment. In close consultation with the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services, Brian Howe, and his better city strategy, we will be developing a capacity to advise and assist the States on these land use strategies.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Grey for his question. I acknowledge the concern that he has for the role of the workshops, particularly the workshops at Port Augusta, and the railway workers that he represents in the context of the formation of the National Rail Corporation. I appreciate the care with which he chose those terms. He said that this is a historic decision. It certainly is. I appreciate the extent to which the Prime Minister and the Premiers were able to endorse the initiatives that were being taken. They finally signed the shareholders agreement to ensure that the National Rail Corporation, which is taking over the management of interstate freight on the rail system across Australia, would be pursued and would eventuate, something that should have been done over 100 years ago. It has now been done. We said that it would be done this year. It will be done this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member also asked about the processes which will be undertaken. Firstly, we need to get the board of directors together. It will be a nine-person board. There will be two Commonwealth nominees to the board. As the honourable member knows, one of those nominees will be the chairman. New South Wales and Victoria will also have two nominees-one from the ACTU, nominated by it but appointed by the Commonwealth, and one from Western Australia. The chief executive officer will be a member of the board as well. As soon as that is completed-it should take a matter of days-it will be possible for us to incorporate. We only need the appointment of three directors in order to undertake that exercise.</PARA>
<PARA> Once the board is in place, it will then have the responsibility of selecting and appointing a chief executive officer-it has already advertised under the provisions of the task force arrangement-and getting a management team together. Before the end of this year, the board will also put in place the arrangements for its corporate plan and will start to put together the necessary investment package that will be involved in a total investment over a 10-year period, something like $1.7 billion. All of that is in the process of being pursued. I appreciate the commitment that was brought to that whole process by the Prime Minister and his colleagues in the Special Premiers Conference to ensure that we could achieve it.</PARA>
<PARA> The first three-year period has been referred to as the transition period. By the end of that time we expect to have been able to achieve two things: firstly, the Corporation will be breaking even; that is, the revenue that it achieves each year will be sufficient to cover the operating costs. At that time it will not be self-supporting to the extent that it will be able to finance its own investment program, but it will be breaking even. In addition, it will have assumed all of the necessary assets it needs for its operation and will have taken over, we hope, all of the services that it needs to pursue in order to fulfil its responsibilities satisfactorily.</PARA>
<PARA> At the end of the five-year period the National Rail Corporation will be self-supporting and will be able to finance its own investment program. We expect that by early next year it will be able to start marketing the sale of interstate rail freight. It will be responsible as well, and will have taken the responsibility, for the management of the terminals. It will then be well on the way to establishing itself in the role that it is required to undertake. At the beginning of next year it will also be in a position to collect the revenue, which is important to the financial basis of the operation and to its financial success.</PARA>
<PARA> I understand the importance of employment and the honourable member's concern, particularly in relation to the employment levels at Port Augusta. It is something that he has pursued with me diligently and frequently. I understand the concern that he and his constituents have on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA> The total number of people employed in the present interstate rail freight operation is about 10,500. It is expected that there could be redundancies. The last report by the national freight initiative in 1989 indicated that the number of redundancies involved in establishing the National Rail Corporation in those services could be about 3,500 out of 10,500 at present. Most of the 3,500 are people within the railway industry who have already been factored into the restructuring plans of each of the State systems. So the number of additional people who will become unemployed or redundant as a result of this particular initiative should be very low.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Why did the Government decide to fund a better cities plan, which the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance both regarded as too vague and lacking a clear policy basis, and as a result had to increase medicare fees? Why did the Prime Minister offer this sop to the Deputy Prime Minister against the wishes of the economic Ministers? Was it simply a desperate attempt to forestall the coming leadership challenge by the honourable member for Blaxland?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The decision to have a better cities program stands in its own right. If one believes that the Government does not have the responsibility to tackle the problem of our cities and their development, one is living in cloud cuckoo land. It is estimated that in the next decade there will be demand for about another 1.2 million housing units, and some 700,000 of those will be in the major metropolitan areas. Of course the average cost of providing the sorts of blocks that have become the conventional expectation is said to be of the order of $70,000. It can easily be seen, when one understands those fundamental statistics, that if a government today were to say, `We are not going to worry about what the implications of those statistics are for the future', it would not be discharging its duty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government's commitment-and it has been long stated-to tackle the problems of our cities has nothing whatsoever to do with the issues that the honourable member for Mayo in his perfervid imagination would seek to inject as some basis for the decision making of this Government.

<PARA> As far as this side of the House is concerned, we recognise that in this country an overwhelming proportion of the population lives in the large metropolises. There is an obligation upon the Government, in cooperation with State governments, to plan for the future to ensure that we get better collocation between residents, recreation, employment and transport. The States cannot do this alone; we cannot do it alone: the better cities program is about getting the three levels of government together to ensure there shall be a better quality of life for the citizens of this country.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Stirling for his question. I would have said that, whatever might be said for devotees of classical music, the ABC more than makes up for any peccadilloes in that area by what it provides on JJJ. It is the torment of my life. I think the honourable member said that tongue in cheek.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am getting a bit tired of the campaign regarding ABC funding and the suggestion that changes in programming are in some way related to policies pursued by the Government cutting ABC funds. I think a reasonable argument can be sustained that the maintenance of triennial funding over the past three years-albeit with the imposition of an efficiency dividend-was nevertheless maintenance of real funding, assuming that efficiencies were taken in accordance with the efficiency dividend.</PARA>
<PARA> So I would not concede that the Federal Government had been cutting the funds of the ABC to this point. Whatever those opposite might think, whatever argument they want to sustain about the position of the Federal Government to this point, they certainly cannot sustain it from the decisions taken by the Federal Government in this Budget for the next triennium. The ABC, like one or two other government agencies, has been exempted from the efficiency dividend. It is not intended forever to continue to apply efficiency dividends. We could assume that we would get to a point 50 or 60 years down the line where we are scarcely doing a darned thing at all, or doing a great deal but doing it effectively for free.</PARA>
<PARA> There does come a time, given that the ABC funding covers things such as orchestras, where the efficiency dividend means dropping a bassoon or a violin or whatever or, as the Treasurer suggested in the course of the debate in the Cabinet, perhaps playing faster. The Government believed that the point of imposition of efficiency dividends on the ABC ought to be brought to an end.</PARA>
<PARA> The ABC has provided over the last few years some very innovative programming. Over the last 10 years it has taken seriously-more seriously than at any point in its history-its responsibility to encourage the production of Australian programming. The complaints that used to be directed towards the ABC that it was BBC South I do not think can any longer be legitimately applied to it. It does very well indeed now. I must say that the ABC will probably live for a long time on the kind remarks made by the Prime Minister this afternoon on its excellent coverage of the situation in the Soviet Union. So criticism of the ABC in regard to its attitude to government funding is not meant to imply a criticism of the organisation and the things it does.</PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that for very good internal reasons the ABC has undertaken for a year or two now a new process for determining how its programs should be funded. It has extended responsibility more and more to the producers to marshall their assets in a manner which means that there is a real costing of the programs they produce. I think in such circumstances, where the production of a particular program requires weekend work outside broadcasts, they are likely to find themselves very much at a disadvantage in internal arguments in the ABC over where funds should be allocated.</PARA>
<PARA> Without being absolutely certain of it, I would suspect that there is at least something in that process that has produced the situation where the ABC is cutting sporting programs. It is a matter of some regret. We do not direct the ABC in what it ought to do and we do not seek to do so. But it did take from SBS the broadcast of soccer, for example, and signed up for a specific time on that. It is a matter of some regret that the ABC apparently finds itself incapable of pursuing that. I think its sporting coverage is highly valued in the community and those who are responsible for ABC programming ought to bear that in mind as they impose their discipline on those who produce those sporting programs.</PARA>
<PARA> What ought to be clear is this: however laudable-or not laudable-the way in which the ABC does its internal budgeting, there is nothing now being imposed upon the ABC that in any way, shape or form amounts to a cut in its resources. Whatever is occurring inside the ABC is a product of choices it is taking itself.</PARA>

<PARA> The Department of Social Security made a formal bid to take over DVA's computing service, but the Department of Social Security's proposal was found not to be as competitive on a range of evaluation criteria as the two private sector proposals. DVA is not contracting out any of the services it delivers to the veterans' community by outsourcing the NCC. The private suppliers will have no direct contact with clients. They will be providing only routine processing services. The data and applications systems will remain strictly under the Department of Veterans' Affairs' control and the suppliers will in no way be involved in the assessment or provision of pensions. Pensioners will continue to use DVA for all their service requests and inquiries.</PARA>
<PARA> The Privacy Commissioner has been consulted. Following his advice, the private sector organisations will be bound by the provisions of the Privacy Act and will be contractually required to meet the standards that exist now, or higher. Backup and backout plans are a critical part of the detailed contractual negotiations. Financial checks have been undertaken and backup plans will be in place in case of computer malfunction. The privacy and security of veterans' information will be maintained at the highest levels possible under the new arrangements.

<PARA> I thought I would break with tradition a bit today. Instead of reading a prepared text, I thought I would talk about the issues that were raised in this Budget in a more informal fashion, trying to capture what I believe are the real issues in the minds of the people of Australia at present about our economic circumstances and where this country is headed in the course of the next five to 10 years. </PARA>

There is absolutely no doubt in my mind, from my own personal experience in travelling all over this country and all the letters and correspondence we have received in the recent days, that they are genuinely concerned about unemployment. They are worried that if they get a job and lose it they might not get another job in a reasonable time. I know that past experiences linger in their memory as to how long it has taken for jobs to be restored after businesses have been closed down and livelihoods have been lost. </PARA>
<PARA> The great disappointment of this Budget was that it had virtually nothing to offer by way of hope, by way of promise or by way of security for the average Australian who is genuinely concerned about jobs and job prospects. Indeed, it was a blatant political document which had much more to do with preserving the job of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), who is now leaving the chamber, than in securing the job security of average Australians. It was a cobbled together document, a series of deals that were stitched up in an effort to preserve the leadership of the Prime Minister and his position as Prime Minister, rather than to address the fundamental economic problems in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> A deal was done with the ACTU on wages and superannuation; a deal was done with the Deputy Prime Minister, the honourable member for Batman (Mr Howe), and other members of the looney left about their grand city fantasies and assistance to the group that this Government has now created-the new poor. Green and other deals are evident in the document as well. </PARA>
<PARA> But, most importantly, it was a document designed to head off the potential challenge of the gentleman sitting three rows back, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating). Honourable members will notice how carefully that member's agenda was picked up in this document. They only have to go back to the time of the leadership crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> Do honourable members remember the interview that was given by the honourable member for Blaxland on the Sunday program with Laurie Oakes, where he set down his two-point agenda for Australia for the next decade? What were the two points in that agenda? Superannuation and the mad cities fantasy. Both those points are taken up in this document. That therefore validates my point, I believe, that this document has much more to do with securing the job of this man-the Prime Minister-than it has with addressing the genuine concerns and needs of the people of Australia about job security. </PARA>
<PARA> The political priorities were dealt with in this document, but the economic priorities were ignored. Nothing in this document is going to address our debt problem or our balance of payments problem. This document overall increases rather than decreases unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite frankly, it is very difficult for the average Australian to understand how a Prime Minister, who claims to have a personal and close affinity with the people of Australia, a Prime Minister who has been said to have had a love affair with the working people of Australia, a Prime Minister who claims to be steeped in the traditions of the ALP-he claims his roots all the way back to Balmain or Barcaldine, or wherever it was that the Party originated, he looks to his traditions and he claims to represent the interests of the average working Australian-could have brought down a Budget which is so deliberately and calculatingly against the best interests of the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no better authority for that than Bob Carr, the Leader of the Labor Party in New South Wales. This week Bob Carr was right when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>There is precious little hope for the unemployed in this document. It is indefensible in Labor terms. No matter how hard I try, as a Labor leader I cannot defend the existence of unemployment at that level. </PARA>
<PARA>Well, Bob, I tell you that it is indefensible to the coalition as well; indeed, Bob, it is also indefensible to the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Before we look at this document, the key point to understand is that this recession was deliberately engineered by this Government, and this unemployment which is now of such great concern was a fundamental instrument of this Government in trying to right the wrongs of its earlier policy excesses. In years to come it will be interesting to look back at the history of this period, the centenary year of the ALP, when all the Prime Minister had to offer this country was the prospect of one million Australians unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has been very conscious of assuring his position in history. He has done it. He has got it because he is going to throw one million Australians onto the unemployment scrap heap in the centenary year of the ALP. But it is important to recognise that this was a deliberate policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us go back a few years. Do honourable members remember the excesses of policy in 1987 and 1988 when the Government was concerned to win the 1987 Federal election and started pushing interest rates down? In early 1988 it was concerned to save Barrie Unsworth's skin in New South Wales so interest rates were pushed down again. These are all politically motivated changes in interest rate policy which fundamentally overheated this economy and gave us one of the greatest booms in our history. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members should think back just a few years ago to the excesses, to the speculative property boom, the fantastic increases in property prices and the excesses of the corporate sector. They are a good example of exactly how overheated this country became. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the context of that, the honourable member for Blaxland, the then Treasurer, the Prime Minister and, most recently, John Kerin have deliberately relied excessively on interest rate policy to do the job. They knew that if they pushed interest rates up and held them high enough long enough they would inflict the sort of damage that they wanted to do on this economy-to send businesses broke so that they would reduce their spending, to send average Australians broke so that they would reduce their spending. Quite deliberately, for those that they did not put onto the unemployment scrap heap, the impact on their average mortgage payments of something like $400 to $500 per month was designed to slow their spending.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The start of the Budget says that the problem was too much spending relative to production. The Government's response was to deliberately use unemployment as the instrument to slow this economy down. All we have had so far by way of an explanation beyond that is the new Treasurer-I guess we could justifiably call him Mr Sorry-simply coming in and saying, `Sorry, we didn't expect the recession to go that far. Sorry, we didn't expect to have a recession. I am sorry that people are unemployed. I am sorry that this Budget does not address the problems that really ought to be addressed, in the context of what are the worst circumstances in this country in 60 years'. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most galling features of this document and the subsequent statements by the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and others has been references to fairness and compassion. They act as if they are the only ones who understand what is fair in this country, the only ones who can understand genuine compassion. Yet this document and the experience of the last four or five years stand as a very clear example of just how unfair they can be and just how much compassion they can lack. </PARA>
<PARA> I would put it to the people of Australia to just think about who has lost and who has gained in recent years under the Hawke-Keating Government. The politicians, of course, are all right. They sit in here with fat salaries, fat superannuation and VIP aircraft and cars. They are fine-no politicians have lost their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, their rich business mates are okay. Even if they have reportedly gone broke, they are still enjoying a pretty good lifestyle. Some of them are still living overseas on Spanish islands such as Majorca. Others are buying units or houses on the waterfront in Perth for their girlfriends. The rich mates have been looked after in this country. Of course, the new breed of bureaucrats whom the Government has created-all of these do-gooders it has who run around in the name of community services or in the name of the Aboriginal heritage movement or the Green movement-have all got their jobs. Indeed, their basic purpose in life these days is to make sure that they hang onto their jobs by blocking the job opportunities of others. </PARA>

<PARA> If we look back at the plight over the last few years of the average pay as you earn taxpayer in Australia, we can be nothing short of appalled at the amount of damage that has been done to that individual. PAYE taxpayers get their pay after the tax has been taken out. They do not have any access to the rorts that exist in the tax system for the rich under this Government. Tax is still an option under this Government in relation to the rich. The rich still have the option of paying tax. There are fringe benefit rorts; superannuation rorts, as was admitted today; and access to negative gearing. Even the Prime Minister has recently taken access to negative gearing. There have been plenty of examples of these rorts. There has been access to the cash economy and access to the processes of incorporation. None of those things are available to the average PAYE taxpayer. They have gone backwards. Yesterday the Prime Minister stood up here in this Parliament and said that average workers have had their real wages cut by 10 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They have suffered enormously under this Government. But most interestingly, the PAYE taxpayer is also left to carry the load of some of the other excesses of those who cannot work or will not work in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it is instructive to go back and look at the ratio of social security spending, excluding family assistance. Back in 1982 it was 68c in the dollar of every dollar paid by the PAYE taxpayer. Now look at it-86c in the dollar of every dollar of tax paid by the PAYE taxpayer goes to support the social security budget. They are left holding the can. They are carrying the real costs, with real falls in their standards of living. They have little opportunity and no incentive to do anything about it. If they try to lift their game, they get belted; if they save they go backwards. They rely on the Government's ever decreasing standards of service in Medicare. They are left to rely on the Government's ever decreasing standards of education. They have nowhere to go. The Government has left on the scrap heap the great bulk of people whom it claims to represent. </PARA>
<PARA> Against that background, let us look at some of the decisions in this Budget and the extent to which they are supposed to help or work in the best interests of the average Australian. Let us begin, for example, with the centrepiece of this document-the superannuation policy which, as I say, was quickly cobbled together to offset the run that was being made by the Treasurer in his commitment to enforce occupational superannuation with the prospect of a substantial benefit for the average Australian by the year 2000. Work that has been done by an ex-Treasury officer using the model that is used in the Treasury clearly demonstrated that a 5 per cent move into occupational superannuation will add 100,000 to the unemployment queues; and it will add about 2 to 5 per cent to inflation. None of that is going to be compensated by a change in inflation. And all of that is directly against the best interests of the average working Australian whom the Government claims to help. </PARA>
<PARA> So we have superannuation which has been rorted for the benefit of the rich against the poor; the Government is going to impose a system on the business community which is, in effect, a tax on employment. On that basis, the Government is going to create another 100,000 unemployed in this country and add 2 to 5 per cent to inflation. Think about some of the other consequences of the concentration of financial power when that money, accruing to $600 billion-to $800 billion-by the year 2000, is in the hands of a few people in the course of this decade. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us also look at the Budget outcome itself-a deficit of $4.7 billion. The most disturbing feature of this document when we look more closely at the numbers is that the Government had a realistic opportunity to balance this Budget. The Government saved $2 billion and it gave away $2 billion in terms of revenue concessions. It had the possibility of balancing this Budget, which would have given much lower interest rates, much more investment and many more thousands of jobs. That possibility was deliberately forgotten when the Government put together this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, we have this wonderful grand scheme-the `Tom Uren lives, better cities fantasy'. This is a pay-out to the Left; it is a pay-out to the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe). It is a $800m commitment over the course of the next five years. I ask: what is fair about that; what is compassionate about that? Come with me, we will go to the unemployment queues and ask people whether they can understand why the Government can spend $800m while they have to queue up. All the Government is going to give them as a result of that package is better quality pavements to queue up on, designer soup kitchens or better parks for the homeless to live in. It is one of the most ill-conceived and, again, quickly cobbled together policies for the sake of placating a political vested interest that I have ever seen. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us go on to some of the other areas. Let us go on to the so-called policy of structural reform in this Budget-a promise of more studies by the Industry Commission and the announcement of the National Rail Corporation which is, in itself, a good move but one made somewhat after the horse has bolted from the stable. One can go to any railway in Australia. But let me refer to Victoria. I am told that it is a fact that it is cheaper to close down the Victorian railway system and give every regular commuter a car than it is to try to run that train system. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an essential and urgent need to start to address some of these fundamental problems in this country. Of course, all we are going to get at best are more studies. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, we have an attempt to appear compassionate in regard to the education, training and family assistance front. Yet, in fact, family assistance is simply an acknowledgment that the Government has created a new class of poor in Australia-the new poor, as they have been referred to. The Government is gradually raising the income thresholds and so on; it is gradually increasing the cut-off point for the poor in Australia and, again, putting more and more burden on the average PAYE taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has acted in a similar way in respect of education. The Government has thrown 400,000 or 500,000 people onto the unemployment scrap heap just since the last election and it is getting a little bit nervous that maybe somebody will say that some of those people will not get jobs. It is throwing a bit of money in the direction of training. This is welcome but there is no guarantee that the systems will not continue to be as greatly inefficient as they have been demonstrated to be in recent days by Auditor-General reports and so on. The interesting thing is that to do that the Government needed money. And where did the money come from? There was an admission that the Medicare system is failing, that it was only about 20 per cent funded by the levy and is out of control. Therefore, the Government had to start to do something. So it hit Medicare. There is to be an uncompensated increase in the cost of medical services. The Government has passed the revenue across to family assistance, education and training. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the environment is also mentioned. What is so fair about some of the payments that are included in this area? Again, those on the dole queues around this country will have trouble understanding what it is that this Government has in its mind when it talks about fairness and compassion. They see, for example, a new environmental protection agency being set up-another bureaucracy. They will feel really good as they queue up for their cheques when they see that bureaucracy being built as an alternative to actually putting this economy in shape. </PARA>
<PARA> I put it to the Prime Minister that they would have a lot of trouble understanding why he would spend $20m in paying money off to the World Bank in the name of an international environmental commitment when they are left standing on the unemployment queues. </PARA>
<PARA> As we go through this document, we see not only a lack of concern about our economic problems but a genuine lack of fairness and compassion. The Prime Minister's concept of compassion is that when he sees a television camera he goes for the hanky, he wipes the eyes and therefore he is compassionate. That is absolute tripe. His concept of fairness is that it is a word he should use all the time so that perhaps ultimately people will believe him. But the facts speak against him. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no fairness or compassion in this document; this document will end up with one million Australians unemployed. It is very clear that in the course of the last seven or eight years the Labor Party has not been working in the best interests of the people of Australia. It has been dominated by and beholden to a succession of deals which have looked after a few special interests to the detriment of the general body of people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is about time that we stopped and reflected on the fact that this country cannot continue to go on this way. This is a great country which has great opportunities and great resources, and it is about time we moved dramatically and urgently in a direction which will allow us to reap more of its potential. There is an alternative to driving the economy into the floor, sending companies broke and having one million unemployed, and that is actually to face the reality of our economic circumstances and put in place an across the board reform agenda that will increase our capacity to give jobs. </PARA>

We have recently released a document entitled `The case for a broad based goods and services tax' by R.J.L. Hawke. It is worth reading; I will send him a copy. In that document, the Prime Minister put a definitive case for the change to a goods and services tax as part of an overall reform agenda.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Why would he not want to give people the opportunity to keep more of the money they earn or the opportunity to increase their wages rather than having a centralised system which continues to erode their real living standards? Why would he not want to give them the incentive to work, the incentive to work harder, the incentive to save, the incentive to work an extra shift or the incentive for people to lift their game, improve the quality of their output or get out of a poverty trap? Why would he not want to do that? He knows jolly well that a goods and services tax-as part of overall tax reform, as part of a total package, a total reform agenda-is fundamentally important if this country is going to turn itself around. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why the coalition parties are totally committed to a major reform agenda-no tinkering at the edges, no little marginal changes, no playing bits and pieces here, but an overall reform agenda with the specific objective of rebuilding the economy from the bottom up, brick by brick.

<PARA> The Prime Minister can sit there and laugh and mock; he can put that stupid grin on his face. But the people of Australia will never forgive him for one million people being unemployed or for failing to show the leadership that he knows he ought to be showing but cannot because he is so worried about the honourable member for Blaxland that he has lost all sense of proportion. He has lost all sense of direction, and that is amply reflected in the Budget document, which has no sense of reality, no sense of vision and no sense of direction. </PARA>
<PARA> We are very concerned that, as matter of matter of urgency, we start to turn circumstances around. I have even offered the Prime Minister bipartisan support for the major decisions, because I know how tough it can be to get the right decisions up.

Rather than face reality, he will let one million people sit on the scrap heap with the prospect of being among the long term unemployed for six or seven years. It is a tragedy to go overseas as an Australian and be constantly reminded of how much we have fallen off the pace in the last seven or eight years. </PARA>

<PARA> The report recommends that the House continue televising its proceedings and has recommended a number of changes to the conditions adopted during the trial period. Some of those changes proposed are: that the adjournment debate be included in the proceedings for televising; that public proceedings of committees be authorised for televising, subject to a common set of guidelines for the media; that restrictions be lifted on the use of the parliamentary footage for television stations' promotion; that restrictions be lifted on the use of split-screen shots by broadcasters; that acknowledgment be made of distinguished visitors in the Speaker's Gallery; that possible breaches of conditions be referred to the House members of the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings for consideration; that penalties for breaches be determined by the House members of the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings; that the arrangements for the televising be provided for with appropriate amendments to the Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Act 1946.</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee did not accept the argument that the House should adopt the same conditions as the Senate. According to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation there is more interest in the House of Representatives broadcast of Question Time than there is in the Senate. The live broadcast of Question Time in the House attracts 68,500 viewers, while the Senate broadcast attracts 46,350 viewers. I am sure that includes even the relations of the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull).</PARA>
<PARA> The televising of the House brings with it new challenges and responsibilities. Accordingly, the Committee has recommended a further review in the Budget session of 1993. I would like to thank the members of the Committee for their diligence in attending meetings and the Committee staff-especially Phil Bergin and Sue Morton-for their professionalism.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order. When I concluded my question in Question Time-which, as the House may recall, was the last question in Question Time-the Minister for Veterans' Affairs replied. I raised a point of order about the tabling of the documents that you referred to. While I did not quote the exact words from the standing orders -I refer specifically to standing order 321-there is not the slightest doubt, frankly, that what I said is consistent with what standing order 321 says. The document was not a confidential document, and yet the Minister was not required to table it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The procedure, as I recall it, which has been adopted in the past is that an honourable member from either side can ask a Minister whether he will table a document-to which the Minister can say no. With regard to Ministers quoting, or allegedly quoting, in Question Time, my recollection is that it is usual practice for the honourable member to refer my attention to that standing order. I then ask the Minister whether he is quoting. If the Minister says yes, I then ask him if it is confidential. If he says yes, he does not have to table it; if he does not say that it is confidential, he is then required to table it. It is a separate sort of thing.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G4">Mr DUFFY</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Holt-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Attorney-General)</ROLE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitution Affairs inquiry into mergers, takeovers and monopolies was initiated in February 1988. The Committee was requested to examine and inquire into the adequacy of existing legislative controls over mergers, takeovers and monopolisation, with particular reference to the extent of control of mergers, takeovers and monopolisation necessary to safeguard the public interest, the adequacy of existing legislation, and the role and effectiveness of the Trade Practices Commission in its implementation of sections 46 and 50 of the Trade Practices Act. This request followed a period of widespread discussion regarding the effectiveness of the Act to adequately safeguard the public interest at a time of increased merger activity involving corporations whose general activities significantly impacted upon large sections of the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The level of community interest was reflected in the wide range of individuals and organisations that made submissions to the Committee. The Committee held public hearings in various capital cities and, in addition, the Committee conducted a workshop in Canberra which provided a valuable opportunity for participants to exchange views on various options for reform of the Act which had been suggested to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The conduct of the inquiry coincided with two important court cases concerning the interpretation of sections 46 and 50 of the Act. The High Court's judgment in the Queensland Wire Industries case is a landmark decision on the interpretation of the misuse of market power provision-section 46. The Australia Meat Holdings case constituted the first fully argued section 50 merger case since 1978. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government would like to express its appreciation to the Committee for the production of a very valuable report. Notably, the report brought together the views of a wide cross-section of the business, legal and academic communities and consumer organisations on the effectiveness of the merger and misuse of market power provisions of the Act and on the proposals for their reform. The Committee should also be congratulated for its innovative approach in holding a workshop which enabled a greater and more effective input by participants into the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will be aware that the Senate has since referred to its Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for inquiry and report several trade practices issues which were also the subject of inquiry and report by the House of Representatives Committee. These relate to the adequacy of the existing merger test in section 50 and aspects of the misuse of market power provisions in section 46. The Government obviously would wish to have and study the report of the Senate Committee before making final decisions on these matters. The following response, therefore, represents the Government's views of the House of Representatives Committee recommendations, which will be examined again, if necessary, in light of any contrary recommendations of the Senate Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government agrees with the Committee that the misuse of market power provisions in section 46 should be retained in their present form-recommendation 2. Like the Committee, it is not convinced that there is sufficient justification for reverting to the `substantial lessening of competition' test in merger cases-recommendation 4. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government also accepts the general thrust of the Committee's recommendations that:</PARA>
<PARA>- guidelines should be issued by the Trade Practices Commission on the operation of the misuse of market power provision-recommendation 2-this has now been done;</PARA>
<PARA>- a private right to injunctive relief against mergers should be reintroduced-recommendation 5;</PARA>
<PARA>- there should be legislative recognition of the informal merger consultative process-recommendation 7;</PARA>
<PARA>- the procedure for authorisation of mergers should be retained in its existing form-recommendation 8;</PARA>
<PARA>- statutory remedies should be provided in respect of breaches of undertakings entered into with the TPC-recommendation 9;</PARA>
<PARA>- information concerning merger matters considered under the informal merger consultative process and the formal authorisation process should be publicly available, but subject to appropriate confidentiality requirements-recommendation 10;</PARA>
<PARA>- appropriate procedures should be developed to improve coordination between the Trade Practices Commission and other regulatory agencies involved with various aspects of mergers-recommendation 11;</PARA>
<PARA>- the TPC should maintain a pro-active approach to the merger and misuse of market power provisions recommendation 12;</PARA>
<PARA>- cost recovery measures should be introduced in relation to costs incurred in the administration and enforcement of the merger provisions-recommendation 13;</PARA>
<PARA>- the role of the Federal Court in the resolution of matters under part IV and related provisions of the Act should be retained -recommendation 15; and</PARA>
<PARA>- there should be a substantial increase in the existing maximum pecuniary penalties for sections 46 and 50 and an enhancement of the range of remedies available for part IV contraventions-recommendation 16. </PARA>
<PARA> Further detailed consideration of some aspects of the above recommendations will be required. These include the suggested options relating to the procedures of the Federal Court in the resolution of matters under part IV and related provisions of the Act-recommendation 15-and the level of penalties which should apply not only to sections 46 and 50-recommendation 16-but also for infringements of other provisions of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 3 recommended against the introduction of pre-merger notification into the Act. The Government believes, upon further reflection and consultation with the TPC, that a form of pre-merger notification which has sufficiently high thresholds, is sufficiently flexible and does not involve unduly onerous burdens, would be advantageous. This would ensure that the TPC received adequate notice of proposed mergers, thereby enabling it to give proper consideration to the transaction before it is consummated. A pre-notification scheme would also mesh well with the proposal to give statutory recognition to the informal consultation process and to provide for enforcement of undertakings given during it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that the objective of recommendation 6, which concerns the TPC's policy of giving emphasis to the authorisation process in mergers with potential for market dominance, is already being achieved and that a section 29 direction as recommended by the Committee is, therefore, not warranted. The TPC is already aware of the Government's support in principle for its approach in this area, and regular consultation between the TPC and the Government provides a satisfactory means for the Government to keep the TPC informed of its views in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> As regards recommendation 14, concerning the provision of adequate resources to enable the TPC to maintain its pro-active approach, the Government notes that the TPC was provided with significant increases in the 1989-90 Budget. It has since been given additional funds for its new responsibilities in relation to waterfront reform, misuse of market power in a trans-Tasman market, and those resulting from micro-economic reform. These additional funds have been built into its resource base for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is sympathetic to the considerations underlying the Committee's first recommendation-that the TPC in conjunction with the Australian Bureau of Statistics should establish a minimal set of on-line business data for use by the TPC and private researchers. However, consideration of this recommendation has identified significant practical and resource difficulties for which satisfactory solutions would need to be found if the recommendation is to be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn finally to the Committee's recommendation that the Attorney-General initiate a further review of the merger and misuse of market power provisions of the Act within five years. There is, of course, a further review now being conducted by the Senate Committee. Officers of the Attorney-General's Department have made a detailed submission to that Committee. That submission canvasses those issues examined by the House of Representatives Committee which fall within the terms of reference of the Senate Committee. It also canvasses a wider range of proposals for amendments of the Trade Practices Act. The officers' submission has the general endorsement of the Government but, as noted above, this position will be reconsidered in light of the report of the Senate Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I again thank the members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for their valuable work. I notice that coincidentally the Chairman of that Committee, the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths), has entered the chamber. Therefore I repeat the thanks of the Government for the very valuable work of the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Less than six months ago the Government presented its other great fizzer for the year, the complement to Tuesday's Budget-the 12 March statement entitled Building a Competitive Australia. In that statement various empty promises were made about how competition and competitiveness would be developed in the Australian economy. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) declared:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Trade Practices Act is our principal legislative weapon to ensure consumers get the best deal from competition. </PARA>
<PARA>When we get to the detail of what was meant by that declaration, we begin to see how hollow it was. The Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) has just responded to a report by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs entitled Mergers, Takeovers and Monopolies: Profiting from Competition? If the Government had a serious interest in a vigorous competition policy, the opportunity could have been taken to disclose it in this statement. The Attorney may have amplified and given us just an inkling of where the Government intends to go. </PARA>
<PARA> But perhaps he did give us an inkling or a glimpse of where the Government intends to go on competition policy. It intends to go nowhere. The Attorney-General's statement should not be condemned for what it says-as far as it goes the statement is correct-but it should be condemned for what it does not say: what it does not say about the role of the Trade Practices Commission in promoting competitiveness in the Australian economy; the resources to be devoted to that; the penalties to be imposed for anti-competitive behaviour; the way in which the role of the TPC would be integrated with a whole raft of regulatory agencies such as the Prices Surveillance Authority, the Office of Regulation Review, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, the Australian Securities Commission, the Industry Commission; and how that hotchpotch, that mishmash of regulatory authorities, will be developed in the role of promoting a competitive Australia. We are interested not in a bureaucratic and regulatory framework for Australian business, but in a framework which will promote a competitive Australia. This is a complacent and an enervated statement. </PARA>
<PARA> Do not think for a moment that the brevity of the response and the narrowness of its focus are because there has been no time for thoughtful and mature reflection. This is a response to a House committee inquiry which was initiated in February 1988. The Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs did good work. It was well chaired, and I pay tribute to the work of its then Chairman, sitting at the table-the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths). In a little over a year his Committee was able to have public hearings, to take evidence, to analyse complicated statutory provisions and to write a report of over 100 pages. The report was published, after all of that considered work, in May 1989. In the 27 months the Government has had to respond, the best it could do is produce five pages which advance the work of that Committee not one inch. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government accepts the Committee's recommendation that the misuse of market power provision-section 46 of the Trade Practices Act-should be retained in its present form. So does the coalition, although it will be necessary for the incoming Government to keep a close eye on the interpretation by the courts, following the Queensland Wire decision, of complicated questions that arise as to how it can be determined when a monopolist refuses supply for price reasons and when a monopolist refuses supply for the proscribed reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government accepts the Committee's recommendation that there is not sufficient justification for reverting to the substantial lessening of competition test in section 50 merger cases. So does the coalition, particularly at a time when Australian industry is being devastated by the recession it is now experiencing. The Government accepts the general thrust of the Committee's recommendation that a private right to injunctive relief be granted in merger cases. So too does the coalition accept the general thrust of that recommendation. But it is important to note that the Committee recommended that on a condition that targets and associates be excluded from this right. The statement does not deal with that, but for our part we would think that condition would be integral to the recommendation. If it were not, then that private injunctive relief could be used by targets and their associates effectively to delay mergers and acquisitions over a long period of time. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has recommended that maximum fines be increased for breaches of sections 46 and 50. The Government agrees with that. Good; so do we. But it should be noted that the Committee also argued for a wider level of penalties for all part IV contraventions. They are notoriously low, and the Attorney-General knows it. The press has reported that time after time he has been to the Cabinet to get it to agree to increase the penalties. It was reported in December 1990, it was reported in June 1991, and it has now been reported that the Attorney is going back to Cabinet in September. Time after time the Cabinet has stalled the Attorney. We commend him for his efforts, but the Cabinet has stalled him in his efforts to increase penalties across the board in relation to part IV contraventions. Why? Because if we even-handedly increase penalties for part IV contraventions some of the Government's mates might suffer-in this case the high priests among the mates, the trade union leaders. </PARA>
<PARA> In a handful of cases unions have been found, after trial, to have contravened part IV sections 45d and 45e. None have ever been fined. I know these cases well because before I came to this place I had more than a passing familiarity with them. None of them have been fined under part IV, but the very prospect of increasing the maximum penalty has frozen this Government to stone-cold immovable ice. The Government really cannot deal with competition issues like this because it cannot bring itself to treat people equally, to treat citizens, corporations and unions on the same basis, when it comes to competitive or anti-competitive practices. It cannot encourage competitive conduct between players treated equally before the law because it believes in special privileges, special rates and special mates. In this case the special mates are those organisations that may come within the purview of sections 45d and 45e. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government comes to this issue with a corrupted mindset. If it is to get serious about equal competitive treatment, integral to that will be equal penalties for uncompetitive practices right across part IV of the Act, including the uncompetitive practices of secondary boycotts by trade union organisations which inhibit competition in the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA> The other area where this response goes to water is on the question of resources for the Trade Practices Commission to take an active role in promoting competition. Professor Baxt, the retiring Chairman of the Trade Practices Commission, said on 26 June 1991:</PARA>
<PARA>Regrettably, the Government has not been willing or able to translate its recognition of the importance of competition policy into devoting the necessary resources to the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>He was right. What Professor Baxt really was saying, in a very polite and ever so gentle manner, was that when we match the words of this Government against its deeds we find that it has no commitment to promoting a competitive Australia. We find that those words are hollow and empty. He was the Government's appointment as the Trade Practices Commission Chairman; the Government's appointment said that in an indictment of the Government. I do not hold the Attorney-General responsible because I know he is trying hard in the Cabinet, but the Cabinet has no commitment to support him, as Professor Baxt made clear. </PARA>
<PARA> An additional $300,000 was voted for the Trade Practices Commission in Tuesday's Budget. What was it for? It was to monitor industry claims that products are environmentally friendly. According to that vote in the Budget, we are to have an environmentally friendly package labelling law led competitive Australia after Tuesday night-$300,000 to monitor industry claims that products are environmentally friendly. That is the commitment the Government has made to its Trade Practices Commission in building a competitive Australia. We look forward to the environmentally friendly package labelling law led competitive Australia as a result of that brave decision on Tuesday night. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, the portfolio estimates produced by the Attorney-General's Department start off with this outlook for 1991-92:</PARA>
<PARA>Activity for 1991-92 is continuing at similar levels to 1990-91. In this regard, program performance may suffer through lack of resources. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the Government's own portfolio estimate. As I said, that was following on from the big fizzer of March 1991, supposedly building a competitive Australia. When we get down to the detail, they are hollow words indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> Not all of the allocation to the Trade Practices Commission is well spent. There have been allocations from which we are yet to see any result. It is supposed to have a program on waterfront reform. Everybody is supposed to have a program on waterfront reform. We never see any progress on waterfront reform; that is the problem. It is supposed to have a program on trans-Tasman markets, yet we know that the trans-Tasman shipping agreement is still in place. We have not seen any tangible benefit from the Commission's involvement in that. It is supposed to have a program on micro-economic reform. We have not seen any real benefit from the Government as a whole. I do not know whether the Commission is trying hard but, if it is, certainly its efforts have not been recognised by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Commission is to have a real role in the future it must be in promoting competition and real enforcement of laws against anti-competitive conduct. Sadly for Australia, there is no hint at all in this statement that the Government has anything like the resolve needed to bring that about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just half an hour ago the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) was in the chamber telling us about a Budget which offers no hope for the unemployed. He talked about the fact that jobs should have been the principal focus in the Budget. At the International Conservation Union meeting in Perth last December, the head of the union made a statement that I thought was worth remembering. Coming from the mouth of a notable conservationist, it marked something that is too often forgotten. He said that we will be taken seriously only if we regard people as being as important as penguins.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I bring forward this debate about the Government's failure to coordinate its environment and industry strategies in the belief that this is one of the vital contributions to Australia having become a `can't do' country. Instead of being a country of unlimited potential for its people, we are a country that is limping from disaster to disaster. In personal terms, we saw 83,000 jobs lost in July. I find in this chamber that it is very easy to be amused by some of the debate which goes back and forth, and it is very easy to deal with large statistics. But I ask the House to remember that every one of the 831,900 unemployed is an individual who in many cases suffers intense personal anguish from a sense of failure and deprivation. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality of massive unemployment, which in the words of the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) is predicted to grow over 900,000, overhangs this debate and all other debates in this place. I think it is important that honourable members try to conceptualise what we are talking about, to really understand. We are talking about filling the visitors galleries of this chamber 1,200 times with the people who are unemployed. If we got them to queue in twos, we could not fit them between here and Sydney. If we reach the Budget estimate, there will be a longer queue than would link Sydney to Melbourne if we gave each of the unemployed a metre of space. </PARA>
<PARA> Try to imagine the number of Australians who have been cast down. The relevance of this debate is that one of the reasons why hundreds of thousands of people have lost their jobs over recent years and, in particular, since the last election, is the total failure of the Government in this area-this capacity the Government has had to reduce us to being a `can't do' country. </PARA>
<PARA> There is only one answer to unemployment and that is new business and investment. The Budget tells the story: a third period of decline in business investment. There is no hope; there are no prospects. Yet as the Leader of the Opposition said just half an hour or so ago, this ought to be a country of unlimited possibility and prospects. The students sitting in the gallery should be looking forward with enthusiasm to a range of exciting occupations that will take them through to the next century. Instead, they face the prospect of one in three of their peers being unemployed. It is a national disgrace and a national scandal. </PARA>
<PARA> Do we hear protests from the Labor Party? I sat in this chamber when we had a recession led by the world and by a drought and I heard the fulminations of Labor members-not in this chamber but in the Senate. I hear nothing today. The position of members of the Labor Party is reflected in what Dr Martin Luther King had to say:</PARA>
<PARA>We shall have to repent in this generation not so much for the evil deeds of the wicked people, but for the appalling silence of the good people. </PARA>
<PARA>I say to the members of the Labor Party, elected as the friends of the workers, that unless they are prepared to demand that their Government change its economic direction and bring its environment and development policies into close harness, they will stand forever condemned for the hardship they are imposing on the people of Australia. It need not be like that. We have areas of expertise and comparative advantage and enormous skill in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I was delighted recently when I picked up a newspaper and read the headline that BHP is to spend $1 billion on mines. I come from Western Australia. I understand that a new mine brings with it new jobs in the cities and a capacity to pay our international debts. It is a splendid thing that our great international company, BHP, is looking through its mineral division at $1 billion worth of investment. But where is the investment? Some of it is in Australia in the Queensland coalmines. There is a goldmine in Mali, a platinum mine in Zimbabwe, a Brazilian iron ore mine, coalmines in Indonesia and New Mexico, a sulphide mine in the north-east of the United States and a giant copper mine in northern Chile. </PARA>
<PARA> Why, in this extraordinarily resource rich country, are the BHPs and the CRAs of this world looking elsewhere? Why has CRA just spent $700m in east Kalimantan to mine coal that will be very competitive with Queensland coal? It has a high calorific value and is low in impurities. Environmentally, it is very good stuff. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that investment has been forced away from Australia by the policies of this Government and by its total failure to deal with these issues in a proper way. This is not just a partisan view. I have talked about mining, but we have enormous potential to add value to our basic resources. There are legion examples of opportunities missed in recent years. After the fiasco of Wesley Vale in 1989 one critic described the fundamental problem with the Government's approach. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has not got an overall environment strategy. If it had an environment strategy and an effective industry development strategy, both sides of the equation would have a much better idea as to where it was going. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement was made by Simon Crean. That is a Minister from this Government, then the President of the ACTU, speaking about the pathetic incapacity of this Government, so often reflected upon by the Minister at the table, the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths), who has run into these issues with solutions which have disappeared so quickly. They have disappeared like the jobs of so many workers in this country. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Mr CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has got worse and it continues to worsen. The most recent example is Coronation Hill, in relation to which a majority of the Cabinet did not have the courage to put the interests of the people of Australia and the interests of that queue of unemployed that runs from Melbourne to Sydney ahead of the short term political interests of the Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If honourable members want an example which exemplifies the correctness of the accusation that was made by the Leader of the Opposition in the debate earlier this afternoon about the failure of this Government to address the national interest and about its preparedness to sacrifice the national interest for narrow political advantage, it can be found in a situation in which two-thirds of the Cabinet do not have the courage to make the decision that they know is right, and then to hide-I say this, as an ex-Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, with considerable disgust-behind the Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the chamber: how many people in Australia would regard the judgment or views of Bob Hawke on the rightness of the Jawoyn situation as being more valuable than the views of Senator Bob Collins? I am not here to praise Senator Collins. I am not here to bury him, either. Quite frankly, I could not dig a big enough hole. Senator Collins, the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, knows more about the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory than I have managed to forget and will ever know. I have been with him in the bush; I have a total respect for his capacity to communicate with and understand the people he represents. I would say that in any company and in any place. His assessment of the situation reflects my own view and I think the view of many other people who have had a long interest in Aboriginal affairs. The disgusting preparedness of this Government to lay that decision at the feet of the Jawoyn people, when it totally ignores the Aboriginal views on Jabiluka and Koongarra, is pathetic. The unemployed people of Australia are entitled to say, `This is a disgraceful failure of national responsibility'. The problem is not new. </PARA>
<PARA> We have enormous environmental problems in this country. I believe that they are greater than the public assessment. For example, the measure and extent of soil degradation is beyond public understanding at present. The cost of remedying that is in no way fully appreciated. I believe that over the next decade governments will have to substantially revise their commitment in that area. I ask the House: is a poor Australia likely to come to grips with that problem more successfully than a rich and prosperous Australia? We should look at the problem of feral animals. We should talk to our ex-colleague Senator Kilgariff about rabbits in the centre. This is an enormous problem which I do not think the Minister at the table would claim to have got under control. It is a massively expensive future challenge. </PARA>
<PARA> The Great Barrier Reef has some additional funds, but I am sure the Minister would say that there are threats to this priceless and national world asset which may well prove to be very expensive. One can go on and on. The simple point I put in this debate is that if we are to protect our environmental assets, if we are to do the job that is required to be done and to meet clear environmental objectives, then we must also meet clear economic objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister may well talk about the ESD process. I say to the Minister that when I read through the great pile of documents and when I attended the public consultation in Perth last week I thought of the words from Eliza Doolittle- `Words, words words, I'm so sick of words. That's all I hear, I see no action'. The reality is that the paralysis which has affected this Government with respect to bringing together its resource and environment policies continues to this very day. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the Government's decisions on uranium, contentious environmentally, we might ask: what has it done globally? It has exported the mining of uranium to Canada. It has transferred to Canada the jobs which could have been filled by Australians and the export income that could have been earned by Australians. This is the grand contribution to a better world. If we want to test the sincerity of the Government we should look at the decision making process with respect to Olympic Dam, made in the teeth of an election in South Australia to save the Bannon Government, without regard to principle of any sort. </PARA>
<PARA> I think this is a very serious debate. I suspect that when you go back to your electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker, and talk to your constituents, they will basically want what the confused and frightened people who come to my office want. They want to see Australia growing and prospering and they want a job for themselves and their children. That is what this Government is not producing. The two Ministers at the table present a sharp contrast. What do we get from the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly)? We get a whole lot of nice words, no sense of direction, no sense of decisions being made and no hope for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> In closing, I say that the very minimum that is required for Australia in the 1990s and as we go into the next century is clear environmental goals. Those goals are relatively straightforward-targets with respect to the preservation and restoration of our soils and the protection of our water supplies, and clear targets and programs for the protection of biodiversity. Those things will be expensive but they are essential. There are others, but time does not permit me to enumerate. Just as important are clear economic goals. In Australia that means doing what we are good at and stopping this paralysis which is turning us into a third rate country where there is no future for our children. We need improved and streamlined procedures which will bring together the environmental and economic interest and we need an end to the sort of decision making that has made this Government untrusted by environmentalists and businessmen alike. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have heard nothing from the Opposition but very negative comments. Basically in the past 18 months we have had no policies at all from the Opposition on the environment. The Opposition says this issue is critical to the future of this country-I agree it is-but when does it raise it? The Opposition has raised it as a matter of public importance after the major Opposition speech for this Budget session, the response of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> How much attention will this matter of public importance receive today? Opposition members know how much it will receive-nil. The Opposition raised this issue today because it does not rate it as being of major significance at all. In fact the Opposition does not rate the environment as an issue of any significance. When the Bulletin of 13 August appeared with an article entitled `Hewson's Australia', I thought I might find the Opposition's environment policy in it. I went through the article and saw the beautiful photographs of the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan), the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) and the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton), who was in an apron; even the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale) got a mention. I looked at sections dealing with industrial relations, taxation, privatisation, telecommunications, and even arts, sport, youth affairs, aviation and trade got a mention. But where was the environment?</PARA>
<PARA> The environment never matters at all to the Opposition. The only context in which the Opposition raises the environment is when it asks, `Why don't you do more for industry?'. The Opposition never analyses the balance between the environment and the economy; it never tries to integrate the environment into the economy. That is the fundamental basis of everything this Government has done in the area of the environment since I became the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has started processes and is getting results in relation to the ecologically sustainable development process. The honourable member for Pearce criticised that and said that it is just words. Sure, they are draft submissions now going out for public comment. I would like to know what detailed public comment the honourable member for Pearce and the rest of the Opposition will make. In fact the Opposition is so irrelevant in that process that we have State governments, the business community, the broader community and the Federal Ministers making a contribution, but we never hear any constructive comments on these detailed issues from the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition never has any ideas. I am prepared to listen to the Opposition's views, but all one hears is negative, negative, negative. Do honourable members know what the Opposition has said so far about the environment? The Opposition has said two things about the environment: first, it is going to mine Coronation Hill and, secondly, it will abolish the Resource Assessment Commission. That is basically all the Opposition has said in 18 months about the environment. It has made very negative comments and has said nothing about how it would get the balance between the environment and the economy. The Government is dealing with that on a day-to-day basis. We have set in train processes for full community consultation and as a result of that the Government will get action in relation to long term plans for the integration of the environment into the economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The classic example is that of tourism. With the narrow, blinkered view of the Opposition, it never thinks that the environment can actually generate any jobs. How does the Opposition think we got an effective tourism industry? We have an effective tourism industry because we have a natural environment which we want to show off to the rest of the world. In fact we have a major industry in the tourism area, with the support and integration of areas of the environment. For example, tourism contributed 5.1 per cent to Australia's gross domestic production in 1989-90 and created over 100,000 jobs in the 1980s-and there will be more in the 1990s. Looking after the environment and integrating it into the economy, which is in this draft report-again this was discussed with industry, the community and the State governments but there was no input from the Opposition-is what the future is all about. That is how we integrate the environment into the economy. If we destroy the environment, we will not have a tourism industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The same goes for industries such as agriculture. That is a very important industry and our National Party colleagues in particular will agree with that; however, if we continue to degrade the soil and destroy the land, we will not have an industry. These issues are analysed in this paper; they are big issues that must be addressed if we are to have sustainable industry into the next decade. The same goes for every other report we have here. Here is one on mining; again, one cannot just dig the resource up and forget about the environment. I support the mining industry, just as every other member of the Government does--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is nonsense. More jobs are being created through tourism in the northern part of Australia than would have been created through the mine at Coronation Hill. What goes with it? We will get, for example, a transport industry and an accommodation industry. The Opposition always takes a narrow view. The Government must work closely with the States to try to streamline environmental decision making. One of the great problems in this country is that in many cases we have too many overlapping regulations. Through the initiative of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Premiers Conference, this Government has set in train processes by which we get rid of some of that burden and streamline decision making processes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One area where we are seeing significant changes is in the environmental assessment process. All States and Territories are working with the Commonwealth Government to get uniform agreed environmental assessment procedures. That does not mean that we lower environmental standards; it means that we have standards across Australia so that the business community knows what the rules of the game are. I think those same sorts of rules should be applied across Australia. The Government is now sitting down with the States saying, `Let us try to get agreed standards in water and air quality'. We are one of the few countries in the developed world that has no agreed standards on air quality, for example. We have one rule for Victoria, which follows one standard; South Australia follows another, as does Western Australia, and the business community hardly knows what those standards are. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is trying to bring that process together. That is one reason the Government has established in this Budget an Environmental Protection Agency. Of course the Opposition in its usual way said, `We oppose that', but it has not asked the business community what it thinks about it. The Opposition is saying, `That is another level of government'. In fact it is just the opposite; it is leaving the role of policing to the States and it is attempting to use the resources we have and the information we hope to get from all the States to develop one law and rule in relation to the operation of these standards throughout Australia. Yet the Opposition does not even want to do that. That proposal does have the support of the industry; industry has been one of the main groups calling for this sort of initiative. However, in its usual way the Opposition says, `Let's forget about that. Don't worry about that'. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the EPA will be a very valuable asset to business as well as to the environment. My approach in relation to the EPA will not be to work at end-of-pipe solutions, where we regulate or over-regulate, but to work with industry in a constructive way so that we can look at how it manages its wastes and can help in particular the middle range and smaller businesses to know what sort of technology is available and to work with industry too in the development of new waste technology. </PARA>
<PARA> Another very important aspect is the whole matter of clean-up in Australia. One of the major problems is that there are various State laws governing the collection of waste. Some States have a good kerb-side collection system; others do not have any. Industry has come to me and said, `Look, we can't have these particular targets for Victoria and different targets for New South Wales. Can't we pull it all together?'. A classic example is the collection of tyres. In this country millions of new tyres are coming onto the market every month. The old tyres are discarded throughout Australia. We need a national approach to deal with this waste tyre problem. So what we are doing through the EPA is pulling together the two manufacturers, who say, `Right, we can work with you to get together the motor dealers in a national collection system'. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OH4">Mrs KELLY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not going to be regulation. This is going to be done in a voluntary way, the simplistic way of thinking again. Are honourable members aware that if we can get an effective national collection system of tyres, bottles or plastics we can actually get new industry? But the key is that we must have all of the States working together, all of them collecting. We can then have a central new factory which can, in the case of tyres, produce new products, and those new products can be exported. But, of course, there is no vision in the Opposition that allows it to think that the environment can do more than stop jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have here an excellent report which I commend to the Opposition. It is a report on commercial opportunities in waste management. If we are looking at one of the big growth industries for this country in this region, it is in waste. This is a paper prepared not by my Department but by the private sector and the CSIRO, in which they outline the opportunities in the waste business for this country. They say that it is worth about $4 billion a year, and that is just in this country alone. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the things that is stopping them is that we do not have agreed standards. If we can get agreed standards, we get industry responding to them and it knows what the hell it is preparing its manufacturing instruments for. Waste management is a terrific growth industry, particularly in this region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recently we have had some discussions with some of our neighbouring countries. They say to us, `Look, we don't want to be a dumping ground for the rest of the world, either. We want to work with you in clean-up technologies'. This country has the potential to get international recognition for some of the research in these areas of waste minimisation and clean-up, particularly, say, in the area of water quality. </PARA>
<PARA> I have attempted today to point out to honourable members that there are opportunities for growth in areas of major concern in respect of the environment, particularly, as I have said, in the waste industry. But every single step of the way in my environment portfolio we are concerned about protection of the environment and the economy, because we understand that we need to have both. The Australian population do not want to trade off one against the other. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that we have to prepare not just for today's generation but for future generations as well. We would be reneging on our responsibility as a government if we say, `Yes, we will exploit anything regardless of the price, regardless of what we leave for future generations'. Instead, we are attempting to plan for the next century to get that integration right. It is hard and it is tough. It requires time, consultation and information. But it also requires vision, and vision is one thing we will never hear anything about from the Opposition. All we hear is its negative barking: `We will abolish this; we will not do this; we hate you for doing that'. It never has a vision about where this country is going in relation to integrating these important issues on the environment and the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Every single step of the way, we consider both of those factors. That is why we are establishing an environmental protection agency. That is why we are having endangered species legislation, and why we want to have recovery programs. It is essential that we preserve these species for future years. That does not mean we do not have a mining industry. Of course we want to have one. But together we can work, and I am finding a lot of cooperation with industry. I have not seen the sort of antagonism that the Opposition has talked about. Around a table, industry is working with us together because most industry does want a balance in the economy and the environment. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA> Around Australia we have had a crisis of confidence followed by good seasons and a recovery that has really been the product of rain and the remarkable products of this environment of ours. I remember Chris Christian, who was an officer with the CSIRO, despairing after years of work in Central Australia, talking about the progressive degeneration of the species of the centre as a result of year after year of drought. We then had a series of good years, and suddenly out there, in the midst of what seemed an absolute desert, there was green grass, there was growth and the country bloomed again. The same thing happened when we got rid of rabbits. What I wanted to do when I had a look at this motion was think, `Now, I wonder whether or not the Government knows really what the environment is all about'. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested to hear the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly). I thought she might have come in here and given us something of that vision that she suggests the Opposition lacks. What did we get? We got a series of reports, all of which apparently are directed towards answers she believes are going to give us some great new world. I can tell the Minister that the great new world as achieved by the eradication of rabbits, the great new world as achieved by rain and water in the centre, has been far more about sustainable agriculture than anything in the paper and the reports that she has produced. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, the Minister might have done well had she been at a dinner attended by the Heavy Engineering Manufacturers Association the other night and heard Arvi Parbo, Chairman of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company and Chairman of Western Mining. He mentioned that committees, inquiries, task forces, studies and commissions have become a major growth industry in Australia-perhaps the only growth industry in recent times. He continued that if we could only export inquiries, studies and commissions our economic problems would be over.</PARA>
<PARA> Having heard the Minister today, I think that is really the Government's approach to the environment. I looked through the Budget and I thought, `Let us look at this and see how we are going to get that balance, which is what this motion is all about-how we are going to get that balance between jobs and protecting the environment'. I was fascinated to see that one of the measures is the Fraser Island structural adjustment package. What does that mean? It means that the Government is going to ensure there will be no more commercial logging on Fraser Island. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know whether many honourable members have been to Fraser Island, but I can assure them that I went to Fraser Island on occasions before and after sand mining. I have been one of those who have looked at some of the ghastly mining sites around Australia that were not restored following the mining of many rural areas 50 to 100 years ago, and I have worried about what was happening to the environment. I have some worries; I live in a mining area. I went to Fraser Island-I do not know whether honourable members have seen it-and I am dashed if I can tell the difference between the reconstructed mining areas and the lands that were not mined. If there is a difference, it is only because the land that has been replanted and reforested after mining looks better than the land that has not been mined. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is talking about providing $7m in 1991-92, $7m in 1992-93, $2.5m in 1993-94 in order to stop an industry. It is not about protecting the environment; it is about stopping people having jobs. If honourable members think that this is really what it is all about-the Minister might have forgotten-I point out that there is another small community, on the top of the Atherton Tableland. They are all small communities, and I want to just mention that in a moment. The Atherton Tableland is one of the most beautiful parts of the world. It is glorious country up there. As one goes down that eastern escarpment and comes over the top, one sees those tall trees. They have been farm managed-forest managed-for 100 years. There has been a cycle of taking logs out and reforestation. The Government decided that that was all; no, no, it should stop. So what did it do? It said it would terminate logging and introduce a compensation scheme. We all know what happened there. It introduced a compensation scheme, Ravenshoe is virtually shut down, and three-quarters of a million dollars was paid by this company to the wrong person. None of that money got to the people who were denied their jobs. So much for the sort of compensation that this Fraser Island structural adjustment package envisages! I regard it as one of the most abusive actions by any government in terms of exercising its proper responsibilities. That is the first part of our environment package. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested to see whether there was some other virtue in the package that the Minister adopted. She talks about the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency. I am one of those in this place who have heard the Prime Minister as President of the ACTU, in and out of industrial forums, and as Prime Minister over a few years now, and I have never really been greatly taken by his belief in his own honesty and the words he says, but I accept them at face value. I rather thought that there have been a series of Premiers Conferences that the Prime Minister held out as being the great achievement of Mr Hawke as Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> What was this great achievement about? It was about several things. The first was trying to get the Commonwealth and the States together, and the second was introducing a new reciprocity. We were going to have a common market in Australia. That common market in Australia meant that we were not going to have that overlap of regulation, so that if one State adopted a set of regulations with respect to food consumption, presumably with respect to environment protection, and presumably with respect to logging, then it was going to be accepted everywhere else around Australia. I listened to the Minister. She was talking about the Environment Protection Authority, the Resource Assessment Commission and this new waste management proposal that she suddenly found, and I gather that her whole concept-this national collection system-is all about establishing agreed standards. I tell the Minister that, if that is the only reason for the establishment of the EPA, then I can see that everything that Prime Minister Hawke has been telling us about the success of that last Premiers Conference is absolute rubbish. </PARA>
<PARA> I happen to believe in there being a common market in Australia. I happen to believe in the general concept that I thought the Prime Minister was talking about. The Leader of the Opposition has said that we in the coalition are only too prepared to cooperate with the Government in ensuring that there is this reciprocity and understanding between the States. That will mean that if a national collection system is adopted in one State and a process is set up-whether it is tyres or all those wonderful products that the Challenge Foundation pursues, such as paper, plastics and aluminium recycling, which are already in place-we do not need to set up a new statutory authority in order to get cooperation. We need to make sure the rhetoric of the Prime Minister is put into being. That is what it is all about. If the Minister wants to get cooperation, she should go back to the words that the Prime Minister uttered after the last Premiers Conference, and forget about setting up another statutory authority for the purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> Does the Minister know what this matter of public importance is all about? I thought the shadow Minister for the environment, the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney), properly addressed it. He talked about the billion dollar investment that BHP is making outside Australia. We all opened our financial papers this morning and we saw what, to me, is an absolute disaster story. The headline is `Coal write-offs and MIM's profit 97pc lower to $6.9m'. </PARA>
<PARA> Like many of us, I get around Australia quite a deal, and I have been talking to many of these major mining companies. Can the Minister tell me when the last major new investment in mining in Australia occurred? I will tell her. </PARA>

If an export consciousness is going to be developed, of course the environment has to be preserved and emphasised, but there has to be a balance. Unless we have an export consciousness, unless we allow our miners to mine, unless we allow our investors to invest, unless we develop Australian capacity, there will be no future and the one million unemployed Australians will grow to 1.5 million, and their number will continue to grow. We must get a balance. We must allow development. Certainly, we must protect the environment. We do not do it by continuing to develop new agencies and new authorities.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find that a pretty stilted set of observations from the Opposition, as if there are only jobs at the expense of the environment, or vice versa. The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) has not read the words of the matter of public importance brought on by the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney). He says, `to deliver satisfactory environmental and economic outcomes'. Of course, the word `satisfactory' begs the question: what is a satisfactory outcome between jobs and the environment in a particular physical investment on a particular environment? The point is that we do not know until we test it. We do not know whether Coronation Hill should or should not be mined until it is tested. We clearly tested it and we felt that Coronation Hill should not be mined. That is the end of the matter. This Government decided on the basis of the merits of the case that it should not mine Coronation Hill. Do those opposite know why it was such a difficult decision? The reason is that it was a complex matter. Members of the Opposition really hate complexity. They would rather criticise the Government and say, `Look, it's easy, you don't stop any mines because mines are good for this economy'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On balance, mines are good for this economy, but because we have a consciousness about the environment that does not mean we have stopped every mine in the country. We clearly have not. We have stopped a very small number of mining jobs in this country, and for very good reason. A question that can never be answered is: when is the time to say no? That is the difficulty members of the Opposition have. Can they ever say, `No, you shouldn't' to a miner, a property developer or a tourist developer? From time to time we do. We say no. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Name it? They are a thousand miles long. The honourable member does not understand that there are mines opening every day of the year in this country. They are not all big ones. We can talk about the North West Shelf as long as we like, but those sorts of activities are subject to exploration. Deposits of oil, gas, coal, gold, nickel, or whatever have to be found. It is then mined, subject to the most important thing-the environment. The opening of a major mine depends upon the mineral being found. It is a question of exploration. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the environmental imperative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my electorate of Petrie there are some mangroves on the fringes of the Pine River. It is currently proposed by a developer to put a canal estate there. I am absolutely opposed to building houses on the mangroves. But there might come a time when there was something that was economically absolutely essential, such as a Brisbane airport. There has to be a particular economic reason to destroy an environment. </PARA>
<PARA> If I were put in a position where I had to argue the case for saving the mangroves of Pine River and I knew that Brisbane needed an airport, an extension to a runway or whatever, then I would understand the immense importance of a runway to the economy of Brisbane and Queensland. I might have to say, `Fill the mangroves'. If I were given something that is less important economically, such as a canal estate--</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Chaney interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JH4">Mr JOHNS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course I would, subject to those things. A canal estate is really something that is not that important to the economy at all, because those houses can be built elsewhere. In other words, if there were a choice as to the location of a particular physical infrastructure and investment, then presumably the choice would be to save the environment. In my case, we must not have a canal estate on the southern side of the Pine River; we must save those mangroves. I am not saying that those mangroves are sacrosanct for all time. I hope they are. But if there is a really essential development, then maybe they get filled in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So the name of the game is one of measurement and judgment. Unfortunately, we do not have a nice simple unitary system of government. The Commonwealth actually has very few powers which it can use to save the Australian environment. But we use them to the nth degree. We have used the Commonwealth's powers magnificently over the last eight years. I might say that we have done so almost to exhaustion. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth merely has residual powers to stop projects. We have used them, as did the Fraser Government way back to stop sandmining on Fraser Island. The Fraser Government cancelled the export licences of sandminers on Fraser Island. I think it is the only time-certainly it was the first time-that that was done. The notion of sovereign risk was thrown around this place after the Coronation Hill decision. Sandmining on Fraser Island was the first real instance of this notion being thrown at any Commonwealth government. Thank goodness the sandminers were stopped by the Liberal-National Party Government of Malcolm Fraser!</PARA>
<PARA> I guess one of the difficulties is that the Commonwealth Government has become something like a court of appeal on environmental matters. If one side or another in a particular development does not get its way, it tends to appeal to local, to State, to Federal government. We are very conscious of that. In a sense, we are used as a final court of appeal. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) is attempting to do, and does day by day, is sort out those things that the Commonwealth will become involved in and those things that it will not become involved in. That is a question of judgment for government. We do not want to run the whole country but we would love to see each State government have the same rules and standards on the emission of materials into the air and water. So an EPA needs to be established because we would like to have national standards on air quality and water quality. </PARA>
<PARA> Big companies want national standards. Big companies that are based in three or four different States are sick of operating according to three or four sets of rules. They would like a single set of rules nationwide. So, in fact, business-the blokes who create jobs-would like to see the Commonwealth Government set a single set of standards. We are providing that set of standards. </PARA>
<PARA> But honourable members know that we cannot just legislate for national standards. We do not have the powers to do so. We have to negotiate with six State governments. We work with those governments. There is a little bit of prodding and, no doubt, a little bit of money changes hands to sort of free them up a bit. But at the end of the day, they will come with us and we will be able to achieve uniform standards on the question of pollution, emissions and so on. As a result business will be in our debt. For the first time in 200 years business will be able to get on with the business of creating jobs, knowing that it will face the same set of environmental standards throughout the nation. I applaud the Minister for this terrific achievement and fantastic breakthrough. </PARA>
<PARA> The right honourable member for New England reminisced about when he was a boy. When I was a boy I lived in the inner suburbs of Melbourne next to a railway station. My family never owned a car. We always travelled by bus and train. Of course, now I live in the middle suburbs and I have two cars-and I feel guilty about that. But we have produced cities that require us to have one or two cars. The only way that we can turn that around, diminish our call on energy and diminish air pollution is by encouraging direct government intervention. We have to try to change the rules of play somewhat so that it is economically sensible for me to live on a smaller block of land near a railway station and not be so reliant on two cars. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an example of how governments sometimes have to intervene in the market. It just has to be done. Governments just have to take the bit between their teeth in order to save the environment. We are quite prepared to do that. For instance, under the better cities program of the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe), in conjunction with the private sector, we will attempt to do that. We are not going to build the medium density houses that I would like to see--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> (4.56 p.m.) I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill proposes amendments to the Crimes Act 1914 to provide police officers with powers to search aircraft, vehicles or vessels in emergency situations. </PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth legislation currently confers emergency search powers on a wide range of officials, including police, in relation to offences against specific enactments. However, no such powers are conferred on the police in relation to the vast majority of Commonwealth offences. This is despite the fact that the Australian Federal Police is the Commonwealth's primary law enforcement agency. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past the Australian Federal Police relied on emergency search powers conferred in State and Territory laws and applied by section 9 of the Australian Federal Police Act. A recent court decision in South Australia indicated that State law could not be applied in this way because section 10 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act covers the field. Section 10, however, provides for searches authorised by warrant only. </PARA>
<PARA> I appreciate that there will always be concern in some quarters about providing police with additional powers. In this case we are giving the police powers which they have always been able to exercise in the past and which are common to police forces in other jurisdictions. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment is designed to provide a clear basis for police action in emergency situations across the various jurisdictions in relation to Commonwealth and Territory offences. </PARA>
<PARA> The powers proposed are limited. It is proposed that emergency search powers should only apply in public places or in some other place to which members of the public have ready access. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, a police officer will only be able to stop, detain and search a conveyance in public places if he or she suspects on reasonable grounds that:</PARA>
<PARA> an item relevant to an indictable offence is in or on the conveyance. </PARA>
<PARA> it is necessary to stop, detain and search the conveyance to prevent the thing from being concealed, lost or destroyed; and</PARA>
<PARA> the circumstances are so serious and urgent that it is necessary to exercise this power without obtaining the authority of a search warrant. </PARA>
<PARA>When conducting the search, the officer may only use such assistance as is necessary and must not detain the conveyance for longer than necessary. The officer may also use force if necessary, but must not force open parts of the conveyance or receptacles found during the course of the search without first giving the person in charge of the conveyance the opportunity to open them. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, once an item has been seized, further safeguards come into play. Police officers may only retain items for 60 days after their seizure. At the end of this period they must either take steps to return the thing to the person from whom it was seized or to its owner, unless the thing is required for evidence, is subject to a further order allowing the officer to retain it or the officer is otherwise authorised by law to retain, dispose of or destroy the thing. </PARA>
<PARA> Such powers are essential for the effective operation of the Australian Federal Police, particularly in their investigations concerning drug offences. The movement of narcotics is essential to their effective marketing and provides an opportunity for detection and interdiction by an appropriately empowered investigating force. Other offences, particularly those involving the use of firearms or explosives, often call for the exercise of emergency search powers. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Bill provides effective powers for police to protect our society and enforce its laws without unduly infringing upon the privacy and freedom of movement of individuals. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Amendment Bill gives effect to the Government's undertakings to provide an improved benefit under the Defence Force home loans assistance scheme for those personnel who served in the Middle East. Further, the amendments will recognise other operational service of Defence Force members who choose to revoke their entitlement to the defence service homes loan in order to join the new scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The Defence Force home loans assistance scheme, now known as Defence HomeOwner, provides a subsidised housing loan of $40,000 for members of the Defence Force who joined after 14 May 1985. Interest on the loan is subsidised to the extent of 40 per cent of the average interest that would ordinarily be payable over the term of the loan; the individual is required to meet the remaining 60 per cent. The scheme commenced operation on 15 May 1991, and to the end of July some 41 loans had been provided by the National Australia Bank, the authorised lender under the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Defence HomeOwner was essentially designed as a peacetime replacement for the defence service homes scheme, which was closed on 14 May 1985. Defence HomeOwner encourages retention of personnel, and when introduced was not geared to provide a benefit based on war or operational service. Payment of the available interest subsidy is currently linked to completed years of service with a requirement for an initial period of service of six years, for which subsidy is not payable. The existing concession for personnel deployed on operational service in the Gulf is waiver of this six-year basic service period, which is a similar concession to that available under the defence service homes scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises that, in view of the efforts of our personnel who served in the Middle East during the Gulf war, a revised benefit is appropriate, indeed necessary. Therefore the Government now proposes, as further recognition of these efforts, to provide under Defence HomeOwner a minimum benefit of 16 years subsidy, regardless of length of service. Naturally, in the case of those who serve past the 16-year point, subsidy will continue to accrue at the normal rate to a maximum of 20 years. As widows or widowers of eligible members have the same entitlement that their spouse had accrued at the time of death, the 16-year benefit of deceased Gulf members will pass to the surviving spouse. </PARA>
<PARA> The 16-year subsidy period was selected because the amount of subsidy payable over this period equated to the subsidy payable on a defence service homes loan. This was based on present values and the interest rate applying at the time of the Government's decision. </PARA>
<PARA> Another change introduced by this Bill is the waiver of the six-year basic eligibility period for Defence Force personnel with operational service prior to the Gulf war who revoke their entitlement to a defence service homes loan in favour of Defence HomeOwner. Under the defence service homes scheme, members with operational service have no basic qualifying period, and it is considered that this benefit should be applicable to personnel with operational service whichever home loan scheme the serving member chooses. </PARA>
<PARA> A further amendment re-defines the Middle East operational area for the purposes of the Act to include Iraq and Kuwait in accordance with the declaration made at the commencement of the ground war. It also sets a cut-off date of 9 June 1991 for operational service in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> Precise costing of providing the 16-year subsidy to Defence Force personnel with Gulf service is not possible, because each year of service offsets one year of subsidy, and it is difficult to estimate how many years each member will serve. Other variables include the interest rates and annual take-up rates of the loan. </PARA>
<PARA> Assuming an interest rate of 13 per cent, average resignation rates and an annual take-up rate of 20 per cent of those eligible, the cost over the next four financial years would be $1.65m. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation provides additional housing loan benefits to members of the Defence Force who have served their country on operational service as a member of Australia's contingent in the recent Gulf crisis, and builds on the worthwhile and effective scheme introduced earlier in the year by the Government. </PARA>

<PARA>Very briefly, the proposed Select Committee on the Print Media arises out of a substantial degree of public concern that has been expressed in recent times about the question of concentration of media ownership in the area of the print media. Of course, that is not the only issue which is addressed, as honourable members will see if they study the terms of reference; it will be an opportunity also to examine a whole series of matters internal to the print media industry, and also, unquestionably, the Committee would consider issues related to government broadcasting policy in the electronic media and any concerns about the question of cross-media ownership which might arise from that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government intends to take cognisance of the advice of the Committee. From time to time in the next few months, there will be issues which the Government will be required to address. Because some of those issues are of reasonably immediate prospect, there is a requirement, the Government believes, to have advice as rapidly as possible. A schedule has been imposed on the Committee requiring it to respond by the end of this sitting-before Christmas-but there is also provision, if it wishes, to report in bits or in whole at an earlier date than that. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is going to be a very important Committee. The issue of resources of the Committee will arise, and that is a matter that will be discussed between the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), the Speaker and me reasonably soon in order to ensure that the Committee obtains the support it needs to do the job it should do in the time allocated. The Committee is the normal size of a House of Representatives committee, which is 12-seven members of the Government and five from the Opposition. Although it is a select committee, the conditions under which it operates are very much those conditions that apply to the standing committees that this Parliament has established. </PARA>
<PARA> Personally, as Leader of the House, I take some considerable pleasure that in this important area of policy my colleagues have chosen to locate the processes of this Committee in the House of Representatives. This is the House in which the Executive must predominate in order for a government to be formed. As a result of that, from time to time members of this House have missed out on opportunities to undertake investigative-type activities that have been seized by the Senate since the late 1960s. </PARA>
<PARA> We are beginning to change that somewhat in this place; but I think that process can only be added to, and the reputation and standing of this chamber advanced, by our being able to consider matters which a government is most concerned about-not necessarily in a bipartisan way. I would be most surprised if this produced a bipartisan outcome but at least it will be multi-party. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought this matter might have been coming on after the dinner break but, in any event, it is here now. I indicate, on behalf of the Opposition, that we will cooperate with the inquiry. I have stated publicly, on behalf of the Opposition, that we do not particularly welcome this inquiry because it is clearly a product of a political deal that arose at the recent national ALP convention in the City of Hobart in the State of Tasmania. Perhaps that is a matter for debate at another time. We have made those points quite clearly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We do not believe this is going to discover anything new in terms of this issue. It is interesting that the Opposition is on the record as having raised this matter when the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs raised this question in 1989 with the mergers, monopolies and takeovers inquiry. It was recommended to the Government that the Trade Practices Commission look at competitive aspects in the media industry to see what role there might be for the Commonwealth. It is of interest that there has been no response to that 1989 inquiry, and that is to be regretted. In our view, the central elements involved in this inquiry are about ensuring continued pluralism, enhancing the diversity of sources of information and ensuring that there is a true adherence to competition policy in this country. In the media, quite clearly, in a whole range of areas there is not that opportunity at the present time to take that approach rather than this approach. Many of us fear there will be further demonisation of media proprietors, which does not enhance the addressing of the principles which need to be looked at in this particular area. That is an area with which we have concern. As I said, it is a product of a political deal, and that was evidenced so clearly in the last 24 hours where we have moved from a nine-member inquiry to a 12-member inquiry to accommodate the factions. If ever there needed to be an example of the fact that this is--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member can be assured when he sees the list that comes out that there has been absolute, total unanimity on this side as to what our approach ought to be. In any event, there has never been a better example of the factions at work than what has taken place over the last 24 hours. We have had to see the number of the inquiry increased to accommodate all of the factions in the ALP-even the independent faction. We will come to the inquiry with a view of cooperation, but with a great deal of scepticism and, indeed, criticism of the basis upon which it is proceeded. The time frame is going to be somewhat demanding, but the Opposition is used to working under great pressure imposed by the Government. It is an unreasonableness that it sets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We will accommodate that time frame. The Government should be aware that, in addressing a matter which has some elements of extreme importance to the community, such a short time frame limits the ability of the Committee members to address in a deep and meaningful way the very major issues which this Committee will be addressing. With those few words, can I say that we will be back on 19 December with a report, and we will await to see whether or not it is unanimous. I am sure there will be many on the other side wanting to join us in the views that we will be putting forward-based, as they are, on reasonableness and principle. We will see whether or not the Government comes with us. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have heard what the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner) has said with regard to the amendments. I believe that the amendments we proposed, which were passed in the Senate and which the Government has accepted, were made necessary because of an attempt by the Government to use unequal power against the users of certain quarantine facilities. I believe the exercise of that power has been most unfair. It has united all sectors in Australia's livestock industry against what the Government was proposing to do. I want to make the point that there is great concern about the attempt by the Government, at a difficult time, to change the rules of the game in relation to establishing costs-who should pay and at what level-for the importation of certain animals and/or genetic material.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that generally we have a very good range of facilities and procedures for providing access to Australia for improved animal genetic material, which is very important for the future of our livestock industries. I make the point that AQIS and successive governments have been very successful in general terms. But in this situation a crisis of confidence and uncertainty has been created by this proposed new legislation. There has to be a feeling of certainty amongst those who want to import that when they make their calculations about whether or not it will be profitable for them to do so-to the extent that anybody can do that ahead of the quarantine period-those calculations will not be upset by arbitrary changes to the rules or the costs on the way through; hence the dates that were included in that amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> In the longer term it seems sensible for those who are thinking of using the quarantine facilities to require commercial contracts. Without that I think it would be very hard to regain the confidence of some of those who may wish to import in the future. I see that as a very sensible way to do business anyway. We support the amendments, and I acknowledge to the Minister the Government's acceptance of the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) opened the Opposition's contribution to the debate on the Budget-or that is what he was supposed to do. In fact, he engaged in a wild and reckless tirade. In debates in this House the Opposition Leader is fond of referring to the loony Left. I must say that after listening to his speech today it is clear who is loony, and it certainly is not the Left.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> His speech-this wild and reckless tirade-was a litany of false accusations, extravagant claims, extraordinary hypocrisy, a total lack of analysis, and a complete absence of any alternative strategy. Some of his accusations were almost unbelievable. For instance, at various points of his tirade he wept crocodile tears for the unemployed and said that this Budget showed a lack of compassion. This really is absolutely extraordinary, coming from someone who advocates cutting off unemployment benefits after nine months. </PARA>
<PARA> He would like us to believe that he really has the interests of the unemployed at heart; that he and the Party he represents, if it ever came into government, would be really concerned about the unemployed, despite the fact that when they were in government they could not produce anything like the rate of jobs this Government has produced. They treated the unemployed with disdain and gave them much less in the way of real benefits than this Government has given them. Nevertheless, he would have us believe that his Party has the interests of the unemployed at heart. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not for one moment think that the Leader of the Opposition, or anyone behind him, loses any sleep at night over the position of the unemployed. The Opposition supports a policy of cutting off unemployment benefits after nine months, saying to the unemployed, `You can go out there and do your best. Beg, starve, rob or whatever, but do not come back to us for anything unless you are absolutely at desperation point, and then we might give you special benefits'. That is the Opposition's position in relation to the unemployed. For God's sake, let us not have any more talk about how we lack compassion for the unemployed when the Opposition's position on the unemployed is such a horrendous one. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the Better Cities program, he derided it and said that it would produce things such as designer soup kitchens. I suppose that if someone has a mansion in the salubrious suburb of Bellevue Hill in Sydney, another mansion in the almost equally salubrious town of Bowral, and a stack of cars from which to choose to drive between the two mansions-including a Ferrari, as he proudly boasted here today, and, when he became Opposition Leader, a Mercedes, a Jaguar and a Rolls Royce-who cares about crowded, inefficient public transport? Who cares about the urban sprawl? Who cares about the lack of services for people in outer suburban areas and the long distances they have to travel? Who cares about pollution in suburban areas? Who cares about chemical hazards in suburban areas? Who cares about anything except the state of the road between two mansions? That is all the Leader of the Opposition is concerned about-so he can get from one to the other in the shortest possible time and enjoy the drive in his expensive cars. I think the position of the Opposition on this issue, in deriding a program such as the Better Cities program, is demonstrative of its lack of understanding and concern for ordinary people. </PARA>
<PARA> Amazingly, the Leader of the Opposition also accused this Government of allowing tax rorts, when this is the Government that shut down the rampant tax avoidance industry that prevailed whilst the Leader of the Opposition was an adviser to the Treasurer under the Fraser Government, when the tax avoidance industry was described by the investigator as a growth industry. It was virtually the only growth industry that Government had. We shut down that industry. Apart from our stopping the tax avoidance industry, we have cleaned up the tax Act in a multitude of ways to ensure that we do not have tax rorts, that we do not continue to have untaxed capital gains or untaxed fringe benefits, which the Opposition wanted to keep. What extraordinary humbug it is to accuse this Government of maintaining tax rorts when the Opposition parties are the ones who, historically, in government have allowed the tax rorts and in opposition have defended them. </PARA>
<PARA> The most outrageous misrepresentation of this Government's Budget by the Leader of the Opposition was that it offers no hope for economic recovery and no prospects for the unemployed. In this he misleads the Australian people in a most serious way. The fact is that this will be a year of economic recovery and one in which employment growth returns and unemployment starts to fall. This is a year in which we can build growth in a more sustainable way than we have in the past-indeed, at any time in the postwar era. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to look at the prosects for growth this year. There is hope; there is the prospect of economic recovery and job growth this year. Our forecasts in relation to GDP are for real growth through the year of 3 3/4 per cent. That compares with a decline in GDP last year, which certainly was a bad year, of 2.4 per cent. So it is a tremendous turnaround from last year. Instead of GDP falling, we have it increasing by 3 3/4 per cent, with non-farm product increasing by 4 per cent through the year. </PARA>
<PARA> What is driving that growth? There are various factors. Dwelling investment is driving that growth. It is expected to increase by 14 1/2 per cent through the year, compared to a decline of 7.2 per cent last year. The figures out today on housing finance certainly lend credibility to the estimate of a substantial recovery in dwelling investment. Increases in stocks have been run down by approximately $2.25 billion in the last couple of years, but they have now reached the point where, with recovery, there will be a need for them to be rebuilt. We expect that to add one half of one per cent to GDP this year. That compares with a decline of 1.2 per cent in GDP last year in relation to stocks. </PARA>
<PARA> Private consumption expenditure will increase because real wages will increase. We expect that to increase by 1 3/4 per cent through this year compared to less than one per cent last year. Net exports made an enormous contribution to growth last year. That was certainly the one positive factor operating in 1990-91. That was still expected to contribute 1 1/4 per cent in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has said, `Yes, but you aren't going to get business investment this year; business investment year on year will be further down'. That is true, but through the year business investment will show a slight increase. One would not expect it to be a leading indicator. Business investment will follow as the recovery occurs. At a time of excess capacity, why would people be investing in more capacity? As recovery occurs we will see business investment come. It will not lead the recovery, it will add to it. Plant and equipment, nevertheless, is expected through the course of this year to increase by 6 1/4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> With that recovery occurring we will begin to get increased employment through the year. Over the year we will certainly not have an increase in employment on the Budget figuring, but through the year employment will begin to increase. Last year was certainly a bad one on the employment front. Employment fell by 196,000 and unemployment rose by 230,000. The unemployment rate went from 6.7 per cent to 9.3 per cent. This year will not be anything like that. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am absolutely sure. Employment will not show any further fall later in the year. It fell substantially in the first month of this year, in July, and may well fall further within the next few months, but it is likely to resume growth in the second half of the year. We expect growth of about 1 1/4 per cent in the second half of the year. This year will see the unemployment rate come down from its peak. It will go up to a peak of about 10 3/4 per cent and begin to come down in the second half of the year, and of course it will fall further as growth continues and picks up pace in 1992-93. So our rate of employment growth-even despite the loss of some 300,000 jobs-is still over three times the rate of growth per annum that the Fraser Government was able to achieve. It is over three times as high, despite the job losses in the last year. So we know how to create jobs. We will get back onto a job growth path, and we will do that in 1992. We will see strong growth occurring from that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Inflation had a significant fall in 1991. We had inflation falling down to 3 per cent because of the low wage growth and the impact of recession. The CPI fell to 3.4 per cent in the course of 1990-91. That is the lowest rate for over 20 years and well below that of our major trading partners. Except for 1980 Australia has not had inflation below the level of our major trading partners since the early 1970s. It is important that we now lock in that low inflation, if possible below that of our trading partners, for improved competitiveness, for export growth, for current account improvement. If we can keep inflation low while we move back to substantial economic employment growth, that will be the most important structural adjustment that this country can achieve-and that is certainly our objective. We have that within our grasp and we are determined to achieve it. </PARA>
<PARA> In that respect we are given comfort by the fact that the agreement that we have with the ACTU, which was worked out a week or two ago, includes these words:</PARA>
<PARA>In respect of 1992-93 and future years, the parties agree to work towards wage outcomes consistent with keeping Australia's inflation at levels comparable with those of our major trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the agreement we have with the ACTU-to keep inflation comparable with the level of our major trading partners. That is a very important development because it is not something which Australia has enjoyed in the past 20 years. If we can get to the stage where our inflation rate is at the level of our major trading partners in the long term, or less, this will be an enormous boost to the Australian nation. We believe that is something which is definitely achievable because of that agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the current account deficit, last year there was a dramatic improvement from 6 per cent of GDP down to 4 per cent in 1991. This year it is expected to fall to 3 1/2 per cent. This could lead us this year to the point of stabilisation of our foreign debt as a percentage of GDP, an achievement previously thought to be years away. Yet the Leader of the Opposition in his speech today said that there is nothing in this Budget to assist with the current account deficit, that there is nothing in this Budget to assist with the problem of our foreign debt, when in fact the current account is almost half of what it was to be as a proportion of GDP two years ago, and we could well stabilise our foreign debt as a proportion of GDP this year. What an absurd statement by the Leader of the Opposition. It is a total misrepresentation. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the improvements in the current account have been helped by the impact of the recession on imports, it is also substantially due to the enormous improvement in our export performance which flows from our level of international competitiveness being now 18 per cent better than it was in 1982-83. This will be further improved by our low inflation rate in 1991-92. Our exports of manufactured goods have more than doubled in real terms in the last seven years, growing by 112 per cent or an annual rate of 11.3 per cent. Last year they increased by a phenomenal 20 per cent. Our export base is therefore being rapidly broadened. We are moving away from this Third World pattern of exports which the previous Government left us with, when there was an overwhelming concentration on primary products, to a more sophisticated array of exports. That is very much to the credit of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> So it is absurd to describe this as a `do nothing' Budget with no hope for the future. This is a Budget which will take us back to recovery, and to a recovery which is solidly based. It will be a recovery based on low inflation, on the current account deficit being at a sustainable level, and it is certainly a Budget which gives great hope for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to structural adjustment, this is a Budget which continues the Government's drive for structural adjustment of the Australian economy, a drive which goes far beyond anything ever undertaken or even contemplated by previous governments. It has involved a multitude of initiatives to shift resources to areas of greater competitive advantage, to increase efficiency of our industries, to develop a productive culture, to increase the level of competitiveness in our markets, to improve skills and education levels in our work force, and to develop Australia as a clever country and not the lazy, lucky, resource reliant country it has been for most of this century. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not go to the details due to lack of time, but look at the National Rail Freight Corporation, a dramatic initiative for rail freight; the area of higher education, where there are tremendous improvements; the area of science, where there are again tremendous improvements; language and literacy, where there is a very substantial increase in resources of about 23 per cent; and support for the multifunction polis. So there is certainly a concentration of efforts to extend further our array of activity in relation to structural adjustment. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also a lot of social improvements. The only one I have time to refer to is universal superannuation for wage and salary earners. This is a spectacular social improvement which will, over time, provide all wage and salary earners with the opportunity to retire with a living standard somewhat akin to that which they had during their working lives. For blue-collar workers especially this is a tremendous change. The great majority of them had no superannuation at all until the 3 per cent awarded by the Industrial Relations Commission a few years ago, so they retired with no more than a pat on the back from the boss and the old age pension to keep them in their retirement. By providing a minimum requirement of a 9 per cent employer contribution for superannuation by the end of the century, supported by at least another 3 per cent from employees, we will have young workers entering the work force now being assured of retiring, in 40 or 45 years time from now, with a level of superannuation which will enable them to have something like half or more of their earnings during their working life as a retirement benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> But what does the Opposition say about all this? It says it is a payroll tax, that it will cost 100,000 jobs. What absolute rubbish! The fact is that about 75 per cent of wage and salary earners already have some superannuation, at least the 3 per cent awarded by the Commission, and this number is continuing to further increase as there is increased compliance. </PARA>
<PARA> For those employers not complying with their existing legal obligation to pay the 3 per cent superannuation contribution, the levy will impose a cost, but a cost which in large part they should already have been meeting. If they are small employers with payrolls of less than $500,000, it will not impose any more obligation than they had as a result of the award decision. So it is absurd to say that the superannuation guarantee is like a payroll tax. A payroll tax would apply to all employers, regardless of how much superannuation they were paying. The levy applies only if the employer is not making the required superannuation contribution. By July next year, probably 80 per cent or more of employees will already have a superannuation contribution being made on their behalf. So the levy will impose little or no cost on employers with respect to the great majority of employees. </PARA>
<PARA> As for the 100,000 job loss, one can only assume that the superannuation contribution will be a complete add-on to labour cost if one works out that kind of job loss or any job loss. In fact, as I have already shown, it will have little or no effect with respect to the great majority of employees. But in so far as it does add to overall labour costs, it will need to be taken into account in determining the overall wages outcome. The ACTU has agreed to that. It said in our agreement that improvements in superannuation will be taken into account in future accord negotiations. In other words, we do not just pile it on top of the wages outcome; it is part of the wages outcome; it will be included as part of the wages outcome. It is absolute nonsense to say it will be some add-on and will cost 100,000 jobs. It is an absurd and totally ridiculous argument. The superannuation contribution will be part of a wages outcome. A hallmark of this Government has been its responsibility in wages outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA> The lowest wages outcome in any year of the Fraser Government was 7.4 per cent; the average was over 11 per cent. The highest wages outcome for any year of the Hawke Government was 7.4 per cent, exactly the same level as the lowest level for any year under the Fraser Government. Those opposite need not tell us about wages control. We have made that an art form, and superannuation will be taken into account in the continuance of a responsible wages policy. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other improvements in this Budget which I cannot refer to, but let me refer in my last few minutes to the Opposition's alternative Budget. The first thing to say is that the Leader of the Opposition had no alternative. He spoke for the best part of half an hour and had no alternative. He put out a press release today saying that we could have had a balanced Budget. This press release says that this Government spent $2 billion on new policy and had revenue giveaways of another $2 billion, and that if we had not done that we could have had a balanced Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> What that implies is that we should not have done either. The $2 billion of revenue giveaways was the income tax cuts that came in in January-their full year impact. Apparently the Opposition opposes those tax cuts, because it says that they are revenue giveaways and we should have used them to balance the Budget. Another part was removing the sales tax off business inputs announced in March. The Opposition is against that too. Another part was the loss of revenue from tariff cuts. Apparently it is against tariff cuts too. So its policy is absolutely hopelessly confused. It argues for income tax cuts; it argues for taking imposts off business; and it argues for tariff cuts-and then it says that we should not have these revenue giveaways. What a hopeless lot Opposition members really are. To top it off, they say we should solve the recession by a consumption tax, despite the fact that countries such as the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Canada all have a consumption tax and all have a recession.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In following the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) I must say it is refreshing to see him come out of the woodwork after months of beavering away on the ERC and Budget committees. At least he certainly wrote his own speech and ploughed into it. But he got it wrong. It is not just me saying he got it wrong, and not just the Liberal and National parties saying he got it wrong. Let me refer to the editorial in the Age the day after the Budget under the heading `Kerin's do-nothing, be-patient budget'. Let me refer to an article in the Sydney Morning Herald the day after the Budget, which said: `Why Kerin's Budget fails'. If that is not good enough, let me refer to an article in the Sydney Morning Herald of 21 August written by one Maximillian Walsh, who, with plenty of good contacts on both sides of this House, reached this conclusion:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Save us-this one's mad, bad and dodgy, to boot. </PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>This really is a bad Budget-dodgy, pork barrelling, and full of rubbery figures. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition Leader, Dr John Hewson, is spot on when he describes the Budget as a document without an economic strategy, consisting of deals aimed at shoring up the Prime Minister's position. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a brief selection from some of the commentary arising from the Budget beyond Parliament House, which I will now add to following the excellent response to the Budget given by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) this afternoon. I want to then pick up one other point arising from the speech by the Minister for Finance when he said that this Budget will pave the way for an enhancement of our export effort for increased exports of the diversified kind. </PARA>
<PARA> I will tell honourable members what this Government policy does for exports, and I will quote a senior public servant in the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, one Dr John Bell, because he admitted some few weeks ago in the middle of the winter recess that, as a direct consequence of this Government's policies in respect of indirect taxes, Australian exporters are placed at a 5 per cent disadvantage. They are not my words, they are not the words of the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) and they are not the words of the Leader of the Opposition; they are a direct assessment by a senior public servant that the Government's sales tax and indirect tax structure in Australia is placing our exporters at a 5 per cent disadvantage. This Budget reaffirms that policy setting, and indeed this Budget takes another $9 billion off all Australians pursuant to the imposition of wholesale sales tax. Of that, $3 billion or thereabouts is on transport, freight and transport equipment, thereby adding greatly to the cost structure of so many people in rural and regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the House in unequivocal terms that, if we are going to have this export led recovery to which the Minister for Finance made brief reference, then let him go back and follow the advice tendered by Dr Bell of the Department of Industry when he refers to that 5 per cent disadvantage factor. Let him structure a Budget which will abolish sales tax and provide for the removal of that $1 billion to $2 billion of indirect taxes denting our export effort and placing us on a less than competitive footing with OECD competitors. Already 22 out of 24 of our OECD competitors have taken the necessary steps to give their export industries a fair go, especially with regard to indirect taxes. So I reject the criticisms of the Minister for Finance. I point to the reality of the circumstance facing Australia as one which I think is borne out best by travelling around Australia, beyond the cocoon of Canberra, and speaking and listening to the sorts of people who are the backbone of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> What we hear is a clear recognition and understanding of Australia's desperate economic circumstances and very bitter criticism of this Government's incompetence. There is an acceptance of the need for an adjustment, and acceptance of a need for reform, but absolute frustration that they have had all this pain over eight years and no real fundamental gain. Their standard of living has slipped further and further behind and their tax structure has increased and increased, especially for the PAYE earner, as the Leader of the Opposition so accurately pointed out this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to put that in the context of some of the specific people I met during the winter recess; for example, the dragline operator near Blackwater. He is a young family man, married, with a wife and four children and on the maximum 47 per cent income tax rate. As he digs away at that coal and operates that sophisticated machine, he is clobbered for any extra incentive he might want to embark upon in terms of his economic circumstance. </PARA>
<PARA> I move on to the cattlemen at Oak Park. It has been a very fragile season around Oak Park, between Townsville and Mount Isa. They too are being clobbered by the tax structure imposed by this Government and reaffirmed by this Government in this Budget, especially so far as beef exports are concerned. Then there is the hydro power station operator at Khancoban, in my electorate, with a family. His wife is not able to obtain work. Recently she lost part time employment in the area because of the economic contraction. He is paying massive levels of income tax and, what is more, paying pretty savage levels of sales tax even at a place such as Khancoban, in relative proximity to Melbourne and Sydney, by dint of the sales tax on transport, freight and transport equipment. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the tourist crocodile farm operator in Darwin in the Northern Territory. I also refer to aquaculture and mariculture, which have no sales tax exemption in respect of those types of primary production and which equally get clobbered-although crocodile farming does figure in some elements of that. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Budget we have a reaffirmation of a very ramshackle sales tax regime which is ripping the heart out of the viability of so many small business operators and farmers and so many families. As the honourable member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey) and others have pointed out, the average family has been clobbered time and again by sales tax. We do offer an alternative, a clear cut sense of direction and an economic reform agenda. One of the key parts of that agenda is the absolute commitment to bring about the total abolition of sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of the people I met understood that their interest rates and the resultant recession and unemployment levels have all been policy induced. It is the recession that we `had to have'. It is the recession that the average Australian voter will never forgive the honourable member for Blaxland or the Federal Labor Government for `having to have'. Those opposite on the Government side should not underestimate the bitterness and the spleen vented about the cost the Australian people are bearing because of the Government's sheer incompetence. Many also understand Australia's escalating foreign debt and the importance of reversing the economic descent into recession. Indeed, Treasurer Kerin used the word `depression' yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable members want some different statistics for a change, to move away from the economic statistics, let me acquaint the House with the electricity sales growth short term outlook. They are official figures collected from independent sources associated with Electricity Commission activity in Australia. They show that in 1989-90 the Australian electricity grid-and sales growth of electricity-was set to grow at 5.6 per cent and did that. In 1990-91, the last financial year, that growth had plunged to 2.6 per cent. What is the projection for this current financial year? It is 2.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> If we want to get to the epicentre of this recession, perhaps we do not need that combined NFF-Government study of where the recession is hurting most. If I look at the figures for Victoria I see that it is 4.3 per cent, plunging to 0.6 per cent and then to 1.1 per cent. That is at the coalface and it is another indication of economic activity. That shows that Australia is in deep trouble on a range of fronts, not the least of which relates to the 800,000 people who are jobless, now breasting one million, for whom this Budget provides, and that is unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1991 Budget offers only inertia. It betrays the Australian people. It betrays the average Mr and Mrs Worker. It betrays so many objectives and visions for Australia in a way which is unacceptable. Its prescription is more of the same. This Government has given up the right to lead Australia. It is not leading; it is following the demands of the ACTU and the whims of the loony left led by the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe). </PARA>
<PARA> How did this situation come about? It came about because during all of the ERC deliberations the Prime Minister and his senior Ministers had one thing, and one thing alone, in their minds: not the future economic direction of this country, not the need for structural reform-the third runway at Mascot so dearly followed by my good friend opposite the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch)-and not the required prescriptions which should have been in the Budget. They were all looking over their shoulders waiting for the next Keating challenge. The ex-Treasurer has totally destabilised this Government. We now have the Government Whip no less, the honourable member for Canning (Mr Gear), blatantly counting numbers on the floor of this House while his own Prime Minister was speaking during Question Time. The count is on again for the challenge by the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) because he knows that his time is running out. It is indeed running out for him. He may well be Prime Minister for a matter of weeks or months when he gets the keys to the Lodge if he succeeds in his next challenge, but then it will be curtains once and for all, not only for Paul Keating but for this Federal Labor Government, which will be buried once and for all. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer (Mr Kerin) is ill prepared for his task and duty as Treasurer in producing this Budget. The Deputy Prime Minister had to be paid off with his big cities program of $56m, totalling some $800m-a curious priority. This is back to the thrust and thoughts of Uren and Whitlam in a critical time of economic recession. </PARA>
<PARA> The horrific interest rate equation which impacts so heavily on small business operators has not been addressed by this Budget. The public sector borrowing requirement will increase massively as a direct consequence of the settings in this Budget. Hard pressed farmers seeking to hang onto their farms and families trying to pay off mortgages are faced with a very bleak prospect on interest rates as a direct consequence of the policy settings of this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, this Budget will not work. The Government's approach to nearly 10 per cent unemployment defies belief. The Government has effectively imposed a payroll tax with regard to its superannuation changes. Make no mistake: superannuation of 9 per cent, plus 3 per cent by the year 2000, has the same effect as a whole new payroll tax on the business sector. The result this time will be more unemployment, a disastrous consequence for many individuals involved. Ultimately, the result will be a bigger Budget deficit arising as a direct consequence of the inadequate policy settings and the inadequate decisions represented by this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government says that the deficit is a mere $4.7 billion. No-one believes that figure. It is around the $10 billion mark if we take into consideration the one-off effects of assets sales and the transfer of maturing debt to the States. The State governments yet to bring down their Budgets should watch out because they will find it very difficult to set their Budget parameters as a direct consequence of this Federal Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> The deficit figure is also distorted by payments from the government enterprise superannuation funds and extra profit transfers from the Reserve Bank and Commonwealth Bank. May I mention one curious development during the winter recess involving the Reserve Bank? I know that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, possibly support the Brisbane Broncos in a certain football competition. This is a quite important matter. As Governor of the Reserve Bank we have a person who is meant to be the supreme umpire and the referee of the banking system, a person in the control room handling the levers associated with the prudential control of banking in Australia. What did that person, Mr Bernie Fraser, choose to do during the height of a recession in this winter recess? He decided to line up with one particular company with massive financial troubles and to back that one particular company by lending his prestige to that one particular company. That one particular company-it is a matter of public knowledge-has enormous exposure to the banking system of which he is a supreme referee or umpire. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the decision of the Governor of the Reserve Bank to become involved in a financial rescue committee of a company which operates that particular football team, something called the Canberra Raiders. I do not care what it is called; it is the principle involved-the principle where the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia at the height of a recession has the hide to line up with one particular financial company in trouble and give it the full prestige of the office of the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia. Frankly, he should think again about that decision because there are many small business operators who might like to have the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia heading their financial rescue committee, too, and participating in the negotiation of rescue packages on their behalf. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government says that it cares about investment. We can understand the jaundiced attitude of business to investment in this country. The Government is heavily taxing employment and is making inconsistent and quite harebrained decisions about development. Need I mention Coronation Hill or, on a different level, the very fast train project? Many of my colleagues are much in favour of and some are against the very fast train. But that is not the issue. The issue as I speak tonight, as we discuss this Budget framework for the future of Australia, is that our decision making process in this country has deteriorated so much that as a direct outcome of decisions of this Federal Government and other governments in this country we can no longer get big-ticket items such as the very fast train, Coronation Hill, Yakabindie and many other projects up to a level where they might be fairly and properly considered for the green light or otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a disgrace that the very fast train could not cross even the first hurdle of being fairly and properly dealt with by Federal, State and local governments in considering the possibility of taking a big leap forward in boosting the transport mode of this country. A series of decisions have given a negative signal to the rest of the world with regard to investment in this country. This Budget does nothing to address the Mad Hatter attitude that has been built into a range of activities, including the horrific big cities program. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the issues we face in this House, there is a better way: we are offering a clear-cut reform agenda to the people of Australia. We have the policies and the commitment to stay the course. Our industrial relations reform agenda stacks up. It is an agenda for true decentralisation of Australia's industrial relations system, built on SPC-type decisions. In a sense that decision represented the light on the hill, but it could have been so much better had John Halfpenny not intervened. It is for industrial relations reform-the concept of the right to belong to a union and the right not to belong to a union. It is fair dinkum enterprise bargaining on behalf of unions, workers and management, reaching agreement and getting on with the job. </PARA>
<PARA> That is at one level. Secondly, our agenda is all about genuine taxation reform-not just the GST, which has the ability to introduce greater fairness into the taxation system of this country, but reducing taxation overall and creating a jobs agenda for the unemployed, especially the young unemployed, whose unemployment level has now reached 28.5 per cent. That is a chilling level of unemployment, an agony level for which Australia will pay a price for many years to come. </PARA>
<PARA> So we have industrial relations reform and we have all aspects of tax reform. I will be prepared to debate our tax reform agenda in each and every country town hall I can physically get to in the course of the next few months. It stacks up for country people, for families beyond the capital cities and for people in the capital cities. It will abolish sales tax; it will rebate all business inputs; it will zero rate exports; and it will provide a very fair way forward for the average taxpayer in this country by reducing income tax in a constructive and positive way. </PARA>
<PARA> On top of that we have our trade reform agenda and our micro-economic reform agenda, and I will deal with more of that on another occasion. We now offer the vision and the leadership, the real alternative to the governance of this country, to get the Australian economy back on the rails, to generate the jobs that will create a surge in the standard of living of all Australians as we build towards the year 2000. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having listened to the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) earlier today, one is compelled to say that the only decent thing he seems to support this week is St George against the Canberra Raiders on Sunday. There appeared to be precious little else worthy of support in anything he had to offer the House and the nation today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to two issues in the time available to me. The first is an issue I have been concerned about for some time. It follows on the heels of some fairly solid anecdotal evidence I have picked up in Sydney, particularly in my electorate of Barton, and across the country. I refer to the real concern about the growing problem of middle-aged unemployed. It appears to be a problem that cuts across the normal educational, training, experience and income categories that have for so long traditionally divided those who have jobs from those who do not. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has placed an extraordinarily high emphasis on the issue of training and retraining and has quite rightly put a good deal of time, effort and money into bringing Australian women back into the work force. On both these counts-training and retraining and the re-entry of women into the work force-our policies have been designed to give every Australian an equal opportunity to achieve a fulfilling working life, and also, in the practical interests of the Australian economy, to provide the widest field of talent available for this country's economy. </PARA>
<PARA> It is ironic that we seemed increasingly willing in the 1980s and now during this recession to assign to the scrap heap of the unemployed people of all backgrounds who are needed by this country. Too often of late I have heard the label `too old' being applied to people who, quite simply, on all practical and objective measures are not too old to remain in the work force. The sticker that seems to be applied to people who are 45 years of age and over appears to me to be illogical and certainly harmful to the long term interests of this country. A further irony is that, when we consider the ageing of our population, we find that Australia is among the fastest ageing countries in the Western world. That seems to be in juxtaposition with this new social trend in attitude. </PARA>
<PARA> The anecdotal evidence I referred to is regrettably borne out by statistics in both growth in numbers and the length of unemployment. As at 15 February this year, the mean duration of unemployment for benefit recipients under 45 years of age was 36.7 weeks, but for those recipients over 45 years of age the mean was 88.2 weeks. While we must obviously take account of the fact that a certain number of people, particularly those in their 60s, probably are not likely to re-enter the work force and may not have any intention of re-entering it, that very sharp contrast is on its own a source of major concern for any government. Secondly, it is particularly disturbing to see how the mean duration climbs with age over 45 years: for the group between 45 and 49, for instance, the mean duration is 59.1 weeks; for those between 50 and 54, it is 73.2 weeks; for those between 55 and 59, it is 101.1 weeks; and for those between 60 and 64, it is a massive 130.6 weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking at the long term percentage growth in unemployed persons by age since 1980, the Australian Bureau of Statistics labour force figures are even more disturbing. They show that the highest rises have been, firstly, in the 35 to 44 year group; secondly, in the over-55s group; and, thirdly, in the 45 to 54 age group. I believe that reflects, as I said earlier, a long term trend that seems to have settled upon the Australian psyche in regard to its work force. </PARA>
<PARA> While I acknowledge such factors as reduced eligibility conditions for the over-50s under Jobstart in terms of the period they have to wait for benefits and the various early intervention programs open to the unemployed in all age groups, I fear that effectively very little is being done by governments at both State and Federal level to halt this massive waste of Australians who are unemployed, or prospectively unemployed, at age 45 and over. </PARA>
<PARA> What is to be done? Particularly in the Budget context, I believe that as a matter of priority the Federal Government and the various State governments must look immediately at their employment, education and training programs with a view to, firstly, alleviating this situation and, secondly, setting about to convert this negative and waste into a positive through those very resources and activities which we have pursued for eight years, concentrating on younger unemployed through retraining and education, both of which are clearly for the long term benefit of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that the Government consider this now. It is an unfortunate circumstance, nevertheless the reality, that with every week that passes we are seeing various corporations and small businesses laying off workers, as I say, of all skill levels, educational levels and experience backgrounds. It is being seen, indeed, in the State and Federal public services. The Greiner Government in New South Wales has converted redundancies into some sort of art form. I fear a large pool, then, of reasonably well qualified, experienced people in their forties and fifties who, after having taken their pay-outs and in some cases their superannuation, have perhaps paid off their homes and will be consigned to stay sitting in their lounge rooms day after day, frustrated, supposedly too old, according to some, to gain re-employment, but certainly too young by any objective measure to retire. They will have a minimal cash flow with which to sustain both themselves and the members of their families, some of whom may be undergoing continuing education. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem is a very real one. It appears to have been missed by State and Federal bureaucracies in the design of various programs to retrain and re-educate the unemployed. I appeal to the Federal Government to take that very much on board with a view to action not only by and within its own resources but also by the States. </PARA>
<PARA> The second issue to which I turn is also one which is, I suppose, not addressed in this Budget as I and so many other people in Sydney would want to see it addressed. That issue involves something for which we have looked for so long-the immediate start to the construction of a proper airport at Badgerys Creek, a second Sydney airport. I must place these remarks in a non-sensational manner on the record of this Parliament. I hope that I am wrong but events, particularly in recent times, around Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport lead me to say that it is, in my view, now inevitable that an accident will occur at or around Kingsford-Smith Airport. </PARA>
<PARA> Last week we were shocked in Sydney at the near miss, a very close shave indeed, between a Thai International craft and an Ansett craft at Kingsford-Smith Airport. This followed other occurrences and concerns in recent times, one example of which has been the very real fear that a low flying jet landing over Rockdale was responsible for, firstly, a black-out in a small region and, secondly, the destruction of part of a roof of one of my constituents' houses. I understand that a second claim has been made about that sort of activity again this week by other people living around Kingsford-Smith Airport. </PARA>
<PARA> The other example in recent weeks involved fragments of an international jet's tail dropping onto some roofs in Stanmore and, indeed, into a public reserve. These incidents follow that horrific incident in January 1989 when a small general aviation craft strayed out of its airspace over West Pymble and came within some 50 feet vertically of a Qantas international jet on its approach into Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. </PARA>
<PARA> All of these issues highlight the vulnerability of Sydney Airport. It is a very small airport by international standards; it is a very small airport by Australian major airport standards as well. It is in the middle of, arguably, one of the most densely populated parts of Australia, and it is ringed by industries such as petrol facilities at Kurnell and chemical factories around Botany, all of course highly inflammable. The problem is that as many runways as we like can be built at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport but, at the end of the day, there will still be the same small airport, the same small ground space and the same relatively small airspace around it into which we are attempting to cram more and more aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> My crucial point is that the people running the system now at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport and the civil aviation system in general are responsible for running it safely, whether there is a third runway or not. If risks are being taken, the system must be changed and it must be changed immediately, while whatever additional runway capacity to be built wherever is being built or, indeed, is simply being decided upon. The onus is on the people running the system, and the people running the system now must introduce those changes if Kingsford-Smith Airport is indeed unsafe. </PARA>
<PARA> Following this Thai jet incident, I saw some fairly inane comments, I must say, from the Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport task force chairman, a Mr David Taylor, whoever he may be. He said that this Thai-Ansett incident could have been avoided if a third runway had been in use. I am very pleased to see that the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support, Senator Collins, told the Senate that the near miss between the Thai DC10 and the Ansett Airbus was in no way related to the presence or absence of a third runway. </PARA>
<PARA> But having said that and dismissed that inane comment by this Mr Taylor, I point out to the House that the incident is directly related, it seems, to human error, but human error occurring within the operating framework of what is called simultaneous landing operations at Sydney; that is, where planes are landing on the east-west runway and on the north-south runway with very little time between them. </PARA>
<PARA> This simops, as it is referred to, is a reflection of a small airport, with the runway configuration that Sydney has, that is quite simply overcrowded. The proof of this-and I am pleased to be able to say this-is that Senator Collins has, he tells me, apparently suspended simops for international craft. He is to be commended for this and commended most highly. </PARA>
<PARA> I now come to the eerie tale of accident figures. The major airport needs of Sydney report in October 1978 shows that on international experience some 60 per cent of aviation accidents occur on take-off and landing, and 30 per cent occur on the ground. That last statistic, bearing in mind the incident between the Thai and Ansett crafts last week, is a chilling statistic. The master plan issued by the Federal Airports Corporation not so long ago shows a major blow-out in the time that aircraft will spend on the ground in taxiing and so forth when Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport has a third runway. In an economic sense, in a passenger sense, that obviously is an increase in delays but, in a safety sense, when we consider that statistic that I have just cited, it is a safety issue to be considered as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Added to this we have the Federal Airport Corporation's release yesterday-finally an admission-that an Adelaide-type option, an airport with terminal facilities twice the size of Canberra, can be built at Badgerys Creek for some $411m, with a construction period of around four years, depending on various factors. That vindicates much of what the anti-runway lobby has been saying for so long. Yet I notice that the media attention given to it is very minor indeed. Clearly, another airport of even that limited size, which is all the anti-runway lobby has ever called for, catering for some 140,000 movements a year compared to the additional 60,000 movements a year that a third runway would add to Kingsford-Smith Airport, makes much greater sense in terms of safety-a less crowded airport, bigger than Sydney, with uncrowded airspace above and around it. </PARA>
<PARA> When we consider that all the runway adherents admit that a second airport is needed, one asks: why do we persist then in this futile chase of further crowding and further exacerbating the risk over Sydney, when clearly these incidents that have occurred in the last few weeks, added to the incident of January 1989, are showing that we must be spreading the traffic rather than concentrating it. We must be spreading that traffic at Kingsford-Smith Airport now, regardless of what decision is made regarding the third runway, even if it involves added costs or inconvenience, because a massive air accident will be far more costly and far more inconvenient if, in this lust over the commercial orientation of the airport, we concentrate our minds solely on that. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly in the future the spreading of that risk-rather, the avoidance of the exacerbation of the risk-is, in my view, and the view of so many other people around that part of Sydney who have to live there, an essential function of this Government, and indeed the State Government because of its involvement. The risk under the present regime is simply not worth it, nor will it be worth it in any way in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> In concluding, I would like to do the rare thing of quoting an independent in the House. I do not think that has been done before on either side of this House. The honourable member for North Sydney, Ted Mack, has a chilling reflection about the morning after-if, God help us, there were an accident at Kingsford-Smith Airport-that is, as he remarks, `The morning after, everyone will be saying, ``Well, why didn't they get on and build a second Sydney airport?'''</PARA>
<PARA> I ask both sides of the House to have a good, hard look at this safety issue because I have placed my comments on the record about it today. I direct the attention of those responsible for air safety in this country to those comments and remind them that, regardless of whether a runway or a second airport is built and regardless of when that happens, it is up to them to run the air system in this country and run it safely. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When discussing the Budget he brought down two days ago, the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) has frequently referred to it as the `shock absorber'. He is so wildly out of touch with the people that he is blissfully unaware that in our ordinary language and in the language of those who are fond of cars, shock absorbers are universally referred to as shockers. The Treasurer's Budget is not the shock absorber; it is a shocker. It is a shocker, not because of its boldness, its vision or its dream for Australia and Australians, but because it is depressed, negative, regressive, reactionary and, above all, just plain wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This shocker Budget is the product of a leaderless, distracted and dispirited Government. The Budget is a shocker in several respects. It is a shocker because of its investment forecast; it is a shocker because of its unemployment forecast; and it is a shocker because of its failure to implement an intelligent and effective privatisation program. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year-1990-91-business investment in Australia fell by more than 11 per cent. Under the 1991-92 HawkeKeating-Kerin shocker Budget, business investment is expected to fall by a further 11 per cent. So little reference has been made by the Treasurer and the Government to this continued fall in business investment that it is apparent the Labor Party has not the slightest idea of what this means or what it portends. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, what this continual decline in business investment means for Australia is as follows: higher unemployment with all the social dislocation and human suffering that results; lower international competitiveness with the resulting dire consequences for our balance of payments and overseas debt; the further closure of equipment manufacturers, as if Government policies have not already created enough havoc in that area; a further drop in the demand for engineers with all the implications this brings for our higher education system; a further shrinking of the nation's productive base and productive activity; and a fall in value-added manufacturing exports. </PARA>
<PARA> This Treasurer and this Government have achieved a world first in budgetary economics. Not only have they deliberately adopted a low investment policy, but also they have determined on a deliberate, declining investment policy. Business confidence has not been lower since the Depression-should we say, as the Treasurer said yesterday, `the other Depression'-of the 1930s. And into this pit of despondency this Treasurer and this Government have cast an extra ingredient-low and falling business investment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer and the Government have given us an official reason for their low investment policy. They say they want a manageable recovery, but under these policies there will be no significant recovery, manageable or otherwise. Let members of the Government, including the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall), who is at the table, venture out into the shopping centres, the construction sites and the factories of our community and they will discover what most people have known and have been telling us for some time; that is, that there is no recovery at hand now and no sign of any recovery. This shocker of a Government has misjudged the boom, it misjudged the bust, and now it is misjudging the recession. </PARA>
<PARA> How can the Government claim that a recovery is at hand when business investment has fallen 22 per cent in two years, and continues to fall, and in a year when the Government also admits that the terms of trade are likely to fall? Furthermore, this shocker of a Budget employs almost every means of preventing or delaying a recovery in business investment. </PARA>
<PARA> Interest rates are forecast by this Budget to remain high in real terms. An extra payroll tax in the form of a so-called superannuation levy has been imposed on employers. Structural reforms, which in the old days used to be called micro-economic reforms-in the old Hawkespeak they were called micro-economic reforms, a name now discarded because the Government has failed in its program of micro-economic reform-have been avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> A huge and still understated and unsettling structural Budget deficit is in the pipeline. Potential new property speculative funds are being established in the name of superannuation, there is no sign of taxation reform, and tax distortions continue to deflect spending into unproductive areas. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will make a brief statement prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner. Earlier today the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) to table a paper. After the Minister had refused to do so he and the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife) took points of order in relation to the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the outset I would like to say it is most helpful, and often occurs, that when a member raises a matter as a point of order, the relevant standing order number is quoted. Indeed, today the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson) on two occasions took points of order and directed my attention to standing order 145. The honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) frequently drew attention to the same standing order number. If members do so in raising a matter with the Speaker, it allows the House to know precisely what is being raised and it allows the Speaker to give an appropriate ruling.</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of this particular matter, after the Minister for Veterans' Affairs had completed an answer to a question today, the honourable member for Bradfield asked the Minister to table the document. The Minister declined to do so. Subsequently the points of order were raised. I have contacted the Minister, who has advised me that in his answer to the question he was quoting from confidential notes.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is worth reiterating that this shocker of a Budget employs almost every means of preventing or delaying the recovery in business investment. Interest rates are forecast to remain high in real terms. Extra payroll tax, in the form of a so-called superannuation levy, has been imposed on employers. Structural reforms, which used to be called micro-economic reforms in the old Hawkespeak-a name now discredited because of its failures-have been avoided. A huge, and still understated, and unsettling structural Budget deficit is in the pipeline. Potential new property speculative funds are being established in the name of superannuation. There is no sign of taxation reform, and tax distortions continue to deflect spending into unproductive areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Interlocked with the failure of investment policy is the Government's failure to deal with the social and human problems of unemployment. In this shocker of a Budget, the Treasurer and the Government have created more history by abandoning the full employment policy which has been a bipartisan feature of Australian politics for decades. Let there be no mistake about this. Subject only to cyclical changes and frictional factors, such as people changing jobs, the coalition parties are committed to a policy of full employment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian public had thought that this Labor Government also had that full employment commitment, but with this Budget the Australian Labor Party has now unilaterally abandoned its full employment policy. This discredited Government knows that every economic forecast available to it predicts that its policies will create severe and traumatic unemployment-almost certainly more than 10 per cent for the next five years. Incredibly, into this cowardly policy mix that institutionalises high unemployment for years, the Government has dropped another ingredient-a payroll tax in the form of a superannuation levy. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not hard to find who is responsible for this wildly irresponsible levy and why it is required. It has occurred as a result of demands by the so-called workers' friend, the ACTU. Why is the Australian Council of Trade Unions demanding a policy that will lead to higher unemployment for the workers? The ACTU is doing this not because it any longer has the interests of the workers at heart but because it would like to get its hands on the accumulated funds and manage them in the interests of its ideological perceptions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is simply incapable of dealing with the real factors influencing productivity. As a result, it has decided to achieve its inflation objective with its new weapon-unemployment. This is a stark and despicable admission of policy failure by this Government. It is a clear reminder that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) will make the unemployed pay for his mistakes. </PARA>
<PARA> In this, its centenary year, there has been a great deal of talk about the history of the Australian Labor Party. Whatever the merits or otherwise of that talk, future Labor historians will focus on this shocker Budget as one of the most seminal in the Australian Labor Party's history. This is the Budget in which a Labor Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, and a Labor Treasurer, Mr Kerin, officially abandoned their Chifley tradition. This is the shocker Budget in which a Labor Prime Minister, Mr Hawke , and a Labor Treasurer, Mr Kerin, officially abandoned their Party's full employment objective. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Prime Minister's portrait is painted the words `This is the Australian leader who abandoned full employment' should be marked on it. Every working Australian and every unemployed Australian listening to this parliamentary broadcast today and reading of it in future should remember that this is the Labor government that abandoned the unemployed. It is this, more than anything else, which will destroy the Labor Party, particularly in the strongly held Labor seats, at the next Federal election. </PARA>
<PARA> The bipartisan approach to full employment has now gone. The coalition parties alone now carry the employment banner for it is only the coalition parties that are prepared to adopt policies which encourage investment and growth and which will lead to improved employment prospects. The Australian Labor Party, through its policies, has now entrenched an unemployment rate of around 10 per cent over the next few years. That is a savage and lasting indictment of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget is also a shocker in terms of the Government's failure on privatisation. In fact, the Government cannot bring itself to use the word `privatisation'. Instead it uses the words `assets sales program'. In this difference of nomenclature, we come to the heart of the difference between the Labor Party's assets sales program and the coalition parties' policies for privatisation and contracting out. `Assets sales' means just that: it means the sale of assets; it means money and nothing else. But privatisation and contracting out are the mechanisms to enhance competition and, as a result, generate greater efficiency, higher productivity, lower prices and better services for consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> Privatisation means there will be no further call on the taxpayers for funding requirements for government enterprises. Privatisation means leaner government. Privatisation means lower public sector debt. Privatisation means wider share ownership in the community. Privatisation means that the effectiveness of the capital markets will be enhanced. Privatisation means that there will be a continuing involvement by enterprise employees through share ownership and workplace bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget does not contain any significant new measure of privatisation or contracting out as part of Government objectives, so a major opportunity has been lost to increase productivity and international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> Details of asset sales in the Budget are very sketchy. Table 1 of Budget Paper No. 2 reveals asset sales receipts of $1,340.8m and payments of $715.8m for a net result to revenue of $625.0m. Budget Paper No. 1 discloses that the $625.0m comprises sales of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation, the sale of which has already been agreed; Australian Airlines; 49 per cent of Qantas; Aussat; an indeterminate amount of Australian National Line; the uranium stockpile; and other commercial property assets. </PARA>
<PARA> In the absence of a detailed breakdown of the proceeds accruing to each asset-an extraordinary omission given the wealth of detail that exists in the Budget on other matters-it appears certain that the Government's asset sales program has been botched. No responsible commentator expects that during the 1991-92 financial year the sale of the airlines, Aussat, the Australian National Line and the uranium stockpile will be completed; if any commercial property assets are sold it will be at very low prices. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, the coalition's privatisation program is clear. In addition to the assets I have listed, we would transfer from the public sector to enterprise employees and private sector investors the Australian Industry Development Corporation, the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust, Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, the Federal Airports Corporation, Medibank Private, Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation and, after competition had been properly established, Telecom, the Pipeline Authority and the remainder of the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, numerous opportunities exist for contracting out government functions and services. Our national efficiency and productivity will be markedly increased by ensuring that functions and services at present performed for government by government will in the future be performed for government at better costs by the private sector. Cleaning, security, computer services, fire protection, laundry, stores management, transport, waste collection, property management, property construction, property maintenance, mapping, training, catering and laboratory analysis are some of the contracting out opportunities that come to mind. </PARA>
<PARA> It was my pleasure this morning to bring before the Parliament the Commonwealth-Owned Enterprises Bill 1991. The purpose of this Bill is to establish an appropriate privatisation framework to facilitate the transfer from the public sector to the private sector of certain government business enterprises and to set relevant guidelines to enable the establishment of other government business enterprises. The Bill clearly demonstrates the coalition's commitment to the privatisation process and emphasises that we are ready for government by having before the Parliament the enabling legislation in the privatisation area. </PARA>
<PARA> This 1991-92 Budget is not a shock absorber; it is a shocker. It is a shocker because the predicted investment decline is a disaster for our economy; the unemployment consequences are tragic for our people; the Hawke Government's abandonment of the long held bipartisan policy of full employment destroys its political legitimacy; the Government's asset sales program has been laborious and mishandled, and its figures are now highly dubious; and, finally, this Budget is not so much an economic document as a requiem for a failed and dispirited Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like many members on this side of the House-and, I am sure, many people in Australia-I am sick to death of hearing people on the other side whinge, complain and suggest that they are the only people in this place who have compassion or care and concern about the unemployed in this country. What they do, one after another-and we saw it with the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) this afternoon-is get up and give a tirade against this Government about unemployment and the present economic difficulties of this country; then they sit back and say nothing more.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If those opposite are an alternative government, where are the alternative policies? What do we hear? People who are unemployed can look forward to a consumption tax and further slashing of government expenditure. Whom will that be directed to? It will not be members of the upper classes whom those in the Liberal Party would like to see continue supporting them; it will be directed at those who are less able to look after themselves, those people that this Budget has rightly and compassionately directed its attention to. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight in my contribution on this Budget debate, I want to deal specifically with some of the major programs that this Government has put in place, I want to talk about unemployment and I specifically want to focus on my own electorate and the Illawarra region in general. In recent times-and I am not talking just about the last couple of days but of the last seven or eight years-there has generally been a feeling within the Illawarra region, within my electorate, that no government cares for the Illawarra. It has often been said that there is nothing wrong with the Illawarra; it has been said that it is a very evenly balanced place, because there is a chip on both shoulders. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight I would like to suggest that there are problems in the Illawarra. There are some special problems that require special solutions and I hope that the Government listens to what I say now. I hope it takes some heed of what I and my colleagues the honourable member for Cunningham (Mr West) and the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) have said in the past and, hopefully, puts in place some of the suggestions we make. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I do that, I would like to reflect a little on history. I would like to reflect on unemployment by taking into consideration statistics which I had compiled this afternoon by the parliamentary research service. The statistics were based on ABS labour force survey data-that is to say, the measure most used for unemployment levels in this country, the measure which presently puts the unemployment level in Australia at 9.7 or 9.8 per cent and which puts the unemployment level in New South Wales at something like 8.4 per cent. Those statistics throw up some very interesting information. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a copy of the table I refer to. The shadow spokesman, the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale), who was at the table, has given his okay to this document. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. This table shows some very interesting statistics. For example, it shows in the Wollongong statistical district-and that takes in the local government areas of Wollongong, Shell Harbour and Kiama, that is, the heartland of industrial New South Wales-that in 1983, when this Government came into office, the unemployment rate was 14.4 per cent. It showed that the labour force participation rate was 58.6 per cent. In other words, there was quite a proportion of hidden unemployment that did not show up in that statistic. The most recent figures, for June 1991-and all these are measured in the month of June-indicate that the unemployment rate in the Wollongong statistical district is now 7.8 per cent and that the labour force participation rate has gone up to 62.3 per cent. This table details that for every year between 1983 and 1991 there has been a fall in the unemployment rate as measured in June.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That has not just come about through some magic; it has come about because of hard work by a variety of people in the Illawarra. It has come about because of the trade union movement's involvement. It has been prepared to look at itself and ways in which it can assist local industry. It has been as a result of industry itself investing massively in the Illawarra region-particularly in the steel industry. It has been as a result also of government initiatives. Yet many people choose to ignore those statistics. Many people choose to say that that is terribly low and, therefore, it cannot be right. </PARA>
<PARA> When these statistics were released in June, one had to look long and hard to find anybody talking about the matter. It was not reported because it did not serve some people's needs. I find that a little distressing. I am not for a moment suggesting that unemployment in the Illawarra region is not a problem, because it is a problem-like everywhere else in Australia at the moment. I, as a member who regularly gets out amongst the people in my electorate, know the suffering of these people that have lost their jobs. They have lost their jobs because of changes, rationalisations that have occurred within industry in the Illawarra. </PARA>
<PARA> In the steel industry in our region, in 1983 there were 22,000 people directly employed by BHP. That figure is down to close to 8,000 now-not as a result of the policies of this Government but as a result of the policies of the company itself to make it work smarter. Its productivity has increased massively. The technological investment that has gone in has also increased massively, and BHP is to be commended for that; but this has also brought about a massive reduction in employment directly attributable to BHP. Of course, that is reflected in the general area as well. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is-notwithstanding BHP and the commensurate decline in employment in the coal industries in the Illawarra region, where there have been massive retrenchments as well-that under the pure measure of unemployment, that statistic still does not look bad. But I have got a real difficulty-as I am sure many other members of this place have-because when we compare those ABS statistics with the information which we can obtain through the CES offices or the Department of Social Security on those people who are applying for employment benefit or other benefits, there seems to be some sort of anomaly. When I obtained figures for the month of June this year, when those unemployment rates came out that no-one wanted to talk about, I found that in Corrimal-where my office is located, and the office of the Department of Social Security is located-there was an increase in those people registered for unemployment benefit. The increase was 112 people, or a 4.5 per cent change, in those who had been registered. </PARA>
<PARA> That was the figure that many people seem to concentrate on to say that there was a massive blow-out; yet there have been some suggestions that employment levels in the Illawarra are 18 per cent, 24 per cent-as was mentioned in one publication today-or 30 per cent if you talk to some people who have a different agenda. The problem is: which statistics are we going to believe? It suits certain people to use certain statistics at different times. I am sure all honourable members know that that is the case. My concern is that there are unemployed people in the Illawarra region. There are people who need assistance. There are people who can get assistance from this Budget, particularly through the training programs. </PARA>
<PARA> We only have to look at increased funding being directed to the Corrimal Skillshare project in my electorate and at the increased funding that is directed to a number of Skillshare projects in Wollongong and in Shell Harbour to see that there has been a real benefit. There is $800m-plus to be directed in Australia for training programs. I feel sure that there will be a proportion of that directed to an area like the Illawarra; yet some people are still prepared to say that the Government will not give assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned the steel industry. If it had not been for this Government, there would be no steel industry, no 8,000 people in jobs in Wollongong now, because it would not be there. The steel industry plan was put in place by this Government within 100 days of coming into Government; yet people conveniently forget that is the case. The coal industry is often thrown up. This Government is being criticised from both sides of the coal industry. The unions say that we have deregulated too much in the coal industry, and that they have lost out; the coal companies say we have not deregulated enough and that they are still not making any money-hence the rationalisation process that has to take place and 5,000 jobs that have been lost there in the Illawarra region in the coal industry as a result. Clearly, they cannot have it both ways. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to infrastructure. People have suggested that the Illawarra has been forgotten by the Federal Government because nothing has been put in. They forget the money that has gone into the coal roads, the northern distributor, the grainhandling facility at Port Kembla. They have forgotten the money that went to build the Commonwealth office block, the building at the Brandon Park sports complex, the Croome Road sports complex, the University of Wollongong-which has seen a massive increase in places and the buildings that are on site. They have forgotten the money that went in to the Illawarra Technology Corporation at the University of Wollongong, that is giving a start to the smart industries-the clever country industries, the technological industries that we want in this place. They have forgotten the massive investment that Telecom Australia has put in to the University of Wollongong. Over $10m was announced very recently when the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free) was in town. They have forgotten all of this and say that this Government has turned its back on the Illawarra region. They have also forgotten the role played by the local members in developing an economic development strategy for the future of that region. They have forgotten the hours put in by the local members as part of the Illawarra Regional Consultative Council, established by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) two years ago, and which reported in November last year through its economic development strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> They have forgotten what was said at that time about how the blueprint for the further economic development of the Illawarra was an outstanding document that provided clear guidance-not only to the Federal Government but also to the State and local governments-for improving our local region, and the sorts of initiatives that have already come from that. They have forgotten that the Federal Government has announced that a regional branch of the Australian Taxation Office is to be built in the Illawarra. There have been 275 jobs created; but some of these people have turned around and said that the Illawarra has been forgotten by this Federal Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We have also seen in recent days ongoing discussions about developing what I consider to be a major new industry in the Illawarra-that is, telecommunications. There have been ongoing discussions with the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean), before he went to that portfolio, and ongoing discussions with the new Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free), who came to the University of Wollongong recently to see what the plans were. That will lead to something positive in the Illawarra in the not-too-distant future. Going hand-in-glove with that will be more jobs created. But people tend to forget these sorts of things exist. </PARA>
<PARA> People also tend to forget that there are job programs like the Skillshare program that I have mentioned, apprenticeship plans, the CEP when it was in operation several years ago and the labour market adjustment programs that were specifically directed to the Illawarra region. Yet, they have all been there and the quantification of the amount of money spent in a region like our own runs into tens of millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude on the Illawarra region by saying that I always respect the views of others within my electorate and within the region. I always respect their right to criticise me as a local member of parliament, my colleagues as local members of parliament and, on occasions, there is probably some just desserts in giving us a good kick in the bum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Minister. Nevertheless, I believe it is also incumbent upon people to balance that argument. It is incumbent upon them not to put around spurious arguments, but to look at the facts. There are many people in the Illawarra region who believe that those facts speak for themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also wanted to make some comment tonight about the whole issue surrounding this Budget in respect of some of its fundamental tenants and some of the assumptions that have been made. With the inflation predictions that are being made and the assumptions contained within this document and the figures on inflation at the moment, I have come to the conclusion, as I think a number of people have-certainly, this has come through discussions with business within my electorate-that the Government should give consideration to reviewing its present position in respect of interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past 18 months we have seen a decrease of 7 or 8 per cent in official interest rates. In many cases we have seen them fall from the 18-plus per cent of 18 or 20 months ago to below 10 per cent. Yet there are still difficulties with small business. There is still difficulty associated with small business people taking the decision to invest, taking the decision to put on an additional apprentice, taking the decision not to put off another staff member-simply because they have to ensure that they keep their heads above water. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my view that the Government needs to give that consideration to interest rates at present. I accept the concerns of the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) and the Prime Minister that we have to be careful that the economy does not overheat again and that some of the benefits that we are deriving at the moment, particularly in respect of inflation, are not blown away by any premature decision on interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the Budget projections for unemployment rates, in view of what I know are the circumstances in the Illawarra region, as I have outlined to date, and particularly in view of what I know of the concerns that exist amongst, for example, small businesses and the farming community-of which I learned as we travelled around Australia with our banking inquiry during the recess-I know that the interest rate question is an important one and in the minds of many people a burning one. I know that last night in Sydney the Prime Minister did indicate that it was an issue still on the agenda. I think that is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that this morning the Treasurer gave some view on that issue, but at this stage I simply say that, as this Government has had such an excellent record in the past in respect of job creation and generation-not through pump priming but through real economic reform-we must give consideration to the whole issue of interest rates; but it should not come without a price. That price has to be the challenge to business to take advantage of that environment when it is created. </PARA>
<PARA> How many times in the past when the Business Council of Australia and other business groups have called for particular directions of government policy and those directions have been achieved have we seen nothing eventuate? What did we see in the late 1980s? Did we see the entrepreneurs of this country deciding to invest in productive capacity? No; we saw them get involved in overvalued assets, we saw them go to the wall and, hence, exacerbate the problems that we have in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view, the Budget itself does contain the appropriate compassionate measures to meet the needs of those people who are suffering at the moment. I will mention some of those measures in passing. They include the family allowance supplement, the building better cities programs, the types of educational programs that have been put in place and the labour market programs, all of which are directed specifically with compassion in mind. But compassion must go hand in glove with economic consideration. In that respect, I believe that the interest rate question is one which must be addressed by this Government again, and with that combination I think we will see this economy on the road to recovery. But it must be done not only by the Government but also by the business community and the people of Australia taking up that challenge. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I propose to address three aspects of this Budget. I want to talk in particular about its impact on my constituents, who I think are a microcosm of middle Australia; I want to talk about its treatment of the science and technology portfolio, an area that I take a special interest in; and I will briefly comment on its treatment of defence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My electorate of Aston is an outer eastern suburban one in Melbourne. My constituents are predominantly young with not particularly high education levels in terms of tertiary qualifications. Per capita incomes are below the national average, but per household incomes are above the national average-which tells us, of course, that there are a lot of working spouses. It has been a rapidly developing area in the last seven years and it lacks a lot of facilities such as schools, roads, health facilities and so on. It is a blue-collar area, with a lot of semi-skilled, white-collar, wholesale and retail people. It has over 6,000 small businesses, and it contains more mortgage payers than any other electorate in the country. It is the mortgage belt of Australia. The impact of unemployment in the last 12 months, brought on by this Government, has meant almost a 300 per cent increase in the rate of unemployment. So it is turning from the mortgage belt into the dole belt of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As one goes around my electorate and sees the `For sale', `For lease' and `For rent' signs on the offices, factories and shops, it is quite obvious that we are in the middle of a major recession-or, to use the Treasurer's word from yesterday, a `depression'. Interestingly enough, my electorate is also the demographic centre of Melbourne, so it is truly typical of modern Australia in the outer suburban areas. I ask myself what this Budget has done for my 120,000 constituents. </PARA>
<PARA> This morning during the public hearing of a committee a witness tried to avoid responsibility for his department by saying that he was new to the job and, therefore, had inherited the problem, and then he said, `Well, we admit our mistakes and we are now looking at them'. Then he went on to say, `Well, we have lots of plans and studies going on to decide what to do'. Another member of that committee, an honourable member from the Government side of this House, leant across to me and said, `The Kerin Defence'. My God, how true!</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer's inheritance is from the failed former Treasurer. Not surprisingly, that deposed Treasurer is reluctant to acknowledge that Australia's current recession was caused largely by the tight monetary policy that he introduced to cut the current account deficit, which, in turn, was directly linked to his rapid deregulation of the financial sector without giving any form of prudential watching brief to the Reserve Bank or to anybody else. </PARA>
<PARA> The recession which the failed former Treasurer said would not occur, when he was pushing interest rates high in 1989, became the recession he said we had to have. Now, with inflation banished, he wants to bring interest rates down, even if the new Treasurer does not. Of course, the Prime Minister keeps hinting at it, as he did last night in Sydney. The Australian economy is in recession because of the ex-Treasurer's policies. He is quick to claim the credit for lowering inflation, but is reluctant to accept responsibility for the current levels of unemployment-with all the uncertainty and suffering that they have produced in our community. </PARA>
<PARA> As we heard on Budget eve on the Four Corners program, the ex-Treasurer is now claiming that interest rates, by constant fine tuning, can be set to achieve a recovery. He used the phrase `consistent with the locking-in of gains on inflation and the current account'. Of course, the new Treasurer, while saying that there is no change in the direction of Government policy, is embarked upon a change, because we are going into deficit. The Prime Minister, ever the populist, is hinting at interest rate cuts all the time but not actually cutting them. </PARA>
<PARA> On having blamed the predecessors, we come to step 2 in the `Kerin Defence'. This, of course, is to admit one's mistakes. As we heard from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) this afternoon, we have Mr Sorry. It is a novel change to find that going on, because normally from the Government side of the House we hear honourable members panning us daily in Question Time about our so-called failures more than eight years ago. The Government, of course, has had eight years to get it right; in fact, at the end of this term it will have had 13 out of 20 years. So it has had time to learn and to get it right. So, admitting its mistakes and blaming others will no longer wash. </PARA>
<PARA> Step 3 in the `Kerin Defence' is to say, `We are looking at it all; we are studying the problem'. Frankly, it is a bit late to do that. The Government knows what needs to be done. We all know the sorts of things that need to be done. In industrial relations, for example, we have to do away with the anachronistic work practices that are holding back this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In tax reform, however one argues about the details, we have to return some incentive to the work force of Australia. On the waterfront we have to get some real progress. At the end of the Government's current waterfront reform program, containers in Australia will be turned around at the rate of only 11 per hour, whereas Singapore is doing 20 and Taiwan 25. Land transport affects every single business in the land, and we have not done anything about it in eight years. As to shipping reform, it is still cheaper to send something to New Zealand via Hong Kong rather than straight across the Tasman. These are the things we need to be doing. We need action to create the clever country, but I will come back to that a little later. </PARA>
<PARA> We know what needs to be done, but where are the Government's detailed plans? Where is the action? Will the ACTU, and of course the next Prime Minister, the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean), actually allow significant action to take place? For businesses struggling to survive or workers on short hours the measures in this Budget could be the final straw. There are the costs of doctors' visits. There are superannuation increases for employers at a time when they can least afford it; therefore they will have to pass that cost on in their prices, which means more inflation, or they will have to cut their costs further, which probably means more unemployment. Then there are the higher education contribution increases, which the Government obviously thinks are quite humorous, as evidenced by the performance of the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) during Question Time this afternoon. My constituents think it is a quite serious issue and not a laughing matter at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget provides no relief for the people of Aston, for the unemployed, for those losing their homes or their businesses, and for those just plain struggling to survive. We needed to see in the Budget some vision for the future, some initiatives from the Treasurer to fix some of our current problems in order at least to give people some hope. What he gave us was confirmation of his statement of last week that the economy's future fell into the category of, `Well, your guess is as good as mine'. With over 7,000 of the 76,000 voters in my electorate claiming unemployment benefits and the Treasurer admitting that a further increase in unemployment will occur over the next 12 months, this Budget is yet another failure by the Hawke Government to deal with the problems of a self-induced recession. </PARA>
<PARA> Where are the measures to get the country moving? Where are the measures to tackle the unemployment problem? The principle of trying to get people into superannuation schemes in the long term is quite sensible. Nobody will argue with that. We believe that preferably it should be voluntary, but it has to be done a little further down the track. We will not be able to sustain everybody on government pensions long term, so we have to get them onto a superannuation scheme. However, to force this extra levy onto employers, particularly at a time of deep recession-the Treasurer's actual words in this place yesterday-with no prospect of improvement for at least a year, is simply unacceptable. However one looks at it, it is bad news for the 6,000 businesses in my electorate and the people who work for them. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst nobody welcomes the extra $5 on Medicare-and it will be $5: $3.50 now and another $1.50 down the track-it is something we accept had to be done to contain the blow-out of costs. But this should have come from pruning the bureaucracy and not just from the pockets of my constituents during such difficult times. The Treasurer should have taken the opportunity to help the people of Aston, as well as the people of the rest of middle Australia, by acceleration of the restructuring processes in the transport and other infrastructure areas I have mentioned to ease the costs on business so that it can become more competitive and in turn become more successful, and therefore create new and genuinely sustainable jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> People also need the opportunity to retain more of their earnings, with a restructuring of the tax system to provide incentives for people to invest, to save and to work harder. Without this restructuring the increased inflation caused by the extra costs on health, education, superannuation and the rest will simply eat into life savings and will continue to erode the living standards of all my electors in Aston. </PARA>
<PARA> All in all, this Budget was a sell-out for the people of Aston and for the rest of Australia. The tone was set by the former Treasurer and was continued by the new Treasurer. The Budget does not offer any short term relief or any long term hope for Australia. It is steady as she goes-and she, I am afraid, is sinking fast. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to turn from general economic issues to the science and technology area in particular because I take a special interest in it. The Budget offers little good news for science, like all this Government's Budgets over the last seven or eight years, because it will not inject any substantial new research funding into the nation's research agencies. In times when our innovative approach needs urgent cranking up, the Government has chosen not to move into a higher gear in its much vaunted scientific and technological drive towards the clever country. Even the new funds committed outside last year's Budget through the cooperative research centre schemes have restored government expenditure on science in real terms only to the levels of a decade ago. </PARA>
<PARA> The real measure of investment, both government and private, in science and technology can be found in the Science and Technology Budget Statement, Budget Related Paper No. 6. This shows Australia still wallowing in sixteenth place amongst the 19 OECD nations in the percentage of gross domestic product expended on research and development. We lead only New Zealand, Ireland and Spain-not a very auspicious list, I suggest. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's largest government research agency, the CSIRO, received $440m, an increase of $26m, or 6.3 per cent, over last year; but adjusted for inflation the increase dwindles to 1.8 per cent. That increase includes a special $10.7m increase for capital infrastructure expenditure. Through the 1980s CSIRO's government funding declined, so it postponed maintenance of its buildings and facilities. Eventually it was forced to cannibalise the research budget for the most urgent maintenance work. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that John Stocker, the Chief Executive of CSIRO, has had to battle hard for even this partial restoration of his capital budget. This year's Budget allocation will also be reduced again by the so-called efficiency dividend. Each year for the past five years, the Government has cut back one per cent from all departments and agencies, asking them to compensate for the shortfall by increased so-called administrative efficiency. The Department of Finance has refused to exempt CSIRO from this dividend. I suggest that this reduces the efficiency of the main activity of CSIRO, which is research, and not just its administration. This year that efficiency dividend will cost the organisation $4.6m. Dr Stocker said on Tuesday:</PARA>
<PARA>The efficiency dividend just splats like a cowpat all over our level playing field. </PARA>
<PARA>Colourful that may be, but it is so very true. While John Stocker welcomed the extra funding for CSIRO, he made the point that repairing dilapidated assets was no longer an option and the organisation would continue to reassess its research programs as well as sell assets. In fact, CSIRO has said it must spend $35m in each of the next three years to restore scientific assets to a workable condition. It has planned to earn $15m a year from asset sales and has asked the Government to provide the rest rather than scrap further research programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Government support for CSIRO has risen by 3 per cent in real terms under the triennial funding guarantee, but its sister body, the Defence Science and Technology Organisation, has sustained a 6 per cent cut. Funding for the Australian Research Council, which is the main funding agency for research projects in Australian universities and research institutes, will rise by $39.7m to $241m in 1991-92. That sounds great, but of the total, some $72m, or nearly 30 per cent, is simply money clawed back from the universities' discretionary research budgets for recycling by the ARC through competitive grants. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation has been allocated $64.9m in this year's Budget, an increase of $2.3m, or 3.7 per cent, but a 0.8 per cent decrease in real terms. The Government has also not made any commitment to the space industry. Only $6.7m has been allocated to the national space program in this Budget and, with the Australian space industry ready for much more substantial spending than in the past, the Government is as tight as ever and likely to miss yet more opportunities in this field. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I make a very brief comment on defence. I take a special interest in this area, too, having spent some 24 years in the Services. Unfortunately, we have seen it all before. Let me give honourable members a quote:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has decided to maximise combat capability by reducing the numbers of service personnel. </PARA>
<PARA>This is a quote from the 1991-92 Budget Paper No.1, not from Lewis Carroll. I can almost say to honourable members: what more needs to be said? The Government is to abolish not the tail but the combat units-two regular battalions, one regular tank squadron, and one regular engineer and construction squadron. As I will elaborate in the debate on the Defence White Paper because there is not time tonight, there has been no strategy review and no recognition of recent historical world events. It is a cost-cutting exercise, pure and simple. It leaves this country totally vulnerable. </PARA>
<PARA> Aston, which is typical of the rest of the country, finds that this Budget offers it no help-and offers no hope to middle Australia, to the unemployed or to business. In the science and technology area the Government has partially repaired some of its previous damage but it is not enough when urgent help should be provided through technology take-up to industry. As for defence, I regret to say that it is a stain on the name of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) which I believe will haunt him to his grave. I condemn the first Kerin Budget as a criminal lost opportunity for Australia and for Australians. </PARA>

Some think it is possible to wave a magic wand and simplify taxation, leaving people and firms free to live and work in a complex financial world, released from tax.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Minister indicates, the interesting point is that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in his speech today criticised the Government for not cutting back further. He said we should have balanced the Budget. So it is quite obvious that the back bench of the Liberal Party and the Leader of the Opposition are not in tandem when it comes to fiscal policy, just as they were not in tandem when it came to a health policy before the last election. They are certainly not in tandem when it comes to their consumption tax, a policy which the National Party has and will be dragged screaming to the wire on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is also interesting that the Opposition always claims that it has a monopoly on defence. It is quite ironic that it was a Labor government that led Australia through both world wars. It was a man called John Curtin who established the most important and great alliance we have with the United States. He leaves everyone in his wake when it comes to defence. So we on this side of the House do not need any lectures from the Opposition when it comes to the defence of this nation and how we ought to look after the welfare of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Taxes are complex because of the way people do business. The system is more complex than it was even a decade or so ago. For example, when our forefathers wanted to buy new equipment or a new car they put on their wedding suit, visited their bank manager and came away with bank credit to buy their cherished item. Then emerged different ideas such as hire purchase, leasing, and chattel mortgage, which became the rage. The taxation system had to adjust. The pace of communications increased. No longer was a firm a local entity. International commerce and finance emerged as controlling forces; again, the taxation system had to adjust. </PARA>
<PARA> I think there is a lot of nonsense talked about simplification. Some use it as a lever to get the sort of laws that they want-ideally with someone else paying their tax. Simplicity is achievable on the cheap but only if equity is discarded and-shock, horror-even a single rate consumption tax is not simple. When Labor won office in 1983 it inherited a taxation system in disrepair and disrepute. Years of neglect had resulted in a system which was inequitable, inefficient, and extraordinarily complex. The chief economic adviser for the previous coalition Government, of course, was the present Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> As a member from Western Australia, I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you would know full well of the tax rorts that went on under the Liberal coalition-the bottom of the harbour schemes and the straw companies. Yet the Opposition has the audacity to come into this chamber to talk about equity and justice. Those opposite sat on their hands for three years and did nothing about those corrupt practices. It took the Labor Government to clean that up. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1983 Labor has developed a taxation system which is fairer and more efficient and which is no longer open to that massive abuse. It has been a huge task and I will briefly summarise reforms introduced by the Government during the 1980s. The top personal marginal tax rate is now 47 per cent. By comparison, when we came into office in 1983 it was 60 per cent. While we hear those opposite talk about giving more incentive by reducing taxation, in all the years they were in government they did not do that. It was the Labor Government that reduced the top rate for the high income earners in our country. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also pertinent to note that the bottom personal marginal tax rate now stands at 21 per cent. Under the previous coalition it was 30 per cent. The company tax rate is now 39 per cent compared with 49 per cent in 1983. The effective rate of company taxation in 1983 was a staggering 78.4 per cent. Of course, the introduction of the capital gains tax means that the privileged-the people represented by those on the other side of the House-who take a proportion of their income in capital gain are now taxed. This tax has encouraged a shift away from the speculative activity to more productive investment. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1983 taxation was an optional extra for the well-heeled. The Opposition is now planning to reintroduce optional taxation by eliminating capital gains. This means that PAYE taxpayers, pensioners, families, retirees, farmers, and those living in regional and remote Australia would have to make up the difference. In 1989-90 the tax paid on capital gains amounted to $543m. The introduction of the capital gains tax was opposed by the conservatives, and they still oppose it. The Opposition also opposed the introduction of the fringe benefits tax. In 1990-91 the fringe benefits tax raised an astounding $1.262m, an incredible amount of money. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor's reforms ensured fairness in the taxation system: people now pay their fair share. The long, free business lunch in the Melbourne Club cannot be paid for any longer by Australian taxpayers. By introducing franked dividends, Labor reduced the effective company tax rate. This means income received from equity investments no longer faces a double tax. Longstanding bias against equity investment in favour of debt financing has been corrected by Labor. </PARA>
<PARA> Companies deriving income overseas now pay the correct level of tax in Australia. Labor has ensured that foreign income is properly taxed. The reforms of this Government mean that elaborate company structures established in offshore tax havens cannot disguise foreign income. The Australian community now receives an appropriate return from the use of its natural resources. The resource rent tax, introduced by the Hawke Government in areas under Commonwealth control, is paid by companies which develop resources owned by the Australian community, and it is levied in addition to company tax. In 1990-91 it raised $293m. </PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of the resource rent tax was opposed by the conservatives in 1987. Every time it comes to a bit of fairness and equity, every time they have the chance to put up their hands with us to do something decent, they become butlers for the rich. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor has consistently improved the integrity of the taxation system. Substantiation requirements, the reforms to the prescribed payments system, increased audit activity by the Australian Taxation Office and the tax file number system have all acted to reduce tax evasion. The wholesale sales tax system has been changed to reduce compliance costs. As a result of Labor's reforms, wholesale sales tax collections, as a proportion of total taxation revenue, have increased at the rate of only 1.2 per cent since 1983-84. Further, as a result of Labor's tax reforms, the amount of tax paid by individuals as a proportion of total taxation revenue has declined. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has delivered the largest personal income tax cuts in Australia's history. By international standards, Australia is a low taxed country. Only three of the 23 OECD countries have a lower tax rate as a proportion of GDP than Australia. In contrast, tax revenues in other areas have increased dramatically because of Labor's initiatives. In 1989-90 capital gains tax collections were $543m. Resource rent tax collections are up by $251m since 1988-89. As I have just mentioned, the tax collected on the fringe benefits tax is $1.262 billion. These specific initiatives, which fund essential government programs at the Commonwealth, State and local level, were opposed by the conservatives. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's 12 March statement, Building a Competitive Australia, contained a number of measures designed to build on the structure of the tax system. The administrative and compliance costs associated with determining depreciation allowances will be mitigated and appreciation will now have greater regard to the effect of the economic life of assets. Goods producing businesses will be relieved from sales tax on a wider range of inputs related to the production process and the cost of undertaking environmental impact studies will now be eligible for tax deductions. </PARA>
<PARA> In short, the reforms of Labor make the system fairer. The reason for this is clear. A fairer tax system means a more efficient tax system and a more efficient economy because individuals and companies can no longer restructure their affairs to avoid their proper share. </PARA>
<PARA> As I represent a very large rural electorate and, since the redistribution came down this week, a slightly larger rural electorate, I was pleased to note a range of measures introduced in this Budget to assist people living in rural and regional Australia. I take this opportunity to compliment the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) on the work he has done in the primary industries portfolio in the past few months. He is an eminently capable Minister who has brought to his portfolio skills and a capacity to work equal to the tasks set before him. I look forward to working with him in government as Australia continues the process of growth through restructuring to become a truly robust and competitive economy once more. </PARA>
<PARA> In the current difficult times in the rural sector there is a definite need for people concerned with the current income problems and agriculture to take a balanced view of the matter. Through the combination of the Government's policy changes for the wool industry, specific assistance measures for the wool and wheat industries, increased general assistance measures through the rural adjustment scheme and the rural counselling program and the improvement in the climatic outlook, we now have more grounds for optimism than at any other stage over the past year. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that this year will be much worse in the rural sector in some regards. Many farmers have a problem because they went into last year with some liquidity when commodity prices were falling, as I am sure you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, being a farmer yourself. The problem is that a lot of that equity is being used up and they are facing a year which is just as tough with virtually no equity. We recognise that as these times are tough the Government is determined to keep as many farmers on the land as possible provided they are potentially profitable. </PARA>
<PARA> We have increased funding for the rural adjustment scheme by some $100m to $160m this year. This gives the Commonwealth the capacity to support up to $1.4 billion of rural debt under the scheme. The Government acted promptly and responsibly to ensure that those farmers most in need will receive appropriate assistance. It is true that we cannot borrow our way out of debt, but many farmers can restructure and, over time, will be able to work their way through the system. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you know there are three parts to the rural adjustment schemes-parts A, B and C-that take account of the various issues and problems farmers have. </PARA>
<PARA> The time has now come for all parties to get back to more positive thinking. It is vital that community groups, financial institutions, local authorities and farmers' organisations work together to support their own actions and the actions of governments which will build on the solid future for agriculture and rural areas. We must not be complacent. Neither must we fall for the trap of being so consumed with the challenges in front of us that we fail to recognise turning points and an improved outlook. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision in the Budget to modify changes to the assets testing requirements for the family allowance and family allowance supplement components of the new family payment recognise the particular circumstances of farm families and people with small businesses who can be experiencing financial hardships while having substantial assets despite low and even negative incomes; in other words, some people are asset rich but income poor. This is a category that many farmers have fallen into due to the commodity price slump. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, student assistance through Austudy and the assistance for isolated children's scheme will be available and a hardship provision will be introduced so that the present assets test, effectively $695,000 for farm and business assets, will not apply if a student's parents or spouse receive a social security benefit, veterans pension or household support under the RAS scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> I certainly also support the establishment of a rural industries business extension service, RIBES, which will facilitate the development of agricultural and related businesses with particular emphasis on assisting export orientation and value adding. It makes little sense encouraging non-viable farmers off the land if there is nothing else for them to do. This new service will increase the scope to develop integrated and innovative approaches to production, marketing and value adding. Some measures will complement and build on existing State and Federal programs to promote regional economic development. Studies of some of these programs indicate a very good return on the investment. </PARA>
<PARA> The biggest problem facing rural and remote Australia is the corrupted trade practices. We spoke about this matter in this House earlier in the week on a matter of public importance. While we can put mechanisms in place through the Budget process, until we can get a decent price for our commodities-80 per cent of farm product has to be sold overseas-we are always going to do it tough. This year the conclusion of the Uruguay Round-successfully, I hope-will play a bigger role than probably any other event for the future of Australian agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA> We are in tough times. We are in a recession. It is not a recession that we invented or discovered here; it is a world recession. The world is going through a recessed time. In England, Ireland, Europe, Russia and the United States we see the same thing. We cannot become isolated from those events. Sometimes I wish we could, but the fact is that we cannot. We are a trading nation. As a consequence of that, the events that happen overseas impact on us. This is the first Budget in five years that will come in with a deficit. This is because the Government has believed-I fully support this proposition-that it was not possible to cut any further outlays without destroying programs. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard much tonight from speakers on the other side of the House. Today the Leader of the Opposition said that he cares about the poor. We care about the poor and we care about families and pensioners. That is why we have put so much money into those programs since 1983, and we will continue to do so. But there is a limit to how much we can spend. Under those circumstances I believe that the Budget and the Appropriation Bills have been responsible. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the Opposition's duty to try to attack and criticise what we do. I think that is fair and valid. That is what we expect. It is interesting that today the Leader of the Opposition talked about the unemployed who, after nine months of opposition and Liberal Party yuppie programs, will be thrown on the scrap heap. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition talked about workers getting a fair go and yet the Opposition wants to take us back to the old work practices of the turn of the century and introduce voluntary agreements, which are simply a return to the jungle. They are not about equity or anything else. Earlier tonight we heard the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) saying how he cared about coalminers. This is a man from the National Party in Queensland which tried to bring in the most archaic industrial relations program we have seen and made it quite clear, when it was in government, that it wanted to destroy organised labour and the viability of people like the very coalminers that the Leader of the National Party purported to support and be concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA> When it comes to making tough decisions-and we have been criticised for not making tough decisions-we need to look at the runs on the board. I have mentioned some of those decisions tonight. Let us look at tariffs. Who had the courage to make the tough tariff cuts and bring Australia into the twentieth century? It was the Labor Government. The Liberal and National parties were fighting and screaming all the time to avoid seeing the commonsense of tariff cuts. Even over the past few months the Federal members of the National Party in Queensland have been running around saying they do not support tariff cuts. In fact one frontbencher from the National Party in Queensland said that his Party there does not support a free trade policy, and yet the National Party purports to represent rural Australia. Without access to freer trade, Australia has no future for agricultural products, yet the Opposition says we have not made enough tough decisions or been visionary. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at jobs-this goes to the very heart of the Labor movement and philosophy-the Opposition does not say that 1.4 million jobs have been created by Labor since it came into office. There is no doubt that many people are looking for work today. In my electorate there are people-too many, as far as I am concerned-who are looking for work. We are putting in place programs. On a local basis, like the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin), who spoke earlier, I am doing what I can. In fact tonight while I speak a member of the Bundaberg CES, Mr Wayne Reid, is in the gallery; he is in Canberra on a course to help implement some of the programs. Bundaberg CES does a great job under tough conditions. As a result of the drop in commodity prices, we have much higher unemployment than some other areas in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it will take a lot of goodwill and commonsense to overcome those problems. It will take a government of compassion and at the end of the day, when we count the runs on the board, we have more runs than the other side when it comes to compassion, to vision and to equity, and we always will have. The real difference between capital and labour is that we represent the principles that are right and proper and the other side basically represents greed. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The past 48 hours of leadership struggles in the Kremlin and on the world stage are mirrored in the leadership tensions in the Government between the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) over the preparation of this Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The power of the ACTU and Bill Kelty's failed accord and his demand that the superannuation arrangements be introduced under the Budget provisions are also a reflection of the deals done between the Government and the trade union movement. Of course the left wing has suddenly re-emerged with Gough Whitlam and Tom Uren coming out from the past with the proposition that we spend $800m on urban renewal, including $56m in the current year. </PARA>
<PARA> I challenge the Government on where those funds would come from in this time of crisis and what they would do around Australia, especially the $56m that is to be allocated to all capital cities. What about the farmers, the small businessmen and the people who live in country areas? What will they gain from this discredited urban renewal program put forward by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe), who has all the vigour of the left wing supporting him?</PARA>
<PARA> In the first part of his speech the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) was typical of members of the Labor Party and their approach to the Budget process. He was very keen to extract the last dollar from hardworking Australians. His litany of taxation measures introduced by this Government since 1983 is a clear indication of the way in which the Australian Labor Party operates in taxing average Australians to the very last cent of their capacity to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the Budget brought down in this House. It does not acknowledge any particular failures over the past eight years; it paints a picture of `steady as she goes' and the only encouraging feature I can see in the Budget is the inflationary potential of 3 per cent. Of course, that has yet to be locked in but I acknowledge the considerable achievement of a possible 3 per cent inflation rate in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> All honourable members would be aware that that has been brought about by the recession that we had to have and the general slowdown of the Australian economy. If we look carefully at the fine print, we find that we will suffer a current account deficit of $14 billion. Nowhere in the speech of the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) is this mentioned, whereas in the Budget Speeches of previous Treasurers that important statistic was always recorded. The estimate of how much Australia will trade in deficit has generally been clear in the past eight years but in this case we had to turn over the pages to find out exactly what the figure was and what the Government had in mind. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no mention of interest rates. They remain unbearably high for businessmen, individuals and householders. It is well known to everyone in Australia that we are carrying an overseas debt of approximately $150 billion, which we owe to all those foreigners who have lent us money. Australians, their families and their grandchildren will have to pay off this massive debt.</PARA>
<PARA> Moving to the recession we had to have, even the Treasurer yesterday got mixed up a little bit with `recession' and `depression'. We on this side of the House know it is a depression as we move around our electorates and see the quite stark devastation that this Government has brought upon hardworking Australians. We now have 830,000 unemployed Australians; that is, about 9.8 per cent of the work force. However, even worse is to come; it is predicted in the Budget that there will be 880,000 Australians who will not be able to find a job-that is, some 10.5 per cent of the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> It is even more relevant that the Prime Minister himself acknowledged in Question Time yesterday, when challenged, that there are about 200,000 to 400,000 other Australians who are not in full time work, who have work for perhaps an hour or half a day a week and are themselves seeking jobs of a full time nature. That would take us up to an unemployment rate of 1.3 million Australians seeking a job under the Hawke Labor Government. The Prime Minister, who was the President of the ACTU, presides over this remarkable lack of job opportunities. We note that today Bob Carr, the Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales, reinforced the Opposition's point of view that the number of unemployed in Australia is totally unacceptable to the Labor movement as well as to our side of politics. </PARA>
<PARA> In Geelong, in the electorate of Corangamite, we had 13,500 registered unemployed in June 1991. It is projected that by June 1992, along with those hard-core unemployed, there will be 20,000 unemployed. After talking to the people who are handling those sorts of statistics, I understand that there is very little hope for those people who do not have jobs in the Geelong region to get jobs over the next two or three years. As honourable members would know, the Ford Motor Co. has laid off large numbers of its work force, reducing it from some 5,100 to 4,000 people, and that has had a major impact in the Geelong region. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor governments, both Federal and State, tend to change the names of the operations in the hope that the name of a particular activity will take away the stigma. In this case the dole is now called the Jobsearch allowance, when one has been looking for a job for 12 months. After 12 months, one can have a Newstart allowance. However, that does not really take away the terrible human problem of unemployment and the misery that goes with it. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the Budget Papers, we can really understand why the Budget is now in deficit to the extent of $4.7 billion. In 1989-90, unemployment benefits totalled $3.7 billion. In the next Budget year, 1991-92, it is estimated these unemployment benefits will double, to $7.6 billion. What an indictment of this Government and the Budget process that this amount of hard-earned revenue has to be paid out to those unfortunate unemployed people.</PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the superannuation argument. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) dwelt strongly on this this afternoon in his very vigorous defence of our position and in relation to the Budget. I notice that the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) is in the chamber. He has had long experience in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and would be aware of the quite remarkable situation in which we have a Government which supports the centralised wage fixing system but cannot get a superannuation arrangement through the centralised wage fixing system. </PARA>
<PARA> Kelty could not get his deal through; he could not put enough pressure on Mr Justice Maddern. So what does the ACTU do? It has a late night session up in the Lodge with the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is under a bit of pressure, and so they say, `We'll do a deal; we can't get it through the Industrial Relations Commission, so we will legislate'. Of course, they have done the deal, and now businesses throughout Australia will be paying 5 per cent superannuation by July 1992. But the Government did admit-and it is an acknowledgment of the difficulties confronting small business-`You'll be only obliged to pay 3 per cent until we get the full program'. </PARA>
<PARA> Interestingly enough, the Government has gone along with the honourable member for Blaxland, who wants to have about 12 per cent by the year 2000, and it has high aims to extract a considerable amount of money from employers to support its superannuation arrangements. In fact, it is a de facto payroll tax. If we look at the total oncost of any employer, we see that it includes a 17 1/2 per cent holiday loading; a rostered day off, which causes a great amount of difficulty within the work force; superannuation; holiday pay; sick leave; Workcare; long service leave; and of course State payroll tax as well. So, if we look at these times of unemployment, we find that the superannuation will exacerbate that particular problem and add considerably to the difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Chris Murphy, the ex-Treasury mandarin, indicates in his own model that unemployment may rise by 100,000 persons because of the superannuation impost and that inflation may rise by between 1 1/2 per cent and 4 per cent by the year 1995. My recommendation is that, if employers pay superannuation, employees should make their own contributions so that they can have some responsibility for their own retirement. </PARA>
<PARA> Again the Labor Government, in these difficult times, has added $200m to the labour market training schemes. I find it quite remarkable in this context to see that SkillShare and Jobstart have moved from $315m to $515m, nearly half a billion dollars, to prepare people for jobs that are not there. The Government will be spending this half a billion dollars on training when there will be only 80,000 new jobs this year, whereas normally the market would grow by 150,000 jobs a year. It is really quite a strange approach that we have in Australia. When there is a downturn, we immediately start to invest in training schemes and prepare the work force for jobs that are not available. </PARA>
<PARA> As to a couple of other matters within the Budget, we suddenly see in the small print the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency. This is a sop to the greens, if ever I saw one. Sixty new staff will be employed, and that will be 60 more reasons for businesses not to invest in Australia. A total of $8 billion is to be invested in this particular agency, which is duplicated in the States all around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Medicare arrangements that have been made indicate quite clearly that the Government recognises that Medicare as a concept has been a failure. It has acknowledged that there needs to be a payment by the patients of $3.50 to $5 and that, unless we make some contribution from the patient's point of view, Medicare will become completely out of control. I agree with the Treasurer's indication in his Budget Speech that the demand for health services doubles every 20 years, and that is an indication of what will happen unless we change the whole aspect of Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA> The Medicare levy itself, as all honourable members would be aware if they look at the figures, provides only one-fifth of the total health costs. The levy clearly indicates that the provision of health care is not free in Australia. Both the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) and the Treasurer have now acknowledged that there is a failure of universal equitable Medicare health schemes here in Australia. What we on this side of the House are advocating is that individual Australians take out private health insurance to look after their own health needs. </PARA>
<PARA> I look now at the revenue side of the Budget in view of the recession that we `had to have'. In a Budget providing for expenditure of about $101 billion we see that the Treasurer has had to cook the books, because the Government has had to provide for assets sales of $625m. We are not too sure how they will take place in the current climate. Not only that, but the Government has also had to take $1.9 billion from the Reserve Bank of Australia to try to reduce the deficit of $4.7 billion. In addition to that, the public sector borrowing has doubled from 2.4 per cent of GDP to 4.4 per cent of GDP, adding to the Government's indebtedness. </PARA>
<PARA> Another thing that Australian taxpayers will be unaware of is that PAYE taxpayers who work through a tax agent will have to pay their tax at an earlier time. It is just unclear what the detail might be but, there again, the Government is trying to extract-exactly as the honourable member for Hinkler was saying-the very last cent from the hard working taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has moved the fringe benefits tax up 1 1/4 per cent, just to extract a few more dollars. It gets $1.2 billion from that tax. In relation to capital gains tax, again the former Treasurer (Mr Keating) suggested in 1985 that there would only be $25m from that tax. We now see that in 1989-90 it raised $582m and in the next year it is projected to raise $631m. I ask: what will happen next year when the asset values have so dramatically dropped and the capital gains tax is calculated?</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service will be a matter of considerable public debate over the next 12 months, as you, Mr Deputy Speaker, would know, as there is full cost recovery with meat inspectors, who are paid a salary of approximately $30,000, being charged out to meatworks for about $67,000. Not only is the charge too great, but also all of us are aware of the rorts, work practices and sheer inefficiency of the inspectors involved with meatworks throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Budget does not really address the problems facing the nation. The only one positive, as I have cited, is the lowering of the inflation rate. There is the balance of payments, again in the fine print, of $14 billion; our national debt of $150 billion; and we see that the Government really has no wages policy. Accord mark VI has been a failure, as acknowledged by Kelty and everyone in the trade union movement, and even the Labour Council of New South Wales today acknowledged that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has not addressed the problem of high interest rates. Max Walsh had a very good article in the Sydney Morning Herald today in which he made some observations about the interest rates, our exchange rate, the eternal problem of our national debt and the problem we have in servicing our international debt. He said this:</PARA>
<PARA>Our foreign debt has placed us in a Catch 22 situation over depreciation. Any significant depreciation of the Australian dollar will simply increase our already extremely large interest payment bill on our foreign debt. Unless interest rates are lifted there may well be a stampede out of the Australian dollar as sharp depreciations threaten to create a vicious circle of inflation and further depreciation. But lifting interest rates in the present economic environment would see unemployment move quickly up the double digit scale. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what Max Walsh has to say about that very difficult problem, and I agree with him. Of course, the Government has done nothing to try to address the problem of the high interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been interested in the comments by the Tasman Institute about the former Treasurer. It was making some observations again about the high interest rate policy that the former Treasurer imposed upon all Australians and upon this Parliament. It did a very carefully researched paper to indicate the problems that he brought upon the farmers, the small businessmen and the big businessmen. I would like to quote it, because it is an independent observer and it had this to say about the `Keating gap':</PARA>
<PARA>This `Keating gap' of Australia over foreign real interest rates approached 5 per cent in 1985-86 and again in 1989-90. Many of Australia's other macroeconomic problems over 1983-91, including the increase in foreign debt and the length and severity of the current recession, were related to our high inflation and interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> The main source of Australia's higher inflation rate was its excessively high average rate of money growth. The major explanation for the extremely high real interest rates was the variable and unpredictable nature of monetary policy. </PARA>
<PARA>There is an indictment by an independent group of the way in which the former Treasurer handled the finances of this nation. What a legacy he has left everyone in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In my final remarks I draw the attention of the House to a small liquidator operating in the city of Geelong who contacted me only yesterday and informed me of the very real human problems he was encountering on a day by day basis. The small businesses he is liquidating are now at the end of their tether. The high interest rate policies of this Government have brought them to rack and ruin. They are now selling their houses; they are quitting any stocks they have. One of the major difficulties they have in winding up their businesses is paying out Workcare, accumulated holiday pay, sick pay and all those add-ons for their work force. When they finally sell up, with nothing left, their only consolation is that Treasurer Keating and the Government have made a major contribution to their demise by reducing small business activity in the Geelong region. </PARA>
<PARA> I also conducted a survey into small businesses in the Geelong area, and a couple of the comments made are quite interesting. One said: `The Government thinks small business has an underground cash reservoir'. Some cash reservoir! Some had no cash flow. The general attitude of these small businessmen is an air of pessimism about their ability to survive the next 12 months. The only air of optimism in the Geelong area is the hope that Geelong will win the premiership, which might bring a touch of optimism to the area. I say to the honourable member for Higgins that we are very hopeful that that will happen on grand final day. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is very clear in its policy position. We will strongly and positively advocate tax reform. We will change the industrial relations position in Australia. Our more radical view has now become conventional wisdom. We will reform the waterfront, we will cut government expenditure and we will provide a more prudent management of the economy. We will improve the transport system, we will introduce a program of privatisation, and we will encourage an attitudinal change in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, could I say that the patron saint of the helpless, St Jude, offers more to Australians than does the first Kerin Budget. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Provoked, indeed. If I could comment briefly on the contribution of the Leader of the Opposition-I felt that I was listening to a matter of public importance rather than to the considered views of the Opposition. Naturally, I would expect the Opposition in part to criticise the Government-that is what one expects of the Opposition-but in a constructive way, outlining a program to the people of Australia, allowing them to make their choice between the Budget presented by the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) and the program enunciated by the Leader of the Opposition. I am sure it was a disappointment not only to me but also to many Australians who would have been listening, waiting to hear details, rather than a vague promise of bipartisan support, and statements about the introduction of a consumption tax, about which the Opposition cannot give us any detail-just like its health policy-and the cutting of expenditure, but no indication of where it would be cut.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The contribution by the Leader of the Opposition was more akin to the normal day-to-day parliamentary battle that we call a matter of public importance, rather than a considered contribution by the Leader of an Opposition presenting an alternative program for the people of Australia, in a time which I freely acknowledge is very difficult for many of our fellow Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> Much has been said about superannuation. In particular, I deeply resent the suggestion by the honourable member for Corangamite that this is a de facto payroll tax. A payroll tax is a horrible thing. It is administered by State governments and it is a head tax on the number of people in employment. It will be very difficult to remove-I would not argue against that; but superannuation is nothing like that. What is the credibility of the Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Corangamite on the issue of superannuation? The man after whom my electorate was named, Ben Chifley, the member for Macquarie, in the 1940s introduced the national welfare fund. Every working Australian had to pay a portion of his wages into tax, separately accounted for, so that in old age we would have a fully funded, effective superannuation plan. </PARA>
<PARA> This scheme was introduced and it worked very well. Who abolished it-and abolished it in two ways? Firstly, the conservative Prime Minister Menzies removed the amount of the contribution from income tax statements that ordinary workers received, so they could no longer identify the proportion that was going into the national welfare fund. Then he effectively scuttled the national welfare fund and paid pensions out of Consolidated Revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that while the Budget was being presented I had with me some friends who came from Europe. They were bemused by this argument about superannuation, because many European countries, going back to the 1930s, have national superannuation. It is the English-speaking countries that have failed adequately to address the needs of their citizens in old age. Those people saw the plans outlined by the Treasurer as being understandable-maybe very late, but something they are familiar with. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we have the proposition from the Opposition that somehow this superannuation contribution by employers is going to add to inflation. Firstly, the Opposition is concerned that it could add 2 per cent to inflation. It is not worried that a 15 per cent consumption tax can lead to a 17 per cent inflation rate. Those are not my figures, they are the figures of Eric Risstrom of the Australian Taxpayers Association. The honourable member for Corangamite has no worries about 17 per cent inflation and what that might do in a recession. He is worried about 2 per cent. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QI4">Mr PRICE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What he ignores is the fact that the Government is able, through its proper relationship with the trade union movement and through the accord, to take into account the social aspects of its program, including superannuation. That will be fully taken into account when it is looking for wage outcomes. So it is absolutely preposterous to suggest that automatically there will be a 2 per cent inflationary effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other thing I would like to say, and this is what I take exception to from the honourable member for Corangamite, is that a payroll tax goes straight into the coffers of State governments. It is not earmarked for any special purpose; it goes straight into Consolidated Revenue. We cannot trace what a State government is doing with it, but we can with superannuation. It is going to help ordinary Australians when they get older, and the fact is that more of them will get older. We will have a greying problem in Australia, yet we are ridiculed because we want to make adequate preparation for that eventuality. </PARA>
<PARA> When I go around to my pensioners-and I like doing that-they thank me for what the Government is doing. They like the fact that pensions are indexed, but I have never heard any of them suggest that their life is so comfortable that it could not be made a little more comfortable if they had something else to fall back on. That is what this Government is guilty of wanting to do-to make people not fear their old age and to perhaps enjoy it in slightly more comfortable circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike payroll tax, which goes straight into State government consolidated revenue, superannuation has a profound impact on national savings. I would agree with the Opposition if it said, as a number of prominent businessmen have done recently, `We need to save, and what better way to do it than to provide a safety net for Australians in their old age and be able to use the superannuation funds to generate the extra savings that Australia wants'. It was the conservatives, under Menzies, who scuttled the national welfare fund introduced by Ben Chifley in the 1940s. They left Australia with the present system. Previously it was fully funded. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition and the honourable member for Corangamite came into the House today and said how terrible it was that some 40 years later we want to return to the system that Menzies scuttled. I have no shame about that. I think it is a decent thing to do for ordinary Australians. The Opposition often says, `How would Ben Chifley feel about this aspect or that aspect?'. If I could contact him-unfortunately I cannot-I think he would say that he was damned well delighted. I can say to people in my electorate that this is heartland stuff; it is what traditional Labor governments do. Whilst we have done many things during our term of office of which we can be proud, this proposal will stand the test of time. </PARA>
<PARA> People talk about the impact of taxation on ordinary Australians. It is no secret that this Government, with the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) at the forefront, has been through the difficult period of wanting to reform our taxation system. Why would we not want to do so? After all, it was the Opposition, when in government, with the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) as Treasurer and his adviser, the present Leader of the Opposition, which entrenched tax avoidance scams and failed to broaden the taxation base so that ordinary pay-as-you-earn taxpayers-that is, ordinary Australians-were paying an unfair burden of taxation. We changed that. The former Government did not do so. We introduced other progressive measures-for example, the fringe benefits tax, and the capital gains tax, which is now collecting about $500m. But each day, as values increase, the potential take from the capital gains tax will be greater. We reduced the 60 per cent marginal tax rate to 47c in the dollar. Nowadays more Australians are actually paying tax. The former Government may have had a higher tax regime, but the privileged wealthy were avoiding it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition needs to enunciate his consumption tax and the details of it. The Australian people deserve that. They should be respected and given the details. I have talked about the inflationary effect of such a tax. There are wonderful people in my electorate of Chifley and, like them, I am a bit of a battler: I do not mind being associated with them. I worry about the impact of imposing perhaps a 15 per cent tax on food, and I worry about what impact such a tax will have on school clothes and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Risstrom, the National Director of the Australian Taxpayers Association, says that there has not been enough analysis done of the consumption tax. He estimates that up to 75 per cent of the expenditure of ordinary men and women will be caught in the consumption tax net. That might not worry some of my learned friends opposite, but it would strike terror in me. Mr Risstrom wants to cut government expenditure. That is fair enough. It is always worth looking at what can be cut. However, when people announce that they want to cut $3 billion or $5 billion from government expenditure, they have a responsibility to detail to the Australian people where those cuts will be made and, more particularly, whom they will benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Corangamite and the Leader of the Opposition talked about the plight of the unemployed. I know only too well from my electorate the difficulties of the people who are unemployed. Whilst we may feel in some way that we have provided some safety nets for those on the unemployment benefit, that does not take away our concern for those individuals. However, what the Leader of the Opposition did not say to the Australian people today was that he wants to take away all benefits after people have been unemployed for nine months. The long term unemployed-irrespective of whether they have a family, live on their own, are at risk, are literate or illiterate, or have skills-will not fall into the safety net. They will receive no support. They will be thrown on the mercy of their families and friends. That is the Opposition's attitude in a recession, and I think that it is scandalous. </PARA>
<PARA> What is worse, Opposition members come into this chamber with this unctuous attitude and say, `We regret the situation and look forward to coming out of the recession'. The situation is different from that which existed in 1983. The Leader of the Opposition did not mention the differences. In 1983 we were in a terrible bind. Not only did we have high unemployment but also we had high inflation. We had ballooning government expenditure. Government expenditure was out of control under the stewardship of the honourable member for Bennelong and his chief adviser, the present Leader of the Opposition. That was the situation we faced when we came to office. </PARA>
<PARA> Presently we have low inflation. The latest inflation figure was at a record 20 year low. This Government's policies provide an opportunity, through cooperation with the trade union movement, to lock that in. Our inflation rate is lower than that of our trading partners; it is lower than in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. That provides a sustainable, anti-cyclical and long term way of getting out of this recession. For my part, I wish it would occur sooner. What I am convinced of is that we are trending out of it. But we do not have the problem of stagflation and expenditure out of control as we did in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to deprecate the learning of the Leader of the Opposition. In fact, if I had my way every Australian would attain the academic heights of the Leader of the Opposition. However, in his approach to economic matters he has a tremendous belief in economic models, that once there is a model and a print-out there can be no other truth. I wish that economics and management of the Government would be as good as that. I signal to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, what I see as something of a weakness in his make-up. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a lot of good things in this Budget for my electorate and I want to mention quite a few of them. Mr Deputy Speaker, you might be interested to know that in the electorate of Chifley about 20,000 families are already receiving family allowance and about 1,200 families are receiving the family allowance supplement. Naturally, I am delighted that these two programs are being integrated; the threshold is being increased from $18,000 per annum to $19,300 and will be indexed from January 1992. That probably means that another 50,000 families-I hope a good proportion of them in Chifley-will be able to be assisted by child payments to pensioners, beneficiaries and low income families. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the better cities program. In Chifley I understand what urban town planning is all about because, as a resident, I have seen the growth of the suburbs of Mount Druitt from the little village of Mount Druitt and I have seen St Clair, Erskine Park, Foxdale and Hassell Grove grow dramatically. I had the pleasure of having the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) out to Hassell Grove just to see the problems of families trying to set up in the new estate.</PARA>

<PARA> It seemed a triumph to get such a trivial thing as a mail box, as I used to call it, or a post mailing facility, as I think the Commonwealth calls it, and a public telephone for an estate of 1,000 houses. It is a triumph just to have a place where residents can meet and maybe even have an estate worker. There is no doubt that ultimately estates get the facilities they require, but why should it be 10 or 15 years after people have first moved in? When people first move in, they budget down to the last dollar, they are at a point of great stress and it is a time when there are the least facilities available. There has to be a better way for other subdivisions, other developments, to cater for the needs of families who are usually moving into their first home or, alternatively, moving out of rented accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the better cities program in the Budget. I commend it and I know, Mr Deputy Speaker, that you too understand the issues. I am also pleased to see the education budget increased dramatically. In particular, the adult literacy budget has increased by $2.6m. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member said that the coalition policy on unemployment would throw people on the scrap heap after nine months. This is part of the total propaganda message that those opposite are repeating again and again because they have failed. They are fearful, they know they have failed and they know that they will be tossed out at the next election. One just has to talk privately with any of the members of the Government: they all know that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I had to immediately give the lie-and that is not being offensive-to the honourable member for Chifley for what he said which was untrue. In this House we get members of the Government, particularly Ministers at Question Time, who do not answer questions but fabricate and embroider. Unless we challenge that, it is accepted. There is no way I will ever quietly stand by and accept the total untruths being put forward by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to start with the Budget. The 1991 Federal Budget is a boring Budget. It is a Budget that lacks vision; it lacks hope and it lacks planning-just as the whole of the current Hawke Government lacks vision, hope and planning. Quite frankly, there is no hope for those opposite. They have lost their fire. When they first came in, they had a bit of zeal, a bit of get up and go. Now they are tired, they have run out of ideas and they have failed. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget offered absolutely nothing for Australians who are experiencing or anticipating the gut wrenching fear of recession, unemployment and poverty. Ever since 1982-83 the coalition has been beaten over the head by the Labor front and back benches about what happened when we were in government. They trot out the time-worn, stale bit of pastry about a deficit of $9 billion. We all know-and those opposite know if they were to tell the truth-that that was a wish list, a shopping list, and that the Budget deficit was never going to be in that area. The reason those opposite use that figure is that they cannot defend what they have done themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us face it: there was a four-year recession. But it was not of the making of the government of the day, as the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) knows full well. We had a four-year drought, one of the worst droughts since white European settlement in this country. That created the recession which ended after the rains at the end of 1982. That created the recession, which was not created by the Fraser-Anthony Government. But everybody knows that the recession that is killing Australia now-the recession that is having the most adverse effect on Australian men, women, children and families-has been deliberately set in action by the present Labor Government. It is the result of direct Government policy. </PARA>
<PARA> What has happened over the last eight years? The Labor Government has led the Australian economy into the depths of despair and destruction. This used to be a land of opportunity. Now all we can say about Australia under Hawke-and it used to be Keating, and now it is Kerin-is that it is a land of lost opportunity. The opportunities have been there, and in fact the opportunities would be there now if we had a government which was courageous enough to take the right decisions to get this country moving again. But this Government is not courageous enough. For the time being, until the Hawke Labor Government is thrown out of office, Australia is a land of lost opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> The gravest problem facing Australia at the present time is unemployment. It is predicted to peak at 10.8 per cent. Of course, what is even more staggering is the seasonally adjusted unemployment figure for those aged 15 to 19. They are the bright hopes of Australia's future, the youngsters who, a decade ago, could have been looking forward to a life of prosperity and success. The bright hopes of Australia's future now face a staggering 28.5 per cent unemployment rate. Nearly three in 10 of Australia's young people are unemployed. As far as I am concerned, that is a shameful disaster. I am horrified by it. Well in excess of 800,000 people are registered as unemployed, and that will grow very rapidly indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) proclaims that his Government has created over one million jobs, but, of course, he fails to mention that not all of those jobs are full time jobs. A great many of them are only part time. Of course, those people are partly unemployed, but the Government does not have the intestinal fortitude to add the partly unemployed to the unemployment figures. It adds the partly employed to the job figures, but not the other way around. That just demonstrates this Government's complete lack of courage. It ignores the partly employed people who have been impoverished or are living in poverty because of the recession we had to have. </PARA>
<PARA> I note with some amazement that when the honourable member for Chifley spoke about his electorate a short while ago, he said with pride that in his electorate alone there were 20,000 families receiving the family allowance and another 1,200 receiving the family allowance supplement. Then he went on to say that he hoped another 50,000 families would be helped in his electorate. I do not know how many people he has got in his electorate, but it seems to be growing faster than The Prime Minister's job creation figures. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us go back to his current figures-20,000 families receiving the family allowance. That means that there are 20,000 families just in that Labor electorate who are in poverty. That is an absolute indictment of the total failure of this Government's attempts to try to run an economy. If I were the honourable member for Chifley, I would not be proud of his Government's failure-that so many people have to be on welfare in his electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say, and I have to be fair dinkum, that in my electorate of Cowper there is very strong unemployment. This is because it is a growth industry. People migrate to my electorate because, as the CSIRO says, between Port Macquarie and Coffs Harbour the climate is the optimum climate for the human animal. Naturally, we get very high unemployment figures because people would rather by unemployed there than in the colder places. The level of retired people is very high indeed. I just wonder whether this tragedy of unemployment is going to end if we do not get a change of government. It is essential that we get a change of government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Government claims to be fair and compassionate and to believe in equity. It acts as though it has a mortgage on those sentiments. We get the front bench members of the Government standing up day after day and looking across to the Opposition benches. They sneer and mock because that is all that they can do. That is the only defence they have got at the moment. They have become quite a joke-quite laughable. </PARA>
<PARA> If we go back to the Budget of the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) of Tuesday afternoon, we see that there was nothing in it. I have got no hesitation at all in saying that everybody on this side of the House and, I believe, on the other side is caring and compassionate. We would not be members of this Parliament if we did not care about Australia, if we did not care about our fellow Australians. Quite frankly, I get offended when those people on the Government benches stand up and claim to have a mortgage on the very natural sentiments and emotions shared by everybody in this place. </PARA>

Go through the Treasurer's Budget Speech. Look for anything in it which would engender a sense of pride in Australia. It is not there.

<PARA> I was not really surprised that road funding was to drop by another $36m in real terms this financial year. After all, the Government has decreased road funding by 30 per cent in real terms in the last seven years. All I can say-and I say it clearly-to the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) is that he had better not cut back on the funding on the Pacific Highway. He gave an obligation that there would be double funding-at least for the current three years. </PARA>

The concept has been accepted. All we need now is for the money to flow and the funding to be confirmed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am also concerned about the superannuation contents of this Budget. We need the vision in policy to create security for the elderly. I am not talking about the elderly now-although we have to care for them, of course. I am talking about the elderly in five years, 10 years, 15 years, 20 years, or 50 years. These are the people we are talking about if we are talking about superannuation. Yet, the superannuation plan proposed by the Government-the Government that prides itself on fairness and equity-is based on discrimination. If one happens to work for an employer who has a payroll of over $500,000, that person is okay. That person will get a 5 per cent contribution. But if, on the other hand, that person works for someone whose payroll is under the magic $500,000 figure, that person will get only 3 per cent. That person becomes a second class citizen. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us face it: whether it is 3 per cent or 5 per cent, there is a built-in inequity. I recall when I first started working and received superannuation. As the employee, I made a contribution to my superannuation. The employer did too. I still believe that that is fair and equitable, and that any reasonable program for superannuation will see contributions coming from both employers and employees. If people are not putting into it, if they get something for free, they will not value it very highly-whether it is superannuation or anything else. </PARA>
<PARA> The sad thing, of course, is that the superannuation program provided in this Budget will axiomatically, at 5 per cent, create another 100,000 unemployed. That is another 100,000 men and women thrown on the scrap heap. The sad thing about this unemployment, the thing that really gets me, is that the people who are going to lose their jobs tomorrow-there will be people who will lose their jobs tomorrow-will not know when or if they will ever get another job. If they happen to be my age, or in their mid-30s or in their 40s, it is odds-on that they will not get another job-not under this Government. The other point is that by the year 2000, if the scheme goes ahead, there will be a massive $600 billion to $800 billion involved in superannuation funds. Sensible Australians will ask: who is going to control that massive amount of capital, which will have such an influence on investment?</PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that the Budget has given Australians an increase in the threshold to the family allowance supplement; but I come back to the point I made about the honourable member for Chifley. The Government has created poverty right through the whole of Australian society. It has our farmers in a situation where in this financial year they are going to have negative income. That means, in simple terms, that they are going to make a loss; they are not going to have any income at all. They are going to have negative income; they are going to make a loss. So the Government has properly provided for more social security access for our farming community. But they should not have to apply for it; they should not need it. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Government's policies were working, if we had an economy which was on the move, the hardworking and efficient farmers of Australia would not need social security. With proper management, a proper government-a government that is not the failed no-hoper, down and out government like this one-they would not need social security support. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also concerned about the situation with the better cities program. I totally agree that some Australian cities are choking themselves to death. We need some urban renewal, but I question the motivation of the $800m program being provided by this Hawke Labor Government. There are economies of scale with cities, but there comes a point-and I believe that Sydney and Melbourne are examples of it-where inefficiency starts to escalate. I think we need to look at the possibility of capping or limiting the growth of our current major cities. We should be looking at new cities. I mention in passing that in the Port Macquarie area in the Hastings Valley there is an amazingly exciting project-Hastings 2000-to create a new city development. It is one that deserves the attention of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to finish where I started, by talking about the need for vision, for planning and for hope. As I have said-and as everybody in Australia knows-this Government has no vision, no plans, and it offers no hope. The complete revision and reform of our taxation system by the abolition of a wholesale sales tax, the substantial reduction of income tax, the introduction of a goods and services tax, increases in incomes for pensioners and other low income people and complete reform of our industrial relations situation are essential so that the Australian economy can get on the move. That will be provided when we assume government at the next election, because we have the vision, we have the plans and we offer hope. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been sitting here for a little while listening to the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl). He is a person whom I consider to be very sincere, a person who really believes in what he says, but I think he really does have it all wrong. I would expect and can understand that he would oppose this Budget. He opposed it in such a way as to make it look as if the Opposition has all the answers and as if the Government does not know what it is doing. In fact, the Government does know what it is doing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no question that at the moment the country is undergoing some very difficult economic times. I do not think that over the last couple of months anybody has got up in this Parliament and tried to deny that fact. The fact is that we do have unacceptable levels of unemployment. On a number of occasions the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has publicly addressed that situation and has publicly apologised and said that he regrets that that is the position. </PARA>
<PARA> Contrary to what those opposite would do in a situation of high unemployment-that is, implement a goods and services tax, which really is a consumption tax that they like to dress up and call a goods and services tax, and which would put a lot more people on the unemployment scrap heap-during these times of economic downturn we are trying to do everything we can to cushion that blow. </PARA>
<PARA> It is all right for members of the Opposition to sit over there every time we get a piece of bad news and play on it. I guess it is their job to criticise everything that the Government does. Every time there is a bit of bad economic news, they try to make political capital out of it. I can understand that because in many respects in modern times that seems to be the role of oppositions. </PARA>
<PARA> But we as a Government are trying to do something-we are trying to make sure that the economy does improve. Certain policy measures have been taken that make it fairly clear that in the not too distant future we will be seeing a period of sustained economic recovery-not just something that will last for a couple of years before we go back to recessionary times, but something that will be sustainable. </PARA>
<PARA> We only need to look, for instance, at the way that the inflation rate is now down to a figure of 3.4 per cent, a figure that it has not been at for some 20 years. There has been a big downturn in economic activity, but it has not only been that which has caused the inflation rate to drop to 3.4 per cent; it has also been the policy settings of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition cries crocodile tears for the unemployed. Let us look at what it is prepared to do with the unemployed if it ever gets into government. The unemployed will not go away with the wave of a magic wand. The Opposition would tell us that as soon as it gets in all of a sudden everything will be hunky dory. The fact is that there will be a number of unemployed. The Government has admitted that for the next financial year unemployment could reach the level of 10.75 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> What will the Opposition do? The first thing that it will do is cut billions of dollars off the Budget. Last year, in the reply to the Budget, the Opposition Leader mentioned that the Opposition would lop a figure of $3 billion off the Budget. Where would it get $3 billion from? It would get it by cutting welfare and by taking money from those who can least afford to have it taken from them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has made it very clear that after nine months it would abolish the unemployment benefits scheme, which is now known as the Newstart allowance. It has made it very clear that all it will give is some sort of a special benefit. It has not said anything about retraining and reskilling the unemployed people; in fact, it has made it very clear that it would abolish schemes such as Skillshare. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure that you and members of the Opposition know that the present Skillshare operations throughout Australia are probably one of the best things that this Government has ever introduced. Whether it is in times of high unemployment or moderate unemployment, it is still one of the best schemes that we have ever brought in. Yet the Opposition would get rid of the Skillshare program. </PARA>
<PARA> What have we done in this Budget as a government? We have accepted that unemployment will be at a rate of 10 to 10.75 per cent over the next 12 months, but we have tried to cushion it; in fact, we have given more money to Skillshare. I was very pleased to receive a note today that the Skillshare in my own electorate of Bowman-namely, the Wynnum Skillshare and the Redland Bay Skillshare-will be getting extra funding because they are doing a great job. We will not get rid of them after nine months, as would the Opposition. In fact, not only have we recently introduced the Newstart scheme, which will try to give them adequate income support in these difficult times-apart from family allowance supplements and everything else that goes with it-but we will do everything we possibly can to put as much money into training programs. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very pleased to be speaking in this debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1), because the Budget includes a very hefty increase in training expenditure. It has risen by at least 30 per cent in the last financial year, and we are seriously doing something to try to reskill those who are unfortunate enough to be unemployed at present. We are doing something to try to enhance their abilities so that when the economic recovery occurs-and it is already starting to occur; by the end of this year, as the Prime Minister and Treasurer (Mr Kerin) say, we will see signs of it, and by next year it should be well under way-these people who were unfortunate enough to be unemployed as a result of economic circumstances will be sufficiently skilled to take up the jobs that become available. So the Opposition can cry its crocodile tears, but it has no thoughts with respect to the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, as I say, the response of honourable members to the problem of unemployment is simply that they will cut out the unemployment benefit after nine months and make people then crawl to the firms of accountants, or whoever it is who will dispense social security payments, to try to get some money to subsist. </PARA>
<PARA> I have received a note from my colleague Senator Bob McMullan who tells me that last week in the Senate the Opposition finance spokesperson, Senator Short, made a particular statement. At page 444 of the Senate Hansard dated 15 August, Senator Short, who I understand is the shadow spokesman on finance matters, said:</PARA>
<PARA>A Budget deficit next week would worsen, not help to correct our fundamental economic problem of inadequate savings. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McMullan-Sorry; are you saying there should be no Budget deficit?</PARA>
<PARA> Senator SHORT-I am saying that a Budget deficit next week would worsen our fundamental economic problem of inadequate savings. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator McMullan-Do you think there should be none?</PARA>
<PARA> Senator SHORT-In essence, yes. That is correct, and I am on the record as having said that before. Next week will be the real test of the Government. We will see whether it tries to buy short term electoral popularity or whether it is prepared to provide responsible government and the opportunity for sustainable job growth. I must say that at the moment the matter is not shaping up too well at all. </PARA>
<PARA>This statement, as Senator McMullan points out, shows the hypocrisy of the Opposition's declarations of concern for the unemployed. It is a cut of $4.7 billion in expenditure, and of course would have severe effects on economic growth and employment. I hope we do not hear too much from the Opposition when honourable members opposite talk about supposed compassion. Their compassion would be to introduce a goods and services tax, as they call it, but in fact what they mean is a consumption tax-that is, a tax on those people who can least afford to pay: on fixed income earners, on those people who need almost all of their moneys to pay for the necessities of life. </PARA>
<PARA> Only last week in Queensland I debated one of the Opposition task force members, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), on the question of the consumption tax. If there is one new initiative that the Opposition wants to impose upon this country it is the so-called goods and services, or consumption, tax. It is very obvious that, whenever a member of the Opposition gets to his feet and somehow tries to justify the introduction of such a tax, he is like a lawyer who goes to a court knowing he is defending a guilty person. He knows he does not have a proper cause, he knows he is selling a pup-and honourable members opposite know that they are conning the public of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the Opposition that when it has the decency to give us the details of the so-called goods and services tax it will be seen by all and sundry to represent nothing but an attack on those who can least afford to pay. Honourable members opposite ramble on about how they will completely abolish the wholesale sales tax. In fact, they even organised bodgie food-linked surveys, if I remember correctly, where they looked at the 25 per cent of goods which are subject to a wholesale sales tax. I say 25 per cent only because 75 per cent of goods on shelves in any supermarket are not subject to the wholesale sales tax. They get that 25 per cent of goods, put them in a little trolley, go out, get all the pictures done, and get a few of their cronies to turn up and say, `You are already paying a consumption tax'. Is it not funny that in that mix of goods in that basket there was no bread, because that is exempt, and there was no meat or milk-there were none of the basic necessities. There were no basic necessities which are exempt from wholesale sales tax included in that basket. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst honourable members opposite accuse us of scare tactics, all we are doing is trying to expose what the Opposition is trying to foist upon the Australian community. The Opposition is trying to camouflage the whole situation to somehow convince the public of Australia that this will be something that is good for them. The goods and services tax, or the consumption tax, will mean only that those who have the money will get more, and those who are on low to middle incomes-possibly as high as $50,000 according to my calculations, and I have worked it out-will not. People earning even $50,000 or $60,000 plus cannot possibly come out in front with a goods and services tax at either 15 per cent or 12 1/2 per cent. It is just impossible. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Eric Risstrom, the National Director of the Australian Taxpayers Association, has calculated that to give income tax relief sufficient to be able to make up for a 12 1/2 per cent or 15 per cent goods and services tax, taxation would have to be almost abolished for anyone earning over something like $17,000 or $18,000. Quite simply, that means that those who buy Ferraris will end up getting a big discount; those who buy the necessities of life, such as milk and meat, et cetera, will have to pay. It is shifting the whole tax burden from those in the community who earn big money to those who are on fixed incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing the Opposition keeps saying is that it will always arrange for some sort of compensatory package. How it can do that I will never know. How can it compensate a retiree who has saved maybe $40,000 or $50,000 over a lifetime of hard work? How can it compensate those people who will find, on the day the consumption tax is introduced-at whatever rate, whether 12 1/2 per cent or 15 per cent-that their savings will deflate-will evaporate-by an amount equivalent to the rate of the goods and services tax? It cannot. It does not matter what honourable members opposite say; there is no possible way those people can be compensated. </PARA>
<PARA> This Budget has many measures in it which make it clear that this Government has compassion, that this Government is not simply putting in a Budget which will pump-prime the economy so that we will endanger the possibility of sustained economic growth. We have tried to be as fair as we can under austere circumstances. The Treasurer has made it very clear we are simply not going to throw away the hard work of the last several years just to turn it around and have inflation running at bad levels and have all the things that go with priming the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> In areas of social security, for instance, a lot has been done. Up to 10,000 rural families will benefit from the increase in the thresholds for family allowance supplements. I am very proud to say that the other day I went to Port Lincoln with the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil) and spoke to a number of farmers who told me of their plight. They told me they were in very difficult circumstances, and that they really were asset rich and income poor. Under the new rules, if a family has assets above the existing FAS assets limit, namely $347,500, the family may still be eligible for FAS. If families have net assets below $600,000, income below the married benefit rate of $13,078 adjusted for the number of children and limited available funds-less than $10,000 for couples and $6,000 for singles-they may now receive $26.50 per week for each child under 13 years and $38.65 per week for each child aged 13 to 15 years. Families eligible for FAS will also receive family allowance. It is estimated that about 10,000 rural families will benefit from that, so there is some compassion for the Opposition. </PARA>

We want to make sure that by the year 2000 every worker will be on superannuation. Under the circumstances, I support this Budget.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was talking about superannuation. It is very important to look at the record of this Government on superannuation. As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security, I know just how much money we are paying out in social security payments to people for income support, such as elderly people, people who have worked hard all their lives but were unable to get themselves involved in superannuation schemes for the very reasons that I recently stated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that we do have an ageing population. We do need to make sure that in the future the postwar baby boom people have some sort of retirement funds available to them without having to come to the public purse. I am proud to say that I am a member of a government that has a policy for proper superannuation to be installed so that by the year 2000 or 2010 there will be more than sufficient moneys to look after retirement income for most of the population. </PARA>
<PARA> Today, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) replied to the Budget. I guess one of the things that any person listening to him would have thought was, `Really, he has got no response to the Budget-no response whatsoever'. The reason for that is that he talked about everything except what was in the Budget. He talked about flimsy side issues, and whether certain things were or were not happening. He talked about a Ferrari, and that he has the opportunity to own one. That is fine; I do not mind him owning a Ferrari. I guess that if a lot of us had the money we would buy a Ferrari. But that had nothing whatsoever to do with a proper response to the Budget itself. I think that shows it all.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to address the House tonight on a scandalous example of the supine attitude displayed by this Government when confronted with the appalling behaviour of overseas fishermen in our waters. Although a recent current affairs program did not report accurately, it revealed the waste of indiscriminate fishing. As well as the silence of this Government, there was deafening silence from the usually vocal greenies. They erupt into fury when the scallop fishermen of Port Phillip Bay attempt to re-establish their industry. The scallop fishermen represent enterprises which generate an income for Victoria in the vicinity of $25m annually. I understand that only $7m is received from overseas fishermen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In addition, scallop fishermen pay licence fees of over $1m to the Victorian Government. There is no doubt in my mind that the scallop fishermen of Port Phillip Bay, unlike the overseas fishermen, have a strong commitment to conducting their activities in an environmentally sensitive manner. They have a strong personal interest in ensuring that the bay is protected from environmental damage. In attempting to further contribute to the level of scientific knowledge, they have already agreed that an additional $1,000 research levy will be imposed on each of the 84 Port Phillip scallop fishing licences. The resulting $84,000 would fund research and development into improved scallop harvesting techniques, the harvesting equipment and the monitoring of the effects of scallop harvesting in the bay. </PARA>
<PARA> Why has the Victorian Kirner socialist Government been so overtly hostile to the scallop industry by attempting to ban commercial fishing in Port Phillip Bay? Despite the fact that the Kirner Government has finally, with great reluctance, permitted the local industry to resume fishing, it is obvious that it is still intent on making life very difficult for the industry. This attitude is particularly disturbing, given the economic disaster that has been inflicted on Victoria by the Cain-Kirner socialist Government and the Hawke socialist Government with its recession that we `had to have'. </PARA>
<PARA> The revival of the scallop industry means income, it means jobs, and it means exports-all contributing to the ruined Victorian economy. The 84 fishermen are small businessmen. They have invested $16m in their industry. They have debts of about $7m. Fishing this year will save 28 from bankruptcy. If only socialist governments could understand small business and its impact on the economy. The 1991 catch, we believe, will be worth $10m to the fishermen, $30m to the processors, and $24m in exports. Not only will the scallops be sold locally, but also they will be exported to the lucrative French market. </PARA>
<PARA> About 1,000 jobs are directly dependent on scallop fishing. The Kirner socialist Government has placed 1,000 jobs at risk. The Hawke socialist Government has already sold for a pittance its fishing rights to overseas interests and the jobs of Australian fishermen. This is a typical case of socialist governments ignoring Australian businesses, ignoring unemployed Australians and making Australian companies face unnecessary environmental hassles. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no scientific evidence that scallop fishing causes damage to Port Phillip Bay. In its 1982 study the marine science laboratories found no significant difference in the number of fish or species before or after scallop fishing. Recent good snapper catches are not related to there being no scallop fishing for the past three years. There were good snapper catches outside as well as inside the bay during the latter part of last year. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the claims of some greenies, there is no evidence to support the suggestion that the scallop industry is the cause of a decline in the seagrass beds of Port Phillip Bay. It has fished the bay successfully for 28 years with no evidence of damage. In their own interests, the scallop fishermen did not fish for three years. During the three years they maintained their own boats and they paid $400,000 in licence fees in the expectation that fishing would ultimately be resumed. </PARA>
<PARA> The ordeal of the scallop fishermen, like that of thousands of other small businessmen, will be seen as yet another example of government incompetence, waste, mismanagement and blatant anti-business activity. The scallop fishermen of Port Phillip Bay must prosper; small business must prosper; and Australia must prosper. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Saturday, 20 July, I had the great pleasure to participate in an event in my electorate of Moreton to celebrate Senior Citizens Week in Queensland. I convened a committee of community service organisations in the electorate which was responsible for organising a grand picnic that was held in Mott Park in Holland Park, where we had over 2,000 senior citizens from all over the southern suburbs of Brisbane.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was a glorious day. The picnic went for about four hours. During the picnic we had the great support of a wide range of different community organisations as well as a huge range of different groups which provided entertainment for us. As well as a picnic, we had a four-hour concert. </PARA>
<PARA> We were able to undertake this event with the support of a number of different community groups, including the Holland Park Lions Club, the Holland Park Meals on Wheels organisation, the Holland Park Pensioners League, the Greenslopes Senior Citizens Club and the Blue Nursing Service. We also had the support of our new local Ekibin alderman, Alderman Kerry Rea. We received donations of food and services from a range of business houses and community groups throughout the southern suburbs of Brisbane. We fed 1,500 pensioners and senior citizens and were able to entertain them for over four hours. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to place on record in this House my thanks to all the people who helped make that picnic possible, including the members of the committee, who worked tirelessly from March through to 20 July, doing all the work and planning, advertising, organising transportation for the picnic and setting up on the day. I also wish to thank the various companies and business houses that donated either cash or the goods and services that enabled the picnic to take place. </PARA>
<PARA> We are particularly appreciative of the support we received from the Brisbane City Council. The council allowed us the use of the park. It is a very large park, and a picnic with over 2,000 people puts a fair amount of pressure on the facilities. We appreciate the council's approval. It also provided us with the stage that is used for free concerts. That normally would have cost us $1,500 to hire but the council allowed us free use. It provided two buses, which we were able to put on free to pick up various citizens from around the neighbouring suburbs and bring them to the park. We had a lot of support from the Brisbane City Council, largely due to the efforts of Alderman Kerry Rea. </PARA>
<PARA> Representatives of the Holland Park Lions Club were excellent members of our committee and were very supportive. They organised a number of different workers from a range of different Lions clubs on the south side of Brisbane. They provided 25 or 30 different workers on the day for setting up various elements of the picnic. We were able to bring residents from all of the 18 nursing homes in the nearby area, using free buses provided by Clark's Buses. We were also able to bring from their homes people who were recipients of Meals on Wheels or received medical services from the Blue Nursing Service or St Luke's Nursing Service. Those organisations provided their vehicles free and picked up people who normally have very little opportunity to get out of their homes and brought them to the park for the picnic and concert. I am very appreciative of the support we received from the Blue Nursing Service and St Luke's Nursing Service. </PARA>
<PARA> The Meals on Wheels organisation, in particular Holland Park Meals on Wheels, made its kitchen available to us. We were able to prepare meals for 1,500 people in the kitchen that morning. I am also appreciative of the fact that the Holland Park Pensioners League provided 20 of its members to help us prepare all that food. </PARA>
<PARA> The four-hour concert was a great success. We had the support of the Queensland Police Service, which provided a range of different people, including the police pipe band, to entertain. We had the school orchestra from the Wellers Hill State School, the Maruka State School choir and a range of other entertainment. We also had the support of television personality Frank Warwick and radio personality Hayden Sergeant, who were warmly received by the crowd. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was interesting to listen tonight to the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca) praising the actions of his Government for increasing the levels of welfare to the new poor it has created, an admission of failure and the result of the destruction of the Australian ethic of self-reliance and pride in personal responsibility. As other nations reject socialism, it is interesting that we are being forced to embrace it. The speech by the honourable member sent me back to the office to get a letter I received from a resident of Victoria, a married lady whom I will refer to as Leanne. I would like to read this letter to the House:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Dear Mr Fisher,</PARA>
<PARA> I am writing this letter out of sheer frustration and despair. We used to be the `lucky' people. A husband in a good, secure job-the average 2 children and comfortably paying off our own home. We were privileged and were very thankful that our lives were relatively carefree; and that most of our bills were paid on time and without great levels of distress . . .</PARA>
<PARA> We were very responsible people. We paid our taxes, our children's kindergarten fees, school fees; all were paid on time; and we also had ourselves covered with all sorts of insurance so that we would burden nobody. Not a lot to spare, but we were happy to be self-reliant. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, something has gone dreadfully wrong with this scenario. A couple of years down the track-my husband works full time, I have a part-time job, and we have never had so much trouble making ends meet. </PARA>
<PARA> The school fees get paid-eventually; we are still a long way from owning our own home, and even though those insurances are still in place-they have now become a burden on us! Mr &amp;Mrs Average are a dying breed. </PARA>
<PARA> No longer do we have the old three tier socio-economic structure, `lower, middle &amp;upper'-we now progress to the `have's &amp;the have-nots'. Unfortunately, most of the former `middle class' have now slipped down to the `have-nots', but they are a hidden number. We get almost no rewards for our enterprise. We pay top dollar and beyond for all services and receive no allowances for our earnest, hard-working lives. The simple PAYE tax-payer is having the life squeezed from him. We are easily taxed on a regular basis and are bearing the brunt of most cost-cutting procedures. It is surely an unequal system. In this day and age it is a very sad occurrence when people realise that they are better off financially by being on welfare! What a terrible situation. </PARA>
<PARA> As Mr &amp;Mrs Average, we also pay out $55.80 a fortnight for the `privilege' of hospital/medical insurance! We realise that this is not compulsory, but we have always felt it one way to lessen the burden on other taxpayers and governments. On a very brief reckoning-two recent short trips to the local Hospital (necessary operations)-have cost our family in excess of $600 in fees charged over and above the scheduled fees by pathologists, doctors etc.: (because we are `lucky' enough to have private health insurance). Also I have had to purchase two hearing aids, one needed as a result of one of the operations, each one costing $945 of which we get no rebate . . .</PARA>
<PARA> If I had neglected to admit to my hospital insurance cover-after a wait, I would have had all these procedures done at the scheduled or rebated fees, at no cost to us all. How silly of me-not to bludge on the Medicare system! What price for honesty eh? It has got to the stage where people who decide to go without to pay the insurance costs are almost being punished for doing so! What a farce! We are a nation encouraging people to be dishonest! Where are the rewards for initiative and self-reliance?</PARA>
<PARA> I am not denying the many thousands of social security recipients their rights to adequate medical and dental services, but is it at our cost and the cost of others in our positions? Are we not also entitled to adequate services at a fair and just price; not only to be used only to subsidise those who upon reflection may now be better off in real terms than we are? We get no tax rebates or incentives to cover ourselves with health insurance so why do we bother? It's almost worth stopping the fortnightly payments to have that extra money for bills/housekeeping each pay. </PARA>

<PARA> Let us talk about the policy of the Liberal Party. Let us look at some of the policies. I want people in the Hunter Valley in particular to consider the Opposition's policies and imagine the effect those policies will have upon them. Firstly, we will have the abolition of the capital gains tax. That will mean that Mr Rich Guy who does a property deal and makes $500,000 pays no tax. Yet the 17-year-old shop girl who works six days a week, busting her heart to earn a few bob, earns $9,500 a year and pays tax. She will pay tax on the money she earns whereas the real estate agent will pay nothing. </PARA>
<PARA> What would members of the Liberal Party do regarding the assets test? They will ease the assets test so that bloated millionaires can walk around the main street and boast to people about how they are getting a pension. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention another little thing. I know honourable members opposite agreed to this among themselves but they do not come out publicly and say, `Oh sure, we are going to do something about the fringe benefits tax'. What will honourable members opposite do? They will make the employees pay the fringe benefits tax and remove the burden from the employers. </PARA>
<PARA> We will not talk too much about the consumption tax or the goods and services tax because from honourable members opposite there is a deafening silence about that. I would like to bring out people from Canada and from New Zealand, and I would like them to tell the Australian people about the benefits of a goods and services tax. If honourable members opposite continue with this lunacy, they will be looking for a very deep hole to crawl into because the people of Australia will not have a bar of any GST. Honourable members opposite are running scared; they should read the papers about how they are quivering in their party meeting rooms with fear of a goods and services tax, and the idiocy of their Leader and Deputy Leader, who are pursuing it. </PARA>

A million people will be deprived of $20,000 each year. Honourable members should just work that out. The Australian people will be deprived of $20 billion by this Government in one year. If it were to go on for two years, the figure would be $40 billion. Yet we have the likes of the honourable member for Hunter talking about $3 billion and this Government--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BI4">Mr MILES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. It was just incredible that the honourable member could talk about compassion, and yet this Government has thrown tens of thousands of young people onto the dole queue. These young people have worked for 10 or 12 years in their schools hoping for the opportunity to be able to go out and earn a dollar so that they can start to save to buy a car, to buy a motorbike, to go to university or to buy a home in the future. However, because this Government really lacked the foresight and the fortitude to bring about changes in this country and a framework that would allow private enterprise to flourish, thousands and thousands of families have been forced into poverty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This week's Budget will have as sad an effect on the Australian people as the events we saw in the Soviet Union because there is no hope and no vision. It was just a flat and uninspiring document that almost said, `We have given up; there is no hope for Australia'. I am sure that last Monday many people in the Soviet Union felt that the clock had been turned back 50 years, and they were deeply concerned and very sad about those events. </PARA>
<PARA> I only wish that events in this country could turn around in three days and there would be some hope. It is now just about three days since we had the Budget. Not only is there no hope; there is even less hope than there was. In my electorate 52 per cent of young people are unemployed. People may ask: why is that the case? The reason is that my area is very much a private enterprise region of Australia. It is highly productive and oriented to export income; it is involved in both rural and manufacturing industries; it has great diversity. Yet that area of Australia, like many other regional areas which produce a lot of our export income, has people who are being thrown onto the scrap heap because of the framework put in place by this Government, which has absolutely knocked the stuffing out of all those business people who would like to invest and would create a climate in which jobs would flourish. </PARA>
<PARA> However, this Government has set about the task of trying to look after the welfare people and the Government bureaucracy, and has not been concerned about the future health of this country. We have a huge overseas debt and high interest rates. The situation now is that business has lost confidence in investment and until we get that confidence back we will not see young people off the dole queues. Of course we will not get that confidence back until we have leadership shown as we saw it shown here today by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). The people in the galleries of this place responded spontaneously with enthusiasm to the visionary picture he painted for Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to raise a matter relating to the activities of the New South Wales Greiner-Murray Government and in the process give the lie to the notion that honourable members on the other side of politics have some understanding of better economic management; that is, the sort of Ferrari led recovery that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) spoke about this afternoon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It relates to an issue in western Sydney, the F4 Tollway, which has been an ongoing issue that I have spoken of before in this House. The New South Wales Government is seeking to place a toll on a section of federally funded road constructed and completed in 1988. It was constructed by the taxpayers of Australia for the tune of almost $40m. </PARA>
<PARA> This was an issue in the last State election and interestingly the Liberal Party lost the State seat of Parramatta over it. Far from being prepared to admit its error in this policy, the Greiner-Murray Government has decided to proceed on come what may with its deliberately confrontationist approach to this particular issue. In fact it is going one step further than just putting in this tollway in a section of western Sydney. Approval for these sorts of roads will no longer require the same planning conditions, particularly those relating to environmental protection and environmental impact studies, as applied in the past. The Government can not only ignore the wishes of the motorists of western Sydney; it can also avoid the need for proper consideration of environmental safeguards that this issue should rightly have focused upon. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr Crean</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) The $8.70 per kilogram clean minimum market indicator reserve price was effective from 1 July 1988. Sheep numbers had been increasing prior to that date and continued to increase after that date:</PARA>
<PARA>  Year  Sheep Numbers</PARA>
<PARA>  (31 March)  in Australia</PARA>

<PARA>  1988  156.6</PARA>
<PARA>  1989  164.9</PARA>
<PARA>  1990  173.5</PARA>
<PARA>  Virtually all wool was sold until April 1989. The AWC purchase rate at auction then increased to 19 per cent at the end of June, and 59 per cent at the end of December 1989.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) The minimum market indicator reserve price of $8.70 per kilogram clean was a weighted average across the different wool types. Some types of wool had a reserve price below $8.70 and some above, depending on type. The Australian Wool Corporation was required under the reserve price scheme provisions of the Wool Marketing Act 1987 to be prepared to purchase wool offered for sale at auction which did not receive a bid equal to or above the relevant reserve price for that type of wool.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) In the absence of specific actions to impose quotas, the level of production is a matter for individual growers. Spokespersons for the Australian Wool Corporation did suggest on a number of occasions that production was reaching too high a level.</PARA>
<PARA>  (4) The level of wool production is determined by on-farm management decisions in advance regarding matters such as expected prices of wool (including the reserve price), expected profitability of alternative farm enterprises, expected costs of farm inputs and forecasts of climatic conditions. The floor price of $8.70 per kilogram clean could have had some impact on production in the July 1988--June 1990 period during which $8.70 was the reserve price. However, a substantial effect on the Corporation's stockpile was also brought about by a reduced demand for wool. The AWC's financial position deteriorated more quickly at $8.70 than it would have at a lower price, and this led to doubts in the market place about the sustainability of the reserve price. As a result buyers were more reluctant to purchase wool, particularly in early 1990.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0H4">Mr Griffiths</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) The Australian representatives to the Nineteenth Session of the Joint FAO/WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission (CAC) to be held in Rome during 1-10 July 1991 will be Mr Digby Gascoine, Director, Food Inspection and Support Services, Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, and Dr Graham Maynard, Director Food Policy Section, Department of Community Services and Health.</PARA>
<PARA>  Australian representatives also attend meetings of some fifteen subsidiary committees of the Codex Alimentarius Commission. These representatives usually have technical expertise in the subject-matter of the individual committees. For example, the Australian delegation to the last meeting of the Codex Committee on Pesticide Residues in April 1991 comprised Mr G Hooper, Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Unit, Department of Primary Industries and Energy and Mr D Hamilton, Queensland Department of Primary Industries. Mr A Morley, Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Association of Australia, and Dr J Webley, Australian Wheat Board, accompanied the delegation as industry advisors.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) (a) As the national contact point for the CAC, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service encourages representatives of other interested government agencies, industry and consumer organisations to join Australian delegations to Codex meetings. All delegation members are bound by the Australian Government brief for the meetings.</PARA>
<PARA>  (b) Official Government representatives to Codex meetings have no corporate links. The industry and consumer advisers would, of course, be linked to the corporate bodies they represent.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) National maximum residue limits (MRLs) are established following the evaluation of Australian residue trials and with regard to the manner in which the chemical is to be used. As chemical use conditions vary from country to country as a result of different environmental conditions, pest and disease pressures and plant and animal production methods, MRLs may also vary between countries. It is therefore possible that in determining an internationally agreed MRL, the Codex Alimentarius Commission may establish limits that are sometimes less stringent than the levels prescribed in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>  Codex MRLs are always established at levels low enough to ensure the protection of human health. They are established at levels as low as good agricultural practice allows. For the latter reason, MRLs are set below the maximum level which consumer safety considerations alone would permit.</PARA>
<PARA>  The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) is responsible for establishing MRLs in Australia and the recommendations of the Codex Alimentarius Commission are taken into account wherever possible.</PARA>
<PARA>  The NHMRC Food Standards Code lists some 2400 MRLs for agricultural and veterinary chemicals in foods. The Codex Alimentarius Commission has established a similar number of MRLs but many of these are for different commodity/pesticide combinations. A small number of the Codex MRLs are less stringent than those prescribed in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>  No comprehensive comparative list is presently available but an Imported Foods Inspection Working Group convened by the Australian Consumers' Association has identified around 70 Codex MRLs which are less stringent than those established by the NHMRC.</PARA>
<PARA>  (4) As part of the negotiations on agricultural protection within the GATT Uruguay Round an agreement is being developed to prevent the misuse of sanitary and phytosanitary measures as arbitrary, disguised or unjustified barriers to trade. Some environmental and consumer protection regulations fall within the category of sanitary and phytosanitary measures as defined in the draft agreement. The agreement, if adopted, will foster the harmonisation of national measures on the basis of international standards, guidelines and recommendations--such as those promulgated by the Codex Alimentarius Commission--by determining that national measures in conformity with international standards cannot be challenged under GATT procedures as unjustified barriers to trade. However GATT contracting parties would not be obliged to conform necessarily with the relevant international standards. A contracting party could adopt a measure more stringent than the international standard provided it could demonstrate, if challenged, that its measure is based on sound science, risk assessment and consistent risk management.</PARA>
<PARA>  Australia has played a leading role in the development of the draft agreement on sanitary and phytosanitary measures since Australia's current practices already conform with its requirements, and adoption of the agreement would open the way for Australia to challenge under GATT conditions imposed by other countries which impede Australia's export trade.</PARA>
<PARA>  (5) Codex Alimentarius Commission standards are specifically referred to in the draft agreement as applicable standards in respect of food safety and health matters. Animal health standards promulgated by the International Office of Epizootics (OIE) and plant health standards under the International Plant Protection Convention (IPPC) are also explicitly included. Relevant standards promulgated by other international standard setting organisations whose membership is open to all GATT contracting parties would have equivalent status.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HG4">Mr Free</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) There is realistic scope for commercial interactions in current and projected research programs at AIMS; for example:</PARA>
<PARA>    Living Coastal resources (commercial tourism as well as sustainable recreational and sports fisheries, and selected food products);</PARA>
<PARA>    Health care industries--(potential anti-cancer, anti-viral, anti-malaria agents, other pharmaceutical products, UV-blockers for skin protection, anti-oxidants for food protection)</PARA>
<PARA>    Coral density and fluorescence data as indicators of past climatic conditions, and as a basis for predicting climate change.  These are relevant to planning agencies as well as agriculture and industry.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) AIMS is actively looking for partners in research and the applications of the results of their research.</PARA>
<PARA>  AIMS has attempted to interest some Australian industries in collaborative research for long term benefit.  However, Australian companies seem reluctant to invest in such marine research.</PARA>
<PARA>  Much of AIMS's research is relevant to information required by Local, State, and Federal Governments in developing food management practices for their coastal and near shore marine regions of responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) Yes, AIMS does design research projects with commercial partners, e.g., in mariculture and in the study of effluents from mining operations.  The National Cancer Institute (USA) contract, currently in its fifth year, was competed for internationally.  Research aspects were negotiated with the contractor, the National Cancer Institute.  AIMS is competing for the next five year contract.</PARA>
<PARA>  AIMS has also developed proposals with other companies, investing considerable effort but failing to win the contract.</PARA>
<PARA>  (4) The following current AIMS projects have commercial partners:</PARA>
<PARA>  UV blockers (sunscreens) with ICI Australia</PARA>
<PARA>  Prawn mariculture--two Australian commercial partners</PARA>
<PARA>  Metal and nutrient levels in the waters of the Gulf of Papua and Torres Strait (Mining Company).</PARA>
<PARA>  Other projects which have potential commercial application include effectively all the projects listed in the answer to Question 1.</PARA>
<PARA>  (5) Commercial value of research is difficult to estimate.  An anti-cancer, anti-AIDS, or anti- malarial drug would return millions of dollars per annum to the commercial company marketing and developing the substance.</PARA>
<PARA>  Obviously if intellectual property rights for such products were retained by Australian companies the benefits to Australia would be considerable. Attracting commercial partners for these ventures has involved substantial effort.</PARA>
<PARA>  The combination of ecological and economic value is evident in other areas of marine research;</PARA>
<PARA>for example,</PARA>
<PARA>  the understanding of coral reefs, mangroves and sea grass beds, tourist, recreational and sport fishing industries, and coastal zone management issues including siltation and nutrient input.</PARA>
<PARA>  AIMS has actively sought to stimulate Australian owned companies to invest in Australian Marine research.</PARA>
<PARA>  (6) AIMS has targeted major international pharmaceutical companies, computing and data management companies, and food companies for long term support; principally because AIMS has not found Australian based industries willing to be involved in long term marine research.</PARA>

<PARA>  (1) (a) and (b) I am advised that the Victorian Government had given no instruction to Vic Roads to withhold Federal road funds for local government in 1990-91 until July 1991. State funding to local governments for roads and the procedure by which such State funds are paid is a matter between the Victorian Government and local governments.</PARA>

<PARA>      Consultancies--$14,923</PARA>
<PARA>      Sale of animals, cultures etc--$8,199</PARA>
<PARA>  The appropriation comes from Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) Trust Account, which is in turn funded by an appropriation from consolidated revenue of the Government plus general fees and charges levied against industry, including the pharmaceutical industry. For 1990-91, industry fees and charges will make a very minor contribution to the TGA Trust Account.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr Hawke</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) I have received correspondence addressed to all Members of the Parliament of Australia from Mr Dominic V. Crain of Bacchus Marsh, Victoria, dated 28 April and 16 May 1991.  At my request, the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator the Hon Peter Cook, has replied on behalf of the Government.</PARA>
<PARA>  However, correspondence between an individual and a Minister is normally of a confidential nature and it would not, therefore, be appropriate to make this reply publicly available.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) Mr Crain has made insufficient information available to the Government regarding his personal situation, or the circumstances surrounding the termination of his employment with Ansett to enable confirmation of whether Mr Crain was sacked and sued by Ansett or whether he has been unemployed since. However, I have no reason to doubt Mr Crain's claims.</PARA>
<PARA>  In any event, I do not consider it appropriate for the Government to act as an intermediary in any dispute which may exist between Mr Crain and his former employer.</PARA>
<PARA>  I can advise, however, that the Government has asked the airlines not to pursue their claims against the Australian Federation of Airline Pilots and individual pilots, such as Mr Crain, in the interest of a return to normalcy of industrial relations in the airline industry.  The Government is confident that the airline companies involved will respect the Government's views on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) The simple answer is "yes".  The Government has not wavered in encouraging workers and employers to settle their differences through constructive negotiations or through an appropriate industrial tribunal, without recourse to industrial action.  The Government's commitment to securing a fairer and more rational system of industrial relations remains unchanged. This includes ensuring respect for the rights of all parties within a balanced system of conciliation and arbitration.</PARA>
<PARA>  The current situation concerning waterside workers is entirely different from that in the airline pilots' dispute.  The Government's participation in waterfront negotiations was to ensure the continuation of the reform process. The waterfront agreement, which resulted from round-table negotiations, has the endorsement of the waterfront unions, the employers, the Government and the ACTU.  The wage increases sought under the agreement are consistent with the need for wage restraint and are offset many times over by productivity improvements through workplace reform.  This is in sharp contrast with the Australian Federation of Air Pilots' refusal to negotiate for anything less than a 29.47% wage increase.  Its actions were not supported by the employers, the Government, the ACTU nor other airline unions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I understand that the Queensland Government is assessing a proposal for a toxic waste dump at Miles. The proposal does not involve any decisions by the Commonwealth; however I fully support the Queensland initiative to ensure that hazardous wastes are disposed of properly.</PARA>
<PARA>  A secure landfill properly designed and operated as is proposed would pose a negligible risk to the Great Artesian Basin and the inland rivers system. There is greater risk to surface and groundwater generally if no controlled facility for these wastes were to be built. I understand that it would be unwise to rely on clay of any type as a sole containment medium, however I am informed that at the dump proposed for Miles this has been recognised and that other measures are being considered.</PARA>
<PARA>  I am informed that final decisions on important elements of the proposal have yet to be decided. Accordingly it is not possible to make comparisons with overseas facilities.</PARA>
<PARA>  I have however written to the responsible Queensland Minister to emphasise the importance of the Queensland environment assessment process taking into account the full range of potential environmental impacts including those associated with the management of groundwater.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5H4">Mr Hand</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) I announced a review of the BMP on 30 April 1991 and key elements of the Government's decision on that review on 25 July 1991.  The planning level for business migration was announced at 5000 places.  This figure largely reflects a downturn in applications.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) A 32 page brochure, "Australia Welcomes Business People", was first released in December 1988 to provide information to successful business people overseas who were potential applicants for migration to Australia and to encourage them to apply.</PARA>
<PARA>  Because of depletion of stocks, continuing strong demand and the need to update information, a decision was taken in 1990 to prepare a second edition. This edition was printed in March 1991.</PARA>
<PARA>  (a) The brochure was timely in providing a quality document to include in the information package given to serious enquirers for business migration.</PARA>
<PARA>  (b) See (2) and (a) above for the reasons for the release of the publication and subsequent distribution of the second edition.</PARA>
<PARA>  (c) Total cost for development, research, design, and printing of the second edition was $79,553 (about $3 per copy).</PARA>
<PARA>  (d) Initial distribution of the 2nd edition brochure to overseas posts was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>    London, Hong Kong, Kuala Lumpur, Manchester, Bonn, Seoul:  500</PARA>
<PARA>    Vancouver, Singapore, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Jakarta, Athens:  300</PARA>
<PARA>    Toronto, Manila, Tokyo, Osaka, Paris, Damascus, New Delhi, Chicago:  200</PARA>
<PARA>    Rome, Berne, Bangkok, Nairobi, Suva, New York, Edinburgh:  100</PARA>
<PARA>    Argentina, Santiago,Vienna, Mexico City, Stockholm, Auckland, Dublin, Cairo:  50</PARA>
<PARA>    Islamabad, Beijing:  20</PARA>
<PARA>  A further 5,000 were provided to Austrade for distribution through its overseas offices, as part of the Investment Promotion Program information kit, to replenish stocks of the earlier version.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) The brochure is provided free of charge to prospective business migrants.  The brochures are available for sale to agents and other organisations at $5 a copy.  Anticipated cost recovery would amount to less than 8% of total production costs;  the sale price is largely a mechanism to limit the level of demand to realistic levels from commercial organisations servicing prospective business migrants.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G4">Mr Duffy</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I am advised by the Australian Federal Police as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>  (1) Two Warrants in the First Instance exist for the arrest of Mr Moll, one for sending $300,000 in Australian Currency out of Australia without the authority of the Reserve Bank and the other for conspiring to defraud the Commonwealth. (a) The warrants were issued on 15 March 1984, (b) the warrants were issued by a Stipendiary Magistrate in Perth upon receiving sworn complaints; (c) the warrants have not been withdrawn and Mr Moll will be arrested on his return to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) Mr Moll wrote to the former Attorney- General offering to return to Australia and assist law enforcement authorities with their investigations into matters relating to a particular company, in return for various concessions, including complete immunity from criminal and civil prosecution.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Attorney-General replied that the question of immunity could not be considered at that stage as Mr Moll had not provided proof of any evidence he might be able to give. I am advised that Mr Moll does not appear to have pursued the matter further.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) (a) It is alleged that Mr Moll left Australia when he became aware of the investigation commenced by the Australian Taxation Office. I am not aware of any Victoria Police clearance issued to Mr Moll, but this question should properly be addressed to the Attorney-General in Victoria. When Mr Moll left Australia in 1979 he was resident of Western Australia and he departed from that state; (b) I am not aware of any charges against Mr Moll since his departure from Australia and (c) I am not aware of any limitations applying to the charges against Mr Moll.</PARA>
<PARA>  (4) The AFP is unable to say whether Mr Moll lost a job in the Netherlands as a result of a letter originating from its Perth office in 1990. (a) The Officer in Charge of the Western Regional Office has the authority to reply to correspondence sent to that regional office. (b) An Australian firm of solicitors, Parker and Parker, wrote on behalf of a firm in the Netherlands. The solicitors were advised of the warrants still outstanding on Mr Moll and were only given the basic contents of each warrant. (c) The letter replying to Parker and Parker was issued by the Officer in Charge of the AFP's Western Regional Office. (d) The letter was issued to reply to the letter received from Parker and Parker.</PARA>
<PARA>  (5) The case against Mr Moll remains open. (a) The case remains open because he left Australia in 1979 and the two Warrants in the First Instance were not issued until 1984. (b)(i) No summons could be issued because Mr Moll had left for overseas; accordingly Warrants in the First Instance were issued. (ii) Until 1 February 1988 extradition from the Netherlands could only be granted for offences listed in the 1889 treaty between the Netherlands and Great Britain (which extended to Australia). Article II of that treaty does not contain an offence directly akin to the one Mr Moll is accused of having committed.</PARA>
<PARA>  (6) There is no impediment to Mr Moll's return to Australia, but upon his return he will be arrested on charges relating to revenue offences against the Federal Government.</PARA>
<PARA>  (7) Mr Moll's solicitors, Molomby and Molomby of Melbourne, are aware of his circumstances and of the existence of the warrants. Accordingly further advice to Mr Moll is unnecessary.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from Telecom, is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (a) The Government's package of reforms of the telecommunications industry is designed to ensure that Telecom/OTC has the incentive to perform efficiently, while ensuring that consumers share the benefits of improved productivity.</PARA>
<PARA>  Telecom will not be privatised, but will become a wholly-owned Government company, and will be merged with OTC once the details of the capital structure and interconnection arrangements are finalised.  A second telecommunications carrier, based on a privatised AUSSAT, will commence operations in 1992.</PARA>
<PARA>  Telecom has continued to review its management structure and operational methods to ensure that it is most appropriately placed to face competition. Restructuring of Telecom's workforce will result from this process, although the precise impact will depend upon how the industry restructures.  Employment opportunities will be created with the second telecommunications carrier.</PARA>
<PARA>  (b) A number of measures have been introduced in the new arrangements to safeguard the interests of consumers, including rural and remote residents, and to support the Government's commitment that no consumers will be disadvantaged by the reform of this industry.</PARA>
<PARA>  Existing price controls, which limit increases in Telecom's charges to 4% below the rate of inflation will be strengthened to 5.5% below the consumer price index.  In addition, community service obligations will be maintained, particularly to rural and remote areas, as well as to pensioners and people with disabilities.  Telecom/OTC will have a universal service obligation, as a condition of its licence, to provide the standard telephone service and payphones to all Australians, wherever they reside or carry on business.</PARA>
<PARA>  The second carrier, once established, will be required to contribute to the costs of fulfilling this obligation through a universal service levy, based on a pro-rata share of interconnected traffic.  It will be AUSTEL's responsibility to ensure that Telecom/OTC fulfils its universal service obligation and to administer the universal service levy.  AUSTEL will also be responsible for ensuring that quality of service standards are maintained.</PARA>
<PARA>  Through these means, the Government has guaranteed that all Australians, including those in rural and remote areas, will enjoy the benefits to flow from the introduction of competition into the telecommunications industry.</PARA>
