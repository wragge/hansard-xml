<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Social Security Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1991 will implement the major part of the Budget announcements in the social security area. The most significant changes are a proposed assets test on the family allowance, changes to the existing family allowance supplement assets test, and a new hardship provision on the family allowance supplement. I shall address all of these matters later in more detail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Bill introduces new child bereavement payments, with the start-up date backdated to 17 August this year. This initiative is a result of promises made after the family of a child killed in the Strathfield shootings received a letter from the Department of Social Security two weeks after the child's death advising the parents that they were no longer entitled to receive the family allowance for that child. A parent or guardian whose child dies and who was receiving family allowance, child disability allowance or a double orphan pension for that child will continue to receive payment for four weeks after the child's death. </PARA>
<PARA>  The principal Act also embodies this principle, but in a limited form. For instance, these limitations meant that the family of the child killed at Strathfield had its family allowance entitlement stopped immediately because there were no other children in respect of whom family allowance was already being paid. The coalition gives its support to this initiative. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill establishes an education entry payment of $200 for sole parent pensioners as from 1 January 1992 to encourage them to undertake study. To receive the payment, the sole parent pensioner must have enrolled in a course of study and be eligible to receive the Austudy education supplement--a payment made to some pensioners and beneficiaries who, because of the Austudy income test, are ineligible for Austudy. No more than one education entry payment will be made in each calendar year. This payment will assist in alleviating the poverty traps faced by sole parent pensioners when they take steps to get themselves off the pension. The payment will make the transition to education easier and act as a reward for doing so. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill's explanatory memorandum states that payment of the EEP will be made in respect of either full or part time study. However, the pensioner must also be eligible to receive the Austudy education supplement paid by the Department of Employment, Education and Training, but this is paid only to full time students, suggesting that sole parent pensioners choosing to study part time will be ineligible for the EEP after all. Nevertheless, we support the proposal and trust that the Government will correct what looks like an obvious error. </PARA>
<PARA>  Also introduced in the Bill is a reduction in rent assistance waiting periods. Under this amendment, the rent assistance waiting period for recipients of Job Search allowance, Newstart allowance, sickness allowance or special benefit who have no children and are aged between 18 and 60 years, and for disability support pensioners aged between 18 and 20 years, will be reduced from 26 weeks to 18 weeks. For beneficiaries with children there is no waiting period. It is proposed that this measure will commence on 20 March 1992. </PARA>
<PARA>  The amount of rent assistance paid depends on the person's income, the rent paid and the number of dependent children, if any. We see this initiative as nothing more than a backdoor increase in benefit rates for persons without children, which seems unnecessary, given that rent assistance is already tax-free and indexed and that property prices and rentals are currently in a depressed state. The coalition will not be supporting this particular proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>  We welcome the proposals to increase the child disability allowance and to pay this increase to recipients of the new youth disability supplement. The Social Security (Disability and Sickness Support) Amendment Bill, due to come into effect next month, linked payments for 16- to 20-year-olds with disabilities to the common youth allowance, but added a new youth disability supplement. Although we are still very concerned about the overall drop in payments for this group, we believe the introduction of a youth disability supplement to be very important as, for the first time, it recognises the additional cost of disability faced by young people and their families. We now urge the Government to go further, to honour the commitment given when this Bill was discussed by a Senate legislative and general purpose standing committee, and to pursue a carefully constructed disability allowance which recognises the extra cost of disability faced by all people with disabilities and their carers. </PARA>
<PARA>   Whilst on the subject of disability, I should like to comment on some of the remarks made last Thursday in this House by the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) during the debate on a motion relating to disability services that I had laid before the House. I prefaced my remarks in that debate by saying that the motion did not seek to condemn the Government, nor did it seek confrontation. I also said that the Coalition would like to work with the Government in a bipartisan manner on setting the objectives for the future on disability services. </PARA>
<PARA>  Unfortunately, the honourable member for Forde obviously was not so disposed, and perhaps that was her brief from the Department. If that were the case, she was badly briefed. The honourable member for Forde labelled the Endeavour Foundation of Queensland as `a monster private provider', with `megalithic structures' that has failed to move down the same path as the rest of the community for the past 40 years and has `an enormous amount of money power and control over people's lives'. My own personal involvement in Endeavour allows me to say categorically that her comments about the Endeavour Foundation are absolutely wrong. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Executive Director of Endeavour, Mr Tom Barry, says that the claims of the honourable member for Forde were untrue, outrageous and worked contrary to the best interest of people with intellectual handicaps in Queensland. He stated that `her whole speech was crass political grandstanding in the worst taste'. He also asked whether the Federal Government had a clear plan in mind for its Disability Services Act. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps it wants to dismantle all community based care providers in Australia and push all people with an intellectual disability into the mainstream community and workforce. </PARA>
<PARA>If so, their idea fails to take into account the individual nature of the intellectual handicap and blatantly refuses to recognise the undisputable fact that there are a large number of people with an intellectual handicap for whom full time mainstream or open employment is both a physical and intellectual impossibility. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Barry commented further:</PARA>
<PARA>Endeavour is not a monolithic private structure, it's a community based care organisation, founded by and directed by the parents and friends of people with intellectual handicaps and largely run by individual Queenslanders who give their time and effort free of charge. </PARA>
<PARA>Endeavour receives from the Government less than 25 per cent of the $40m of its Budget it needs each year. So, in fact, the attack by the honourable member for Forde on the Foundation amounts to an attack on the integrity and dedication of literally hundreds of thousands of Queenslanders over four decades and the denigration of an organisation that has provided an outstanding service without being a burden on the financial resources of any government. </PARA>
<PARA>   I want to give my experience with the Endeavour Foundation. I have been a member for 30 years. I am presently a Vice-Patron of the Mackay organisation. I can reflect on the earliest endeavours of Endeavour in Mackay and the changes that have been brought about under Endeavour. These changes were not insisted upon by the DSA and in fact were well before the Disability Services Act was introduced. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think Mackay is typical. Having started in a pioneering fashion those 30 years ago, it now provides most of those services mentioned by Mr Barry with a limited input from the government of the day. Mackay is fairly typical of most of the Endeavour Foundation groups around Queensland. It started a school activity centre which has now been taken over by the State government; it has provided accommodation in a larger style--12 persons per unit; it has been buying, building and providing units of a lesser number, about five accommodation units, and it is doing that with its own funds without any help from the Commonwealth whatsoever; it has a sheltered workshop, a farming activity and an activity centre, and it also has a shopping arrangement where bits and pieces can be brought in and farmed out within the community. I have inspected those facilities; I have gone to the games which are encouraged by Endeavour throughout north Queensland; and I have attended its Christmas party. </PARA>
<PARA>  I raise this matter as one of great concern. Many Queensland Federal members on both sides of the House are proud to be members of the Endeavour Foundation. The disgraceful comments made by the honourable member for Forde do not represent my views about Endeavour, those of my coalition colleagues--the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) is in the chamber, and I am sure he would agree with me--or the views of other Government members in this chamber. The honourable member for Forde, in her speech, also referred to the service provider, Keystone, as proof that the philosophy and practice of the Disability Services Act was the ideal for the future. </PARA>
<PARA>  Yet in a letter dated 7 October 1991 to the Courier-Mail and to some of my colleagues, the Keystone Executive Director, Mr Lyall Cowell, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>No doubt you have become aware of Australia's national scandal, the heartless disregard for the intellectually disabled. Parents of the intellectually disabled are devastated at the policies developed by the Commonwealth Government and instituted by its department which sees the intellectually disabled literally thrown out into the street. Keystone along with similar organisations believe such policies to be based on unworkable theories. Indeed, Keystone views such policies as social engineering on a grand scale. </PARA>
<PARA>Comments by the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services that all intellectually disabled people can be successfully integrated into either the workplace or TAFE training schemes is incorrect. In reality, only 10 per cent of the intellectually disabled people can achieve such a status. The honourable member for Forde, in whose electorate I believe this particular establishment is, did not even know the attitude of her own organisation--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Jull" NAMEID="MH4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-He is. He has written to me and I have agreed to go and visit his workshop whenever I can get to Brisbane. I suggest that the honourable member for Forde should also visit his workshop. It is time that departmental bureaucrats opened their eyes to the reality instead of basing their policies on unworkable theories. I was appalled and saddened by the speech of the honourable member for Forde. As I have said on many occasions, there is no room in politics for matters concerning people with disabilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I say once again that the Disability Services Act has opened up new options for people with disabilities, which the Opposition applauds and approves. However, we believe that there is still a need for services such as sheltered workshops, hostels, nursing homes and activity therapy centres to be able to co-exist along with the new services. The Government must recognise the facts and provide support for care providers who have quality services in place for those individuals who cannot be fully integrated into the community. In Mr Barry's words, the Government should be working on realistic solutions to the problems faced by people with intellectual handicaps, such as the lack of community understanding and the acceptance of disability in all its forms. </PARA>
<PARA>  I return to the Bill before us and to the proposed changes in Job Search and Newstart allowance. Job Search and Newstart allowance will not be paid to a person who is receiving income from a group or community which, in turn, derives that income from funds provided by a Commonwealth funded employment program. Similarly, a Job Search or Newstart allowance recipient will no longer be able to claim an additional amount in respect of his or her partner if the partner is receiving income from funds provided by a Commonwealth funded employment program. A Commonwealth funded program is to be defined as one where the funding is based either wholly or partly on the number of JSA and NSA recipients who are or will be participating in the program. In the past, the participation in some training programs which provide payment has allowed some JSA and NSA claimants to effectively double dip into the welfare system. Obviously, this must be prevented, and we support this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill further proposes that new part rate family allowance supplement recipients will no longer receive health care cards. Currently, all FAS recipients receive a health care card which allows access to concessions on pharmaceuticals and to State transport concessions. This proposal will restrict health care card eligibility to full rate FAS recipients, although existing part rate FAS recipients will be allowed to retain their cards for as long as they continue to receive FAS. It will necessitate an amendment to the Health Insurance Act 1973. </PARA>
<PARA>  The amendment will allow for better targeting of the pharmaceutical concessions scheme and will also head off further increases in the cost of this scheme which would otherwise result from the liberalising of the family allowance supplement income test and the subsequent rise in the number of part time FAS recipients. The coalition also supports this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I said at the beginning of my speech, the major initiatives in this Bill relate to the family allowance and family allowance assets test changes, and the introduction of hardship provisions. Family allowance is an income tested payment paid fortnightly to the principal carer of children. It is a payment that recognises the costs of raising children. In 98 per cent of cases the principal carer is the mother, but in the other 2 per cent of cases it is paid to fathers, guardians and even State and Territory juvenile detention centres.</PARA>
<PARA>  In conjunction with the family allowance supplement, it aims to maintain the real value of family payments through indexation, as well as keeping it relative to other social security payments. Family allowance cuts out when family income reaches $62,057 in respect of one child, this threshold rising by $3,104 for each additional child. For families with one to three children, family allowance is paid at the rate of $10 per week and slightly more in respect of subsequent children. Family allowance supplement is paid as an add-on to family allowance to low income, working families. Its purpose is to eliminate poverty traps, that is, to ensure that families do not find themselves financially better off dependent on social security than at work. The rate of family allowance supplement paid depends on the number of dependent children and whether they are aged under 13 years or between 13 and 15; for example, a family earning less than $18,000 a year with a single child aged under 13 receives the maximum FAS rate of $26.50 per week. </PARA>
<PARA>  The 1990-91 Budget contained a proposal to impose an assets test on the family allowance of $300,000. This figure was subsequently raised to $500,000 in the hope of ensuring the proposal's acceptance, but it was to no avail as it was not ultimately passed by the Senate. This proposal would impose a family, as opposed to a parental, assets test limit of $600,000 on the family allowance, above which no family allowance will be payable except in circumstances of hardship and for a limited period, as I will spell out further on. Excluded from the definition of assets are the family home and curtilage and debt. </PARA>
<PARA>  Primary producers will be allowed to transfer debt associated with one income producing asset to another to reduce total net assets. The $600,000 figure will be indexed from 1 January 1993. What we have to ask is: what is the value of a property in connection with this new test? Recently at a banking inquiry at Charleville we heard from many people on the land that the value of their property is being greatly reduced as security by the banks. It must be an understanding that the proper and appropriate value should apply to the property under this particular test. Within my own electorate I know that the cane farms are selling at about half the price they were about 12 months ago. The farmers are also suffering from that reduction of security valuations by the banks. So we ask: how will assessments be made?</PARA>
<PARA>  The existing FAS assets test, which stands at $347,500, will be converted from a parental to a family assets test in order to catch those who have avoided the test by rearranging ownership of assets among family members. A special financial hardship test will apply for two years. Those families with incomes which in current dollar values are below $13,078 plus $624 for each dependent child, and who have liquid assets of less than $6,000 for a single person or $10,000 for a couple, will be eligible for family allowance even where their net assets exceed $500,000, and for family allowance supplement in addition where net assets are between $347,500 and $600,000. </PARA>
<PARA>  The family allowance is the only major family payment which is not assets tested, although it was means tested some years ago. This has been an anomalous situation and quite against the trend of tightening assistance to those genuinely in need. We have previously had reservations about the impact of assets tests on those in rural areas, including small businesses, who are relatively asset rich but income poor, especially in tough times, and these have been addressed by the hardship provisions in the Bill. Also, assets tests have been in place for a number of years in respect of a wide range of transfer payments, including the family allowance supplement and unemployment benefits--now the Job Search and Newstart allowances. However, we are concerned that this measure has taken so long to materialise since the first mention of a liquid assets test. The current Treasurer (Mr Kerin) excused himself, his Department and the Government for this delay by saying that the difficulty had been in defining a liquid asset. The Bill defines liquid assets in relation to a person as:</PARA>
<PARA>(a)  the person's cash; and</PARA>
<PARA>(b)  the person's shares and debentures in a public company within the meaning of the Corporations Law; and</PARA>
<PARA>(c)  any amount deposited with, or lent to, a bank, building society, credit union or other financial institution by the person (whether or not the amount can be withdrawn or repaid immediately); and</PARA>
<PARA>(d)  any amount due, and able to be paid, to the person by, or on behalf of, a former employer of the person; and</PARA>
<PARA>(e)  any other readily realisable assets of the person. </PARA>
<PARA>Concerns have been expressed, by both small family businesses and farmers, as to whether working capital--carry-on business funds--will be excluded from the liquid assets test. It has been assumed that because of their non-inclusion in the definition such funds will be excluded. I would hope that the Government can give that assurance in the closing summary of this debate. </PARA>
<PARA>  For instance, a farmer may receive $20,000 for the sale of wheat and have the money temporarily available in a bank account or as a credit in a statutory marketing authority but require the funds to pay for fertiliser, seed, rates et cetera. We believe that those funds should be excluded from a liquid assets test. Similarly, a small business person banks his takings for the month and temporarily has a credit in a business account but earmarks that amount for creditors and wages. These amounts should also be excluded. </PARA>
<PARA>  We ask: to what extent will business transactions of a partnership or a corporation be divorced from the day to day private requirements of the partners or the shareholders in making the assessment? It is critical that we get answers to these particular problems now because this is central to the hardship provisions and the need to extend this latitude to those particular people, the small businessmen and the farmers who are suffering at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA>  The family allowance was an initiative of the Fraser Government in 1976 when the original child endowment and the taxation rebate for children were brought together into one allowance. Both initiatives were family policies recognising the additional costs and responsibilities of the parent in raising children. The child endowment was a cash transfer--non-income tested--and the rebate was available to the head of the household by way of the reduced tax liability. The family allowance initiative was by far the best family orientated package brought before this Parliament and gave relief to the carer, that is, the mother. I believe it was a great initiative of the Fraser Government. It is interesting to read what the then Minister, Senator Don Grimes, said in introducing the family income allowance supplement in 1986:</PARA>
<PARA>The family income supplement is designed to improve the living standards of low income families with dependent children. The number of such families increases as unemployment increases. More breadwinners are being put out of work--</PARA>
<PARA>we should remember that this is 1986--</PARA>
<PARA>more families are living on a single wage, and more on pensions because there are so few jobs. Some of the reasons why the economic situation has deteriorated are also very interesting. </PARA>
<PARA>One might ask in these particular situations: what has changed between 1986 and 1991? Firstly, the living standards of low income families with dependent children are lowering. Also, there are 500,000 children living in poverty, in spite of that grand declaration by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that none would live in poverty after 1990, and there are 75,000 homeless people, as indicated by the Burdekin report. </PARA>
<PARA>  Unemployment is now over 10 per cent, and forecasters are saying that the number of Australians on the unemployment list will exceed one million. There are now more people than ever before on all types of pensions and benefits because there are so few jobs. So we can make comparisons with the economic malaise created not by Fraser, not by the coalition, but by a Labor government that said that this is the recession that Australians had to have.  Do honourable members remember the Budget that was about `bringing home the bacon'? The Labor Party has not even caught the pig yet. The Labor Government under Prime Minister Hawke will go down as one of the most uncaring governments since Federation. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Government and the Australian Labor Party are now in a policy paralysis situation, with Caucus revolts on Medicare and foreign ownership guidelines for the media, with no coherent wages policy and with no real plans to alleviate Australia's drought. It is interesting to note a comment by Mr Clyde Cameron when he was addressing a May Day rally in Cairns. He called on that rally to sweep the Labor Government out of power at the next election as a penalty for its betrayal of Labor policies and principles and for bringing about the worst recession since the disastrous Depression of the 1930s. Those comments were by a former Minister in the Whitlam Government, one who was described in the article as one of the great men of the Left of the Labor Party. They were his own comments. So the Labor Party has been condemned by its own. If we want to get a bit closer to the bone, we might ask what Premier Kirner and Wally Curran are indicating to the Government about the fact that it has no policy for jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>  The recession we `had to have' now means that 90 per cent of all pay as you earn taxation is required for our welfare bill. In 1991-92, $37.67 billion will be paid in pay as you earn taxation, and $34.41 billion will be spent on social security payments. Ironically, the cost of this recession is being borne by the people suffering most--those on pay as you earn taxation, those involuntarily unemployed, those suffering poverty in the bush, who are the new rural poor--the farmers. All these people have been the victims of high interest rates that were pitched far too high for far too long, of fouled up transport and wages systems and of record bankruptcies. One might ask in the face of all of that: where is the reality of Labor's social justice policy? In contrast, the coalition does have the policies for recovery. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I think it is important at the beginning of my remarks to make clear to the House that obviously the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Snowdon) was referring to and laughing at the Opposition's inability to come up with any policies. He certainly was not laughing at the plight of the unemployed or people in this country who are oppressed or poor. This Government has a very proud record of trying to assist and protect those people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) contains a number of measures which improve support for low to medium income families and iron out minor anomalies in other forms of assistance. Those other forms of assistance--which do have some anomalies that the Government is attempting to deal with by way of this Bill--include assistance to people obviously experiencing financial hardship, many of whom are in the rural communities and who may not otherwise be eligible for income support. The Bill also incorporates a change to payments to young people living away from home. </PARA>
<PARA>  From 1 January 1992, for instance, a family net assets test of $600,000, excluding the family home, will replace the existing parental assets test of $347,500 for the family allowance supplement. This change will obviate the possibility of people rearranging their assets amongst other family members to ensure that parental assets comply with the assets test and that they receive income support to which the majority of the community, I am sure, would not expect them to be entitled if their assets were very large. </PARA>
<PARA>  I remind the House also, in the context of the remarks made by the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) concerning PAYE taxpayers bearing the brunt, that the family allowance supplement, as it exists and under these proposals, provides cash for working families. That is exactly what it is; it is for low income, working families who have a wage coming in but that wage of itself is not sufficient, or does not take cognisance of, the dependants in the family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Behave yourself, Neil. The farmers will get it. The farmers will be eligible if they have very low incomes, as many of them do; I am prepared to acknowledge that. But I think it is important that this House understands--and I am not sure that everybody does--that low income working people are the beneficiaries, in the main, of the family allowance supplement. They may, in fact, have a non-working spouse and young children or a number of children. The allowance extends the limit of the test to a very high income, in fact. But because our present wages system--and, I suppose, that of the future--does not take account of a person's family responsibilities and the cost of maintaining children, it has been in the Government's interest, and I think the interest of the community, to ensure that we have a scheme which assists those people and recognises the costs involved in supporting their families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  A very important improvement, although not a huge one, is that the income threshold at which the full rate of family allowance supplement is payable, which is currently $18,000 a year, will be increased and aligned with the Austudy income threshold from 1 April 1992. At the moment that is $19,300, but it will increase to $20,700 from January 1992 and will be indexed each year in January from there on. I think this will make a difference to the number of people who are eligible for family allowance supplement. It will also increase the number of families, obviously, who are eligible. People will receive more in family allowance supplement as a consequence of the change. </PARA>
<PARA>  Most honourable members are aware, of course, that FAS recipients are currently entitled to a health care card. That has been an important aspect of FAS because it brings quite a lot of benefit to the family concerned. However, the Government has decided with this legislation to remove the eligibility for future part-FAS recipients; that is, people who now apply for a partial FAS payment will not now be eligible for a health care card. Those who are currently in receipt of a full rate family allowance supplement or those who are currently in receipt of a partial rate family supplement will continue to have access to a health care card. </PARA>
<PARA>  This change does have implications for the proposals to quarantine card holders and their families from the impact of the decision to permit bulkbilling doctors to charge their patients $2.50 a visit in the future. That is something that the Government recognises. But to quarantine those people has been seen as an important measure. Full rate family allowance supplement beneficiaries are obviously those who are most in need in these circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>  Other measures in the Bill also benefit families. The honourable member for Dawson referred in his speech to the child disability allowance. This will be raised by $2.15 a week after indexation. This will help restore the payment to its value in real terms at the time of its introduction in 1987. That is a very worthy proposal and one which I will support, the Government will support and presumably the Opposition will support. The youth disability supplement will also be increased by the same amount. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another small but significant change proposed in this legislation relates to the back payment of a family payment when the delay in lodgment of the claim exceeds four weeks after the birth of a child. People who have been in that position--as I, and maybe others in this House, have been--realise that not all women are in a position to lodge the claim for their child very soon after the birth. It is not simply a matter of being unable to do it; one has other things on one's mind. Even in the best circumstances, where a spouse is supportive or willing to go down and register the child's birth and then claim for the payment, it does not appear to be a priority at the time. Four weeks is a fairly short time for a person to have to comply with that requirement. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am pleased to see that the time fame for lodgment has now been extended to 13 weeks, which is a more realistic period, given that one has at least established some family routine in that 13-week period; there may not be a great deal of routine within four weeks of the baby being born. Obviously, that can be worse rather than better if one has other children, although the initial shock and disruption of a first child is probably worse than it is with any subsequent child. </PARA>
<PARA>  We in this House also recognise that sole parent pensioners face a substantial up-front cost when undertaking education. The honourable member for Dawson also referred to that in his speech. I do not think anybody here would want to deny our sole parents that opportunity, especially when education will usually lead to an improvement in their self-esteem and a better understanding and evaluation of their own capabilities, capacities and strengths when it comes to coping with life outside the home. Many people underestimate the capacity of sole parent pensioners to take on another job or to take on anything outside their role as a parent, and many of the problems associated with this are simply self-esteem problems. To involve sole parent pensioners in any community activity or any form of education is itself beneficial. </PARA>
<PARA>  I was therefore pleased to note that sole parents undertaking any education will be receiving a payment each year of $200 up-front, which will allow them to pay for books and other items required for their education. Obviously, this relates very closely to the vocational training opportunities that are available to sole parents, many of whom have children over 16 years of age. Where they are undertaking approved vocational education, for instance, they have course fees paid, their books and equipment are paid for and often even child-care is available for them. That is not always going to be the case with people undertaking education where there is no economic imperative, but I think society needs to recognise that education is a beneficial first step for sole parents to take and I am delighted that that $200 payment is being made available to them if they choose to follow that course. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the second reading speech on this Bill, the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) referred to young persons who have to live away from home or who have to leave secondary studies at an early age. He pointed out that these young people face considerable social and economic disadvantage. That is undoubtedly true and, whilst we as a Government have made great strides in trying to assist young people in their decision to stay in education until at least year 12, which would imply a leaving age of 16 or 17, it is a fact that many young people are still leaving before year 12. Obviously, with participation rates getting up to 60 or 70 per cent, and in some places exceeding that, there are not as many early school leavers as before, but even where there is a 60 or 70 per cent participation rate in post-compulsory education an implied 30 per cent of young people are leaving before they have reached year 12. In places like Western Australia, where, to large degree, even those in year 12 may be only 16, quite a number of 15-year-olds are not working and are getting very little assistance from the Government or from their families in straitened times. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is a good thing that the Government has now regularised its approach to those under the age of 16 who may not actually have had a job when they left school. This is important because previously, in a better job market when jobs were more readily available to young people, they would have been able to leave school at 15 and get some sort of a job. If they lost that job, they would then have been able to seek assistance through Job Search or unemployment benefits. At the present time, if they have not had a job they would not be eligible and would have to seek assistance through some other measure, usually through a special benefit or a sickness allowance. This does not actually assist them, because it makes them think they are in fact a select group of individuals or a sick group of individuals. That is not helpful either to the country or to them and their psychology of themselves. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill provides that from 1 January 1992 an independent young person may enrol or register with the CES for 13 weeks and then will be accepted for Job Search allowance even if that young person has not previously had a job. That is a very important change to the Act. The Bill also involves a change to our view of Austudy. The Treasurer's second reading speech says:</PARA>
<PARA>From 1 January 1992, this Bill provides for social security arrangements to be brought into line with Austudy entitlements for 16- to 17-year-old persons in substitute care. </PARA>
<PARA>I would point out to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) that when we brought in Austudy in the age related context, that is, for 16-year-olds and over, it was made clear that there were a significant number of students in the under-16-year-old category in South Australia, Western Australia and Queensland, which are the three States most affected, who are in fact in year 11 but are not eligible for Austudy because of its age related nature. </PARA>
<PARA>  If we are to extend the payments to people who are under the age of 16 when it comes to unemployment benefits or Job Search allowance, it stands to reason that we should at least be contemplating extending Austudy to those students who are under 16 and who are in year 11, which is post-compulsory education, because the original idea of the age related Austudy was to ensure there was no economic disincentive to students staying on at school. </PARA>
<PARA>  By virtue of this change to the legislation, for kids who are not really wishing to stay at school we may well have inadvertently built in some economic imperative to leave school and get this Job Search allowance, whereas it may be to their long term benefit to stay on at school. We will have to look at that again, and indeed I will ask the Minister to do so. In fact, I would have done so before now, but until very recently I had not realised that was one of the provisions in the Bill and I have not had an opportunity to raise it with him in the interim. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill also contains a proposal to extend the rental assistance provisions to young homeless people. Again those people would often be people who are under 16 years of age, but not always so. The Bill indicates that from 20 March 1992 eligibility for rent assistance will be extended to under-18-year-olds who receive the homeless independent rate of Job Search allowance, sickness allowance, disability support pension or special benefit and who have been receiving social security income support for at least 18 weeks. </PARA>
<PARA>  To people who are not aware of what is going on out there in the community, some of these provisions may appear not to be necessary; but, believe me, there are many children--and they are still children even when they are over the age of 16 years--who have no support at all or are trying to survive on what is effectively a fairly low social security payment, and pay rent out of it. If we do not provide them with rental assistance, we leave them with very little option but to share, sometimes with undesirable flatmates or housemates, or to not go into any permanent form of accommodation at all and pursue a lifestyle which is not helpful to their future or to their health and welfare. </PARA>
<PARA>  To regularise the position of those young people and to enable them to pay for proper--albeit not splendiferous--accommodation is to help them settle back into the community in a more normal fashion and resume a way of life that they have lost or forgone. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill obviously has a great deal going for it. I am sorry that the Opposition opposes that aspect of the Bill which allows an independent young person to register for the rental assistance. That is an important aspect of the Bill and it takes into account the Government's concerns--and the concerns of the community--about these homeless young people. </PARA>
<PARA>  We need to recognise that these young people are not just bums; a great number of them, for very good reasons--not always because of physical or mental abuse, but for very good reason in their minds--decide to leave home. Sometimes they do so at the behest of their parents and yet receive no formal support from those parents. Some of these kids are about 16 years of age. Some of them are attempting to cope with education at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do not need to remind most honourable members in this House that 16- to 17-year-olds have problems trying to cope with the last year of high school and with all that implies even when they are still at home.  Those who have no home deserve every bit of support we can extend to them. It should not be implied that the benefit they receive is sufficient to encourage them to leave home. </PARA>
<PARA>  This point needs to be made: support and assistance should be available where it has been established that there are sound reasons for a young person leaving home and it should be clear that the Government is not encouraging them to leave home when the home is perfectly adequate, and where we are dealing with just a teenage tantrum or a minor family dispute. </PARA>
<PARA>  But there are circumstances--and I have been confronted with them on a number of occasions--where these young people have very good reason for not being at home, or where in fact their parents have insisted that they leave for fairly arbitrary reasons, and there is no financial or other support available for them.   We cannot, in conscience, allow those young people to attempt to exist and follow an education pattern without support. If we do not support them, they will be unable to attain education itself. They will then be not able to redeem themselves. I prefer--I am sure that the Treasurer is proposing this--that we assist those young people as much as we can without actually encouraging them to leave home. After all, this time can be fairly traumatic for both parents and children; the teenage years are not easy years for anybody. </PARA>
<PARA>  Without any further comment, I strongly commend the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) for bringing these proposals forward in the Budget context. I certainly commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I rise in this House, having already been chastened by the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen) and told--in a motherly way--to behave myself. My plea that prompted the chastening from the honourable member for Cowan was in fact injected into her speech on behalf of the farmers of Australia, who have a great deal to be concerned about with the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  This legislation illustrates much of what distinguishes the Opposition from the Government. The Government has an obsession with wealth. It measures the success of various Australian families and individuals by what they have acquired. Consequently, the Government has an enthusiasm that I find almost indecent for the redistribution of that wealth. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is as if, from the Government's point of view, the absence of wealth and assets is some sort of handicap to the way in which people are able to perform as citizens. I suspect that those opposite like to imagine that most of society's major problems can be solved by the acquisition of additional assets or money. This is historic nonsense. I find it repugnant to measure people's individual status by what they own or earn. </PARA>
<PARA>  I was bemused to discover in the Canberra Times last weekend that Germaine Greer, hardly a pin-up girl in my office, had found that her most rewarding times had been spent among the peasants of Tuscany. We would have to ask ourselves:  if the acquisition of assets and wealth really is a measure of people's capacity to contribute, how is it that people in holy orders manage to be so cheerful?</PARA>

What they own bears very little relevance to their capacity to generate a decent income for themselves. In that context, I find the concept of assets testing generally to be a problem and something about which I am apprehensive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  All of these sentiments were expressed by members on this side of the House when we debated Austudy. Equally, they were expressed on this side of the House when we participated 12 months ago in another debate on the assets testing of the family allowance. From our point of view the family allowance should not be a social security payment. It ought to be an entitlement that every Australian prepared to mother and father children, the individuals we most need, ought to get. So we are bothered about any form of assets testing. </PARA>
<PARA>  The fact that the family allowance is what once was the child endowment and is paid to the principal carer indicates that we as a society see it as an entitlement rather than a welfare payment. We on this side of the House recognise that Australia needs nothing more than it needs supportive, stable family life. In that sense, we do not think the family allowance should be a social security payment; it should be, instead, an entitlement that goes to every Australian family who is prepared to make the best contribution it can to social life in Australia by raising well-balanced children. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am a little uncomfortable. I find myself standing here, trapped--though not trapped, as the Parliamentary Secretary will be tempted to interject, by the discipline of the party room. In fact, I am proud to say that over half of my South Australian Liberal parliamentary Federal colleagues have crossed the floor at some stage in their parliamentary careers. There is no discipline here in that sense. I am trapped instead by the uncomfortable reality that the family allowance ought to go to every Australian family, but the economic mismanagement of this Government obliges me and every Australian to recognise that the Government can no longer make that money available, and so we are obliged to target assistance in all areas. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It is a disaster. It was that disaster that had the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil), from the other side of the House, and I hammering on the door of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) in a bipartisan approach to have last year's absurd $300,000 assets test on the family allowance reconsidered. The best he could offer was $500,000. We recognised that that still would fail to meet the needs of Australian farming families, so we opposed it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In 1991 we find ourselves in an invidious position. Here we are with a government sending Australia broke. Here we are, obliged to target assistance in some way. Here we are, considering again a Bill that, thanks to our cussedness, has been improved at least to the point where the assets test will be set at $600,000, which is still far too inadequate, and that includes one sweetener that makes it possible for the Opposition to support the Government in these amendments to the family allowance and the family allowance supplement; that is, hardship provisions, which will allow a number of Australian farming families who ought to access these provisions to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am pleased to say that the honourable member for Cowan--when I was, I confess, rude enough to interrupt her speech--said `the farmers will get it'. No news could have been better for me and for the Liberal and National parties represented on this side of the House. That is what we need to know. We were a bit bothered that the hardship provisions may not be adequate to allow Australian farming families who will be locked out of the family allowance by their assets--and that will be the vast majority of farming families--access to the family allowance and the family allowance supplement when they most need it. </PARA>
<PARA>  The hardship provisions say that, if a person's income falls below $13,078 a year plus $624 for every child, that person will be able to access the family allowance. In addition, if a couple has less than $10,000 of liquid assets, in spite of having farm assets of over $600,000, those people will be able to access the family allowance. The honourable member for Cowan assures me that every one of my farmers will qualify. I am heartened by that because what we seek from the Minister--and I convey this to the Minister through the Parliamentary Secretary--is the knowledge that farmers will not be locked out of access to family allowance by having liquid assets that in our view are nothing more than the working capital they need to run the farm. </PARA>
<PARA>  We reluctantly accept the need for assets testing of the family allowance and the family allowance supplement, but we are concerned that the Government may be much too rigid in its interpretation of what $10,000 of liquid assets means. I convey to the Parliamentary Secretary the following two points, confident that he will be able to take them to the Minister: first, that the Minister, to be consistent, ought to consider tapering the assets test so that it goes up, reflecting the number of dependent children in each family, just as it does in the income test; and, secondly, that the Minister should look at the definition of `working capital' and ensure that working capital is in some way excluded from the liquid assets so as to allow people to access the family allowance. </PARA>
<PARA>  It would cost an average grain farmer in Australia $100,000 to put his crop in the ground. I do not exaggerate,  and my colleagues present could vouch for this even more fluently that I could. A farmer with $10,000 of liquid assets is hardly about to go on a sowing rampage such as Australia needs to turn around its balance of payments deficit. I am not a grain farmer; I am not a wheat or wool farmer. I have come into this place with a background in horticulture, principally in fruit growing. That is not a capital intensive industry, but there is no way I could harvest my fruit crops, given that that harvest is still principally undertaken by itinerant labour, unless I had available to me $50,000 to pay those labourers. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are supposed to sit here and listen to nonsense espoused by Government members as if they were the only ones who knew what it was like to be an itinerant labourer. I will lay London to a brick that I have written out more cheques for itinerant labourers than anyone opposite has. I have a fair idea from the people who work for me year in and year out of what it is like for them to have to survive on what is a very nominal income, which means that most of them qualify for the family allowance supplement anyway. </PARA>
<PARA>  People in primary industry invariably need on hand, in working capital, a sum of money that well and truly exceeds the $10,000 that the Government has allowed for liquid assets. If this, in fact, is to be a fair and just assets test on the family allowance, and revision of the family allowance supplement, then this level of working capital must be borne in mind. </PARA>
<PARA>   As I said earlier, I frankly would prefer no assets test at all. In fact, if I were to be honest with the House, I suppose I would prefer no income test on the family allowance either, given that I maintain that it ought not to be a social security or welfare payment, but an entitlement to Australian families. </PARA>

The insertion of hardship provisions--I have no doubt that these are well motivated--that the Government has brought into this House need, at least, to be flexible enough in their applications so that farming families who may have a temporary influx of funds to be used either to plant a crop, to pay wages or, effectively, to meet the interest obligations that they are going to have over the ensuing three or six months, ought not, because of that influx of funds, be denied access to the family allowance or the family allowance supplement, as the case may be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>   All too often, I stand or sit in this place and have the impression that, from the Government's point of view, all arguments are black and white; there is no compromise. So it is that if we suggest something it is black, and if the Government suggests it, it is white. It is a luxury, frankly, that we have not been able to afford. From time to time, we have found ourselves obliged to support the Government in things we have been uncomfortable about. As a representative of wheat and woolgrowers, and as a representative of horticulturalists, on the question of tariff protection I have  found myself on the question of tariff protection supporting the Government on issues with which I was uncomfortable, knowing that they were imperfect but deciding that they were the lesser of the available evils. </PARA>
<PARA>  A similar sort of generous spirit has not, it seems to me, pervaded the Government benches because here we are proposing a goods and services tax. It is not a black and white decision, but if one listened to the people opposite, one would swear that it was. Everything we have heard over the past month about the GST has been black. In spite of the fact that it was recommended by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and endorsed by the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), everything has been black. </PARA>
<PARA>  In this debate this morning, before I rose to my feet, what did I have? I had the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Snowdon) and the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen) telling me that we, the Opposition, have no policies. How that must rile the shadow Minister for tourism and the shadow Minister for education. Before the last election we had policies in every area, and yet here we are being pillaged by the Government because we are about to announce the most dramatic policy change that this nation has seen in 30 years. What does the Government say? It says, `You have no policies'. How on earth can it stand behind a statement like that?</PARA>
<PARA>  Having been obliged this morning to stand up and uncomfortably support the Government's proposal for some form of assets testing on the family allowance, having been obliged to make a compromise in that area because I see little choice and because economically it is being foisted on me, let me remind the Government that I do not by so doing walk away from the families of Australia or the need to support them. The coalition recognises that, through the GST, there is a real opportunity to offer support to the families of Australia. It is only that sort of opportunity that allows us to support the Government in what we see as a less than adequate family measure currently before the House.</PARA>
<PARA>  We propose a sort of tax measure which deliberately encourages Australians to be productive and which, in fact, allows the Government for the first time to reduce income tax on Australian families. There has not been one gracious word of support from the Government benches. We have not pretended it is all good, but I am damn sure it is not all bad. Yet, if one listened to the Government, one would swear it was. Does the Government think that in Opposition the proposal of a new tax policy is easy? Of course it is not. It would be a lot easier for us to sit here mute and go into government, as we inevitably will. Instead of that, we have taken the honourable course; we have told the people of Australia what we propose to do in taxation reform and designed that taxation reform so that it will deliberately assist Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA>  We would like to deliberately assist Australian families by making the family allowance freely available to them all, but the economic reality is that we cannot. So, we have compromised our attitude at that point in the interests of the national economy. I have seen no such realistic compromise on any area of the GST emerge from the Government benches, in spite of the fact that--</PARA>

<PARA>   The Bill before the House underscores some form of asset testing for the family allowance. We have wrestled with this. We uncomfortably support it because we see it as the lesser of the available evils. But we seek the assurance from the Minister for Social Security--and I pass this message through the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) who is at the table--that the real value of farms will be taken into consideration because, of course, they have plummeted and because the $600,000 asset test limit will almost certainly exempt 90 per cent of Australian farmers from the family allowance. The door that the Government then opens to let them in, which is the door that allows them to qualify through hardship provisions, has sufficient flexibility to allow farmers to hold the working capital that they need merely to be farmers and still be eligible for the family allowance and the family allowance supplement where possible. The income test of $13,000 or so elevated for each child ought not to be so rigorously policed that those who are on the margin will find themselves unable to make ends meet or feed their families simply because they happen to be assets rich, but cash poor. This is something that the Government seems to find difficult to conceive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I have listened with interest to the previous speakers in this debate this morning and I guess I was similarly amused with some of the comments, as was the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Snowdon) earlier on. I guess I contained my amusement; unfortunately the Parliamentary Secretary, with his jovial outlook on certain aspects of the Opposition's policies, was not able to do so. However, I was similarly bemused, I guess, with the comments of the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) who concentrated most of his remarks on one aspect of this particular debate before the House this morning. He concentrated mainly on the assets test and the angst which that is causing within the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>   He noted that the debate about the assets test is similar to the debate that took place previously in the House with regard to the assets test on Austudy. I must say that I will canvass more of the aspects of this Bill this morning than just the assets test that applies to the family allowance and family allowance supplement. </PARA>
<PARA>  Certainly of great assistance to families, particularly rural families, and small businesses in rural areas are the benefits from the series of social security Bills included in the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3), which is here before us today. Most of the changes, I know, were announced in the Budget, and this legislation is to bring them into action. In my electorate, I have had much representation on many of the things covered by the Bill we are discussing today, and I will visit nearly all of them in the limited time I have available. Certainly the provisions for families within this Bill are to be applauded. </PARA>
<PARA>  I notice that the honourable member for Wakefield digressed a little in his remarks on this legislation this morning in that he mentioned the goods and services tax at large. He did not quite elaborate on how he views the imposition of a goods and services tax on low income families, considering the Opposition's argument--and I agree with that argument--that the farmers of Australia and a lot of small businesses are asset rich, if I can use that term, and income poor. The impact of a goods and services tax on those people, who are in receipt of very low incomes and, consequently, are paying very small levels of income tax, and the way in which the Opposition is going to compensate them are yet to be seen. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do not know whether the Opposition is going to give them a straight cash grant, but certainly a small cut in income tax levels will not be a commensurate reimbursement for the amount of money that small farming families and people on low incomes will have to pay. When the constituents of honourable members opposite appreciate what the goods and services tax means, they will, no doubt, be banging on the doors of Liberal-National Party members, not to mention Labor Party members who represent rural areas--after all, we do represent most of Australia now. The representations from those people, I know, will be loud and long; they are already starting to express their concern to me. How does one compensate people who do not have an income or who have a very low income?</PARA>
<PARA>  I turn to the provisions for families in the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3). The raising of the family allowance supplement threshold income from $18,000 to, I believe, $20,700 by 1 January 1992 is to be applauded. It extends the provision of this allowance to a larger number of families. Another provision I want to comment on is the integration of the family allowance and the family allowance supplement into a single payment and claim process from 1 January 1993. Again, that is simplifying the procedures and ensuring that people who are removed from one payment do not miss out when it comes to applying for the other. </PARA>
<PARA>  Farmers and people with small businesses get a deal of attention from the Opposition. As a matter of fact, in the debate this morning the hardship provisions applying to those two groups seem to have been the only part of the Bill that has been visited at all. I admit that the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) went further than that, but it seems that most of the time has been spent on the problems of the hardship provisions relating to family allowance supplement and family allowance. </PARA>
<PARA>  We do not have a bottomless pool of funds to draw on, and that means there has to be some limit. How one goes about putting that limit is a matter of debate. I know that members of the coalition are divided in their opinion on that. I would not step back from the fact that if we did have a bottomless pit we should extend the family allowance to a larger number of families. But, let us face it, that bottomless pit of money is not there. We have to put in some restrictions. The fact that the net assets level of some $600,000 sees a cut off in most circumstances is not something that I applaud, but I do not step back from it either. It is just something that we have to face up to. </PARA>
<PARA>  I guess there are a lot of things in government, on either side, which we do not necessarily agree with. The honourable member for Wakefield was very forthright in mentioning that some of his colleagues have had similar angst and have even crossed the floor. I do not know that we are going to see a great deal of that in the next 18 months, but it shows that government is a difficult proposition and means that we have to make some decisions. This Government has made decisions in this regard. It has not stepped back from making those decisions. It is not lost or wandering around in the desert, as a couple of honourable members opposite have inferred previously. </PARA>
<PARA>  A great deal of time has been spent on discussing the family allowance and the fact that the assets test of some $600,000 will see people cut off from that benefit. In particular, I am very pleased--and I know that the members in the coalition are pleased with this, although they express it with a great deal of qualification--that the hardship provisions mean that most people will still be eligible for that payment. The hardship provisions, I think, are reasonably generous and they are commensurate with what is extended to other people--not necessarily to people with lots of assets that would be removed. </PARA>
<PARA>  I turn to income levels. It has been mentioned that the income below a married benefit rate of some $13,000 is adjusted for the number of children. That means we are not just dealing with one section of Australian society or one section of the producers in Australia. We are dealing with people across Australia. Imposing the provision on an across-Australia basis is one of the problems. But, again, we have not got a bottomless pit of money and we have to be responsible as to how and to whom we go about giving the money. Honourable members opposite will get a great deal of press coverage from their opposition to the proposal. I wish them well. However, we have to be responsible about it. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the debate, the Opposition has concentrated on the income level below $13,078 which is adjusted for the number of children in the family and a limited amount of funds. When one starts making allowances for certain industries or certain parts of society, one starts to discriminate. I do not step back from that, either. It is part of our social philosophy that we do those things. But we have to look at how much we are prepared to discriminate and how other people with other forms of support can come in. We have to be careful about that. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9U4">Mr NEWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The flexibility, I think, is there. The Parliamentary Secretary indicated that he was listening when honourable members opposite mentioned the problems of small business people and farmers who need a certain amount of working capital. I take that on board. However, the limited funds, the liquid assets, which are available to people across the board are fairly generous, with the qualifications that I have just mentioned. Hence, the family allowance is still available to a large number of beneficiaries. Although it is not a great deal of money, obviously it is something which people feel they are entitled to. I guess the debate which probably went on in the coalition's caucus in the last couple of days would have been about that entitlement. I notice that, similarly, members of the coalition were divided on the matter, if the report in the Australian Financial Review this morning is accurate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The other things I would like to visit in this debate come from my own electorate. In my electorate there are a number of homeless children, homeless youth, who are disadvantaged. I guess every electorate has that. I do not know that the numbers in my electorate are any greater than one would find across the rest of Australia. They might be a little greater. With the education of today's youth, people would at least know that the north coast is a great place to live. If they are to be homeless and destitute, then I guess they would come to the north coast--and why not?  But this legislation is all about provisions to assist them to get established and get away from the poverty trap and barrier. </PARA>
<PARA>  The reforms of payments for disadvantaged youth are certainly useful, and making the homeless allowance for the young available on a weekly basis from January 1992 is to be applauded. The young people to whom I have spoken and, more importantly, the social workers who work amongst them believe that these changes are beneficial. I know that the extension of the rent assistance to single people under 18 years, as provided for in the Bill, has been received with a great deal of acclaim. As the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen) pointed out, it is not for us to judge too harshly young people who, for various reasons, may have to or do leave home. From my 14 years as a schoolteacher, I know that there are all sorts of reasons why that occurs, so I applaud the changes set out in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>  The extension of rent assistance to young people will keep them away from the poverty trap and will help them to put money into productive things and to get established. There are other provisions in the Bill that will help them to do that, and I will come back to them. Certainly, making it easier for unemployed school leavers between the ages of 16 and 20 who are from low income families to get the special benefit is another aspect of the Bill which is to be applauded, and the fact that they do not have to wait the usual 13-week period before receiving a payment is again something which takes into consideration the circumstances in which some people find themselves--in this case, youth. </PARA>
<PARA>  I guess that, of all the people in society, young persons are the ones who have not had the experiences of life to know what they can and cannot do to help themselves. It is okay to say that when people get to 20 or 25 they are street-wise and know what to do, but when we were in this younger age group of 20 years and below, we all liked to think we were wise. In hindsight we know that we could have done with a little more help in our lives, especially in that critical period of our youth when people are just learning about things and life in general. The independent rate of Job Search allowance, the sickness benefit and the special benefit to 16- and 17-year-olds in foster care are again measures that are just extending what, I guess, is their entitlement. </PARA>
<PARA>  The other aspect in which the Government is taking a pro-active role in assisting youth is the establishment of pilot projects which will make it easier for homeless young people to get both social security payments and help from other agencies. I guess it is especially the homeless who tend to be cut off from communication with government departments. I think the Government is to be applauded for coming up with these pilot projects to put in place not a bureaucratic system but one which is identifiable and can be reached by homeless people. After all, we tend to forget that most homeless people do not, in a lot of cases, have the cash to get onto a train or do not have a supporting family member to put them on a bus or into a car to get them to a certain address. Homeless people usually mix with other homeless people and communicate within those circles. When going round in circles, if you like, it is very hard for them to get positive communication to help get them out of that particular circle. </PARA>
<PARA>  I commend the work of social workers. After 14 years as a schoolteacher I sometimes wonder how they stay in the game and face up to the problems that they encounter every day in communicating with and assisting these people. It takes a certain type of person to stay there and to push continually through the frustrations caused by the bureaucracy and the difficulties in communicating with people who, in some cases, do not at the start want to be communicated with. That is why they are there. The pilot projects will go a long way towards helping people get off that particular roundabout. </PARA>
<PARA>  The child support for sole parents to help minimise poverty gaps will certainly help people to keep away from the poverty trap. The extensions that the Government is making to non-custodial parents to help cope with maintenance liabilities and so forth will certainly go a long way towards helping them. The people I have mentioned are the winners, I guess, out of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have mentioned rental assistance. The changes to the bereavement measures were covered by the honourable member for Cowan, and I second her statements. I also commend the Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) for his quick action in dealing with that particular nasty anomaly which was revealed in the case of the Strathfield incident. He has certainly shown that he is the compassionate man whom, I think, a lot of Australians see him as, in that he is prepared to act quickly on little bugs that we sometimes inadvertently allow to sneak into legislation. I commend him for his reaction there. </PARA>
<PARA>  The other aspect which I have found to be welcomed in my electorate is the education entry payment for sole parents of $200, which is to be paid for continuing full time or part time approved education courses from 1 January 1992. In the short period that I have been a member, I have lost count of the number of people who have pointed out problem areas to me, and this is one of them. People who do not have any cash reserves, who literally do not have cash assets, not even up to $10,000, do not have the money to help themselves get established. I pay tribute to the people in TAFE and to the course providers because I know that in my electorate they have actually gone and put cash in people's hands to help them get established. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have written to the Minister for Social Security on another aspect which I hope we can overcome. When people on low incomes, especially on unemployment benefits, apply to get into a course of some sort, they find there is the anomaly of their unemployment benefits being cut immediately after they start the course. The problem is often that their money from the Department of Employment, Education and Training has not come through. Not many of us can hold our breath for 30 seconds, yet we are really asking these people to hold their breath for two weeks or more. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have written to the Minister for Social Security to ask whether we can change the legislation or whatever it is that causes that two-week gap to appear. Quite a number of people have come to my office in Lismore to see me on that particular matter. I hope that the Minister is able to react just as quickly to this aspect as he has to other aspects of the Social Security portfolio, which he has administered so well. </PARA>
<PARA>  Again, in a couple of cases--genuine cases, I assure honourable members--the TAFE people have actually dug into their own pockets to help people through that two- or three-week period. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-First, I would like to acknowledge the Minister at the table, the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), and thank him for the hearing he gave the other day to some of my constituents who had come all the way from far western Queensland for a meeting of the Federal Inland Development Organisation. Let us hope we can be of some assistance to those people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I was listening quite intently to the honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell), and I can only conclude that he really has lost touch--if he ever had touch--with his electorate. I know that the electorate of Richmond is on the north coast of New South Wales and some parts of it include seaside resorts, but it is very much a rural electorate. I can only say that he has lost touch. It goes to show how honourable members, if they are not careful, can lose touch so quickly once they come to Canberra. If the honourable member really wanted to see what is going on out there in the bush, I would welcome him to the electorate of Maranoa and show him some very sad cases that really must be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) will give effect to a number of measures, most of which were announced in the 1991-92 Budget. I took a sympathetic interest in the bereavement provision of this Bill. The recent tragedy at Strathfield in Sydney's western suburbs highlighted an unfortunate aspect of the current social security legislation whereby child bereavement payments were not available to some families. The Minister for Social Security (Senator Richardson) gave an undertaking to correct this deficiency at the first opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Bill gives effect to the Minister's commitment and highlights to me the pace at which reform of social security legislation can be undertaken. I appeal to the Minister to reform other unfortunate aspects of current social security legislation in light of the worst drought facing rural Australia for over 100 years. I have appealed to the Government to introduce now as a matter of urgency an unconditional household support payment, which would be equivalent to the unemployment benefit, in the form of a cash grant to many farming families living in these drought declared areas. I think that this measure would correct a very unfortunate situation whereby unemployment benefits are payable to a married couple in the city no matter what the value of their residential property, while, on the other hand, a farming couple becomes ineligible for unemployment benefits once the value of their farm exceeds $157,500. </PARA>
<PARA>  In his second reading speech, the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) emphasised that no person in Australia could not be aware of the special difficulties being faced by the rural community. Does the Minister sincerely believe that the provisions in this Bill help put food on the table of those drought stricken farmers whose resolve has continuously been broken down by nine years of hard Labor policies?</PARA>
<PARA>  Honourable members of this Parliament need to recognise the severity of the drought crippling much of rural Australia. They need to recognise that nine years of this Government's policies have exacerbated the position in this crisis. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) acknowledges the current situation. Recently he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Rural Australia could be facing its worst crisis in 100 years. </PARA>
<PARA>Such a crisis does not eventuate out of the blue. The policies of this Government have struck a far heavier and much more savage blow than the weather has. Farmers have fought to remain in business against all odds. They have fought for the last eight to nine years against record interest rates which have led to a grossly overvalued Australian dollar, which in turn makes export products less competitive. They have fought the hidden taxes and tariffs which this Government has introduced. There are many tariffs on imported machinery and spare parts. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the last nine years the Government has made virtually inoperative the income equalisation deposits scheme, which was an initiative of this side of the House which helped smooth farmers' income and catered for situations such as the one we are confronted with in rural Australia right now. Farmers have fought to have countervailing duties applied to the many imported food products that come into Australia and unfairly compete against the domestically grown product. They are continuing their fight against the corrupt world prices for food. They are fighting the major nation, the United States of America, right now in Brussels to see whether we can see some reforms put in place. They have fought all those battles. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will give a simple example to put in perspective the relative purchasing power of a farmer today. In 1973, a farmer needed 35 tonnes of wheat to buy a farm utility, which is an essential item around the farm today. In 1991, he will need 175 to 180 tonnes of wheat to buy a farm ute. That is a factor of six. </PARA>
<PARA>  Mr Andrew interjecting--</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YT4">Mr BRUCE SCOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I will repeat that for the honourable member for Wakefield because I know that he has a rural electorate similar to mine and is confronted with these problems daily. In 1973, 35 tonnes of wheat would purchase a farm utility; today, it is almost 200 tonnes, depending on whether it is a premium wheat or a feed wheat.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  That gives the Parliament some idea of the erosion of the purchasing capacity of the farmers in rural Australia in the last 27 years. Based on this fact alone, farmers cannot fight against all these evils imposed by this Labor Government and survive the worst drought in living memory. This Government has succeeded in achieving the breakdown of the farmers' resolve so that when farmers are faced with a natural disaster of this magnitude they feel completely helpless. </PARA>
<PARA>  Across my electorate--I imagine across many electorates of Australia--there have been financial assistance seminars. These have been conducted by farming organisations to find out what can be done to assist farm families to remain on the land until the next rain. Rain is one thing that no-one can organise. Rain will certainly alleviate some of the problems, but it will not rain money; rain will only alleviate the immediate hardship of the daily chore of feeding livestock. </PARA>
<PARA>  From these meetings comes an overwhelming plea for understanding and compassion from the Government. Most of these people have never been in this position. Most of these people are very proud people and they have never had to resort to even considering that they may need some form of welfare to get through this crisis that they are confronted with. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is the first time since the Great Depression of the 1930s that farming communities in the Dalby area have been so united and have come forward together to try to tackle this problem and seek some emergency relief. I believe that that is certainly a sad indictment of Government policies when for 60 years communities have been able to cope but right now they believe they cannot cope much longer. It is the whole community that is united behind this cause. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Exactly. As the honourable member for Wakefield says, they pride themselves on being independent and not wanting to go to governments for handouts. Even sadder is the lack of financial assistance or understanding that is coming from this Government. I am not talking about an inefficient industry. These farmers are considered `world best standard'--a catch phrase around this place which is often used to suggest that we should strive to achieve world best standards in many industries. They are acknowledged internationally as the best and most efficient farmers in the world. We are not talking about subsidies or assistance for an inefficient industry to be propped up. By failing to attack this problem, this Government is succeeding in destroying Australia's world best industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It was interesting to note a comment in the Australian Financial Review made by Mr Curran, the Victorian Secretary of the Meat Industry Employees Union. He said that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was `a product of the Australian Parliament'. As reported, he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>He reflects the general conservative views of modern Labor politicians. They've lost the way. Their rhetoric is not the light on the hill. It's the bunker. It's a tragedy. </PARA>
<PARA>I would have to agree with him. Mr Curran, the Secretary of the Victorian meatworkers union, one of those on the Government's side, said:</PARA>
<PARA>It's the bunker. It's a tragedy. </PARA>
<PARA>I must acknowledge in this address the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy's recent visit to Toowoomba on the Darling Downs. He came to Toowoomba about 10 days ago. I hope that as a result of that visit he has an understanding of the real plight in rural Australia. It is so easy to sit in one's swivel chair in Canberra in the comfort of this air-conditioned building and think one knows what is really happening at the coalface. The Minister did visit my electorate and I hope that he gained an understanding of what is happening. I hope he understands what the drought means, because that is what we must focus on now. We must identify drought as a recurring phenomenon but one which must be considered by this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>  The rural adjustment scheme (RAS) certainly does give assistance to farmers at this time. I concede the advantages of this scheme. However, the scheme makes no provision for drought. The rural adjustment scheme pays interest relief, but where does that interest relief go to? It goes to the bank;  it pays the bank's interest. It will put food on the banker's table but it will not put food on the farmer's table. RAS lends money to already debt ridden farmers who have struggled to remain efficient and who have survived for the last 10 years under this Government, or forces them to adjust out of farming. </PARA>
<PARA>  Government policy seems to be more directed at eliminating farmers than trying to assist them. One only has to look at the ABARE figures, which state that in the next three to four years 20 per cent of farmers will leave the land. That is an appalling indictment of this Government. Testimony to this fact is the existence of government incentives to leave the land and policies which encourage the importation of $2.2 billion worth of food imports every year. </PARA>
<PARA>  The drought policy task force commissioned by the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy identified government assistance under the banner of a hydrological cycle. I will explain that briefly. It is a cycle where one gets rain, apathy, drought, awareness, concern and ultimately, crisis. Then the cycle begins again. However, this cycle leaves out any effective form of drought management. It tackles drought at the crisis point and not before. We have to attack the problem before the crisis. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is a very real need, as recognised by the national drought policy review task force, to encourage commercially and environmentally responsible management under variable seasonal conditions. The Federal Government's approach to the disaster of the magnitude that is now being felt in Queensland and New South Wales is to define drought as a naturally recurring feature of the Australian climate and an ongoing commercial risk associated with rural enterprises. However, the task force recommended an additional part to rural adjustment--part D. This part addressed household support--the very basis of what I am talking about today--under drought conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is this provision which should come under the banner of this social security legislation. The cash reserves of these people out there right now have all dried up. They have spent an awful lot of money, all their cash reserves, feeding their livestock and, in some cases, they have been selling their livestock, if they are saleable, to pay their bills. Many grain growers have been without income for the last four seasons. Let me assure the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths), who is at the table, that our welfare net is missing the farmer and his wife, unlike the farmer's city cousin. </PARA>
<PARA>  Whilst unemployment benefits are payable to married couples in the city no matter what the value of their residential property, no such benefit is afforded farming couples who may wish to remain on the land. They only become eligible for unemployment benefits once their assets are below $157,500. Honourable members might think these people get picked up under the family allowance or family allowance supplement, but they do not. To be eligible for family allowance or family allowance supplement, they must have dependent children. So the older couple, or the young couple trying to get a start in farming, are not picked up under the social security network. </PARA>
<PARA>  Part C of the rural adjustment scheme under household support provides no benefit for those farming families who wish to remain on the land. To become eligible, they must put their property--their assets, in other words--on the market and sell within two years. If they do not sell within two years, the household support which they have received under part C of the rural adjustment scheme is converted to a commercial loan; the money that has been paid for the last two years is converted to a commercial loan. </PARA>
<PARA>  When farming families put their property on the market to receive this household support they also put the family home on the market. So when they adjust out of farming they leave the land homeless. This is the only way that they can get household support today. There are strings attached. I believe it is time that we altered that criteria for drought affected farmers, such is the severity of the drought that is being suffered in so many areas of rural Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA>  Certainly household support must take on a new dimension in drought declared areas. I have several cases in my electorate right now where people have sought outside work, which is very difficult to find. I had one case in my office the other day. This person was able to obtain $60 a week in part time work. I said, `How do you use that money?' She said, `That is what the family is living on. That is buying the groceries'. Other families did not attend these rural financial seminars--they rang me.  They believed that they could use the money that they would have spent on petrol to get to town in a better way. They rang the 008 number which I have at my office to give me some idea of the hardship with which they are confronted. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Queensland Government has an initiative right now which gives $200 in emergency aid to put food on the table of some of these families who are suffering extreme hardship. It is not the type of scene that I would have expected in Australia where a government boasts that there will be no child living in poverty. It is the type of scene that one would see in a Third World country. Two hundred dollars of emergency food aid, in this day and age in Australia, is a sad indictment of this Government. We are faced with the worst drought in living memory, since records were kept in my electorate and in many parts of Australia. We must have, under this social security legislation, unconditional household support for up to nine months to address the extreme financial difficulties being faced by these drought declared farmers. </PARA>
<PARA>  At the end of the drought, machines can be replaced and animals can be repurchased, but we cannot replace the four and five generations of farmers who have worked that land and who have an intimate knowledge of what it can do. They have knowledge that has passed from father to son. It is not in the textbooks. That is what we are going to lose if these farmers are forced from the land. Right now they are asking for a little compassion and some support. I believe that support must come in the form of household assistance. This will certainly take the weight off some farmers' minds as to how they are going to continue to keep food on their tables. It is a problem that this Government must address as a matter of urgency. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I place on record my personal support for some of the points raised by the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott). He outlined the concerns that people have in rural areas and has exposed the plight of people out there. Recently I went to a rural crisis meeting in Biloela in part of my electorate in central Queensland. Some 200 people brought forward similar problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Having said that by way of support, I find it very difficult to continue that support when the honourable member says that there ought to be unconditional household support for nine months. That is an amazing suggestion. He is saying that regardless of the wealth, regardless of the assets, regardless of the capacity of a person to borrow on a rural property, the Government, the people of Australia, the pensioners, the workers, the low income person, ought to give unconditionally money for a nine months period. </PARA>
<PARA>  I understand the honourable member's concern because I have travelled my electorate and I know the sorts of problems that people are having. But I suggest that we do not achieve very much in a debate such as this when people come out with such extreme propositions. We need to be fair. I try to be fair to the honourable member for Maranoa, as his electorate joins mine. We try to work for the same constituency, our rural people. But we need to ensure that, when we give assistance, we provide it efficiently and that we also provide it to those who need it most. That has been the significance, the characteristic, of the Australian welfare system. It is extremely efficient; it is means tested and it targets those in most need. </PARA>
<PARA>  It costs less than 3.5c in the dollar to deliver this service. Honourable members should think about that. We have seen all sorts of allegations against privatised type welfare agencies where 78c of every dollar given goes into the administration. But, of every $100 that we expend or appropriate for welfare, only 3.5c actually goes to the cost of delivering that service. That is a minor amount. One of the reasons for that is that we do it efficiently and properly and we target those most in need. </PARA>
<PARA>  I also want to take issue with the honourable member when he continues to raise the matter that no child shall live in poverty. Everyone understands that what this Government had as a policy, as a principle and as its objective was the provision of assistance to families. When those opposite continue to criticise this Government because families--or parents, those within the family system--are not prepared to pass on that assistance, that is an unfair criticism. What this Government has done over the period 1983 to 1991 has been to implement a major change, a revamping of the welfare system, and this recent Budget continues that revamping, continues the improvements in the system and improves the efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA>  Surely we cannot be held responsible if the mothers, fathers or others in families who get the assistance do not pass it on. But that is what those opposite are saying. They are criticising us because there are still children living in poverty. Do they want a socialist, communist system? Do they think that we should drag children away from parents who do not provide them with suitable care, who do not pass on to them the family allowance and the family allowance supplement, who do not use their rental assistance properly but instead go down to the pub weekend after weekend and blow the money? Surely that is not what those opposite are suggesting. Yet that is what they are saying every time they criticise us for the fact that there are still children living in poverty today, which I and all honourable members admit. But we do not have the capacity, nor do we have the right, to go into a family home and drag out those children because a parent is not carrying out his or her responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA>  I concur with many of the points made by the honourable member for Maranoa, and I understand where he comes from on these issues because I know the plight of the people and the deprivation that is taking place and the attitude where they just want to walk away because they have seen their life work being destroyed because of climatic conditions, and in some instances because of government policy. They just want to walk away from it all and throw up their hands. But I suggest to the honourable member that we are trying to address that. If the honourable member had taken extra time to read the detail of the Budget Papers he would know that as from 1 January the assets test pertaining to rural people will be increased significantly to $600,000. That is a massive increase because the present FAS limit is $347,500, excluding the family home. But as from 1 January it will rise to $600,000. I would like to go further with this; I think we ought to do it now; I do not think that we can wait until 1 January. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Let us deal with what we have to start with. At the moment the Austudy allowance is $19,300, so we have the difference between $18,000 and $19,300. The Austudy allowance will increase to $20,700 in the new year and we are going to make them the same. That is what we did when it came to what a pensioner could earn without having to pay tax. Originally, we had the stupid system where the Department of Social Security said that pensioners could earn $40, but if they earned more than $6 or $7 a week over that, they faced tax. So, after a lot of consideration in bringing the systems together, we overcame that problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  We are targeting those who most need government assistance. The money is not coming from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Treasurer (Mr Kerin), the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) or from me. It is coming from all Australians. It is money that goes into the general pool and is then disbursed back to those who need it most. This Government has as its priority the giving of assistance to those who need it most. </PARA>
<PARA>  In this Bill there is an increase of $2.50 in the child disability allowance. It is not much, but again it is an indication of our priority and our willingness to help those in need. We are also increasing the youth disability supplement. We are also picking up the gaps. On the one hand, we say to sole parents that we want them to go and study. We have given them an Austudy supplement for that purpose. But we also understand that sole parents have major problems if they enter a study course. They have to buy books, pay course fees and get equipment. So, understanding that problem, this Government is introducing a new up-front cash grant of $200 to solve that problem. But no credit, no recognition, of that is being given from the other side. Those opposite do not recognise that here is another problem, in the myriad of problems that exist out there in the fabric of society, that we are weaving back, fixing up and patching up. We are doing it properly. We have an understanding of the problem and we are doing something about it. </PARA>
<PARA>  Again, in the independent young person category, for a long period young people below the age of 18 have faced the problem that, because they have not been employed, they could not access allowances such as Job Search and sickness benefit. They simply have not been able to do that because of this employment requirement. We are now changing that. We are now saying that, irrespective of whether someone has been employed, they now have a right to access this Job Search allowance. That is what this Government is about: having been made aware of problems, it acts on those problems. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are making the welfare system fairer and more efficient. We are committed to maintaining policies that really raise the issue of compassion. We recognise the special needs and problems of the sick, the aged, the disabled, the unemployed, the low income families and, for that matter, families generally. With the family allowance, a family can now earn up to $65,161 and still get the family allowance, so we are targeting families generally and ensuring that we are doing what is best for Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA>  What we are doing is in sharp contrast with our counterparts on the other side. One has only to look at the policies that have been enunciated and announced by them in recent documents. An article in the Bulletin magazine, written by David O'Reilly some weeks back, really exposed what the Opposition Liberal and National parties are about. They would cast on the scrap heap people who have been unemployed for nine months. They would privatise the delivery and provision of welfare services. They would remove the universality of the system. What it means is that, whereas at the moment one has a right in law to access, to gain sickness benefit or assistance by way of Austudy or whatever, that lot over the other side would leave it to the discretion of some welfare group. They would give some welfare group a lot of money and it would decide how much one gets and when one gets it. </PARA>
<PARA>  Surely the people of Australia will not accept that proposition. But that is very much part of what the Liberal and National parties are about. They are also coming up with some brand new ideas, which I will mention later, such as the goods and services tax. I noticed that the Opposition spokesman on social security, the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), mentioned in that article a retirement tax. We know that those European nations that have introduced a consumption tax, a goods and services tax or a value added tax also have this retirement tax. They charge people now for their future retirement. We do not do that. Yet about 23 per cent of all tax revenue in Europe comes from that retirement tax. </PARA>
<PARA>  Those opposite have not talked about that when they have discussed their consumption tax and GST, but the honourable member for Dawson has let the cat out of the bag. He has exposed the hidden agenda. They are not only talking about a tax on everything that is eaten and worn, they are not only talking about removing the exemptions of sales tax from charities; they are talking about other taxes as well. I thank the honourable member for Dawson for his honesty and for his willingness to place on the record the other aspects of these propositions being put forward. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I said before, we are about helping Australian people based on their needs. This is why we have introduced rent allowances, to try to subsidise or underpin those costs that people have to pay. At the same time, this Government has made sure that people in need have had telephone rebates and that through local authorities there have been rebates and subsidies on the rates and charges levied. The States have also pursued that line with rebates and subsidies on car registration. We have been trying and we continue to try to work to improve the lot of the low income person and those in need. </PARA>
<PARA>  I went to a meeting the other day in Biloela and I was amazed to hear one person say that we had done nothing about tax. It seems to me that we do not get our message through out there, so I pulled out some figures just to show what tax changes have taken place. From July 1991 a single pensioner will now pay no tax whatsoever unless he or she earns over $9,789 a year. Under the previous Government such pensioners paid tax on everything they earned. Let us go back to some of the other changes for the employed person. A $15,000 income earner back in 1980 had to pay $3,673 tax. Today, under the Hawke Labor Government, it is $1,998.75--a drop of 45.6 per cent. For a person on $25,000 it is $3,205.21 less, a saving of $61.63 a week. For the person on $30,000 a year the tax has dropped from $10,508 to $6,594--very close to a $4,000 drop in tax in any one year. For people on $35,000, or around $680 a week, the tax has dropped from $13,111.72 in 1980 to $8,799.75--$83 less per week in tax. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have also increased the threshold. So we have lowered the tax rates and we have increased the threshold. No-one now pays any tax unless he or she earns over $5,400. We have also ended the fringe benefit rorts--the entertainment deductions--and we have required substantiation and accountability. We have got tough with the system. We have got tough on those who have abused and misused the system, and at the same time we have redistributed the revenue available to government to help those who need it most. </PARA>
<PARA>  I read a recent article that has gone right across Australia showing how effective we have also been in overcoming the problem of people who abuse the system. Hundreds of thousands of people have been caught because they failed to disclose other income, because they falsified their assets, or because they gave false numbers for the number of children they looked after--children who have left home and have been kept on the home list. They have used false names in their bank accounts and they have used false names for pensions and unemployment benefits. They have also had undeclared bank accounts. We are really cleaning up the system. It is not easy when there are people who will falsify forms. I believe the person I have used as an example came out of the taxation system. He got all these false declarations and false birth certificates, but they finally got him. The key here is that it is a deterrent to others. It is a deterrent to abuse and to rorting. </PARA>
<PARA>  We now need to increase the work we are doing and the explanation of it. I came across a booklet the other day called Help the People in Country Areas, produced by the Department of Primary Industries and Energy through the Countrylink program. It is an excellent book. The reason I raise the issue is that some time ago I was in part of my electorate and a lady of 62 years of age came to me and asked whether she was eligible for a part pension or pension because of her age. She said she had thought about it two years ago but her friends and her husband said she was deserving of nothing. I followed the matter through. She should have been getting $80 per week for the last two years, but did not get it because she was ill-advised. Misinformation caused this problem for her. She missed out on that sort of money, something like $4,000 a year for two years, simply because of misinformation. So I welcome what we are doing through the Department of Primary Industries and Energy and through the Department of Social Security. We need to do more of it. People need almost a university degree to understand some of the forms and documentation. The onus is upon us as a government to ensure that people are informed. We have to sit down and make sure that people find it worth while to apply. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have had people say, `What's the use; I can't understand the forms; I don't know what to supply in terms of documentation of earnings or otherwise'. That has certainly been true with the family allowance supplement, where at the start hundreds of thousands of families did not take up their rights. That was money that could have helped raise the purchasing power of those families and improve their quality of life. So we need to do more about it; we need to ensure that people are informed. We also need to make sure that people are informed about the alternatives. This is the thing that really worries me. I think most Australians understand that we are getting to the issues; we are ensuring that the loopholes are being closed and that the needy and not the greedy are getting the assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>  The real threat is an ideological one. It is not administrative; it is ideological. We have coming from those on the other side an attitude which is Australia's brand of Thatcherism, where they simply attack anything that is called welfare. They seem to put down people who are unemployed, people who are on pensions, people who have been disabled and people who are sick. They put them down all the time and make them lesser Australians. I will not cop it and other people in the Labor Party and those who support our position will not cop it, either. </PARA>
<PARA>  Those on the other side intend to destroy the very fabric of the system of support that we have built up over many decades--built up also by the Menzies and the Frasers, who saw a need and tried to do something about it. They intend to destroy Austudy--fancy throwing out the concept of Austudy--and privatise university education so the rich get the best places. That is an abhorrent proposal, but it is part of the proposition being put forward by the Liberals and Nationals. </PARA>

He will see what his own spokesmen have said about Austudy. Let me go on. I mentioned the retirement tax. They want to destroy superannuation. With the plight that this country is in at the moment, for every person who is elderly and on a pension there are five people out there in the work force. Within 30 years, for every person who is on a pension there will be only two in the work force. We have to build now for a retirement system. The Opposition wants to cast aside and destroy everything we have done to bring about a superannuation system that is universal. It is amazing that, when we realise the importance of building up a national savings account and of pooling that money so people need not borrow from overseas but can borrow in Australia, so they can start to plan and save for their own retirement, those on the other side want to destroy it. Why? They have not explained why. They are simply saying no, no, no; they will have some other sort of system. Then there is the goods and services tax. If ever there was an attack on people who really cannot afford it--those people who are on low incomes, the superannuants, the charities--it is the GST.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I will take up that point. I have only 30 seconds left, but let me take one example: the charities. At the moment the charities have tax exemption under the wholesale sales tax system. Under the Opposition's proposal they will pay tax on everything and, not only that, they will not be able to recover that tax, because it is really a VAT. Ultimately, the system is that the business person adds it to his price and sells it and gets the money back; but charities do not sell it, they give it away. If ever those opposite are going to hurt anybody, they are going to hurt hundreds of thousands of people out there who are directly helped by charities, and they are also going to hurt the charities themselves.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The forerunner of the family allowance and the family allowance supplement, child endowment, came from the enlightened social laboratory that was Australia in the first decades after Federation. Child endowment and its successors are the only recognition of women's work in the home, the value of which has been estimated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics at between $142 billion and $154 billion in the production of gross domestic product, if we also take into account women's voluntary work. One of the early advocates of child endowment, A.B. Piddington, said in 1921:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . a strict and even-handed canon of plain justice will recognise that the children of those engaged in industry have a right to maintenance from industry and that the mother who rears children for the future of industry and the State has a right to receive the only wage she ever asks--enough to enable her as society's trustee for nurture and education to discharge the duties of her trust. </PARA>
<PARA>Child endowment from the start was a radical proposal to transfer income to the mothers of dependent children, so severing the connection between wage fixation and family size and allowing adult male wage rates to be based on the needs of a married couple or a single man. Child endowment was also envisaged by its advocates as preparing the ground for equal pay for women by removing the problem of men's family responsibilities having to be allowed for in the wage. In fact, as a survey of women in manufacturing in 1928 found, 30 per cent of women were either helping to keep or keeping other family members. Child endowment acknowledged the separate rights of women and children to their own independent source of income. </PARA>
<PARA>  A limited version of child endowment was first introduced for Commonwealth public servants in 1920 and later in New South Wales in 1927. While initially opposed by Labor governments, its value was recognised during the Great Depression. When unemployment was 33 per cent in 1932, the regular fortnightly payments to mothers meant sustenance for the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA>  National child endowment passed into law during the Second World War when it was introduced in 1941 to ensure that children were kept in stout boots and had food in their stomachs, despite the climate of austerity. It provided endowment direct to the mother at a flat rate of five shillings per week for each child other than the first child under the age of 16 years. This was at a time when the average wage in Australia was around #4 per week. </PARA>
<PARA>  Labor leader John Curtin, speaking for the Bill introduced by the Menzies United Australia-Country Party coalition, said:</PARA>
<PARA>  With this Bill we are, for the first time in the history of this country--except for the Maternity Allowance Act--writing into the statute book our realization of the national significance of family life. This is not a platitude--that means something. There never has been any doubt of the value of the services, infinite in variety and extent, which the family renders to the nation. Primarily, it is the source of national continuance; it has supplied the human material indispensable for the production of the means of subsistence; it provides for the replacement of the old and the dead, and is the sole guarantee for the redemption, in the future, of those obligations which previous and present generations have found it desirable to incur in order to enjoy the fullest obtainable measures of security, comfort and civilization. </PARA>
<PARA>Curtin said that there was:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . no device which can be regarded as an adequate substitute for actual cash in the mother's hands, for she, better than any agent of the state, is able to use what resources are available to the best advantage of the children. </PARA>
<PARA>At the time there were, of course, conservative critics who regarded child endowment as a subversion of men's role as family provider. What child endowment recognised pragmatically was that men were sometimes prone to drink away the household money or, even if wealthy, to retain that by keeping their purses closed, even to their own families. </PARA>
<PARA>  Later Commonwealth child endowment legislation in 1966 was commended in terms acknowledging the importance of the payment to women. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA>We realized the enormous difference it would make to mothers, not only to have it paid to them. For many mothers this was the only money that they were entitled to in their own right and it gave them the first taste of economic independence. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, the main complaint raised with the Department of Social Security, as reported in the 1960s, was husbands' objections to their wives receiving and having money. In 1941 John Curtin applauded the principle enshrined in national child endowment that there be no means test. He said, and his words are worth remembering today:</PARA>
<PARA>This nation consists of not only physical but also human values. For too long we have failed to appreciate that human values have a paramount claim upon us, and indeed are more important economically than material ones. </PARA>
<PARA>Curtin's words were echoed by those of Harold Holt in introducing the Bill. Holt said:</PARA>
<PARA>Child endowment can be rightly considered as a profitable national investment. A free enterprise economy such as ours provides inadequate incentive for investment in persons as compared with things. This is because it is rarely possible for people who make investment in persons to profit from it. For this reason governments subsidize education. For this reason also the investment of the Commonwealth Government can be expected to make a high return in human happiness. </PARA>
<PARA>Over the years child endowment has been broadened to include the first child and children up to the age of 25 if still dependent students. Child endowment payments were at their peak value in 1950 when they represented 11 per cent of the basic wage and 7 per cent of average weekly earnings. In 1980 the value of family allowances for two children represented only 4 per cent of average earnings; for four children, the value of allowances was 9 per cent of average earnings. </PARA>
<PARA>  Thus, until the advent of this Labor Government, a government of quite another complexion to that of John Curtin, child endowment was a universal payment to families that acknowledged the cost of families. The cost is high. It is estimated that the first year of a child's life costs around $9,000; disposable nappies alone cost between $600 and $1,000 a year; and infant formula costs $1,000. Teenagers cost the most, estimated at around $10,400 a year. Assuming that a mother loses $24,000 in annual salary, a household suffers a loss after having a child of some $35,000 a year. A 1988 study by the Australian National University estimated that the average woman lost $336,000 in earnings after having a child. Second and third children added further losses of $50,000 and $35,000. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Hawke Government began to income test the family allowance in 1987, so turning what had been accepted as a universal payment in recognition of the costs of children into a social welfare benefit. In eight years of government the Hawke Government has disqualified 10 per cent of families from receiving the family allowance and its value is now only two-thirds of what it was in 1976. The current threshold of $62,057 for one child and an additional $3,104 for each further child is not princely if one considers the effect of high interest rates on home mortgages and small businesses throughout the 1980s. Small businesses still pay 24 per cent interest. High interest rates were the policy of this Labor Government, not of some natural disaster, something which the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright) in speaking before me conveniently failed to mention when lauding the Government's tax policy. </PARA>
<PARA>  I know, for example, of one doctor who supports a wife and three children. With a salary of around $70,000 he misses out on the family allowance but has to wear the punishing costs of working and living in Sydney. He has downgraded his home to find a home with a backyard to accommodate the romping of three small boys. His wife is unable to work because of the need to care for the children. Outside care of three children simply is not affordable, even if desirable. The family now has no car and the doctor walks to work at the hospital which is nearby. He says he cannot even think of putting up the $5,000 for a second-hand car. There are too many day to day expenses on top of the Sydney mortgage. </PARA>
<PARA>  Taking another example, $62,000 is only two very ordinary salaries combined. Because of the hike in mortgage interest rates, hundreds of thousands of women have had to go back into the work force to help meet the mortgage repayments. This has been seen against the background of an enormous increase in  the amount of income tax collected from ordinary Australians on very average salaries because of income bracket creep, which the honourable member for Capricornia also conveniently neglected to mention. Inflation puts them into even higher tax brackets. </PARA>
<PARA>  Total taxation on individuals has more than doubled under this Labor Government, rising from $23 billion in 1982-83 to almost $51 billion in 1989-90. Inflation and wage restraint have meant that the real value of the average wage has fallen by as much as 10 per cent. Striking directly at people's purse strings in the shops and supermarkets, the wholesale sales tax, first introduced by the Scullin Government in 1930, has trebled in the eight years of this bankrupt Government--from $3.5 billion to $10.7 billion this year--as more and more items, including food and beverages such as orange juice, flavoured milk, ice-cream, biscuits and snack foods, have been quietly added to the list. Withdrawal of family allowance may be the last nail in the coffin for many Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA>  To these trials this Government adds yet another. It now proposes to introduce an assets test on the family allowance from 1 January 1991, which sets a limit of $600,000 in assets, apart from the family home. The assets test which already exists on the family allowance supplement, and which targets Australia's lowest income earners, is to be further tightened, making it impossible for a family to shift ownership of assets into the name of any other family member in order to be eligible for the benefits. The assets limit is $347,500, apart from the family home. </PARA>
<PARA>  The family allowance supplement applies to only about 7 per cent of Australian families. The threshold for this is to be grandly increased from $18,000 to $19,300 from 1 April 1992. Further, families with limited cash funds may continue to receive either if they fulfil certain hardship provisions. These provisions are draconian. People must have an income of no more than $13,078, the maximum pension rate for a couple, and they must have income amounting to not more than $624 per child receiving family allowance. They also have to satisfy the Department of Social Security that their estimate of income is correct. On top of this, a couple must have less than $10,000 in liquid assets and a single person must have less than $6,000. This clearly discriminates against both small businesses and farmers. </PARA>
<PARA>  Between 50 and 75 per cent of farmers have incomes of over $13,000 and more than 50 per cent have capital investment in their farms of over $600,000. For many farming families the family allowance has been the difference between being able to afford to buy groceries or not. It is more difficult to pinpoint the effect on small business operators because of the dearth of statistics available. But what we do know is that the assets test is more likely to affect small manufacturers, who make up 97 per cent of some 37,600 manufacturing businesses Australia-wide. </PARA>
<PARA>  Almost 54 per cent of the population live in households consisting of parents and children. Children are our future. Families cannot be expected to manage completely on their own. By eroding the support given to families, except those in the most depressed sector, the Government removes from women the choice of being able to afford to stay at home to raise young children. Many families are now making great sacrifices to allow one parent to stay at home with the children. They need all the help they can get. So too do those parents who have to work to support their children. </PARA>
<PARA>  The virtue of the family allowance was that it did not distinguish between either group. The lack of support for ordinary Australian families creates horizontal inequity between those who have children and those in the same income tax bracket who do not. Under this Government, people have been effectively penalised for having children. We can claim a tax deduction for an overseas trip, yet we can claim nothing for the enormous expenses of raising children. Why do we rate children so lowly? The sole parent rebate and the dependent spouse rebate are not income tested. We can take out superannuation and, no matter what our income, get a tax deduction. Why should it be different for children?</PARA>
<PARA>  Then there is the recognition of child endowment--and, later, family allowance--being made to women in their own right. Women are ill served by the Government's flight to superannuation. Tax rebates and deductions do not go directly to women and so cease to give women, particularly those working in the home, some small moiety of what they deserve for their efforts in building the economy. We must remember that economic systems should accommodate people; people should not accommodate mechanistic economic systems, which should only exist to facilitate the greatest human happiness. </PARA>
<PARA>  John Curtin, the man whom the current Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) pretends to eulogise, speaking of the child endowment legislation in 1941, said:</PARA>
<PARA>To the degree that this merging of each individual in the fate of the nation has been forced upon us by the state of the world, and to the degree that that brings us nearer to each other than has hitherto been the case, I hope that that approximation, between Opposition and Ministers. . . shall in this country, give to the children who are now being born, and the youth and mothers of Australia, the assurance that their needs at any rate shall be placed beyond the hazards of political controversy, and that no future government will deal with this legislation which we are now passing except to widen and improve it. We shall not retrace this step; no economic burden which this scheme imposes shall be regarded as insuperable. If economic trouble in the immediate future, or in years to come, should involve something being dispensed with, then there are a number of other economies which this country can afford to make with greater regard for the welfare of our citizens than any economy at the expense of legislation of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA>Instead, the Hawke Labor Government has reduced the extent of the application of family allowance and whittled away its substance. By 1993 it is to be further limited by being subsumed into the family allowance supplement. </PARA>
<PARA>  Curtin's sentiments were noble and honest, but this Labor Government has given the lie to them. We need to help Australian families now. The Labor Government has failed for eight years and it fails again today. Only when the coalition taxation package is announced shortly will average Australian families find a package that supports them. In the meantime, I am reminded of a lampoon of the old chivalry towards women and children. A cartoon depicts women and children standing on the edge of a cliff. Someone calls out, `Women and children first'. That is the pass to which we have come in this country under the Labor Government. </PARA>

The honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) has attacked the removal of universality of the family allowance on the ground that about 10 per cent of people are unable to get it. Do people who are on $60,000 a year really need the family allowance?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Let us look at what has happened with the introduction of the family allowance supplement. In studies that were done well before the Hawke Government came into office, families with children were found to be among the poorest in the Australian community. At the moment, farming families are the poorest; they are the ones who need assistance. Instead of just a few dollars a week, these people are receiving up to $53 a week for a child. It is better to take the family allowance away from those who are on higher incomes--people with children do not need the family allowance if they earn $60,000 or more a year--rather than to take it away from people on very low incomes. </PARA>
<PARA>   This is what happened: the poorer families with children got the benefit of the family allowance supplement. We got children out of the rut of subsistence feeding. I can remember when I was working in the community some 15 years ago visiting a family that was on a very low income and the children were eating bread and butter for their evening meal. Through the policies that have been introduced, we are getting them out of the rut of subsistence feeding, low achievement and early departure from school. </PARA>
<PARA>   Families have been helped. John Curtin would have supported our policies, because in his day, when there was universality of family allowance, most people needed it. Today, there is a certain section of the community which needs help to get out of that rut of subsistence. It needs help to get out of the rut, and it is now being provided. I applaud the policies. Like you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I was involved in the development of those policies. They have been successful. </PARA>
<PARA>   We have helped the youth. Things have changed for young people. I can remember when young people were put out of their family home quite often, and I can recall when the Liberal-National Party Opposition in New South Wales was attacking the fact that young people were being supported when they left home, but they were not really looking into the reasons why young people were leaving home. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is interesting that when the present Minister for Family and Community Services, Virginia Chadwick, became Minister she quickly realised that quite often when children left home it was because they were being abused, or it was because they were finding life extremely difficult in the home. They have to be catered for occasionally with accommodation.  Just over the boarder from here in Queanbeyan, 21 young people were under bridges and on seats in parks in the middle of the cold winter that we members know about. That was intolerable. We have to get away from it. Now there is a youth refuge in Queanbeyan. Accommodation is being provided. Things have changed. </PARA>
<PARA>   We have helped the ageing. We have developed on the reports that were made by the present Speaker and others on his committee so that we have got away from just institutionalising the retired, the older people. We have found that under the home and community care program we can actually keep them in their own homes longer if they want to stay there. There is plenty to do, plenty to improve on, but at least it is starting to happen. </PARA>
<PARA>   Then there is the unemployed. What have we done for these people? I guess it has been harsh in some ways, but it has also been kind in others. Unemployed people, the jobless, are now finding that that is the case. Unlike the Opposition's policy which is to abolish unemployment benefits after nine months and say to them all, `You look after yourself from now on', we are balancing the taxpayers' desire to see their money efficiently spent by helping with the needs of the jobless. Through programs like Newstart, Job Search and Jobstart, we are able to get people back into work to a much greater extent than we were in the past. We are balancing the desire of the taxpayers with the needs of the jobless. Taxpayers said to us, `We are not happy with the way benefits are just being paid to someone. They are left on the dole and nothing happens'. So, from 1 July, the concept of the dole was abolished. A person cannot get the dole any more. Now he can go and get an allowance from the Commonwealth Employment Service and, after a year, maybe earlier, the Commonwealth Employment Service asks the recipient to come into one of its offices and come to an agreement with the Service. </PARA>
<PARA>  Just recently I visited the Commonwealth Employment Service offices in Cooma, Queanbeyan and Batemans Bay. In each case I found that the people who were on Newstart were delighted with the fact that someone had taken the time to bring them into the office and actually go through a list of suggestions with them so that they could present themselves better for work and take a job if it is offered. Now the allowance is given under different arrangements. It gives the people more dignity, but also it says to the taxpayer, `Yes, we are spending your money properly. If a person refuses to cooperate, refuses to present himself properly, refuses to take a job when it is offered, then he is not entitled to the allowance'. But we do not see people starve. We help them, we make suggestions and we have an agreement with them. The concept of the dole is gone. </PARA>
<PARA>   Then there is the disabled. Just a few weeks ago in this Parliament we were debating legislation relating to the disabled. What was the suggestion of the Opposition? It moved an amendment suggesting that we are not really going to help the disabled unless we introduce a goods and services tax. Has anyone ever seen anything more insulting? Most disabled people are on relatively low incomes. They will be the people who will be hurt by a goods and services tax. The goods and services tax is going to give them a tax where there has not been one before. If they have not been on a very high tax, they will be paying more with a goods and services tax. Everything--things such as food, bread, milk and clothing--will be taxed under the goods and services tax. The last thing the disabled would want is the acceptance of the Opposition's amendment for a goods and services tax to help the disabled. It certainly would not help the disabled. </PARA>
<PARA>   Of course, the goods and services tax is being introduced by the Opposition as a proposal which will help everyone. The Opposition even introduces it, as I said, when we are talking about people who are poor, people who are on low incomes. I ask the Opposition: What about the disabled? It should think about the disabled when it is actually formulating its policy on a goods and services tax. What about people on low superannuation, people who are not on a pension, but who are receiving superannuation? What about people in the country? A small country store might charge, say, 60c or 70c more for an item than, say, a supermarket in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart or even Darwin. They may charge a little more. Every time that person pays an extra 60c or 70c in the country, he is paying a goods and services tax on the extra 60c and 70c; he is paying more. </PARA>
<PARA>  The goods and services tax is going to be a day of reckoning for the National Party. The National Party ought to be considering just where its alliances should be, because we are going to reach the situation in Australia, I believe, where it is going to be forced by its constituency to think about where its alliances are and whether it really should be aligned with the economic rationalists on the other side who really are not interested in anything but user pays. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition's goods and services tax will hurt everybody. Of course, it says that it will be adjusting pensions to cater for the tax. If we recall what happened under the Fraser Government when CPI increases were refused to pensioners, we cannot be all that sure that pensioners will get that sort of adjustment. To talk about introducing a goods and services tax when it will cost three times as much to collect the same amount as is being collected by the wholesale sales tax at the moment seems to me to be pointless, from an economic as well as a social justice point of view. </PARA>
<PARA>   The honourable member for Menzies called this Government bankrupt. He has called it bankrupt when it is having its first deficit in years. Unlike any Howard Budget when Dr Hewson was there assisting the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) as Treasurer, this Government has been many years in the black. Now we can afford a deficit. We need to have a deficit because we need to make a calculated decision to protect the less fortunate who have been hurt by a range of problems. These are not only the recession because of over $6 billion less coming into Australia for the sales of our commodities overseas--and this spreads to all our industries--but also because of problems like drought and the recession that has crept into the country and crept through the cities. So we have to protect the less fortunate, not least those who are in country areas. It is fortunate that we are having a deficit. I certainly do not accept the Opposition's proposal that we should go back into the black in this time of difficulty. Australia is a country which has great resources and can afford to have a deficit. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course there are things that we need to do. We need to look again at the family allowance supplement and the fringe benefits tax that is paid by pensioners. I would say to the Government that we should be considering allowing fringe benefits to apply to all people who are on a pension, even a part pension. I include the fringe benefits that come from local government and State government. This will involve, of course, discussions between the State and Federal governments, because travel, rates and telephone charges can all be involved in the provision of fringe benefits, as can pharmaceutical benefits. It is important that we discuss the ramifications with the States and with local government representatives; perhaps the Federal Government could come up with payments to improve the accessibility of fringe benefits to people who are on even part pensions. </PARA>
<PARA>  Opposition backbenchers, including the honourable member for Menzies have come into this Parliament trying to paint the Liberal and National parties as compassionate parties. The people of Australia will not wear it. When the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) was attacking the Australian Council of Social Service, he could not have been attacking the administration of ACOSS, because that is a skeleton staff, and he could not have been attacking the constituent organisations--the Salvation Army, St Vincent de Paul, the Brotherhood of St Laurence and others--because they have very small, skeleton staffs. </PARA>
<PARA>  Mr Deputy Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition was really attacking the people on your street and mine--the people who work for the community, for those who are in need: the Salvation Army, the St Vincent de Paul Society, the Smith Family, family support organisations, a wide range of organisations supporting Aboriginal people and a wider range of organisations supporting women and migrants. </PARA>
<PARA>  These are the people he was attacking and accusing of empire building. If they were responsible for 1 per cent of the empire building that occurs on both sides of this House, I could understand it. This is the sort of place where empire building is happening--not the social service organisations. To tell those organisations that they are empire building is an absolute disgrace. How can any honourable member of parliament go into an organisation of that kind and accuse its members of empire building when it is giving wonderful service throughout our community. Just because those organisations are getting together and becoming a political force in this community is no reason to accuse them of empire building. </PARA>
<PARA>  This legislation makes some constructive proposals for sole parents, which were outlined by the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright). Those proposals are for Job Search allowance, sickness allowances, adjustment for child disability allowance of $2.15 and provision to allow 13 weeks from date of birth to claim various types of allowances. They also include the establishment of a hardship test to protect families with assets above the family allowance and the family allowance supplement thresholds where they are producing very low income. This was done through Government members, a very high proportion of whom are from country areas. We made sure that country people were assisted as far as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>  In addition, the income threshold at which full family allowance supplements are payable will be aligned with the Austudy threshold, another very important measure. There will also be modification of the assets test to allow primary producers to deduct liabilities which relate to the carrying on of primary production from the value of assets used in that production, which is to commence on 1 January, and modification of the rules for assessing notional ordinary income within the hardship provisions, so that owners of residential premises that are occupied by family members in certain situations will not be penalised because the premises do not attract commercial rates of rent. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is extremely important that we acknowledge that these measures are being taken. In relation to rent assistance, the waiting period for recipients of allowances will be reduced from 26 weeks to 18 weeks; that will commence on 20 March 1992. There are also a number of changes to the disability reform package. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is extremely important that we make the point that, whatever happens, whatever the proposals, whatever Opposition backbenchers say in this debate, the evidence is there in the attitudes of their leaders: they believe in making everyone pay; they do not believe in relieving people's problems; and they certainly do not support the Government's concept of assisting those in need so that they can achieve better things as they grow older. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I address a question to the Minister for Transport and Communications. Is it a fact that Mr Peter Barron, former adviser to the Prime Minister and now assistant to Mr Packer, has been active in promoting to Ministers the formula for media ownership accepted by the Cabinet at a 3 a.m. meeting on Tuesday on the basis of a two-paragraph note? Is this yet another example of the Labor network doing deals to the benefit of its mates?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Everybody who has been associated one way or another with the various bids for the takeover of the Fairfax group has been active in lobbying Ministers and members of the Caucus for the last three months. Whether or not they take any notice of the particular propositions that are put to them is, of course, another matter. So the implication in the honourable member's question is simply sheer nonsense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Ministers arrived at that decision on their own calculation of what was in the national interest. There seems to be an extraordinary misinterpretation of the nature of that particular Cabinet proposition. I suppose that is implicit in the question that was asked. There is the misinterpretation that, somehow or other, foreign ownership principles have been abandoned in the direction of a more restrictive posture. In fact, it is the other way around: quite liberal foreign ownership provisions have been abandoned to move to a more restrictive posture.</PARA>
<PARA>  There are two elements to that decision that was taken by the Ministry and ultimately by Caucus. One was that it set the level of voting equity that might be owned by anyone in this particular race at 20 per cent. It is feasible, under the Foreign Investment Review Board rules, to go to 40 per cent--that is, if the Treasurer chooses to follow the suggestions made to him by Caucus when this matter eventually comes before him from the Foreign Investment Review Board--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-We know what the Opposition's policy is on this matter, but one would be confused by its questions, because its position on foreign ownership is to have the maximum possible flexibility in the rules.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The second element--which has been totally ignored in any of the public commentary on the matter to this point--is that, overall, a direction was given to the Treasurer that, whatever particular set of recommendations were put to him by the FIRB, he should not permit a situation to emerge in which there was foreign control of the Fairfax group. Again, that is a more restrictive position than the one that would be permitted under the normal interpretation of the FIRB rules. I would have thought that that would give the answer to the sorts of statements around the place at the moment suggesting that this `via a quasi-equity' process could amount to foreign control.</PARA>
<PARA>  The simple fact of the matter is, as has been pointed out by speakers on the Opposition side, that ultimately the issues of the level of voting equity, the treatment of quasi-equity and the particular set of management arrangements that will be acceptable--all of that--will ultimately come from the receiver, if required, to the FIRB and, from that process, to the Treasurer. The Treasurer will, at that point, consult his Cabinet colleagues and the Caucus and make his own views known to them on what constitutes the national interest in this case; but, presumably, he will stay within the bounds of what was put forward by the Caucus--which is for a more restrictive position on the issue of foreign ownership than that which currently exists.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2024" SPEAKER="Baldwin The Hon P.J." NAMEID="MD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SYDNEY" MINISTERIAL="HIGHER EDUCATION AND EMPLOYMENT SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr BALDWIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-There have been some reports in the media in the last couple of days from some of those involved in organising a so-called national day of action about the situation in higher education. Some of those reports have included the claim that the Commonwealth's funding for higher education has been cut. That is an obviously untrue proposition. I will give honourable members the actual figures. Since this Government came to office, the real level of higher education funding has increased every year. It went up by 33.4 per cent in real terms between 1983 and 1991, and up by 22.4 per cent between 1987 and 1991. Of course, this accompanied large increases in student intakes, of planned load, which is up by 101,000 effective full time student units between 1983 and 1991 and by 56,600 EFTSU between 1987 and 1991.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It is true that, for a period, growth in student numbers outstripped the total level of funding, leading to some decline in the level of funds per effective full time student unit. The Government acknowledged this problem and has put in train a number of decisions designed to correct that situation. Going back to 1987, when things really reached their trough, and looking at planned loads since 1987, we see that funding per EFTSU has risen by 2.7 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>  More significantly, I would like to draw the attention of the House to the set of decisions taken by the Government in the last three months to address the situation in higher education and to ensure that we get not only a large higher education system providing opportunities for a very large number of potential students but also one which provides a quality education. On 24 July I announced that the Government would provide full supplementation to enable substantial increases in academic salaries--of the order of 16 per cent on average, rising to 20 per cent over time. The cost of that measure alone is some $119m in this financial year, and over the coming five-year period the total cost will be $900m. That is a very substantial injection which should go a long way towards remedying the concerns about academic salaries.</PARA>
<PARA>  In the Budget, the Government announced major new decisions over and above the normal rolling triennial arrangements. As honourable members would be aware, the Government provides funding for higher education on a rolling triennial basis. Under normal circumstances the funding for the 1992 and 1993 calendar years would at this point be finalised; but, in recognition of the rapid growth in unmet demand and the overenrolment problem, the Government decided to substantially accelerate the capital program as well as providing additional recurrent funds. The cost of those decisions amounted to $76m in 1992. If we combine that with the academic salaries decision, we are looking at a net injection of some $200m.</PARA>
<PARA>  On 4 October I announced a range of new measures giving institutions increased flexibility in order to respond to this year's overenrolment and overcrowding problem, and I might say that all sectors of the higher education community have welcomed the new measures that I announced to deal with that overcrowding problem. Whether we are talking about the vice-chancellors, the students or the academic staff, they have all unanimously welcomed the decisions that I announced on that occasion.</PARA>
<PARA>  In a policy statement on quality and diversity which I made last week, I announced an additional $169m for 1994--$70m for quality assurance and enhancement, $41m for further growth, and $58m in additional capital funding. That brings total capital funding for 1994 to $270m, which is getting to a pretty high level historically. Overall, in the course of the 1992-94 triennium, we are committing $12 billion to higher education, which takes us above the 1 per cent of GDP benchmark which the AVCC, among others, has set.</PARA>
<PARA>  On the funding per student, which has been the focus of a lot of comment, I might also point out that the total net effect of the combination of those three decisions which I announced in the last three months--this massive funding injection--is a further 4.6 per cent increase in real dollars per EFTSU up to 1994. I notice that Di Zetlin from FAUSA has been calling for real funding per student to be restored to the 1990 level. We are going significantly beyond that, particularly if one takes account of the totality of funding, not just operating resources but also capital and--</PARA>

In reality, of course, there would be a substantial real decline because when the goods and services tax of those opposite came into force it would effectively bring about a $200m to $300m real decline in higher education funding, without taking into account what it would do to the student body and student income support. It would be a catastrophe, and the Chairman of the Vice-Chancellors Committee has denounced the Opposition's policies in very clear terms.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am sure the House will be relieved to hear that this is going to be a mercifully brief answer. The point is that there have been some reports today about some proposals that the Commonwealth has put to the States in relation to the range of issues concerning employment, education and training. I think we put them forward in the context of the Special Premiers Conference and the process which is designed to look at how we, as a country, might best address the major issues that confront us without being constrained by traditional approaches to particular areas of responsibility which might have been occupied by either the Commonwealth Government or State governments. The great problem that we are trying to contend with in this issue is that there are 400,000 young Australians between the ages of 15 and 19 who are entering the work force with no post-school qualifications.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  One of the issues we want to address is that we need to have something like an additional 100,000 places provided in the vocational skills area if we are going to do something about not only enhancing the opportunities of those young Australians but also equipping Australian industry with the skills which it needs now and in the future. I hope that the States will approach this offer--which I think is a very generous offer, an offer which is made in the spirit of the new cooperative approach between the Commonwealth and the States--not by trying to descend into Commonwealth-State rivalries but rather by seeing whether this is the best way of trying to address a very important policy issue.</PARA>
<PARA>  I make the point, as my colleague has just done, that there has been enormous expansion in the higher education system with something like 200,000 places since this Government has been in office either being put in place or planned and paid for, whereas in the TAFE area there has actually been a decline. That is the issue which we have got to contend with and that is the context in which the Commonwealth's offer has been made.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I thank the honourable member for his further question, which relates generally to the question of the media and the Fairfax bid. At the moment the Fairfax situation is essentially a question for the receiver. The receiver has to make a decision. In the first instance it is a question that has to be resolved at that level. Notwithstanding the changes that are currently occurring within particular interests, the fact of the matter is that any proposal needs to be examined by the Foreign Investment Review Board on national interest grounds. The Treasurer will then take a decision following the consideration of the Foreign Investment Review Board. There are, of course, questions of complying with the relevant legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>  That type of analysis is totally invalid because since 1983-84 and 1985 there has been a major transformation of the income tax system. As the honourable member for Dobell mentioned in his question, a vast number of steps have been taken both in the area of base broadening, that is, to bring to account for income tax purposes income that was previously exempt from tax, and in eliminating tax evasion directly bearing on the black economy. Consequently, the tax system today contains far less tax avoidance and evasion than prevailed pre-1985.</PARA>
<PARA>  I will quickly remind the House of the kinds of steps that have been taken since 1985: the introduction of the capital gains tax, which will raise about $700m this year, opposed by the Opposition; the fringe benefits tax, which will raise about $1,300m this year, opposed by the Opposition; the resource rent tax, which will raise about $735m this year, opposed by the Opposition; the abolition of the deduction of entertainment expenses, an estimated $300m this year, opposed by the Opposition; reform of the taxation treatment of foreign income; improved substantiation; total reform of the system of prescribed payments, which we introduced in 1983 and have completely revised to make it bear more directly and more effectively on this area of the black economy; the introduction of the tax file number, again related directly to the black economy; the establishment of the Cash Transaction Reports Agency, very clearly aimed at the black economy; and increased activity in auditing by the Australian Taxation Office, again focusing on areas where there is suspicion of substantial amounts of unreported income.</PARA>
<PARA>  In other words, through all of these measures since 1985 there has been a very substantial amount of change to the tax system. It is a vastly reformed system with a much broader base for income tax purposes and it more effectively focuses on areas which previously were able to escape taxation through tax evasion. It is ridiculous to say that we will update some study done in 1983-84 or 1984-85 and come to some assessment as to what the black economy is today, ignoring all the things that have been done since then.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition is about beating up the black economy to create a magic pudding, a source of additional revenue that it can claim will be brought to account through the introduction of a GST. It is very much aware that a GST will be inherently very unpopular. I understand that in Canada it is known as the gouge and screw tax. To sweeten up this gouge and screw tax measure, the Opposition is trying to maximise offsetting tax cuts by pretending that it will be able to tap some vast fiscal dividend by applying the GST to the black economy. This is clearly a nonsense. The fiscal dividend which was referred to in 1985 came mostly from the areas that have since been attacked by the base broadening measures; that is, it is already subject to tax.</PARA>

<PARA>  At the same tax seminar, where the Deputy Leader of the Opposition was lambasting the Australian people as tax cheats and beating up his claims about the amount of untaxed income in Australia and saying that GST was the answer to that, there was evidence given that the GST was not going to be the solution to providing this magic pudding. The Courier-Mail of 17 September, having reported the honourable member for Flinders in the terms that I have mentioned, stated:</PARA>
<PARA>  His insistence on this came despite warnings from New Zealand and Canadian consumption tax experts that such a tax in their countries had not resulted in windfall revenue from the black economies.</PARA>
<PARA>  The New Zealand and Canadian taxes had not caught a significant number of people who avoided the taxman by dealing in cash.</PARA>
<PARA>  This analysis was put by Sir Roger Douglas, the former rationalist New Zealand Treasurer who introduced a consumption tax there and by Mr Ian Bennett, one of Canada's senior finance bureaucrats who planned the consumption tax there.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I thank the honourable member for Perth for his question. It gives me the opportunity to look at this issue in perspective for a slightly longer time than is usually possible in the hurly-burly of this place. We can say with confidence that there is now evidence that the obvious growth in manufacturing exports in this country is not a temporary by-product of the recession, as has sometimes been alleged, but is now a permanent feature of a changed Australian economy. A recent analysis undertaken by Treasury shows strong and durable growth in manufactured exports throughout the last six years. All the evidence therefore points to a structural change having taken place in Australia's pattern of trade rather than simply temporary or cyclical factors. I want to look at the evidence for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Firstly, over the last six years there has been very strong growth in elaborately transformed manufactured exports, which has accelerated in the last three years. The result of that is that in 1989-90--the last year for which we have complete trade statistics--$7.63 billion came from elaborately transformed manufactured exports. In one standard method of categorisation, that makes them the chief source of export values in that year. When we add to those elaborately transformed manufactures simply transformed manufactures, such as iron, steel and aluminium, we get a total for 1989-90 of $12.3 billion in those exports, which is 21 per cent of total exports of goods and services. The evidence for last year, 1990-91--we have only the first three quarters--shows that those manufactured exports are up some 20 per cent over the first three quarters of that financial year.</PARA>
<PARA>  Not only have we had this strong and durable growth, but we have also had a very significant shift in the markets to which those manufactured exports are going. Since 1983-84, the market for Australian manufactured exports has increasingly shifted towards the Asia-Pacific region. In 1983-84, the European Community was the dominant place to which those exports went. It has now been surpassed by Japan, which is our largest single market, at least for simply transformed manufactures. The rest of north-east Asia comes in second, with the European Community now in third place. In relation to exports of simply transformed manufactures, those to the ASEAN region have increased by 180 per cent in the last six years.</PARA>
<PARA>  If we look at the figures internationally, we see that between 1985 and 1989, Australia's manufacturing export volumes grew by 79 per cent, and this compares with a 31 per cent growth in the rest of the OECD. Indeed, if we look at ourselves in relation to the G7 nations, we see that only the United States has had a bigger growth than Australia in manufactured exports over that period.</PARA>

Firstly, contrary to popular myth, Australia's manufacturing sector has steadily increased in both output and exports since 1983-84 and, secondly, an increasing and significant proportion of these manufacturing exports is going to north-east and South East Asia, and despite the difficulties that the manufacturing industry has faced in the recession period, in general this sector has responded vigorously to the challenge of becoming more internationally competitive. Let me say that no single trend is more significant for the transformation of our trading performance and for our growing international competitiveness than that particular trend.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-What the honourable member is now dealing with front and centre is the Broadcasting Act. Let me just explain one or two things to him because I am amazed by the extent to which there is, in general commentaries in this place, a lack of understanding of the operations of the Broadcasting Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Broadcasting Act means this:  if the Tourang bid were to establish what the honourable member has described as an unacceptable concentration of media ownership, it would do so only in one circumstance. That would be the circumstance in which the investment by Mr Packer in it is something more than simply an investment vehicle. If it were, via the process of the Tourang bid, an instrument for his control or influence over the operations of the Fairfax group, it would be manifestly in breach of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal's rules on the subject of cross-media ownership.</PARA>
<PARA>  What tends to be not well understood in the debate to this point is that there are two elements in the cross-media propositions under the broadcasting rules. One is permission to people who have newspapers or people who have television stations to invest in the other operation to the tune of less than 15 per cent. That is one element. The second element is that no person who has so invested, be it to the extent of 2, 3, 4 or 14.9 per cent, and who has, via that process, a capacity to influence or control, will be permitted to do so. If he does so, he will find himself in breach of the Broadcasting Act and therefore will be obliged to divest.</PARA>
<PARA>  I might say that there are some remarkable inconsistencies in the Opposition on this question. When this was debated in the House the other day, for example, the right honourable member for New England put the question to the Government on precisely this point, in which he opposed the changes that we were making to the Broadcasting Act and are before the Senate. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I strongly put it to the House that it would be far better for us to defer this legislation. In that climate, each of the bidders can put in their bids before the event. They can take note of the fact that there is a debate in the Labor Caucus and that the Parliament will be dealing with legislation, although they will not know what it will be.</PARA>
<PARA>He was following some of the views expressed by the Opposition spokesman when he said that. He also had one or two other things to say. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I happen to be a person who is against cross-media ownership restraints.</PARA>
<PARA>He further said:</PARA>
<PARA>It does not really matter whether caucus says it is an arbitrary 20 per cent and how the 20 per cent is defined and whether it is equity or non-equity or quasi-equity. It is essentially a matter which the FIRB and the Treasury look at in relation to what they see as being in the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA>So the Opposition position on this sort of thing seems to change on almost an hourly basis, if not a daily basis.</PARA>
<PARA>  I might say that I am pleased because it seems that, as a result of discussions we had in Question Time here yesterday, the legislation that has been put up to the Senate is now not going to be deferred but is going to start through the committee process on Wednesday afternoon. The mere introduction of that Bill by the Government a couple of weeks ago has clearly had a very substantial impact on the way in which Fairfax bidders have approached the position that they might find themselves in under the Broadcasting Act.</PARA>

<PARA>  So the point is this:  if a bid by Tourang were to produce a situation in which an owner of television stations, irrespective of the level of his investment in the vehicle, was in a position to control and influence the operation of the Fairfax group, it would be ultra vires the Broadcasting Act. It will be much easier for us to see that situation properly reviewed by the Broadcasting Tribunal if the Bill that we have put before this House, so disparaged by Opposition spokesmen when we did it, is allowed to pass through the Senate in as rapid order as possible.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Government announced in March that it would accelerate payments to the States under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement at a cost of $25m. In August this year I wrote to the State and Territory Ministers agreeing to their proposals for expenditure of accelerated payments under the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. So the funds in total of $842m are being paid to the States in two payments in the first half of the financial year instead of monthly as has previously been the case. Obviously, the offer, in a situation in which the housing industry has reflected the overall economic downturn, is designed to boost activity by enabling the States to bring forward those programs. In return, State and Territory Ministers agreed to bring forward projects which continue to keep apprentices in employment, use the financial benefits of early payments on their housing programs and bring forward projects consistent with achieving higher urban density and better cities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Therefore, the States and the Territories are accelerating the levels of activity in the public housing sector. New South Wales has agreed to more than double its planned level of activity in the first half of this financial year from 500 commencements to 1,230. Western Australia has agreed to double its public rental housing commencements in the first half of this financial year from 200 to 400. Queensland has made a similar commitment to bring forward about 300 additional housing commencements on its planned program, and South Australia, the honourable member's State, has increased its planned commitment by an additional 100 dwellings.</PARA>
<PARA>  Each of those shifts, occurring within the context of the Commonwealth's initiative, has had an effect in terms of helping to smooth out activity at a time of downturn in the housing industry. There is now predicted increased activity and recovery in the housing industry. I reported to the House on Monday that the Indicative Planning Council has revised upwards the forecast of housing starts for this financial year from 135,000 to 137,000--a rise of 13 per cent on the 121,000 starts for 1990-91. So there is sense in terms of what the Government has done. The States have taken it up. It is occurring at a time when there has been a trough in the housing industry, but we can see the signs now of recovery. The Indicative Planning Council expects that to be not only a reasonably strong recovery in this financial year, but very much stronger in the next financial year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I not only thank you for the call, Mr Acting Speaker, but I commend you for the way that you have handled the chair in the last two weeks. My question is to the Minister for Resources and it relates to concerns about the meat processing industry in Victoria. Is he aware of allegations suggesting a resurgence of organised criminal activities in the Victorian meat processing industry? Are these claims accurate? Is there any evidence of systematic malpractice in regard to the quality of meat being produced and being transported from Victorian meatworks?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Mr Acting Speaker, I would also congratulate you on your contribution if I were not so scared of the return of the Speaker. I am able to advise the House that the compliance unit of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, in cooperation with the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, has been conducting inquiries for some time into the apparent involvement of organised crime within the Victorian meat industry. I have been briefed on an ongoing basis, and indeed I indicated to officers of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service that this matter ought to be treated as their utmost priority. Because of the current state of the investigations, it is not appropriate to comment in detail or to confirm or deny specific allegations. The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service has intensified surveillance at all levels of the meat chain to check the validity of those allegations. The important thing for consumers and for our overseas customers is that there is no evidence--I repeat, no evidence--of systematic malpractice with regard to the quality of meat being produced in and transported from Victorian or other meatworks. In this respect, importing authorities in overseas countries have been briefed that the integrity and quality of Australian meat exports are not in question as a consequence of these investigations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The final report from the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence, which is due shortly, is expected to address the question of whether the matter of criminal involvement in the meat industry should be referred to the National Crime Authority.</PARA>
<PARA>  I am also able to confirm that a review of regulations designed to keep people who are not `fit and proper persons' out of the meat processing industry has been under way for some months and will shortly be completed. When these investigations have been completed, I will seek Cabinet approval to enhance my ability to prevent certain persons from operating in the meat industry.</PARA>
<PARA>  Let me conclude with these brief comments: there is nothing--I repeat: absolutely nothing--which has come to light as a result of these investigations which in any way goes to the question of product integrity. As to the allegation by the honourable member for Gippsland that these inquiries have `stalled', let me satisfy the House that the inquiries are not stalled and have never been stalled, and nor for that matter are they confined to Victoria. I would in the normal course of events have some further comments to make about the contribution by the honourable member for Gippsland a couple of evenings ago in this House. Suffice to say that I think these matters are of such importance both to people who rely upon this industry and to the national interest that it would advance the interests of neither were I to do so.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2034" SPEAKER="Bilney The Hon G.N." NAMEID="RE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="KINGSTON" MINISTERIAL="DEFENCE SCIENCE AND PERSONNEL" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RE4">Mr BILNEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am sorry that in answer to the question by the honourable member for Brisbane I have to disappoint the Australian Democrats. As has been noted, it is not for the first time. The Defence Science and Technology Organisation does not produce and does not export cluster bombs. It is true that in the early 1980s the organisation did develop a prototype bomb and a small number of those were produced for trialing by the RAAF, but the bomb did not go into production, was not for export and was not exported.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  What we do export is some of DSTO's state of the art expertise in this and related fields. For example, as many honourable members know, Australia currently has an Army team in Pakistan which is operating as part of a United Nations mine clearance training team. Another example is that Army personnel and DSTO scientists have been very instrumental in the efforts being made by the United Nations to monitor Iraq's chemical, biological and nuclear weapons programs and activities, again as part of the Gulf war cease-fire provisions. We have peacekeepers in the Western Sahara and we are preparing to send a major peacekeeping mission to Cambodia, the largest such mission in a long time. So the ability to respond to aggression is only part of our defence posture; working to secure peace is an equally important part.</PARA>
<PARA>  We spend $200m-plus a year on DSTO because it plays an absolutely essential role in guaranteeing Australia's security. In a large, sparsely populated continent we are dependent on maintaining and developing sophisticated state-of-the-art surveillance, transport and communications technologies. To do that we need an organisation like DSTO. Its expertise is crucial in achieving that, and a lot more into the bargain.</PARA>
<PARA>  Let me give a few examples of the exceptional technologies that DSTO has produced: the Jindalee over-the-horizon radar, which for the first time provides a radar sweep over the vast sea-air gap to our north; the special steel which made possible the manufacture, in the electorate of my good friend the honourable member for Port Adelaide, of the Collins class submarines, the first of which will be completed in 1993; and the advanced boron patching system for the repair of aircraft skins and superstructures, which has already saved Australia something like $700m through life extensions of aircraft. That technology, I might point out to the House, is now being exploited commercially through a joint venture, and it looks like having a very large market in the United States and other countries over the next five years. Another example is the laser airborne depth sounder which will enable us to map our coastal waters something like 25 years faster than if we used conventional means. A further example is the Kariwara towed arrays for surface combatants which enable them to detect other vessels, including submarines, at great distance--another technology which we are hopeful of exporting.</PARA>
<PARA>  That is far from an exhaustive list. I might mention to every member of this House that in the mural hall there is an engineering exhibition of excellence, in which DSTO has an exhibit, and I really recommend that people go and have a look at that exhibition. They will see that DSTO, as a result of commercialising its technologies, has pushed into Australian industry, not just the defence industry, contracts which are worth $1.8 billion.</PARA>
<PARA>  They are a few reasons why Australia should be happy to spend $200m on DSTO. I conclude by answering the second part of the honourable member's question, which related to community support for the Government's objectives of defence self-reliance. I will just mention one index of that. The Prime Minister launched in Brisbane just 10 or 12 days ago the Ready Reserve, the new form of reserve service for young Australians. Over the period from 2 October, when that was launched, to 14 October--nine working days--Defence received 8,842 inquiries about the new scheme and over 1,600 applications. I might add that 50 per cent of those inquiries were from the honourable member's home State of Queensland. I cannot think of a better demonstration of the fact that young people are prepared to serve their country and to respond enthusiastically to new forms of service which are tailored to meet their lifestyles and expectations, and I believe it is a ringing endorsement of this Government's defence policy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Almost everyone in Australia has been hurt by this recession that we are told we had to have, but no one group has been affected more than Australia's youth. The promise on youth poverty by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is notorious, and it is to the youth of this country that he should apologise. Young people today are having to cope with enormous pressures. There is amongst them an unprecedented pessimism about the future, and for many the future is indeed bleak. Young people today are having to cope with drugs and AIDS, the breakdown of the family unit, concerns for the future of the natural environment, the tensions of a changing population mix and a lack of confidence in government. Indeed, they question the relevance to them of the whole political process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  They are also concerned about the availability of jobs and the post-Depression record youth unemployment, the inability of the tertiary education system to meet demand and, finally, the dire straits which the Australian economy is in. </PARA>
<PARA>  Young people are indeed the `casualties of change', as Richard Eckersley said in his 1989 report for the Commission for the Future. As Professor Philip Hughes of the University of Tasmania wrote in February 1991:</PARA>
<PARA>The social environment for young people is one of tension and uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA>But there is not only tension for young people. There is, of course, great tension for their parents as they attempt to contend, alongside their children, with the enormous problems facing this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  The future of this country depends on its youth. It would be unreasonable to blame the Hawke Government for every problem faced by young people today. However, the Government has exacerbated the problems, and its policies have contributed to the extent of them. The Government has clearly mortgaged the future of young Australians. It has plunged this country into enormous debt. Net debt in June 1991 was $130 billion, representing 34 per cent of GDP. By some estimates, this net debt will rise to almost $240 billion by June 1996, and that represents 44 per cent of GDP. As we attempt to cope with this debt our living standards will continue to fall. </PARA>
<PARA>  Young people are rightly concerned that they have the responsibility of wrestling with this enormous problem. They find it very difficult to understand that this Government's solution is in part a willingness to sell off just about anything in an attempt to stem the tide, but even this is to no avail. </PARA>
<PARA>  Young Australians are clearly at the cutting edge of this Government engineered recession. Ten years ago, 42 per cent of those aged 15 to 19 had full time jobs. Now the figure is 22 per cent, and next year it will be 15 per cent. Recent surveys have shown that employment is the No. 1 concern among Australia's youth. Youth unemployment, currently at around treble the adult rate, has reached post-Depression record levels. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, in the present recession the collapse in employment for young Australians is far greater than the unemployment figures actually indicate. The real unemployment figure among those aged 15 to 19 is closer to 40 per cent. Many young people are staying at school longer and this, to a large extent, disguises the extent of unemployment. There is, of course, also mounting underemployment for young people as part time work has increased from 17 per cent to 37 per cent in 10 years, as 236,000 full time youth jobs have just disappeared, 70 per cent of that figure in the last two years. </PARA>
<PARA>  One must ask how many of the 230,000 secondary students on Austudy are actually on a de facto unemployment benefit. Of course, the Government maintains that an increased participation rate in post-compulsory education is one of its major successes. However, this clouds the real issue. Clearly many young people are staying at school longer because they have no prospect of getting a job; in many ways, the education system has failed to respond adequately to the needs of these young people who remain at school beyond the compulsory years. </PARA>
<PARA>  The real sting, however, is in the fact that these increased retention rates have created an expectation for higher education which simply cannot be met. At the moment, 30,000 qualified Australian students are locked out of tertiary education at the same time as 15,000 full fee paying overseas students are admitted, and this, as the Industry Commission observed recently in a report, is a serious inequity. </PARA>
<PARA>  Clearly, funding of the higher education system has failed to keep pace with the enormous growth in student numbers. In per student terms, funding has decreased by 30 per cent since 1975, and no amount of gobbledegook by the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin), in answering a question along these lines in Parliament earlier this afternoon, can alter this particular fact. Universities are overcrowded and underfunded and each of us with a university in our electorate is aware of the extent of this problem. Also, enrolments at TAFE colleges have fallen disastrously and vocational training in Australia is extremely low compared with the OECD average. </PARA>
<PARA>  Young people in our society are alienated. This Government's policies have now created a situation where there is a real risk that we will have two separate societies of young people. We will have those who have and those who have not. There will be those who have in education and those who have not. There will be those who have jobs and those who do not have jobs. Many will have neither, and may never have. </PARA>
<PARA>  I ask the Government what future there is for these people. Only an expectation, I suppose, that the welfare system will provide. But what sort of solution is that to this problem?  There are, of course, even those who have homes and those who have not. The Burdekin report, with which many honourable members will be familiar, estimated that there were between 25,000 and 70,000 homeless young people in this country. Government policy has failed to address even this important problem. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the most telling indicators of the increased stress and pressure on Australian youth is the marked increase in the incidence of youth suicide. One in every seven deaths of males aged 15 to 19 is caused by suicide. In 1966 the corresponding figure was one in 20. In 1988 there was one teenage suicide every 46 hours in Australia. The period of increasing youth suicide strongly correlates with the high youth unemployment rate. Unemployment in general, and prolonged unemployment in particular, is associated with low self-esteem and with emotional, economic and psychological insecurity. </PARA>
<PARA>  Many of today's young people have grown up in welfare dependent families. Studies in the United States have clearly indicated that welfare dependence is passed on. The average family in Australia is now considerably worse off than it was in 1983. There are almost 400,000 single parent families in Australia. Most of these are headed by women, and most of these women are living on welfare. There are more than 500,000 children who have at most one parent. There is a desperate need to keep families together. Family breakdown in our society is endemic. Almost one in three marriages ends in divorce. Government programs to address this particular social problem have clearly also been inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA>  The future for the young people of Australia is clearly at risk. Young people have been badly treated by this Government. They have been given unreasonable and unattainable expectations of an education. There are very limited full time job opportunities available to them. There is a drastic need for a new direction. Coalition policies will provide this direction. They will give hope to young people. They will provide young people with a vision for the future. Young people today are clearly worse off than they were in 1970 or 1980.  We want them to be better off by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is a desperate need for a whole new approach to taxation which will restore the incentive for people to work. There is a clear need for a new industrial relations system where productivity becomes the criterion for wage increases. Unless youth wages are related to productivity, they will continue to suffer and, particularly in times of recession, youth jobs will be amongst the first to go. </PARA>
<PARA>  Union activities which have sustained relatively high youth wages have had a disastrous impact on the availability of jobs for young people. Young people are not stupid. They understand the balance between the need to preserve the environment and to create jobs. They recognise hypocrisy when they see it in decisions such as those the Government took in relation to the mining of Coronation Hill and Wesley Vale. They recognise crass politics when they see it. They see through the Government's mickey mouse job creation schemes and training programs. They have little respect for politicians. Why should they? Politicians are largely responsible for the mess which Australian people see in the country today. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe it will be an absolute priority for the Opposition when it comes to government to address the concerns of young people in our society. We, the Opposition, have listened to them, and we are listening to them. Unfortunately, however, a great deal of damage has been done in the last nine years, since this Government came to office. It will in many respects be a very difficult task for us to reverse much of this damage, but there is no doubt in my mind that the future of young people in Australia depends on developing policies which address the needs and concerns of young people. </PARA>
<PARA>  This MPI condemns the Government for the policies it has developed, the things it has done and the things it has not done which have impacted so heavily on the young people of Australia. This Government has clearly failed everyone in Australia, but it has particularly failed the young people of Australia. Its legacy to the young people of this country, a legacy of failure, unfortunately will affect Australia and the society of this country for many years. This Government has failed the young people of Australia, but we will not. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-During Question Time on any day, including today, any question in this House that relates to the portfolios of Education, Employment and Training, Higher Education and Employment Services, Community Services and Health, and Social Security more often than not is met with derision by Opposition members. Yet those are the very portfolios which impact on children and youth, the very portfolios which, by the actions of those opposite, appear to be held in contempt. The Australian electorate will measure this Opposition and its policies on youth as it did in 1983, 1984, 1987 and 1990. The Opposition will be measured and duly rejected by the Australian electorate. The rhetoric of Opposition members simply does not match their actions on matters that affect youth in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In this debate, Opposition members have espoused policies of the lowest common denominator. That display, quite clearly--for all to see--is a very convenient and selective reflection by the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) of history in this nation. The intellectual content of discussions about youth in this House, in terms of a taxonomy of educational objectives for youth, reflects the lowest common denominator--that of the lowest intellectual skill by a concentration of knowledge and specific facts and processes. Perhaps even that is not totally correct, as indeed there is very little reference to any process whatsoever. Where is the rationale, the vision and the philosophy of what has been stated here today by Opposition members? They have to do more than just mention words. Where are the processes, the mechanisms, the means and the facilitation congruent with a vision? As one would expect, they are totally absent. </PARA>
<PARA>  The comments made in this House today by the honourable member for McPherson are purely outcome driven and task driven, with no reconciliation with vision or progress. They are totally reliant upon the recall of facts that are very selective and specific but without great substance. Education of our young--as the honourable member for McPherson acknowledged--should not be simplistic and of the lowest common denominator. Goals set should be long term, and the attainment of them will take a generation. If we are serious, and if the honourable member for McPherson and those opposite are serious--and we ought to be--we at least ought to acknowledge that. Those goals for our young must be more substantive than just a reliance on the selective factual information given today by the honourable member for McPherson. </PARA>
<PARA>  Educational objectives include insight, translation, prediction, comprehension, interpretation, analysis and synthesis--goals that are totally absent in the thinking of Opposition members. The Opposition's recipe for our youth in the 1990s and into the twenty-first century is a repeated recipe for failure, because the Opposition's approach is totally outcome driven and it ignores rationale and process. It is a guaranteed recipe for failure that the Opposition offers the young in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will repeat several points I have made in another debate in this House because I believe they are relevant to this debate. There is no doubt that every thinking, rational Australian is concerned about the current youth unemployment levels in this country. There is no doubt that for the same thinking, rational Australians there still exists a vast gulf between the thinking of the Government and that of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is an informative exercise to put the track record of the Opposition up to scrutiny. In 1968 the OECD made significant recommendations to the Australian Government to significantly lift its game in retention rates and participation in higher education and vocational training. It was not the Labor Party that ignored those recommendations that Australian governments should do that so that Australia could take its rightful place in the world. It was not the Labor Party that increased the retention rates in our schools from a miserly 25 per cent to 36 per cent in 15 years. It was not the Labor Party that virtually ignored vocational training, treated TAFE as a second-class citizen and ignored higher education places for disadvantaged people. </PARA>
<PARA>  It was not the Labor Party that had a resource policy based on agriculture and mining and not the resource that is placed between one's ears. It was not the Labor Party that in Malcolm Fraser's days, when unemployment and inflation were 10 per cent, referred to people who were unfortunate enough to be unemployed as dole bludgers. It was not the Labor Party that called, as some Opposition members are doing, for the abolition of training programs such as Skillshare. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is not the Labor Party calling for the abolition of student income support in the form of Austudy. It is not the Labor Party calling for the abolition of unemployment benefits after nine months. It is not the Labor Party calling for a $3 billion cut in expenditure in health, welfare and education, the very portfolios that impact on women and youth. </PARA>
<PARA>  I point out to the honourable member for McPherson that it was not the Opposition that had the courage and the guts to begin the tortuous process of restructuring in this country. `Restructuring' is a pretty interesting term--one that is often mentioned by those opposite. But what is the Opposition's record on that? Ducking, weaving; ducking, weaving. Opposition members talk about restructuring and they talk about micro-economic reform, but they do not do anything. </PARA>

As the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) said in this House not long ago, it was not even members of the Opposition who thought up the line `Labor isn't working; neither are one million Australians'; they got it from Margaret Thatcher. The infamy of that line! The Minister said that Margaret Thatcher's policies created three million unemployed. In four or five years she managed to increase unemployment in the United Kingdom by 154 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Let us take a town in northern England called Hull. Eighty-five to 92 per cent of the kids who left school last Christmas still do not have a job. Towns such as this are the places where riots are occurring in the United Kingdom. The policies that caused that situation are the policies the Opposition puts forward. Those policies would create two million unemployed in this country. Who would they impact upon most? Youth--that is who. The irony of the 1983 election in the United Kingdom is not lost on Opposition members because, unfortunately and paradoxically, Margaret Thatcher won that election. </PARA>
<PARA>  Perhaps Ross Gittins, in a recent article in the Sunday Age, summed up the Opposition's attitude towards people who are unfortunate enough to be unemployed. I will use some of his words. He summed up honourable members opposite with a very accurate and cutting remark. He referred to unemployment, but his remarks could just as well apply to youth. His words were; so the Liberal Party bleeds for the unemployed? So the Liberal Party bleeds for youth? I think not--Ross Gittins words. The policies of honourable members opposite are those of the Thatcher Government. The Opposition would double unemployment in this country. It would increase it by over 150 per cent, and the greatest casualties of that unemployment would be youth. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us look at some of the achievements of the Australian Government as they affect Australian youth. The Hawke Labor Government is responsible for a revolution in education, employment and training in this country. There are some figures that the Opposition cannot, in fact, deny. There are now more Australians in schools, in TAFE, in training courses, in universities and in jobs, even in the current climate, than ever before in our history. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us look at some of the specifics as they affect schools, the very foundation stones of a clever country. To benefit our youth in our nation there are now more young people completing year 12 than ever before. By the year 2001, if we start applying the recommendations of the Finn report, we are aiming at 90 to 95 per cent of 19-year-olds. There are some ideas. There are some processes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Yes, the honourable member will find a rationale, he will find some mechanisms, and he will find some outcomes. It is a pity he cannot get the trinity right. By the end of the 1992 funding period, funding for schools in this country will be almost $500m more than in 1983. More than $2 billion a year is spent on government and non-government schools, on disadvantaged students, and on isolated students.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Let us have a look at what is going on with the funding of schools. For primary kids it is up 37 per cent; for secondary students it is up 102 per cent. This is the Government that does not care for youth! What about the neediest non-government schools? Their funding is up 36 per cent for primary students and 26 per cent for high schools. I think the Opposition thinks that the Finn report is a comic in the Sunday papers, from the way in which it has referred to it today. What about support for disadvantaged students? That is acknowledged. That is something that we do not see coming from the Opposition. What about TAFE and vocational training which are areas of education that have traditionally being ignored by many on the benches opposite? Again, as one would expect, there is a large gulf between the thinking of the Government and of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA>  With the release of the Finn report, the Government is quite clearly leading the debate on post-compulsory education. It is ideas driven, not outcomes driven. We are planning for our young to 2001. The Finn report recognises that both individual and industry needs are leading towards a convergence of general and vocational education. New measures for participation post-year 10 are clearly spelt out and outcomes are reconciled with ideas and processes that 95 per cent of our 19-year-olds should have completed year 12 or have an initial post-school qualification and be participating in formally recognised education and training. These matters concerning TAFE should have been addressed by those opposite in the 1970s. Why would the Australian electorate believe the Opposition would do anything in the 1990s?</PARA>
<PARA>   In summing up, may I say in relation to Australian youth and children that the lack of planning, substance and detail on the part of honourable members opposite during the Fraser years locked out our youth. That is right, it locked them out and prevented our youth from participating and being able to attain their real potential. The Opposition would do it again. Make no mistake, the Australian electorate knows that it would do it again. The track record of the Opposition in relation to youth and children, welfare groups and the unemployed has not changed, and that is a great pity. </PARA>
<PARA>  Take, for example, the vicious attack on ACOSS by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hweson) recently. In that attack, the Leader of the Opposition quite clearly pointed out from whom he wished to take funds--women, children and youth. Those honourable members opposite know it. They know it all right. They must have cringed in shame when they saw the reports coming back from that attack. They deserve to cringe in shame. </PARA>
<PARA>  Youth and children in this country are indeed our future. Youth and children need and deserve support, and this Government has the runs on the board. Youth and children deserve more than the illusions offered by the Opposition. I acknowledge that improvements need to be and must be made. I am sure that everyone on the Government benches would acknowledge that. Youth and children deserve more than rhetorical catch grab one-liners devoid of intellectual content that fail to acknowledge a rationale, that failed to acknowledge a process, and that are simply an ad hoc collection of synthesised outcomes. The Opposition, whether it is its health policy, micro-economic reform, or taxation reform, continues to take the easy options. It is devoid of analysis. Perhaps to borrow a phrase that I read in the press the other day, the Opposition is in a state of analysis paralysis. </PARA>
<PARA>  What would a Liberal-National Party Opposition do in government? Inevitably, it would repeat the outcomes created and achieved by the United Kingdom Government under Thatcher. It is incapable of planning for the future. It continues to drive this debate by an ad hoc collection of outcomes. It continues to fail to reconcile ideas and mechanisms and procedures for improvement. If any individual in everyday life did this in tackling problems, they would inevitably fail. If any group in this country followed the procedures, the methodology and the modus operandi of this Opposition, it would fail. If a government in the guise of the Opposition followed this way, it would fail. As certainly as night turns to day, it would repeat the achievements of the Thatcher Government and increase unemployment in this country by 154 per cent and the greatest casualty would be the youth of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA>  Sadly, I hear what the Opposition is saying. I hear its real thought-out remedies. The Australian people will surely say, `No, thank you. No, thank you very much'. Civilised societies in this world are noted for their care of the aged, the disadvantaged and the young. We do not see the evidence of that coming from the other side. On all three of these aspects the Opposition fails. By its actions and its words, it is confirming those messages to the Australian electorate and it will be rightfully rejected.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-One in 10 Australians are searching for jobs. Labor is not working and neither are nearly one million Australians. The Australian community has lost confidence in the Hawke Labor Government. The Government has policy paralysis. Minister White is fighting Prime Minister Hawke; Prime Minister Hawke is fighting Keating; Senator Button is fighting Prime Minister Hawke; Keating's 44 are fighting Prime Minister Hawke; Button is fighting Kerin; Hawke is fighting Dawkins; and the Left is fighting just about everyone. Everyone in the ALP is fighting one another. What confidence can the young people of Australia have in a government that has the policy paralysis that is evident within the Labor Party ranks at the moment?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  If the Labor Party cannot govern itself, it cannot govern the country. It should think about the fact that one in 10 young people are out on the streets looking for work. The overall figure is 10.2 per cent of people unemployed in Australia. Almost a million Australians are out of work and the people who are affected most seriously are the people in Victoria, where the situation is even worse. Nearly 11 per cent of the population is out of work, a 2.4 per cent increase in just one month. Here we have the State Minister fighting with the Prime Minister and saying, `You have to change tack'. But the Government will not change tack. It has no policies; it is paralysed by its infighting, and what is happening within its own ranks?</PARA>
<PARA>  The gravity of the situation in rural areas is even more extreme. We are talking about levels of unemployment of up to 22 per cent, and even worse in some areas of country Australia. What is the Government doing about it? It is infighting over everything. No policies are coming out. There is no attempt at making any changes to this economy that will, in fact, encourage any confidence in the community of Australia. The statistics tell only a very small part of the story. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will quote from a letter dated 15 May 1991 which was forwarded to my leader. It is just one very small sample of what is happening. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr Hewson</PARA>
<PARA>  I am writing to you to express my outrage and disgust at the way Australia has turned out. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am a 19 year old unemployed girl who has been unemployed for 5 months (not by choice or lack of trying). </PARA>
<PARA>  I am a qualified travel consultant and I can also speak Japanese as a result of five years study at high school and a year in Japan. </PARA>
<PARA>  You'd think with my qualifications it would be quite easy to get a job but it isn't. All the advertisements say `15-16 year old experienced shop Assistants' or `21-25 year old Receptionist'. . . </PARA>
<PARA>I would not mind finding those jobs, if I could. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA>  I sincerely congratulate you on the job you've done and I hope you gain power at the next election. . . I used to think of the Hawke government but some of the Treasurer's statements have appalled me! `The recession we have to have.' If we had to have it why are things getting worse every day. I think if Australian workers didn't ask for any further wage increases, we might be okay!</PARA>
<PARA>  I know you probably can't do anything for me but I hope you can make Mr Hawke realise that the majority of the people in Australia are suffering, like me. </PARA>

<PARA>That is only one of a million people out there on the streets wanting to work. There are young people who are qualified, intelligent and keen to work and they do not have the opportunity to do so because this Government is not putting the policies in place. It is absolutely paralysed with its infighting and its lack of policies to get this economy working. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the problems with the Hawke Government at the moment is that it kept high interest rates in place for so long, with the recession `we had to have'--it was brought upon us by the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating)--that it did not know how to correct the situation. It just kept forcing interest rates up in this recession and did not realise the high price that young people in our community were paying. The young people right throughout this country will remember the policies of the Hawke Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) will be the next speaker on the Government side. I look forward to her speech because as Chairman of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, I invited her to visit my electorate. She was able to see at first hand the problems people were experiencing in the country area of Victoria with Austudy. They were having difficulty in getting access to Austudy assistance because of the stupid policy that the Government has put in place and the poor administration which has required three inquiries--and still there has been no better result in the administration of that organisation. She will obviously have some very enlightened input into what is happening in rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  What can be done?  Firstly, we need a change of governments, not only here but right throughout this nation. Labor is not working and neither are nearly one million Australians. We need major structural reform; major tax reform; labour market reform; enterprise bargaining; and efficient privatisation to improve our competitiveness. An article in the Canberra Times of 14 October is headed `Labor `burns' over job crisis'. It is not Labor that is burning. Labor's policies are burning the young people of this country--the policies that it has had in place now for the last eight years, almost a decade, of increasing unemployment in this nation. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have reached the highest level of unemployment since 1983. Honourable members will recall that in 1982-83 we were subjected to a drought year. The Government pointed out the unemployment figures at that time, but it very carefully glosses over the fact that Australia experienced one of the worst droughts in its history. Once the rains came in 1983, the economic recovery was immediate and employment started to blossom. But now, because of the policies the Government has implemented, the unemployment situation has progressively deteriorated. </PARA>
<PARA>  My Party has set out to recharge the Australian economy and provide some confidence, particularly to employers who will be in a position to employ young Australians in the work force. We are going to instil confidence in the private sector, which will become the largest employer in the small business area. Our taxation reform will be of tremendous advantage to small business people throughout Australia and will create employment opportunities. We are also encouraging a high level of privatisation in an efficient manner. We should get government out of business and out of running many activities and let the private sector do it. We should let the private sector entrepreneurs create work, create employment for our young people, and let them get on with the jobs for which they are well qualified. They are keen to get out and seek employment. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government is in paralysis. It has no new policies. The fighting continues: White fights Hawke; Hawke fights Keating; Button fights Hawke; Keating's 44 fight Hawke; Button fights Kerin; Hawke fights Dawkins. If they cannot govern themselves, they cannot govern this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I, along with many Australians, share concern about youth unemployment. As well as that, I would argue that we, as a Government, have pursued policies which have attempted to address this matter. We hear the Opposition speak about structural reform and major structural change. In effect, youth unemployment is an indication of that having happened. The drop in the number of jobs for young people is the result of several factors: technological change; restructure of industry; and, of course, the whole move away from traditional young people's jobs. In fact, the present youth unemployment is as a result of those factors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  We have heard today a great cry of nostalgia--the desire for things to be as they were. Of course, things are not as they were. As we move into the twenty-first century, the Government has to face the challenges and understand what they really mean for the youth of Australia. One of those things, of course, is the changing nature of employment and the changing nature of the way in which society and the economy is structured. That, in effect, brings about enormous and dramatic changes in the way in which we skill and restructure our work force, and the kinds of jobs which are now available to us. </PARA>
<PARA>  Anybody within this House would know and understand that it is imperative for people to be computer literate. No job is available in Australia to people who lack skills in the computer area. Indeed, the figures speak for themselves. Young people who have tertiary education have virtually nil employment. Ninety to 100 per cent of people who leave school with only year 10 education are now unable to find employment because there are no longer jobs available to them with that level of skill. </PARA>
<PARA>  That is a fact, and that is why we must continue to pursue school retention rates. It is imperative that we set a goal to keep 75 to 80 per cent of our students at school. We want to give them the best chance. We hear spurious arguments from the other side that people stay on at school because they do not know what else to do. That is rubbish. </PARA>
<PARA>  The community understands and youth understand very clearly that the work force has dramatically changed. It has changed in a way that makes demands on us all, and upon them in particular. Those demands are that they must be trained, they must be skilled, they must have an adequate level of sophistication and knowledge, and they must have a level of skill in seeking information considerably higher than that which has been needed by the Australian work force at any other time in Australia's history. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WF4">Ms CRAWFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am afraid the facts do not bear out what the honourable member suggests; he is quite wrong. The fact of the matter is that those people who are highly skilled and trained--as I have just said, people with tertiary qualifications--find that employment is available. It is those students who leave school at a young age with no skills, no training and no desire or ability to access the kinds of training programs which are around who find themselves in difficulty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  One way in which the coalition would address this issue is simply to say, `There will be no Austudy in the secondary area'. All of us recognise that Austudy enables those people who come from lower income families to continue in secondary education. It is also important that we break the cycle of poverty. That is exactly what Austudy does in that secondary area. It enables people from poorer families to access secondary education--and then, hopefully, tertiary education in some form, whether TAFE, vocational training or whatever--and so to move into employment. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another answer we hear from the other side is, of course, to change youth wages. Let us look at this whole issue of youth wages. Some of my colleagues will know that, in the recent skills training inquiry by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, there has been an amount of debate on that matter. But, indeed, many of the employers who came to us did not see a drop in payments to youth as being at all successful in tackling problems in this area. Between 1972 and 1974--that is, at the time of the previous Labor Government--junior award rates went up by 8 per cent. What happened to unemployment?  It went down by 15 per cent. However, prior to 1972 and after 1974, irrespective of any change in the relativity between youth rates and adult wages, unemployment continued. </PARA>
<PARA>  So, of course, what we are saying is that it is not a question of youth wages;  it is a question of the kinds of skills that young people bring to jobs, the way in which the economy has restructured itself, and the demands that a restructured economy and a restructured work force place on its members. That is one of our major concerns. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another matter of concern for the Opposition that we hear about is homeless youth. Indeed, all of us would be equally horrified by the fact that so many of our young people have been turned out of their homes by their own families. In fact, we see here people who espouse small government and say that we should privatise everything now, suggesting that it is the Government's role to pick up these children where families have failed--and indeed we have. I am very proud and pleased to be part of a Government which saw fit to respond to the Burdekin inquiry. Even in my own electorate we have a number of houses which have been bought for young homeless youth with Burdekin money. They are managed houses and they have given a whole range of young people an opportunity to participate in education and, of course, in the work force. That is a very real and proper thing that is happening to address that issue. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another interesting thing--which was mentioned by my colleague--is that the coalition yet again is calling for an end to all kinds of payments. Honourable members opposite call for an end to payments to sole parents and other welfare recipients. I find it quite extraordinary that they should yet again target women, young women and children as the people who are undeserving, when the real fact of the matter is that 96 per cent of our sole parents have been in marriages. I do not know whether the coalition has some way of stopping men from walking away from their wives, but perhaps we could look to that at a future date. </PARA>
<PARA>  Youth unemployment is of major concern. This Government has addressed the issue in a whole range of ways. Not only has it addressed it through enabling people to stay on at school through Austudy and through creating 100,000 extra places in the tertiary sector, but also, only yesterday, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) announced a $1 billion expansion for the TAFE sector. Why is it doing this?  It is because the State governments have continually failed to address that issue, so it is left to a Federal Labor Government to ensure that the TAFE sector is properly resourced and that our young men and women have access to that whole program. We have also heard the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Dr Blewett) tell us today that the export of manufactured goods to the Asia-Pacific Rim has expanded by 79 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  These are the kinds of programs which will, in the long term, bring about a change in the environment--in a restructured economy in which all our young people can participate, with all having equal opportunity and all having access to universities and other tertiary institutions. It will not be the situation that applied in our day, when only those whose parents were rich and could afford to pay full fees were deemed to be deserving and those people on welfare were put to one side. No, every single child in Australia is entitled to education, irrespective of the kind of money that that child's parents earn. These people are entitled to a house and to a job, and, as the economy moves and as we expand our exported goods market, we are creating an environment of which young Australians can justifiably be proud in the twenty-first century. </PARA>

<PARA>  That the resolution of the House of 9 May 1990 concerning Parliamentary Secretaries be amended so as to read:</PARA>
<PARA>  That, for the purposes of the procedures of the House, any reference to Ministers shall be taken to include Parliamentary Secretaries, with the exception of references to questions seeking information (chapter XI of the standing orders). </PARA>
<PARA>On 9 May 1990 the House resolved:</PARA>
<PARA>  That, for the purposes of the procedures of the House, any references to Ministers shall be taken to include Parliamentary Secretaries, with the following exceptions:</PARA>
<PARA>(a)  presentation and motion for second reading of government bills; and</PARA>
<PARA>(b)  questions seeking information. . .</PARA>
<PARA>Essentially, the motion I have moved would remove that first qualification. I did indicate, when I moved the original motion, that the way in which we handled the matter of Parliamentary Secretaries in this place would be very much a matter of trial and error. I suggested that, while most of their functions were to assist their portfolio Minister, it was clearly intended that they would assist the Ministry generally in the conduct of the House. There is no doubt that Parliamentary Secretaries in both chambers have performed very valuable functions and responsibilities during the past 17 months. I think it is an appropriate time to reconsider their role, and to expand it slightly. </PARA>
<PARA>  The purpose of the motion before the House is to enhance the role of Parliamentary Secretaries, but without overriding the ongoing responsibilities which Ministers have to the proper conduct of business in the House and, importantly, the courtesies that they are expected to extend to it. The same motion was successfully carried in the Senate on 19 June 1991,  and experience since then in the other place indicates that the new arrangements work effectively and with strong bipartisan support. I must say that to some considerable extent our moving of this motion is influenced by the fact that this position has been adopted in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>  Mr Deputy Speaker, I must ask you to convey to the Speaker when he returns from overseas my appreciation of the very significant and historical role he has played in bringing about the reintroduction of Parliamentary Secretaries last year. It has been conducted in a way that is both appropriate and desirable. I recollect that, at the time when we were considering whether or not we should establish Parliamentary Secretary positions, he played an enormously supportive role by suggesting to the Government that it was a sensible thing to do, and he made a few suggestions about enhancing this role. So, to some extent, this motion reflects some of his ideas. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would also recommend to honourable members who are interested in these particular procedures a very good paper prepared for the Parliamentary Library by Margaret Healy, which details the role and responsibilities of Parliamentary Secretaries in a number of countries and states of the Commonwealth. What is quite evident from a study of what she has had to say is that no two systems are exactly the same. There are features which are unique to virtually every parliament that operates with Parliamentary Secretaries. I think it would be true to say, however, that if one went through a list of things they might do, we would have to say that we were perhaps on the most generous side in terms of the roles that Parliamentary Secretaries undertake, when compared with the other parliaments identified by Margaret Healy. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is worth while saying one or two things about conventions that might apply here. Again, some of these matters have been discussed with the Speaker and not formalised, but there are one or two things that might be indicated. It is intended that under the new arrangements Parliamentary Secretaries will be able to introduce some legislation and have carriage of it through each reading stage, including the committee stage. It is expected that Ministers will continue to have responsibility for the carriage of all substantive legislation within their portfolios, but housekeeping type legislation, including portfolio omnibus Bills, can readily be handled through all stages by Parliamentary Secretaries. </PARA>
<PARA>  Parliamentary Secretaries would not, under this proposition, be able to answer questions without notice or seek information, nor would they be able to ask questions without notice of their portfolio Minister. I really ought to talk through with the Speaker the matter of their asking questions. I think there would be a pretty reasonable case for arguing that Parliamentary Secretaries ought to be able to ask questions on matters of relevance directly to their electorates. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Speaker has suggested that the Parliamentary Secretaries, like Ministers, might not participate in private members' debates, grievance debates and 90-second statements. Again, that is something I think I ought to talk through with the Speaker to ensure that that does not overly impinge on the role of people who are in fact not Ministers but members of the Executive Council. </PARA>
<PARA>  One aspect of the role of Parliamentary Secretary requires some clarification. It has been the practice of some Parliamentary Secretaries to speak at the dispatch box while participating in second reading debates and, on other occasions, they follow the practice of participating in debate only from their allocated places. The Speaker has informed me that if the motion is passed it would be more appropriate for Parliamentary Secretaries to address the House from the dispatch box rather than from their allocated places. </PARA>
<PARA>  These changes add to what I think has been a very substantial array of reforms introduced in the House in recent years. They have included the introduction of private members' business on Thursday morning, which has been very well received. The sitting arrangements of the House, with two weeks on and two weeks off--that being prescribed by the doctors on this side of the House--seem to have produced a situation in which a proper balance between electorate and parliamentary work is being assumed by members. The improved hours of sitting which have the House meeting earlier in the day rather than sitting very late into the night have also been of benefit. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is essential that members continue to give consideration to measures which would improve the operations of the House. Changes to improve the nature and conduct of Question Time are always worthy of consideration. Improving the timely introduction of legislation is another. Advisory debates, an initiative of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), will commence shortly and will provide yet another opportunity for members to have substantive input into the Executive decision making process. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think that for the Parliamentary Secretaries this particular motion is very important. It will more firmly stamp authority on their conduct in this House, given the status they have acquired principally by virtue of their being members of the Executive Council. I notice that one who might be described as the head of the Parliamentary Secretaries trade union, the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price), is here in the House. I pay tribute to him for the constant pressure to enhance the role of Parliamentary Secretaries. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think the business of government over the years has increased extraordinarily and that even a cursory look at what parliaments dealt with even 20 or 30 years ago would indicate that, particularly as we on this side of the House have adopted a position that we will have portfolio Ministers. In many ways, the position of senior Ministers has expanded quite dramatically under this Government. As a result of that, they require much more assistance in their normal legislative functions than they have had otherwise. The position of Parliamentary Secretary is not one that we on this side of the House invented; it was one put in place, as I understand it, by the Fraser Government. What we have done with it is to take it several stages beyond the way in which it functioned under the Fraser Government. That has been very much to the good order of business. </PARA>
<PARA>  In conclusion, I point to the role of the Parliamentary Secretary who operates in the Senate, Senator McMullan. He effectively is de facto manager of Government business in the Senate and has an even more substantial role than that which this motion, replicated in the Senate, effectively gives him. That is again very much in the interests of the better functioning of that place. As far as I can see, his particular role has well and truly received multiparty support in that establishment, as I hope it does here today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-When the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) in May last year moved to revive the institution of Parliamentary Secretaries, the Opposition supported the motion. I said at the time on behalf of the Opposition that we believe there is a place in our Parliament for Parliamentary Secretaries. However, it will be recalled that in supporting the Minister's motion we expressed a strong reservation about Government Parliamentary Secretaries being on occasions in charge of the House. I said then that the House should not be in session without a representative of Her Majesty's Government being present in the chamber. We still hold to that view. It is fundamental to ministerial responsibility and it is a courtesy that the Executive owes to the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The original motion excluded Parliamentary Secretaries from introducing Government Bills and from answering questions in the portfolio area. Now the Government is seeking to invest them with the power to introduce Bills and presumably to steer them through the House. The only responsibility that the Government is not seeking to transfer to Parliamentary Secretaries is the authority to answer questions. </PARA>
<PARA>  If this motion is carried, there will soon be very little difference between the roles of Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries in Parliament. It will clearly diminish the role of Ministers. So far as Parliament is concerned, it will mean that the only difference between them will be that Parliamentary Secretaries will not be accountable for their respective portfolio areas. In all other respects they will be carrying out much the same functions in this chamber as Ministers perform. </PARA>
<PARA>  Parliamentary Secretaries are going to be able to introduce Bills, to move for the second reading and to see through the House legislation coming from various departments and Cabinet. Despite our opposition, they have already at various times been in charge of the House. As the Government treads down this path of investing Parliamentary Secretaries with powers that almost match those of Ministers for the purpose of duties in this House, the only conclusion is that this is another step by the Executive to erode the authority of the Parliament and the processes of this place. </PARA>
<PARA>  In this context, we all know that not so long ago the Government was floating the idea of rostering groups of Ministers for Question Time on a weekly basis. This would have had the effect of reducing the exposure of Ministers to questions on their administration and the eliciting of information concerning their portfolios. Fortunately, this has not come to fruition. If it had, it would have been another example of the Government seeking to downgrade the Parliament and the proceedings of this place. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have already had enough experience of this through most of the life of the Hawke Government. It has ruthlessly resorted to the guillotine to process its legislation. The House will be aware that I have repeatedly protested against this practice of the Government's short-circuiting the legislative process by not allowing adequate time for proper scrutiny and analysis of legislation and often far less for debate. I am glad to be able to say, though, that this current sitting has been much better managed than in the past. I am hoping that this will be a guillotine-free sitting, which, having regard to the Hawke Government's record, would be a parliamentary landmark. </PARA>
<PARA>  With this motion, making it unnecessary for Ministers to handle their own legislation in the House, this Parliament is further shunned. In the interests of the institution of parliament, this should not be tolerated. Parliamentary Secretaries have a role in relieving the ministerial workload, but, in assigning duties relating to this House, distinctive functions should be retained as the responsibility of Ministers. It is our view that the carriage of legislation should be one of them. </PARA>
<PARA>  The reason for having Parliamentary Secretaries is to assist Ministers. But this assistance should be defined so that it does not impinge on the parliamentary process or take over responsibilities that should be the reserve of the responsible Ministers. Parliamentary Secretaries, to be effective, should have a range of particular but discrete tasks that do not cut across the full ambit of the Minister's responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA>  A broad outline of the sorts of tasks Parliamentary Secretaries should perform was given when we introduced the Parliamentary Secretaries Act in 1980. It was suggested that members serving in the role of Parliamentary Secretary could provide valuable assistance to Ministers by undertaking, as requested, a range of duties, including assistance with correspondence and other papers, liaising with other members of parliament and meeting with delegations and clients of the department and authorities, and other representational activities. Parliamentary Secretaries will be able to play a very useful role, particularly in assisting to bring the views of others to the attention of Ministers. Ministers must, of course, retain their responsibility to parliament. These tasks were largely echoed by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in his statement announcing the appointment of the present Parliamentary Secretaries. Otherwise, the Parliamentary Secretary has to become answerable to the House for those things. That is why the Opposition is opposing this motion. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is our view that Ministers should be fully responsible for the legislation they present here. If the Government believes that its Ministers are so overworked that it needs to upgrade the responsibilities of Parliamentary Secretaries, it should face up to making them Ministers and bring in the necessary amendments to increase the size of the Ministry. The Opposition does not advocate this course of action. On the contrary, we believe that any perceived overload on Ministers stems from the Government's poor management and its ineptitude in organising itself. Instead of shifting more ministerial responsibilities to Parliamentary Secretaries, the Executive should be reorganising itself and looking to ways of improving its administrative practices. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government's policy paralysis has been clearly evident in recent weeks. We have seen it backing and filling over its media ownership policy as well as its other communication areas, its absolute ineffectiveness in coming to grips with the devastating and growing unemployment problem, as well as a major split over Medicare, to name just a few of the signs. There have been Cabinet meetings finishing at 3 o'clock in the morning, with decisions on major issues such as media ownership being made as Ministers were about to leave. It all adds up to chaos and a government completely lacking in direction. </PARA>
<PARA>  The real role of Parliamentary Secretaries is meant to be supportive. However, if the Government wants to make them more than that and if it continues to pursue such a course, of which this motion is indicative, it could run the danger of raising the spectre of section 44 of the Constitution and the disqualification that arises from a member of parliament who is not a Minister holding an office of profit under the Crown. Honourable members will be aware that the section says:</PARA>
<PARA>Any person who . . . holds any office of profit under the Crown, or any pension payable during the pleasure of the Crown out of any of the revenues of the Commonwealth . . . shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the current arrangements for Parliamentary Secretaries as regards remuneration for expenses incurred in the performance of the duties of their appointment, that problem does not arise. However, past experience dictates that it is something that needs to be watched as governments search for ways to ease the burden on Ministers without increasing the size of the Ministry. </PARA>
<PARA>  The motion before the House is another example of the Hawke Government reverting to the old Fabian device of gradualism, as spelt out by the Prime Minister in 1984, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>For the right moment you must wait . . . but when the time comes you must strike hard. </PARA>
<PARA>Through the life of the Hawke Government in so many instances we have seen its technique of nibbling away at the edges and then bringing in a major change through the back door. This motion has all those hallmarks and we consider it unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the primary principles of ministerial responsibility is accountability to this Parliament. This accountability is discharged in two ways: firstly, through being present during Question Time to be cross-examined on policy matters; and, secondly, through advocating and defending legislation introduced into the Parliament. The motion before the House will remove one of those two main pillars of accountability. The Opposition is strongly opposed to it and we will vote against it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I would like to make some observations about this motion in the context of support for my colleague the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife). The Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) graciously referred to the Parliamentary Secretaries Act 1980. He pointed out that that legislation was introduced by the Fraser Government. That is absolutely correct. I had some small part in that because the then Prime Minister asked me to do the actual discussion paper upon which that proposal was based. Naturally, I have a longstanding interest in the development of the concept of Parliamentary Secretaries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I totally support the views of my colleague the honourable member for Hume in the context of the growth of the use of Parliamentary Secretaries, vis-a-vis the influence of that new office in the context of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>  Honourable members should be well aware of the fact that the concept of the Parliamentary Secretary essentially grew out of the Westminster system. It was introduced by the British in the nineteenth century when they had two forms of secretaries: they had parliamentary private secretaries, who were personal appointees of Ministers and secretaries of state; and they also had parliamentary secretaries, who had additional responsibilities of a more constitutionally based nature, despite the fact that the British have no written constitution. </PARA>
<PARA>  The point made by the honourable member for Hume is absolutely correct. He was pointing out that if it was such a wonderful idea to have Parliamentary Secretaries, one has to ask the question: why was it not introduced at the time of the Hawke Government in 1983? Why was it that the Hawke Government let such a substantial number of years pass before it took up the initiative of the Fraser years?</PARA>
<PARA>  The fact is that the Government introduced Parliamentary Secretaries finally because of the basic embarrassment of having on the back bench too many people regarded as `rich in talent' to whom it wanted to give positions by which they could be involved in some way in sharing the limelight. Therefore, the decision was taken that the easy way out of the problem was to have a few Parliamentary Secretaries. </PARA>
<PARA>  Then the task facing the Government was: what can we make them do? In fairness, I think I would have to say that the initial period, 1980 to 1982-83, was, for us, very much a trial period. I think the responsibilities which were given to Parliamentary Secretaries in that period were very limited indeed. In fact, as I recall, we had only two of them, one helping the Leader of the National Party and one helping the Prime Minister. Later on we had a third, now Senator Michael Baume, who was assisting the Treasurer. In all fairness, one has to say on the record that the Fraser years were not exactly ones of munificence in terms of appointments to this particular office. </PARA>
<PARA>  Nevertheless, the Government went down this road. It did so, as I said, to find jobs for people. Having done that, it then wondered what it could do. As the honourable member for Hume absolutely rightly points out, the weak point in the whole procedure was to ask what Parliamentary Secretaries could do within the Parliament to remove the `weight' off Ministers. It has to be stated once again that, if one is setting about weakening the status of Parliament by minimising the opportunities for Ministers to be here and to be seen to be accountable to the Parliament, then, in the longer term, the trend which has been too evident for far too long will be once again set in motion. That is, the role of Parliament will become even less relevant than it has been over recent decades. </PARA>
<PARA>  The simple reality, which is the view of the Opposition, is that Parliamentary Secretaries should not be used in the Chamber as an alternative to Ministers. It has to be emphasised that a proposal for a system of rostered Ministers at Question Time was put forward as a serious concept by the Prime Minister. It was not suggested, as I understand it, that Parliamentary Secretaries should necessarily fill the gap. They certainly could not do that because they have no constitutional responsibility for the passage of legislation or for the administration of legislation. Under the Act, they have the responsibility of assisting Ministers in the conduct of their normal administrative duties. Those duties, of course, are relevant and they are very onerous on a Minister, whether they be correspondence, liaison, representations, attending functions or, as has been the case in recent years, taking over the actual administration of some legislation. That is particularly the case in the social security area, where I know the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) is very closely involved. All of us on this side who have received his letters and dealt with him would support the view that he has done a good job in that particular context. </PARA>
<PARA>  But the point still has to be emphasised that we cannot support a proposition which will effectively give Ministers of the Crown the opportunity, indeed the excuse, for reducing even further their day to day contact with members of this Parliament, and certainly their responsibilities to the Parliament to be, above all, accountable for their actions, whether in Question Time or in the passage of legislation. There is no doubt--it is on the record--that all governments have had the problem of trying to work out methodologies by which Ministers can be most effectively utilised without wearing them out. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Hume rightly pointed out that the Government has introduced the concept of functional ministries. This has a lot going for it. For many years Crown law officers and succeeding Attorneys-General argued whether in fact one could have functional Ministers as distinct from departmental Ministers. It still has not been tested in the courts and, for the sake of the Government, I hope it never is. Nevertheless, it was an adequate response to the needs of growing administrative responsibilities and duties. </PARA>
<PARA>  One has therefore to ask the very fundamental question of whether, apart from giving good ministerial training, presumably to would-be Parliamentary Secretaries or could-be Ministers, this Parliament at this stage should be asked by the Government to support a proposition which will effectively reduce the contact between members of this House and Ministers of the Crown?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-No. I am really keen to support the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) in his motion. However, the Manager of Opposition Business, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife), has raised a number of issues. In particular, he is very concerned about ministerial accountability. He cites an earlier proposition about the rostering of Question Time and how this may be an abrogation of that process of accountability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I think that Opposition members ought to ask themselves how well they scrutinise each portfolio area of the Ministers in this House during Question Time. If we examined the questions directed to Ministers by the Opposition, it would become quite apparent, because of their tactics, that members of the Opposition are not capable of such scrutiny and that certain portfolio areas are not receiving the degree of accountability that the Opposition is advocating should be a hallmark of this place. Rostering of Question Time certainly has the distinct advantage of increasing ministerial accountability.</PARA>
<PARA>  I guess that is my point. If this Parliament is to be relevant, it is important that it change with the times. The question was raised: why were Parliamentary Secretaries not introduced at the beginning of the Hawke term of office? Clearly it was because super-ministries were not developed at that time. If the Opposition wants to run with the line that in this term of office we had the problem of what we should do with so many backbenchers, I point out that it was a greater problem in the previous Parliament. It is a rather spurious point. </PARA>
<PARA>  I find it hard to believe that, if Opposition members want to portray themselves as the great guardians of accountability in the Parliament, they can sustain the proposition that ministerial accountability is preserved by Parliamentary Secretaries in the Senate being accommodated by this proposed change, as has been the case with Senator McMullan since June of this year, but that somehow in this House it would be very difficult to do so. In fact, often the reverse is the case; propositions that may be embraced in this House may be rejected by the Senate. Here we have an interesting contradiction. </PARA>
<PARA>  If we want to look at ministerial accountability, of course, it is not only through the processes of Question Time that this Parliament has the opportunity to scrutinise Ministers. Indeed, I think one of the great reforms referred to by the Leader of the House has been the establishment of the committee system. This Government has been committed to enhancing the role of the committee system. Just recently, further responsibilities were added to House of Representatives committees, which allow even further scrutiny of Ministers and their portfolio areas. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to conclude on this note: this is a sensible change. It in no way offends the traditions of this House that I hold as dear as Opposition members do, and I am sure that I can speak for other Government members in making that statement. Indeed, all that the motion proposes to do is harmonise Standing Orders, agreed to by the Opposition members in the Senate, so that the same procedures apply in this House as in the Senate. I suggest that the Opposition would do well in not automatically trying to reject every proposed change to make this House and this Parliament more relevant to the times. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Like the Manager of Opposition Business, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife) and the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly), I rise to oppose this motion. Of course, the historical circumstances do not really just go back to the Fraser Government days. The first Parliamentary Secretaries in this Parliament were constituted while the late Sir William McMahon was Prime Minister in about 1970.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The nature and character of the duties then imposed on Parliamentary Secretaries were not dissimilar to those specified by the Manager of Opposition Business, and referred to by the honourable member for Bradfield. We have had set down a range of areas where they could specifically be of assistance to Ministers. Both in government and in opposition I have found that those Parliamentary Secretaries, in assistance to me as a Minister and a party leader, have been invaluable. So the circumstances and the climate of the appointments are not at issue. </PARA>
<PARA>  My concern is threefold: first there seems to be from the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) and the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) a belief that there is a total parallel between the Senate and the House of Representatives. I will try to persuade them both that there are a number of fundamental differences. For a long time, since the late Lionel Murphy was in the Senate, there has been a proliferation of committees in the Senate of a different order and a different character from those that function in this place. Whilst for the first time in this Parliament I have participated in the parliamentary committee system, to my mind there is a total difference between the responsibilities to the government of members and committees of a lower House--the chamber of the people, the chamber from which the Prime Minister is elected--and those of a House of review. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, the Senate is an elected chamber. It has many elements of difference from the House of Lords, on which to a degree it was modelled in our Constitution. Significantly, the House of review is there to pursue scrutiny of legislation and scrutiny of the actions of government in greater detail than is possible in this place. For all of us there is a consciousness that after our second reading debates we have a very perfunctory committee stage debate. </PARA>
<PARA>  If we consider debates on the Estimates, there is a big contrast between what takes place in the House of Representatives and what takes place in the Senate. In the Senate there is significantly greater opportunity for scrutiny of the line by line allocations than is the case in this chamber. It is true that we did have Estimates committees in this place. When I was a senior Minister, I was one of those who suggested that it was difficult to provide the time necessary for that scrutiny to be facilitated, and it is of interest that in the changes to which the Leader of the House referred there has been no suggestion that we return to Estimates committees in this place. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do not need to outline for those who are here the extent to which there is a difference between the two Houses. There is a totally different environment within which legislation and the functions of government proceed in the Senate and in the House of Representatives. I understand therefore the role played by Senator McMullan. Within the Senate he is one of a few Government members who are entitled to sit at the front bench and who are in fact responsible for all those portfolios that are largely represented in this chamber. So do not let us for one moment draw a parallel between the responsibilities of the two Houses. </PARA>
<PARA>  The second area of concern is with the doctrine of the separation of powers, which has been addressed in various forums with greater or less understanding. Let us be quite clear that there has not been and can never be any real doubt about the role of the courts and the way in which they operate separately from the administration and the legislature. But within this chamber the separation between the administration and the legislature of recent years has become more tenuous. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is true that, because we have inherited the Westminster system, our Prime Minister, Leader of the Opposition, Ministers and all members of the front bench on both sides are elected members of the Parliament. For all that we have a provision under our Constitution whereby for a period of three months a Minister need not be a member of either House. There is a requirement that, if he is not after three months, his office be terminated. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is essential when we look at the Westminster system that we recognise some of the responsibilities as well as the opportunities that flow from that relationship between the administration and the legislature. One of those responsibilities for those who are Ministers is that they retain a contact with the Parliament, that they do not just appear during Question Time. I do not intend to pursue the argument of the honourable member for Hume and the honourable member for Bradfield, although I endorse it, about other proposals for the rostering of Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is important that Ministers listen to and understand the proceedings of this chamber. I find it deplorable, for all that we have a quorum procedure which is used basically for political purposes, that for so much of the time there is barely a soul in this place. Those who come to hear proceedings in the chamber must wonder what the devil everybody is doing. I can assure them that everybody is working. But that is not really the argument. The argument is that this chamber should be the basis from which argument is allowed on matters of prime public importance affecting the Australian electorate, Australia's relationships with other countries, the economy and all those significant issues that are allocated to the Commonwealth under the Constitution, and others that are of general public interest. </PARA>
<PARA>  I commend the Leader of the House for some of the changes that he has introduced. But let us be realistic. We have had some procedural changes, including those on Thursday morning which give private members greater opportunities to speak, and other changes that flow from them. But, while they have allowed greater opportunities for private members to speak, realistically those speaking opportunities are not translated into legislative opportunities. They are not translated into the passage of private members' Bills. The consideration is perfunctory, as we all know. Sure, there is a procedure to allow a second reading speech, but, unless the Government adopts the legislation as its own, that is the end of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA>  Indeed, there is no longer a reasonable procedure by which any member of the Opposition or any back bench member can be scrutinised--nor, as I understand it from this motion, will even Parliamentary Secretaries be--on matters for which they are responsible. Under the old procedure, if a member, being a private member of this place, were to have a Bill in his name, he could be asked questions relating to that Bill, and there was a limited opportunity. That is no longer there. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is important that we understand that this measure is really yet another step to reduce the powers of the private member in his relationship with the administration. I see it as a greater separation between the administration and the chamber and a lessening of the opportunities for those who are Ministers to listen to and understand the debate. </PARA>
<PARA>  As the honourable member for Hume has suggested, one immediate consequence will be that during second reading debates--and certainly during the committee stage--there will be no Minister at the table; Parliamentary Secretaries will be largely rostered for duty. I know it is an onerous duty. I know that it is a responsibility that at times many of us find somewhat irksome. </PARA>
<PARA>  But the Minister responsible for a Bill should be in the chamber during debate because members from either side may have a view that they feel they strongly need to express. They may have concerns that relate to their electorate or to some area in which they have some special knowledge, or they may have amendments that they feel are significant. We all know how frequently legislation is returned from the other place because it has been dealt with inadequately either at the Cabinet level, at the parliamentary counsel level or in scrutiny through this chamber. There are far too many errors in legislation which should not happen and should not be allowed. Often those could be redressed if some consideration were given to submissions made within debate in this chamber. I know that so often the debate is political--I accept that--and I know that it is difficult for Ministers, particularly senior Ministers, to spend time in the chamber. But my concern is in the reduction of the powers of this place and what I see as the greater separation of the relationship between the government and the House. </PARA>
<PARA>  The third area of concern to me is in the restructuring of the Ministry itself. I accept, and I have spoken to the Leader of the House on several occasions about, the degree to which the restraints of section 44 of the Constitution, to which the honourable member for Hume referred, impose discipline and make it difficult for Parliamentary Secretaries to perform the role in some sense that one would like them to perform. I support the idea of functional Ministries. I like the idea of having a senior Cabinet Minister who is able to spend more time considering policy. But that separation within the Ministry is really now being extended to a far greater degree by the additional powers to be given to these Parliamentary Secretaries. As I see it, what is being done is the creation, to a greater degree than ever before, of a third tier of Minister. That third tier will be unpaid, thanks to section 44, but nevertheless will be largely given the responsibilities of a Minister within this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA>  If there is a role for Parliamentary Secretaries, I believe that that role should be enhanced outside of the chamber, not within it. We have all spoken about the extent to which today party room and factional deals tend to be the politics of administration. We all know the extent to which the bureaucracy is expanding. We all know the degree to which, in looking and caring for individual departments, there is, certainly under the Labor regime, a far greater difficulty in keeping in touch with Peter, Paul and all those others out there in the woodwork. But, surely, that is an area to which Parliamentary Secretaries could be directed, as the charter of responsibilities to which the Manager of Opposition Business referred is intended to provide the responsibilities of Parliamentary Secretaries. </PARA>
<PARA>  This measure does not enhance a proper and more efficient role of the ministry. I think there is a reason for Parliamentary Secretaries to try to lighten the load of senior Ministers in particular, so that they can spend more time on policy issues, so that they can spend more time in Cabinet and so that they can spend more time in the House. It is because of that last vital obligation that I see this measure as going in exactly the reverse direction. </PARA>
<PARA>  I oppose the measure and do not believe that it is going to assist the functioning of government in any way. I regret that such a fundamental change is apparently to be pushed through in a climate where I believe there will be a significant alteration to the relationships between individual members--because Parliamentary Secretaries will have an enhanced status. I regret that the measure should be forced through against the wishes of the Opposition and in a way which is certainly going to lead to a fundamental division of opinion on the way in which this Parliament should function. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-in reply--In summing up, I thank honourable members who have participated in the debate. We get far too few opportunities to discuss the nature of our House and what it does. Even though I cannot agree with the three Opposition spokesmen on this matter, and do agree with my colleague the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister (Mr Price), I nevertheless acknowledge the fact that the views they have put come from a wealth of parliamentary and governmental experience. It is not as though we on this side of the House do not take their views seriously; we do, but we think they are unnecessary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Basically, if a study is made of the paper to which I have referred, unquestionably we are giving as much authority to Parliamentary Secretaries as anyone else does; we are not in that regard totally unique. A large number of modern democratic governments that operate with something that approximates the Westminster system have found it necessary to create the institution of Parliamentary Secretary and give Parliamentary Secretaries roles that do not simply refer to the administrative tasks of Ministers in their Departments, but also relate to administrative and legislative tasks in the House. </PARA>
<PARA>  We did not implement the office of Parliamentary Secretary in the initial stages of our Government. I think in so doing we were misguided. We took the view that at the time the Opposition introduced the institution of Parliamentary Secretaries, when it was in government, Parliamentary Secretaries were introduced for something like the reasons that have been described as the reasons why we introduced Parliamentary Secretaries in the last couple of years. I am sure that our arguments to the Opposition when it was in government and introduced Parliamentary Secretaries were unsoundly founded, as are the same arguments applied to ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA>  The reality is that the super-ministries were created only after enormously careful checking with the Attorney-General's Department and an assortment of outside opinions, because of the sorts of risks that both the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and the Manager of Opposition Business, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife), referred to. The super-ministries were created only after that advice said that it was okay to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>  We very rapidly reached a situation where the narrowing of the portfolio base created problems. This was particularly so where portfolios had responsibility for omnibus legislation, as my portfolio does every session. Every session we have an omnibus transport and communications Bill of some description in which we are fixing up some part of one of the plethora of Acts for which the Transport and Communications Minister is responsible, but which does not necessarily involve substantial legislative and policy activity on his part. </PARA>
<PARA>  Oddly enough, such matters tend to be the parts of the portfolio which are effectively administered by the Parliamentary Secretary. Parliamentary Secretaries are well placed to be able to handle them effectively in the Parliament and respond to them. For example, my Parliamentary Secretary has responsibility for frequency allocations and for a whole range of that type of backbreaking work which is appalling in terms of the amount of correspondence that it generates but is not necessarily of a very high policy content. He knows a lot more about it than I do. It is not inappropriate that he ought to be in a position where he answers for that here in Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>  The right honourable gentlemen who spoke last for the Opposition correctly pointed out differences in the roles of the Senate and the House. He said that senators, largely because of functions they have attributed to themselves--again, I fully concede, largely on the initiatives of Labor Party senators back in the late 1960s--have created over the last 25 years a greater level of differentiation between the functions of the Senate and the House than there has ever been before. That is partly as a result of the powers senators have accrued for themselves and partly as a result of the working through of the changes introduced by Arthur Calwell in 1949, effectively making for proportional representation in the Senate. For a period of time, because of the fact that the two-party system held up rather well for about 20 or 30 years after that, the full potential for the implications were not realised. However, the two-party system, at least in Senate voting habits, has, to a considerable degree, fallen apart since the late 1960s. </PARA>
<PARA>  As Parliament increases in size, and by virtue of the fact that the Opposition, when in government, unfortunately failed to get through its nexus-breaking constitutional amendments back in the late 1960s, the Senate must inevitably increase in size as well. That new character of the Senate will become more manifest as time goes by and as successive governments adjust the size of the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, there is a similarity between the functions here for Parliamentary Secretaries and the functions that Senator McMullan performs. Basically, as with Ministers in the Senate, whilst an onerous part of Senator McMullan's duties is representational as far as his colleagues in the Senate are concerned, and while he has to handle legislation in the Senate which is not germane to his portfolio area, he nevertheless handles legislation himself; and legislation is initiated in the Senate and passed to the House. Senator McMullan, under the changes, has the authority to do that, in the same way we are extending the authority here, and he will utilise that authority. The authority, as I have said, has been granted to him on a bipartisan basis. </PARA>
<PARA>  Honourable members opposite are sincere in their concerns about the possible impact on ministerial accountability. I would not accuse the right honourable member of grandstanding on this for political purposes, if for no other reason than that, while the matter should have been of vital interest to everybody in the House, I do not regard these procedures necessarily as of vital interest to anybody outside this place. Therefore, there is not much percentage in the right honourable member adopting an obstructive view in this place for political reasons. Nevertheless, I do think he is wrong. The basic problem that we have here with ministerial accountability is not due to any set of procedures that may arise from the creation of the position of Parliamentary Secretary; it arises because of the nature of this House in relation to the Executive. This House supports an Executive. If it does not do that, the country is not governed. The restraints that are placed on private members in this place stem largely from that fact. Perhaps the restraints are too heavy. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think the right honourable member for New England was wrong in one area. It is true that we have a situation here where more private members' legislation has been moved and had a second reading in this place than ever before in the history of the Parliament. It does not actually come through to any fruition unless the Government takes it up, largely as a result of the way in which the Selection Committee operates and the amount of time that is made available for honourable members. </PARA>
<PARA>  Nevertheless, it remains a possibility that, if any member in this chamber actually moves a piece of private member's legislation and it is on the books and on the Notice Paper, it is open to members of the Parliament to question that member on it in this place. So for all those who have put forward things like the Flags Bill and all the rest of it, it is possible, should anyone want to ask a question about the processes being undertaken, for them to respond to that question. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Manager of Opposition Business raised the issue of whether or not this would bring into question any element of the situation that the Parliamentary Secretaries confront in relation to the office of profit question. It does not really impact upon that. Not only Parliamentary Secretaries conceivably suffer that problem; there are also Chairmen of Committees for whom that could conceivably arise. All I can say is, from my own experience in trying to get these fellows a raise every now and again, or a bit better treatment--at least to the level of the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee or whatever--that I am constantly warned that there has to be a very detailed investigation by the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) to make sure that their positions are not in fact placed at risk. To this point of time it is a matter that the Attorney-General has under consideration. But the extension of powers does not go to that. It might go to the sympathy with which we might view an allowance claimed by the Parliamentary Secretaries, but it does not go to whether or not they are actually to be entitled to that. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Manager of Opposition Business also raised the matter of Question Time, and was cheerful about the fact that a proposition circulated to the Opposition by the Government did not subsequently proceed, by and large because we did not really think it reasonable to ram through the Opposition a change in the nature of Question Time if the Opposition really did not want to play ball with it. Personally, as someone who is very much an advocate of that proposal, I am disappointed. Ministers in Question Time here are not subject to being rendered accountable for their portfolios. Here, the political issues of the day get a run. Questions are largely directed to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), and frequently they are directed to the Prime Minister when in fact there are Ministers along the front bench who have portfolio accountability for the matters raised. It is not an abuse of Question Time; it is clearly open to the Opposition to do that, but it does not add to the accountability of the place. </PARA>
<PARA>  If there were a situation where that sort of process took place perhaps once a week, as happens in the United Kingdom Parliament, that would be fine, but the rest of the time there would be serious, detailed consideration given to the way in which each Minister administers his portfolio. It necessarily goes beyond what is generated by the headlines of the day. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I said, this is not something we will press on the Opposition. On reflection, over time, the Opposition might well like to think about that, and think about whether or not in practical terms it would get a better performance in Question Time from the Government and be able to engage in more serious scrutiny of what the Government does. I always remember Barry Cohen, when he was a member of this place, telling me that the best hits we ever scored on the Opposition when it was in government were when the front bench walked away from Question Time. I must say we used to do that a bit more frequently than this Opposition seems to have done in the last eight years. Ministers suddenly started getting pinged on the administration of their portfolios, as of course they turned up to Question Time without being briefed for it. All that every Minister is briefed on in this place are the issues of the day that impact upon his portfolio. What he does not get briefed on is the detailed administration of that portfolio. I remember that Barry Cohen, once or twice, very effectively got under the guard of Ministers on that subject, to their not inconsiderable embarrassment. I do think that is something the Opposition ought to bear in mind. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think this change in relation to Parliamentary Secretaries is a good one. It is one which will stand the test of time. If the Opposition finds itself in government, I very much doubt whether it will walk away from anything we have done in relation to Parliamentary Secretaries. I also understand that the debate does offer opportunities to people to get up and make wide-ranging criticisms of some of the Executive's handling of the Parliament. Some of the points are valid; some are unavoidable. As I said, I do appreciate the spirit in which the Opposition and, indeed, our side of the House have conducted this debate. </PARA>

<PARA>  (6) the arrangements relating to the live television broadcast and rebroadcast of proceedings and excerpts of proceedings of the House of Representatives shall be reviewed by the committee established under paragraph (3) of this resolution prior to the end of the 1993 Autumn sittings of the House; and</PARA>
<PARA>  (7) the House requests the Government to seek advice from the Attorney-General as to the legal position of bodies authorised to receive the signal of proceedings with a view to the House granting access to that signal to government departments, political party headquarters and others. </PARA>
<PARA>  This motion deals with the recommendations of the Select Committee on the Televising of the House of Representatives dealing with the televising of Parliament, extending the authority of the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings and formalising its structure somewhat. I guess the most significant change that will emerge from the Committee's recommendations will be to permit the televising of adjournment debates. By and large, we think the televising of Parliament has worked well. There have been breaches of the rules every now and then, but they have not been extensive and they were able to be dealt with, so I do not think very many problems will emerge from that. </PARA>
<PARA>  The passage of this motion will create the anomaly that the rules for broadcasting the House on radio will now be somewhat different from the rules associated with television. I think the Committee should give early consideration to the implications of that and recommend some appropriate changes on the strength of what it finds. </PARA>
<PARA>  One section of the motion deals with a request to the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) for advice. That advice arrived a fair bit earlier than we expected it would--as the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Fife) knows, because we gave him a copy of it--but I will leave the motion as it stands and we will pass that advice straight to the Committee rather than go through the bother of trying to devise a different set of words which would allow the Committee to take that on board. From my understanding of conversations between the Parliamentary Liaison Officer and the Manager of Opposition Business, I do not think the Opposition has much trouble with this motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The motion moved by the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) arises from the recommendations in the report of the Select Committee on the Televising of the House of Representatives, which was tabled in August. The Opposition supports this motion, which proposes the adoption of the 12 recommendations made by the Committee in its report entitled The Eyes Have It.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In a few instances the Opposition would have liked this motion, which provides for the live broadcasting of the proceedings of this chamber to continue on television, to go a little further. I will refer to these later. But, as there is provision for another review in 1993, we believe it is reasonable to see how these guidelines work and to amend them again, if necessary, following the review. </PARA>
<PARA>  Two of the most important recommendations which will be adopted if this motion is agreed to are the provision for the televising of committees of the House and, as the Leader of the House mentioned, the adjournment debate. This is an advance which the Opposition welcomes. We have been saying for some time that there did not seem to be any valid reason for excluding the adjournment debate from either television or radio. If the adjournment debate is to be available for television, it must follow that it should be carried on radio. Accordingly, I assume that the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings, as referred to by the Leader of the House, will take this up and ensure that the necessary adjustment is made. This will end the broadcasting prohibition on the adjournment debate, which has been in force since 1946--apparently imposed at the time for no other reason than a financial consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>  Equally important is the decision to recommend that the committees of this House can be telecast. This will not only broaden the scope of coverage available to TV news organisations but also give the Australian people an insight into some of the major work undertaken by committees. It will also help them to have a better understanding of the work that parliamentarians are involved in while in Canberra. Being able to see the work of the committees will help members of the community to appreciate that being a member of parliament not only involves making speeches and asking questions in the House but also includes a range of other activities as important--sometimes more so--as what transpires in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA>  In effect, through the adoption of this motion based on the select committee's report to Parliament, I am glad to say that we are catching up with the television age. Australia was among the pioneers in the radio broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings, being the second national Parliament of the Commonwealth of Nations, after New Zealand, to introduce the practice. </PARA>
<PARA>  So far as television is concerned, we in this House have moved much more cautiously, with a trial period of televising which began only in February of this year. In the interim, of course, we have permitted the television cameras to record some of the more notable parliamentary events. Since 1984, televising of the Budget Speech and reply has become an accepted component of proceedings of the House. Television coverage of several other major economic statements and Opposition replies has also been authorised, as well as the debate on the motion of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) of January 1991 relating to the Gulf war. </PARA>
<PARA>   All this has provided valuable preparation, but it has been no real substitute for the public being able to get some appreciation of what goes on in Parliament through live telecasts of proceedings. It is true, of course, that the guidelines will continue to impose some restrictions, but they are sufficiently broad to convey what really goes on here in what is the nation's major political forum. </PARA>
<PARA>  In this respect, I have one or two critical reservations. I would have preferred the adoption of a common set of guidelines for both Houses. I regret, for instance, that no withdrawals or points of order are to be shown in any replay of broadcast, even though they have been carried earlier in the live version. This suggests a sensitivity to image, rather than being prepared to present what goes on here in the way that it happens. </PARA>
<PARA>  Sanitisation will not engender the esteem that we should be seeking for both the Parliament and its work. There has to be an openness about what goes on here if we are to improve the public's perception of politicians and the political process in Australia. There is, after all, a sense of disillusion in the community about politicians and about what they promise and what they deliver. By opening this House to television viewers right around the country, we are imposing a discipline on ourselves to raise our standards and address the urgent issues which confront our nation so that people can see that we can responsibly represent their interests. </PARA>
<PARA>  It probably is necessary, as has been recommended, that the Joint Statutory Committee on Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings review the scheduling of radio broadcasting of proceedings, though I recognise that there are difficulties. However, any such review should in no way seek to curtail television coverage which, as the Committee's report shows, is creating viewer interest with, according to a recent survey, an average of 68,000 people being drawn to Question Time. </PARA>
<PARA>  For some time I had been concerned about whether the guidelines covering Question Time were flexible enough to fully capture that very lively segment of the proceedings. However, I am now assured that the camera guidelines, with provision for wide-angle shots, do provide scope for conveying the real character of Question Time. But it is something that should still be monitored between now and the next review. </PARA>
<PARA>   I note too the suggestion for a weekly parliamentary program. I trust that this will be pursued. I think an interesting round-up program interspersed with some comment and interviews could emerge and generate interest, not only on Australian networks but also perhaps overseas. It is certainly worthy of consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>   We are proposing here to allow television stations to use parliamentary excerpts in their promos on air. In taking up this privilege, they must accept that they are bound to use parliamentary material in station promos in a fair and responsible way for the genuine promotion of bona fide news. Any dramatic distortion of Parliament, or use of parliamentary excerpts in a way that diminishes the standing of the Parliament, should not be tolerated by this House, and the Speaker and the Committee will need to carefully watch this aspect. </PARA>
<PARA>   Another matter that I wish to raise in this debate is the question of television and radio coverage when, and if, the Leader of the Opposition chooses to reply in a major debate, such as the Budget, at a different timeslot to the Prime Minister, the Treasurer or any other Minister who might have carriage of the legislation. Strictly speaking, under the Standing Orders the Leader of the Opposition should be able to reply to the Budget or any other major Government statement at whatever time he chooses. While there is nothing to compel TV and radio coverage of such a reply, over the years reciprocal coverage has become established practice. On the basis of fairness and balance that, of course, should continue. But I suggest that the networks should be prepared to cover the Leader of the Opposition, even when he chooses to reply in a different timeslot to the Government spokesperson, especially when this is clearly permissible under the Standing Orders. </PARA>
<PARA>  The conditions set down for televising state that reporting must be fair and accurate and such `as to provide a balanced presentation of differing views'. While I realise that covering the Leader of the Opposition at a different timeslot may present some programming difficulties, it was no problem when the Budget Speech was given at 7.30 p.m. If the Opposition chooses to make its response at that time, or at 8 o'clock, I suggest that TV coverage should be extended to it on the same basis as the Government's offering. The principle should be that television should match one live speech with another live speech. The timing of speeches in the Parliament is a matter for the Parliament. It is television's duty to convey the proceedings of Parliament as they happen. This is certainly an area that needs clarification and one which should be resolved before next year's Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>  While, apart from the decision to televise the adjournment debate and the proceedings of the committees of the House, the general thrust of what is proposed does not really change the nature of the telecasts to any great degree from what we had during the trial period, they are a significant step forward in that we are formally providing for telecasts of the proceedings of the House. We have been tardy in coming to this point and, as the record shows, the Government has had to be goaded into it under Opposition pressure. </PARA>
<PARA>  Although the viewing audience may not be big, the surveys that have been done show that the numbers are growing. When something really big occurs more people turn to the TV, and some of those are usually retained as regular viewers. For people in our rural communities who tend to follow what goes on more closely than those in metropolitan areas, regular telecasting of Parliament is going to be a boon, especially the repeat broadcasts in the evening. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is no doubt that the televising of our proceedings would go some way to restoring the relevance of this House to the affairs of the nation. With individual members more visible to their constituencies, I hope it will also see us lift our game and that Question Time will become more relevant and less demeaned by overuse of Dorothy Dixers and longwinded ministerial replies. I hope there will also be less resort to the guillotine which has been so much a feature of this Government's legislative process. </PARA>
<PARA>  Carriage of this motion will be another landmark in the history of this Parliament and I believe that it will enhance the role of the House in the democratic process. </PARA>
<PARA>  Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Prior to the suspension of the sitting for lunch, we were debating the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1991, which, interestingly enough, was introduced by the Treasurer (Mr Kerin), whose role in this field has not been particularly notable. I will address some aspects of that in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  For my part, a number of these changes are very welcome. Indeed, as I was Minister for Social Services for a period of three to four years, I know the difficulties in trying to ensure that there are not too many anomalies in the welfare system. I register that, every time one adjusts a benefit, all one does is move the margins of discontent. </PARA>
<PARA>  In several of the proposals there is much to be commended. For example, the new child bereavement payments, which provide for some continuity of payments of family allowance after the death of a child, are to be commended. The tragedy of the Strathfield shootings in the circumstances which have been discussed in the House earlier I think are matters which every honourable member would endorse. Indeed, there is nothing more tragic than the death of a child in a family, and I think the circumstances of providing for that continuity of entitlement are certainly something that we would all accept. </PARA>
<PARA>  Equally, I believe the increase in child disability allowance needs to be supported. I have long had a fear that there are enormous difficulties in trying to provide equity for those with disability. I am not happy with the changes that the Government has introduced in some respects for the handling of those who have disabilities. For all that I know, it is the fashion that they be housed separately and many succeed in accommodating their new environments very effectively. </PARA>
<PARA>  Parents are worried--through the Challenge Foundation, I know that some worry greatly--that as their children grow older their ability to be able to care for them under these new arrangements will become less and, when they go, there is the inevitable concern as to whether or not there will be anybody to care for them at all. I support that amendment. I equally agree with the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) and the opposition he expressed to the reduction in rent assistance waiting periods. </PARA>
<PARA>  The part of the legislation to which I really want to draw the attention of the House and on which I wish to speak is that pertaining to family allowance. I think all of us are aware that this is the current form of child endowment, a measure introduced by Harold Holt in the 1941 Budget. Over the years, this measure has in a way been related to the benefit first introduced in the industrial sense through the Harvester decision, when there was essentially a basic wage for a man and a wife and their two children. </PARA>
<PARA>  With the social changes that have occurred and the inevitable pressures that there are on the family, I want to express a few concerns I have about the alterations in this Bill and my opposition to them. Firstly, the family allowance was the product of fundamental changes to the child endowment system introduced during the Fraser-Anthony Government days. Our intent was to ensure that those with children were not disadvantaged in the overall structure of the social welfare tax system. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is always difficult to find an equitable balance. Family allowance has some problems and it has gone from one side of the Budget to the other. To a large degree, it is now cash payments instead of coming through the tax system. There are inevitable difficulties in trying to ensure equity in a society where to a greater extent both partners of a marriage work. Those difficulties arise not only where both partners work but also in the case of a single parent. It is almost inevitable that, with the financial pressures that are brought to bear, at least one parent works. </PARA>
<PARA>  So the first thing I would say in my concern about these changes is that I believe the nature and character of family allowance are being fundamentally changed because, for the first time, a number of people are to be excluded from any entitlement at all. I want to come to the basis of exclusion. I do not want anybody to believe that in anything I say I am opposed to the idea of having an income means test to discriminate or to separate entitlement between those who might reasonably be said to be in need and those who are not. </PARA>
<PARA>  I know that in the past family allowance has been available, irrespective of either income or assets. I believe to a degree in the social equality sense that can be justified. Within a family those who do not seek to work have the same responsibilities for their children as those who do. There is certainly a difficulty for many who, having been in the work force, suddenly find themselves at home without that independent income. In many ways, when the family allowance benefit was first introduced it was seen as a way to provide some income, particularly for married women who wished to stay at home. As I was involved at the time in government, I had a great deal of sympathy for that point of view. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is in the general concept of ensuring that there should be recognition of children and the role of those children that child endowment and family allowance, and now family allowance supplement, have their particular direction. I am concerned in the social sense that there are many families today who, under this particular provision, are going to be excluded as a result of changes introduced by the present Treasurer. In his days as Minister for Primary Industries and Energy he contributed much to the plight of those about whom I now wish to speak. </PARA>
<PARA>  In his second reading speech, the Treasurer referred to both the new family assets test and to the earlier debate--the extent to which the Government had tried on earlier occasions with other assets tests only to be rejected in the other place. This particular measure is to introduce, from 1 January 1992, a family assets test of $600,000 of net assets, excluding the family home. There are three aspects to that on which I want to particularly spend a little time. The first is the quantum. </PARA>
<PARA>  I find it absolutely farcical that we are debating this legislation in a week when the two major institutions--AMP and National Mutual--have announced a 20 per cent drop in the asset backing of their portfolios. More significantly, they have acknowledged that there has been a drop of 40 per cent in their real estate portfolio. It is true that much of that relates to commercial property in Sydney. We should note that there has been a 40 per cent drop in the valuation of the real estate portfolios of the two major real estate investors in Australia. These are two big institutions and, within their superannuation entitlements, within the balance sheets that reflect the flow of funds, they have had to make an adjustment across the whole of their portfolios of 20 per cent, but I gather that the real estate section is down by 40 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  From 1 January there is to be a $600,000 family assets test. We are looking at the arbitrary valuation, set presumably on a market assessment, that is generally the criterion from which valuer generals have laid down their judgment. So that $600,000 is not market adjusted. It is not a criterion that is in any way set to take account of changing prices. It is set across Australia irrespective of location and irrespective of financial climate. </PARA>
<PARA>  As one who is particularly concerned at the moment about two sectors of the community--that is, the small business sector and the rural sector--I know that, when we take account of that 40 per cent drop to which I referred a moment ago, the $600,000 has no equity in it. Of course, the Minister will say, `Yes, but we have compensatory provisions'. I will come to them in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us look at the arbitrary application of an assets test which in the future is going to be the limit beyond which there will be no family assistance available. My concern is that, as far as FAS is concerned, there is a real problem in trying to ensure that all children receive an adequate access to education. I do not pretend that the amounts paid by government under these benefits are ever going to be able to provide for all the necessities of a child. But I can tell honourable members that in my part of the world I have seen farms that are unable to be sold, small businessmen going broke--we know of the record number of bankruptcies--and children being withdrawn from school at the end of their primary education because their parents can no longer afford to keep them at school; and this legislation is supposedly dealing with an equitable situation amongst all families. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, it will be said, `But there is a hardship provision'. I have never seen a more onerous hardship qualification in my life. The limit for net assets--that $600,000--as I have endeavoured to illustrate is nonsense in financial terms. Whatever the limit, no matter what figure we put there, I do not believe it could be sufficient to permit those who are genuinely in need--and some of those to whom I referred have children who are being denied equitable treatment--to have a reasonable chance of getting that minimal social security benefit. </PARA>
<PARA>  I began by talking about what I see as inequitable treatment in regard to family allowance. I see that allowance as a benefit to try to help children; to try to give children, through those who are responsible for them, some assistance to ensure that they are given an equitable opportunity to be educated, housed, fed and brought up as young Australians. I do not believe that the application of an assets test, using any figure, is a criterion which can be justified, given the variable market circumstances, the rural collapse, the financial predicament in which we in Australia find ourselves, that 40 per cent reduction in regard to real estate values, and the real crisis arising in many instances from the fact that, even where a valuation is placed on a property, there is no capacity to sell. </PARA>
<PARA>  Indeed you, Mr Deputy Speaker, know so well that there are enormous problems in a large part of Australia. One can put a value on a place; but I know of a place--with willing sellers--that has been on the market for two years. Let us be honest, the people who are out there buying at the moment are the superannuation funds, which will look twice at these properties in view of the deterioration in the value of their assets; the odd neighbours with cash--and there are not too many of them around at the moment; or perhaps the very occasional alternative investors--and it would be very unusual if they were out there looking for rural estates. </PARA>
<PARA>  So, firstly, we have the deterioration in values; secondly, we have the problem that valuations really do not mean a thing because they are an arbitrary judgment by a bureaucrat, taken in good faith but without any relationship to the genuine value of the place; and, thirdly, in many instances the assets are just not realisable. Even if someone walked off his holding, it is still there related to him. But then it is said, `Of course, we have excluded the family home'. This criterion, supposedly, is to provide equity because the family home, curtilage and debt are to be taken off this obligation. What the Government is saying to any owner of a well run property or small business whose debt in normal circumstances is under control and who has a family home, curtilage and debt excluded, and anything like a reasonable place in normal times is virtually that the $600,000 limit will apply. </PARA>
<PARA>  I remember Professor Freddy Gruen making a recommendation to the Government not long after it decided that the Prime Minister's promise that there would be no capital gains tax really did not mean very much. Of course, we have seen subsequent instances of the Prime Minister's not keeping promises that he has made to the public. At about that time Professor Gruen brought down a report that said that, for there to be horizontal equity, capital gains tax had to apply to the family home, as it does to any other asset. I suggest to the Treasurer that, in considering this family allowance and this criterion of an assets test which he is going to apply, he should ask himself how he can equate the value of a city home--or, for that matter, a country home--with the value of an asset? As we all know, quite often in small business the home is part of the premises. So, although one can take out one little part, the premises have to be included. With a property, quite often the value of the family home is nowhere near the value of the other assets, because it is from those other assets that the property owner earns his income. Indeed, I suggest it is on those other assets that a good farmer will have been spending money. And this is supposed to provide equity!</PARA>
<PARA>  The disparity in value between family homes, whether in the city or in the country, is such that I think it is grossly inequitable. Indeed, only today I have been told the story of a family who have just been forced by the bank to sell up. Apparently they had a fire back in 1954. They had a beautiful home, and four other station hands' homes on the property. The whole place has been sold for $750,000. I suspect that that family home alone, if it had been in the city instead of way out in western Queensland, might well have sold for $500,000 or perhaps more if it had been on the right site. But, of course, that does not apply in the bush. The value of a family home in isolation is not the cost of building it or the cost of replacing it. It is a different value altogether. It is certainly not a criterion that can be applied with equity, as I see it, with the exclusion of the family home, curtilage and debt. For that reason, I do not believe that there is horizontal equity in the exclusion of the family home. I certainly do not believe that those in the bush and those in small business are being dealt with fairly, and so I believe that the criteria applied are inequitable and unjust. </PARA>
<PARA>  The whole concept of introducing an assets test for family allowance and family allowance supplement is, to my mind, based on the wrong premise. It is based on the idea that there are people who have these very valuable assets who are trying to sneak through the system. To that I would say that that is the purpose of the income test. </PARA>
<PARA>  When I was Minister for Social Services I found that there were always difficulties in trying to apply any sort of a means test or assets test, so when I became Minister for Primary Industry back in 1970-71, when we had enormous difficulties, I introduced a hardship provision which was made part of the rural adjustment package. That meant that household support was equated to the unemployment benefit, and the whole of the assets of the person, because of the uncertainty of value, were excluded in determining that person's entitlement. We provided that household support to a large number of people who were in an extraordinarily impecunious situation. </PARA>
<PARA>  This legislation in its present form discriminates harshly against those who need help the most. There is no criterion for assets that is equitable. At a time of economic difficulty and of disparity between different people in the community, when some are unable to keep giving their children an education, and at a time when land values have certainly slid dramatically, an assets test of this sort will exclude a large number of people who are in critical need of financial help through the family allowance and family allowance supplement schemes. For that reason, I do not support the proposal that has been advanced by the Minister. I regard it as inequitable in its approach, and I very much regret that I see it, in the way that it has been pursued by the Government, more as a device than as a genuine attempt to strike some sort of a balance between the various needs of people in our community. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do not accept as equitable an alignment with the Austudy income threshold, but I will not in any way suggest that there should not be a balance by which we determine who should receive Austudy and who should not. I guess any income test becomes difficult. I accept that there should be an income test on quantum, but I fear that for far too many in rural Australia, even under that Austudy test to which the Treasurer referred, there are difficulties. I can tell honourable members that for country children who have to board and stay away from home, the cost of receiving an ordinary education is far greater, and I believe that this legislation discriminates significantly against them. For that reason, I do not support the introduction of the assets test into this legislation, and I certainly will not be supporting it if it should come to a vote. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-This issue has been one of the more difficult ones for me to confront in my parliamentary career, the reason being, of course, that I represent a very large group of farmers--wheat and sheep producers primarily--and I am very cognisant of their current economic circumstances. I am the owner of a farming property that could be considered, I would think, typical of those in my electorate. I am well aware of the financial circumstances that would be confronting any person seeking to live on and run a farm as the sole source of family income. Such people would be substantially in negative income circumstances. Every day I pick up the newspapers it appears that the price of one of those principal sources of income--wool--falls a little further. Consequently, in this very large Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) we find a provision relating to the family allowance as we know it today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I am old enough to remember the original child endowment and the great discussions about that. I am old enough to remember when Malcolm Fraser was lauded by every political party when his Government introduced the present concept of the family allowance because it paid money to carers. It reversed the situation where there was a small amount of child endowment but primarily a tax rebate or tax deduction which of course generally went to the breadwinner, and the breadwinner did not necessarily pass that benefit onto the wife, who was usually the carer. </PARA>
<PARA>  Over time there has been criticism that people on high incomes really did not need that benefit and that the money they received should have been redirected to others. I have not really contested that argument; notwithstanding that, in my view, people who have children, be they rich or poor, suffer quite a disadvantage financially compared with those who do not. I have read statistics which give the differential between a four-unit family and a two-unit family. They show that a four-unit family needs an additional $20,000 a year to have living standards the equal of a couple who have no children at all. </PARA>
<PARA>  Nevertheless, the Hawke Government in 1989 decided to apply some income tests. They were reasonably generous, commencing at $53,550 plus $2,678 for additional children past the first child. Those figures have grown through indexation, and they are now $62,057 and $3,104 respectively. That is an income test. If the Parliament were debating today the definition of income, if it were proposing to lift what I might call the corporate veil and to decide what is the real income of individuals, and if it were to ask itself whether taxable income is the true measure of people's disposable income, I would bring to this Parliament a wealth of knowledge of how the business sector in particular manages to hive off income. </PARA>
<PARA>  Over the recent years of mega-richness, time and again it was at least rumoured that some of the very wealthiest people were getting Austudy for their children. Why? It was because personally they have no income. There are many aspects of the taxation system that give tax deductions when in fact no money is lost. It is probably less today than in the days of investment allowances when one could buy a $100,000 item on lease for an outlay of about $2,000 and gain a $40,000 tax deduction. All the Taxation Office ever looked at was a person's taxable income. It was quite silly, and in those days it would have been more like a $60,000 deduction if the item was depreciable. </PARA>
<PARA>  If we were talking about income tests today I would be doing my best to see a fair and equitable arrangement because I agree that there is a level of income above which it is probably just not necessary that the taxpayers of Australia should further support someone's income. But we are not. We are talking about asset testing. We have heard the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), who, like me, sees this situation daily. The simple fact is that in the last Budget the Government came to this House suggesting that persons with more than $300,000 in assets should not be eligible for the family allowance. The opposition of the coalition was such that in attempting to sweeten that, and I guess to get it on the statute books, the Government took that figure up to $500,000. To its credit, the Opposition at that time held the line and, with the aid of the Australian Democrats in the Senate, that proposal was defeated. </PARA>
<PARA>  That resulted in substantial criticism in this place of our leader, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), and others. I was very grateful that he managed to stand onside with us on that occasion because as far as I am concerned we took the right decision. Now we are back discussing not $500,000 but $600,000--$600,000 excluding the family home and after the removal of any debts associated with the business. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let me get down to something that is fundamental to most people who have assets. Most of them rely on them for income, so there is a direct relationship between income and the ownership of assets. We read in the paper day after day of the return that people can expect on their assets, and of course that return is always predicated on the value of those assets from day to day. It is usually referred to in percentage terms. There is a little bit of history about that and it is particularly notable in the rural communities because, as I say, people rely on their assets for income. In the case of rural communities the asset--typically the family farm--is home, business and income; it is the lot. That is all they have got. Very few farmers have any substantial extra assets. It is a family farm; it has been inherited; it has no value; the farmer has no plan to sell it; and he did not buy it. </PARA>
<PARA>  But there is an authoritative body of opinion that says that over time a farming business will return about 3 per cent on the investment involved. If one looks at the ABARE figures for recent years, we find that in 1988-89 ABARE declared the return on the assets of a farming enterprise was 3.7 per cent. In 1989-90 it was 2.5 per cent and in 1990-91 it was minus 0.3 per cent. Any average of those figures is well below 3 per cent, and I remind honourable members that 1988-89 was a good year. </PARA>
<PARA>  When we go back to these two provisions, the income test and the assets test--$62,000 for the income test and $600,000 for the assets test--the clear inference is that farming assets after debt return 10 per cent. Okay, those figures I have cited would include debt. Nevertheless, we have to take into account a few simple facts about farming. If, for instance, a farm were worth $1m, the banks would be unlikely to lend more than $200,000 or $300,000--and it would depend when the $1m valuation was made. Banks have been traditionally very conservative in the amounts of money they lend to the rural sector. The fact is that a $1m farm would be very unlikely to have $400,000 worth of debt, and therefore it has a net value in excess of this $600,000. </PARA>
<PARA>  I remind honourable members that the value of that property is not what the valuer general puts only on the land; the value of that farming enterprise is everything that is there, less debts. There is machinery. If a farmer wants to buy a decent header in my electorate today he will get small change out of $200,000. Farmers have learned that it is not wise to buy things until they have got the money because when they used to contract debt to buy machinery they very soon lost their farms. That is one single item of equipment, but a farmer does not harvest a crop until he has bought the tractor and the combine and all the other things. A farmer could have $600,000 worth of equipment on a typical farm without trying very hard--certainly equipment worth $400,000 to $500,000. </PARA>
<PARA>  Then of course there are the animals. Cattle are worth $600 or $700 each, if they can be sold. They are saleable, but if a farmer sells all of his breeding stock he is out of business. There is a similar situation with sheep. Notwithstanding the terrible price of wool, the animals have a reasonably high value. Again, if they were to be sold the farmer would not have an enterprise. But they sit on the property, add to the assets, and may deny families access to the family allowance if this legislation is passed. </PARA>
<PARA>  I bring honourable members back to my example. If the true value or the true return of a farming enterprise is 3 per cent and the Government, notwithstanding the very correct arguments of the right honourable member for New England, is hell bent on going down the road of an asset test, why not let it take account of that return? It is simple enough; it is simple arithmetic. It means that the asset should have a value of about $2m. If the Government wanted to argue a value of $1.5m and change this legislation accordingly, I would probably accept. We should be looking at about $2m, not $600,000. It shows the immaturity of this Government in terms of business enterprise that it thinks even small businesses can achieve 10 per cent returns. They do not; they never have; and they should not be categorised as doing so--not when we have an income test that clearly is $62,057. </PARA>
<PARA>  The first point I want to make is that we should be extending this particular asset test, not because I like the concept but, because the Government has initiated this, I have taken the value to $2m. I draw the House's attention to the fact that in the committee stages I will move an amendment to this clause to deal with that point. </PARA>
<PARA>  The other aspect of this matter is that, if one is an income earner and has more than one child, one is allowed an extra $3,000. If the asset value of one's property is the source of one's income, why can one not extend the asset value of the property if one has more children? It seems pretty logical and fair to me. Consequently, I will move an amendment to extend that, to add $100,000--3 per cent again--for each additional child. I am so committed to this that I intend to see that the Parliament votes on this amendment to test out people's commitment. It is a matter of great concern to me. </PARA>
<PARA>  When someone throws a figure like $600,000 in assets around, there is an immediate belief that that refers to a wealthy person. Let us look at my million dollar farmer who may have $300,000 worth of debt. I will tell honourable members what his problems are today. Firstly, he cannot sell his farm. As the right honourable member for New England said, they are basically unsaleable. Secondly, notwithstanding all those additional assets, he cannot borrow against them because no-one will lend him any more money. Thirdly, because he is now considered such a wealthy person, he is not eligible for any of the normal welfare programs, such as the dole, and this Parliament is about to say that his wife can no longer collect $10 a week per child up to the first three children and $13-odd if she has a fourth child. When we have women in my electorate walking up to the supermarket checkout and finding that they do not have enough money to pay for the groceries in the trolley, which they have been very careful in selecting, that is pretty serious. </PARA>
<PARA>   When I mentioned this figure of $2m today, someone said to me, `How could you go to the unemployed on the dole and tell them you want to give additional assistance to someone who has $600,000 worth of assets? How do they compare?' I said, `I will tell you how they compare: one has the dole and the other hasn't'. I remind honourable members that for someone with $600,000 net, no borrowing capacity, no ability to sell and no ability to realise at anything other than prices which would not pay off the debt, we are saying, `You can't have the only little bit of money you have left, the family allowance'. People say to me, `But if the property will only sell for less than that $300,000 or $400,000 debt, clearly the value is not $600,000'. They should tell that to the Valuer-General. What did he do in Perth the other day? There was almost a riot. He put out his values in Perth--I know that is not the country, but it is still small business--taking the boom activity of 18 months ago and applying it now. </PARA>
<PARA>  One property that I happen to own was valued at $114,000 throughout the boom. The valuer general has now put it up to $400,000. Whom do the public servants go to when an individual seeks to retain the family allowance and wants to self-assess? They do not say that one's property is worthless. I will tell honourable members what they say. They say, `What is the value?' They are putting false values on these properties, which will take them up to levels that will drive these people out. That is the situation we have. </PARA>
<PARA>  Are these special cases to be treated as rubbish because someone has a hate for people who own something? I cannot understand any Liberal arguing for a tax system that basically says, `We want to encourage you to save or invest' and then says, `But if you've got investments you can't have a little bit of help for your kids when you desperately need it'. That is what we are debating today--whether those people in desperate need should be assisted. The Government will say, `But we have the hardship provisions'. What are they? Firstly, they apply for two years only, to try to get this thing through the Parliament. Secondly, if one's income is less than $13,000 plus $624 for one's children and if one has no liquid assets, or liquid assets less than $10,000, one can have it anyway--the Government will be generous. </PARA>
<PARA>  The simple fact is that in a farming enterprise if one does not have $10,000 one does not plant the next crop--if one does not have $30,000 or $40,000 one does not plant the next crop. We have a self-assessment system. This is the same as in the tax Act. The Government says, `You can self-assess; take the punt. Between November and February you will have the value of your wheat proceeds in the bank--$30,000 or $40,000--but just ignore that'. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will tell honourable members something about self-assessment. Self-assessment no longer allows one simply to get a ruling to apply. If people come up before a random audit and are found to have not been truthful according to the standards of the Public Service, they are criminals--they have stolen from the Government. They are a lot worse than someone who just asks. This is what is confronting people. I cannot understand why we choose to do this thing at this time when people in the rural communities, as everybody knows, are in such dreadful shape. </PARA>
<PARA>  The hardship provisions will not assist in most cases. They will demean people by the processes people must go through just to keep something that for 40 years in this country has basically been the right of every mother. I am not objecting to taking it from those who still have adequate income. I am quite happy to look at those who hide their income. But honourable members should remember that one can live in the metropolitan area with a $2m house with very simple corporate arrangements, have no income, and get all the money. The situation is the same in many other circumstances. The Government is barking up the wrong tree. It should have been looking into the income arrangements and leaving people with these small farming assets that unfortunately are worth a lot more than $600,000. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Like previous speakers, I want to emphasise in this debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) the problems that the proposed changes will have for the rural sector and also for small business. The Bill, of course, includes quite a variety of changes to many sections of social security legislation, different changes and benefits for those with disabilities and many other provisions. However, the Bill highlights and draws attention to the third attempt by this Government to introduce assets tests for family allowances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The fact that we are dealing with family allowances at all under social security legislation demonstrates how much family policy has changed over recent years. The $10 family allowance is all that is left of the once universal child endowment arrangements. For 40 years, child endowment helped every family with those extra costs that are associated with raising children. It was an example of fiscal equalisation, a recognition that it costs something more to have a family and that there ought to be some recognition, either in the tax system or by way of providing some degree of balance and assistance, for those families who take on that particular responsibility. Now it is merely another welfare measure. That may be good socialist propaganda or good socialist philosophy, but it really destroys what was an excellent concept that contributed greatly towards building Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  The family allowance, child endowment, was an investment in the next generation of Australians, an investment from which we have received rich rewards. Now it is just in the same category as the dole, sickness benefits and the like. Instead of emphasising and encouraging the raising and the development of Australian families, it seems as though now we will use immigration to import other people's children. We are not prepared to support our own Australian families, but we are prepared to place our emphasis in other areas. </PARA>
<PARA>  Indeed, it is quite obvious that this Government places much greater emphasis on raising children in child-care centres by providing for additional child-care places in almost every Budget, and indeed boasts about the provision of those resources, but is unable to find sufficient funds to continue the universal child endowment. They have allowed it to degenerate to a mere $10 a week so that its effectiveness has been severely limited. Even more people are to be denied it but, more particularly, it is to be amalgamated with the whole family allowance arrangement eventually into a single benefit system. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I mentioned earlier, this is the third attempt by the Government to introduce an assets test for family allowances. It tried initially in 1990-91 with a miserable $300,000 assets test. It was shamed into raising its bid to $500,000; but that was not enough. Now it is trying again, this time with $600,000--indexed, I might add, on 1 January 1993--but this also is not nearly good enough. Indeed, the deceit and dishonesty that has been associated with the Government's portrayal of its family allowance package is quite monumental. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government has been attempting to sell this package on the basis of the extra people who are going to receive family allowance supplement. It is true that some more families will be eligible to receive the $26.50 family allowance supplement payment. However, what the Government is choosing to overlook is that for the first time it is trying to implement an assets test for family allowance, a $600,000 assets test that will cut out thousands of families from receiving the allowance they have received for a very long period. In fact, very many families will be affected. The Government's own estimate is that $25.5m or more will be saved from this single measure in a year. At $10 a week, that amounts to a lot of families. </PARA>
<PARA>  What is of particular concern to the rural sector is that the last time this matter was being debated in this chamber, evidence was presented from the National Farmers Federation and many other groups that around three-quarters of all the families that are going to lose their family allowance as a result of the assets test are farm families. I do not think that there have been any significant changes in the new arrangements which would alter that figure substantially. </PARA>
<PARA>  This legislation makes a number of changes to the assets test rules. It changes the parent test into a family test. That is going to have particular effect on family partnerships, and again the major impact of that measure will be on family farms and family businesses. It is not uncommon for family partnerships to be established to help run family businesses or the family farms and to involve the children at an early age so that they take an interest in the business or the farm. In those instances now the assets of the whole family will be taken into account in determining the limit. </PARA>
<PARA>  One benefit will be that primary producers will be able to deduct liabilities from their assets, and that obviously will be a significant improvement, even though it takes effect only from 1 January 1992. Very few people will benefit from that provision. The Government has estimated it will cost only $400,000, so clearly there will not be many beneficiaries. </PARA>
<PARA>  The most significant change, and the measure which this Government is endeavouring to use to sell this package as being a little more humane than some of its previous attempts, is the inclusion of hardship provisions for those particularly affected. It is an attempt to soften the blow, but it is only a light softening of the blow. To begin with, the provisions apply for only two years. So hopefully people will swallow the poison, enjoy it for two years, and then feel the full consequences. </PARA>
<PARA>  Under these hardship provisions the family allowance assets test will be relaxed in cases involving amounts above $600,000 where the income level is below $13,078 plus $624 for each additional child. However, there is a liquid assets limit of $10,000 for each family, which I am anxious to refer to in more detail later in my remarks. The family allowance supplement assets test will be relaxed in instances between $347,000 and $600,000, again with the same income limits applying. The Bill, in clause 37, defines liquid assets as including personal cash, shares and debentures, money in the bank, amounts due and readily realisable assets. All of them can total only $10,000 or the hardship provisions will not apply. It is not actually specifically included in the Bill, but many of the glossy publications and much of the publicity material that accompanied the announcement of these hardship provisions on Budget night included a specific provision that this $10,000 included working capital. I hope that when the Minister or the Parliamentary Secretary responds to this debate, he will clarify whether or not it is the Government's intention that working capital be included in this $10,000 total of liquid assets. </PARA>
<PARA>  I also would be interested to know what kinds of shares and debentures are going to be included in this assessment. For instance, many primary producers are obligated, as a result of their production of a particular commodity, to have shares in a primary producer cooperative. These shares often revolve, and there is no possibility whatever of their being cashed out early or ahead of their time. They are just a way in which a particular cooperative recognises its equity. Surely those kinds of arrangements should not be included in liquid assets. </PARA>
<PARA>  Most particularly, I want to refer again to this question of working capital. An amount of $10,000 is very, very small. Cropping farmers in particular, those who grow grain, cotton, sugar, fruit or any other similar commodity, have seasonal incomes. They have periods of very high expenditure, followed by just one or two months when their income is received. They need to hold on hand from their income in one year the money that they need for planting their next crop. And they cannot plant much of a crop for $10,000. </PARA>
<PARA>  I know that the new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) has now made about three visits into the country and is starting to consider himself an expert on rural affairs. But I hope that even he has now discovered that one cannot plant a crop of wheat--or for that matter any other primary product that is likely to make a farmer viable--for $10,000. I am not a very big farmer by any means, but each year my family partnership budgets on approximately $100,000 to plant its crop and to bring it through to the stage of harvesting. If I borrow $80,000 of that $100,000 and have a mere $20,000, a mere 20 per cent, of the required needs of working capital in any kind of liquid reserves, under these particular arrangements I, and others in the same position, would not qualify under these hardship provisions. Indeed, they are Claytons hardship provisions which almost guarantee that any genuine working farm will be seriously disadvantaged. Under these hardship provisions, very few of those who are still in business will have the opportunity to qualify. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is a serious problem for those who are endeavouring to guarantee their next year's income to accumulate the necessary funds to plant a crop, fertilise it, spray it, water it and tend it in all the ways that are required in this modern day and age. It requires a significant amount of capital to do just that task. Unless a farmer has to borrow pretty well 100 per cent of his working capital, he will not be eligible under these hardship provisions. Anyone who has to borrow 100 per cent of his working capital to produce his next crop is in very serious difficulty and is probably on the verge of bankruptcy, if not already bankrupt. Those are the kinds of hardship provisions that are being written into this legislation, and I appeal to the Minister to look at them again. The Government should exclude working capital altogether in coming to a conclusion on what are liquid assets and it should adopt a reasonable attitude in developing appropriate hardship arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do not argue with the $13,000 income limit. Of course, it is significantly lower than applies to other social security recipients, such as those on the family allowance supplement. But it is obviously a hardship provision and so it is reasonable that there should be an income limit and that that income limit should be quite severe. But the working capital limit is unreasonable and ought to be reconsidered. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are many faults with the whole principle of an assets test. Of course, it is anti-property by its very nature, but to fix it at an amount such as $600,000 or $347,000 is clearly treating it on an inequitable basis when compared with the income test. Income test levels are adjusted for each extra child. That does not happen with the assets test. There is no shading. You are either all in or all out. That sort of thing also does not happen with the income test. </PARA>
<PARA>  Perhaps one of the worst features of the assets test is, as referred to by the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), that not all assets are counted. The family home is exempted whether it is a caravan under a tree in the bush or a multimillion dollar mansion on the Sydney north shore; whether it is a working asset or the luxurious fruit of previous labours, a bequest, a gift or whatever. No consideration is given to the need of that asset to produce income. </PARA>
<PARA>  Nor is there any recognition of whether the asset's value is actually realisable. What is a farm worth in this day and age? The valuation is unrealistic. A farm worth $1m a few years ago is perhaps worth theoretically $700,000 today. But, in truth, there are no buyers, so what is its real worth? If it were put on the market for $500,000, it would not be sold because no-one would want it at any price. The banks are carrying many of these people, allowing their asset value to slip away because they know that, if they foreclose on them, they will get even less than they would by attempting to carry the customers through. They know also that, by foreclosing on a number of clients, they will further erode property values and put even more producers in difficult circumstances. So, while the asset may have a theoretical value, that value is often unrealisable and should therefore be ignored in these kinds of issues. </PARA>
<PARA>  Most importantly of all, the assets test is not related to earning capacity. One can earn $62,057, plus $3,104 for each additional child, and still receive the family allowance. That is the equivalent of around 11 per cent return on investment for the $600,000 assets test limit, and that excludes any capital gain. Bank interest or any business returning 11 per cent is very rarely found in this day and age. As the honourable member for O'Connor very rightly and forcefully pointed out earlier, ABARE's latest estimate of the return on a farm investment is not 11 per cent. It is not even one per cent; it is 0.3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  In other words, a farm valued at around $600,000, the maximum assets test limit proposed by this Government, would return on average $2,000 for the year. So a farmer earning on average $2,000 or less is considered to be too rich to get the family allowance supplement, while another person earning $62,057 or more can still receive the family allowance. This is clearly inequitable. The farmer on his knees at the bank manager's table, pleading for some carry-on finance after years of negative income, cannot get the family allowance, yet the bank manager sitting on the opposite side of the table can. That applies not just to bank managers but to many doctors, lawyers, senior public servants and university academics. Probably even members of Federal Parliament could qualify for the family allowance under the income test, but farmers on negative incomes cannot. What does that say for the Government's agenda for social justice? In fact, on ABARE's estimate of farm returns, a farm would have to be worth close to $10m before it would trigger the income test. Clearly, there is a gross inequity in all of these issues. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government takes this action at a critical time for the rural sector. In my electorate, there will be no dry land grain harvested this year. The whole Queensland crop is estimated at about 10 per cent of last year's. The sugar crush is almost over. The Government blames international factors, but does little of its own to relieve the hardship in the rural sector. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, the rural sector misses out on most of the welfare measures available to other sectors of the community. The unemployment benefit is available for people who lose their job. People are not expected to put money aside for the day when they lose their job. Unemployed people qualify for this benefit very readily. However, social security is not available to farmers in their time of trouble. Rural adjustment assistance can be available, but more often than not it is only through loans, unless the farmer is already committed to leave the industry. There is a need for appropriate drought measures, appropriate subsistence measures, to tide farmers through their current difficult circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) has proposed that a high level Ministry team be established to endeavour to address the rural crisis that we are currently confronting--the economic and cash crisis faced by so many farmers. His idea has a great deal of merit, although I have very little confidence that the sorts of high level Ministers that we need to be attracted to this team would lower themselves to be even concerned about the problems of rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is talk of bipartisan rural summits. The Queensland Graingrowers Association has been endeavouring to establish such meetings to initiate new ideas to come to grips with the current crisis. But, for many, all of these measures will be too late. Property values are falling. There are many forced sales and values are plunging. In fact, the circumstances are so desperate that the Queensland Government is now offering $200 food packages through Lifeline for farmers who cannot feed their children. How low has our country sunk. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is good that the Government has chosen to recognise hardship provisions, but it has not gone anywhere near far enough. The hardship provisions fail to address the real tragedy of the bush at present. Many needy families will still miss out on these benefits. I ask the Government particularly to reconsider its definition of working capital, to look at the way in which it values family farms and--(Time expired)</PARA>

A number of the proposals are very welcome. The new child bereavement proposal provides for some extension of the family allowance payment after a child's death. This came up following the tragic Strathfield Plaza massacre. The increase in the child disability allowance is also welcome, indeed overdue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In my brief remarks I will deal with the part of the Bill--division 7, clause 36--dealing with the proposed assets test and the new special hardship provisions in respect of the family allowance and the family allowance supplement. I will refer later to the need--this has been canvassed by my colleague who preceded me, the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) and by other Opposition speakers--for the magnitude of assets, as specified in the test, to be larger and for the amounts of liquid assets referred to in the special hardship provisions to be interpreted with reference to the requirements of working capital where the families in question are the proprietors of a small business or a farm. I will come back to that. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to address a view, a belief, a point of principle, strongly held by a number of my colleagues on this side of the House; that is, family allowances are not social welfare but they are a part, in effect, of the tax system. They are an allowance of income in recognition of the high costs of raising children which should not be subject to means tests of any sort, albeit they are paid through the social security system in order to direct the money to the principal carer, in most cases the wife and mother. The argument is that these payments are assessed and made on the basis of judgments about horizontal equity, the equal treatment of families at comparable income levels, some without children, others with children. The costs of bringing up children are indeed heavy and it is this which is recognised by the family allowance payment and, at the lowest income levels, by the family allowance supplement. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, that was a view that may have been sustainable in past times when the relative affluence of this country--its place in the income per head scale as one of the top half dozen countries in the world--prevailed, but it is not sustainable, I submit, in the circumstances of this country in more recent times with a world ranking down somewhere in the twenties. </PARA>
<PARA>  Further, I make the point that in previous legislation this Parliament has collectively accepted the view that, desirable as equal payments in respect of children at all levels of family income may be--that is the principle of horizontal equity, propounded with great conviction by a number of my colleagues, as I have said, and the history of which was so eloquently traced by the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) this morning--nevertheless, in terms of priority, where there are limited resources in the public purse, there has to be regard to real need in making such payments. In fact some time back there was concurrence in the application of an income test to the family allowance payment, but if there is concurrence with an income test, by the same logic there should also be an assets test. </PARA>
<PARA>  The proposal for such a test in a previous Bill was rejected in the Senate. The proposal before the House in this Bill represents the Government's effort to come up with a more reasonable proposal. I believe this proposal is far from perfect, but that is an issue I will return to in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to have recognised publicly that the acceptance of this assets test for the family allowance--as the lesser of two evils in the case of my colleague the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) and on the part of a number of my colleagues--amounts to overriding a strongly held, long cherished principle that the family allowance is specifically not welfare and should be paid to support all children irrespective of family means. I recognise the strength and sincerity with which that view is held. Nevertheless, in the reduced circumstances of this country, the hard fact is that it is not sound policy to pay this allowance to all, irrespective of income or assets. </PARA>
<PARA>  We will never turn our backs on compassionate support for those in genuine need, but pursuit of the principle of so-called horizontal equity, in some cases with all but religious fervour, to the point where it is argued that family allowance ought to be paid to families taking the existing limit with incomes in excess of the $62,057 per annum--that is about $1,200 per week--or families with four children where the limit would be about $71,000 per annum, as in effect this Parliament has decided, is pressing the principle beyond a reasonable limit. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is the opposing principle, or perhaps reality, that at some point priorities in other areas in a situation of limited resources take over--that point in this case being, in the view of the Parliament, at the level of income of $62,057 per annum in the case of one child or up to $71,000 per annum where there are four children. The alternative priority that comes into play, most simply put, is that we can, for instance, help many more people in dire need if we siphon off resources in this admittedly priority area of family allowance at the point referred to. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have this existing income test; the inevitable complement of that is an assets test. Accordingly, the introduction of this assets test is not opposed, in many cases somewhat reluctantly. I am stressing that in the sadly reduced state of the Australian economy--I am not really referring to the current recession, rather to the falling-living-standards, rising-overseas-debt economy of which the current recession was the inevitable end point, and that is what we have had over recent years leading up to this time-- we cannot afford the largess of assistance not targeted to real need. </PARA>
<PARA>  I suspect that will long be the case, but the priority now is to rebuild the Australian economy, to turn the economy around. The fact of the matter is that what we have had in Australia is many years of complacency, to put it at its mildest, of gradual slip, from a country in the first half-dozen in the world in terms of GDP per head down the ranking to the order of 20 or so. </PARA>
<PARA>  The rate of slippage has accelerated in recent years. There is no doubt about that. There has been a refusal to acknowledge the reality of our situation. A recent article in the Business Review Weekly puts it this way: `The easy times have gone'. There is a refusal to acknowledge that. </PARA>
<PARA>  We need to recognise that there is a vast challenge facing this country to work our way towards a containment of the foreign debt and to reverse the process of decline and regain sustainable prosperity. That requires an across the board reform agenda for fundamental change. That will include a consistent, sound monetary policy with the main target being to reduce inflation and a Budget policy over the medium term for reduced spending in order to give us more national saving. That is absolutely essential if we are to achieve economic growth with rising living standards, and a reducing current account for stabilisation of the debt. </PARA>
<PARA>  We need labour market reform for enterprise bargaining; infrastructure change for lower costs of power and transport and so on; more competition and privatisation; tax reform--in particular, the goods and services tax; and a streamlining of decision and approval processes for new developments. All of these are main parts of the agenda. </PARA>
<PARA>  When that is working there will be higher living standards for all, including families with children. When we turn the country around by a process of reform of this nature, indeed there will then be higher living standards for all, including families with children. That is what we need to focus upon. That is what we need to achieve to mobilise as a nation. But on that journey we have to accept limits in providing assistance where the need is not the greatest, even in respect of families and children. The need is to keep our eye on that main game. </PARA>
<PARA>  I again say that the introduction of this assets test is not opposed. However, as is nearly always the case, the particular parameters of the proposal in my view are not sound. A small business, a corner shop, or a farm at $600,000, which is the proposed limit, generally speaking is not a viable proposition. To say that a family unit which is the proprietor of such a business--it will not be earning much of an income--cannot have the family allowance is ill-judged. There are many other difficulties associated with the $600,000 limit in today's circumstances. The state of today's markets have been strongly set out by other speakers, including my colleagues the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and the honourable member for O'Connor. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are, in addition, the hardship provisions. In various ways I believe that they are unrealistic. As a number of my colleagues have already argued, the requirement for liquid assets to be less than $10,000 is quite unrealistic. A family farm enterprise, for example, may well need that sort of money by way of working capital to plant a crop. I would argue, as have other speakers from this side of the House, that the proposals in the Bill require some sort of amendment or at least an explicit understanding to the effect that in making an assessment in the case of a small business, farm or non-farm, the assessment take appropriate account of the requirements for working capital. </PARA>
<PARA>  I stress that the principal point is that in the circumstances of this economy now, as we seek to rebuild the Australian economy, we have to bring an election on for us to be able to undertake that task. Many of the elements that I have mentioned will not and, indeed, cannot be introduced by the present Government, given its constituency.  We will have to do it and in that context we have to give priority to the range of programs to effect fundamental change in our economy and in that the acceptance of an assets test in this area must be recognised. </PARA>

<PARA>  I am very concerned about the regulations that we have in place today, particularly those relating to social security payments. Very few people within the community appear to understand them. The recipients are the ones who certainly do not understand. They should go and get advice from the Department of Social Security in order to receive their entitlements. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe that today we are caught up in a system which has been exacerbated by the Government in many respects. I make it quite clear that I am opposed to an assets test on the family allowance. I cannot support the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) simply because I am directly opposed to an assets test. I do not mind an income test; I think it is essential. I am opposed to an assets and an income test for aged pensioners. Why? The reason is that I believe there are many complications for the aged today. This worries them and they end up suffering from poor health. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would like to say something about the family assets test of $600,000, excluding the family home. This is ridiculous for the farming community and the business community. This afternoon the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) pointed out very clearly that there has been a general decline of between 20 and 40 per cent in the valuation of property throughout Australia, whether it be farm property, commercial property or even residential property. As he said, we have seen the valuation by AMP and National Mutual decline by approximately 20 per cent. An asset of $600,000 is very meagre indeed. The average farmer today has an asset well in excess of that, but it is an asset that he is unable to sell in most cases simply because of the market and the drought. The Government is not sympathetic towards him or her. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government knows that its amendments do not meet the genuine needs of many people around the countryside. I have been sent by my electors to argue that the people in country areas are given a fair deal. I believe that the people involved in primary industry, those involved in agriculture, are the backbone of the country. They are suffering enormously today. </PARA>
<PARA>  As a result of the policies of this Government over the last eight years, between $3 billion and $4 billion has been taken out of the pockets of the primary producer. The 1988 Kerin plan provided for the elimination of underwriting for wheat, the deregulation of the domestic market, the abolition of the floor price scheme for wool, the reduction in tariffs on imported sugar, and the reduction of dairy assistance. We also have to look at the reduction on the import tariffs for citrus juice and the elimination of the superphosphate bounty. These are all major issues concerning the assistance that was available to farmers. On top of this, as has been stressed today, we have the worst drought for many years. The Government knows this, yet the legislation before this House deprives those vitally affected people of family allowance. </PARA>
<PARA>  I sometimes wonder who does the valuation on a property. I think it is a person sitting behind a desk. I have a firm conviction that, to get a logical conclusion on something, one must talk to a practical person who often uses his hands, not a person sitting behind a desk who is working to an Act of Parliament. However, he or she is the one to whom people must apply for support and who will make a determination. </PARA>
<PARA>  I was reminded the other day of an instance of this in my electorate. A farmer who was forced to retire because of his health lost his age pension in 1985 and was forced to go back into dairying. On many occasions, while I have been driving by on the highway, I have seen him cross the road--and he has a job even to cross the road. He has reared eight children and all of them have been successful because he has provided the money for their education. He is a good citizen and he has paid tax throughout his lifetime, yet he has not applied for an age pension because he knows he is not entitled to it simply because of the assets test. He keeps a horse tied up at his back door so that he can ride across the road to inspect the cattle because he is unable to walk that far. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is the type of person that I and the Opposition parties have sympathy for. There are many others like him within country areas. I have a returned serviceman in my electorate who is living on a run-down dairy farm. He and his wife are over 70 years of age. They are unable to sell any of their property, from which they get very little return. He bought a home in the town nearby for his mother, who is over 90 years of age and is receiving a pension. Because he bought her a home--so she is hardly a liability on the taxpayer--he is unable to receive any pension. </PARA>
<PARA>  No wonder the people in our electorates complain when they see greenies and other people who do not believe in the cutting down of trees blocking the logging trucks from getting the timber into the local mills for processing. These are basically unemployed people whom the taxpayer is helping to keep. Yet those who have worked hard in their lifetime, for the productive side of Australia, are not entitled to receive assistance. There is nothing in this legislation that will assist the people we are taking about. I sincerely hope that the Minister will consider changing it, even at this late stage, because he knows of the anomalies in it. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am entirely in favour of the assets test being abolished for the age pension and the family allowance. I have always held this belief firmly. I know that Government members will ask: why should a millionaire receive this assistance? They should look at the inequities of the scheme now before them and the fact that there are only a few people who may be classed as millionaires, and they will pay tax on their incomes. This is the important thing. They may receive the money, but the Government will get most of it back. We do not need an army of public servants to administer the various fractions of the legislation now before us. I am opposed to this legislation because of the principles that I hold. There are some good things in it, and I do not mind there being an assets test for Austudy--although income ought to be the consideration there--but I am opposed to the assets test for the age pension and the family allowance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I wish to participate in this debate because I want to make it absolutely clear why the Opposition parties are supporting the Government on the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill and, most importantly--and this has been the focus of the debate in this House--go through the issue of the assets test on family allowances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I recognise the context in which this decision has been taken. It is a difficult issue, an issue on which one has to strike a sense of balance. It is an issue that involves a number of difficult philosophical positions and concerns. It is an issue in which there have been an unbelievable number of changes in government attitudes and decisions over the last couple of decades, and of course it arises at a time when this country is in its worst crisis since the 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA>  All of us are very genuinely concerned about the phenomenal pain and hardship that have been inflicted on the people of Australia--deliberately and knowingly--by this Government:  `the recession we had to have'. That hardship and that pain are perhaps greatest in our rural communities, which not only have had the recession inflicted upon them but also have suffered the plight of very difficult international market circumstances where what at best could be described as corrupt market practices are squeezing them out of markets that they have traditionally thought of as their own. In many cases they have faced a collapse of their own individual markets and prices. So we are seeing a rural depression, in many cases, and certainly the worst circumstances since the 1930s. Some of my colleagues can go back earlier than that. It is very important, therefore, that we recognise that, despite the intensity of that pain and hardship, we have to keep a sense of rationality, direction and purpose when we face issues as difficult as these. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am also particularly concerned about families. I know all my colleagues share that concern. We are concerned about families during the worst recession in 60 years and also, in a somewhat broader perspective, about the fact that this generation of Australians, under the policies that have been pursued by the Hawke-Keating-Kerin Government, is about to leave a lower standard of living to its children than the one that we have enjoyed ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA>  In that context, we must face the issue. Some very tough decisions have to be made and we have to address the issue of the best way to help, and the best way to assist families, while recognising the realities of the economic circumstances in which we find ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another element of the debate, of course, has been a lot of concern about how to help farms, and small businesses in particular. A number of speakers have spent quite a lot of time seeking to emphasise the need to help farms and farmers and to help small businesses in these circumstances. We have to ask ourselves some fundamental questions there too. Are family allowances really the most effective way of helping farms and small businesses in current circumstances? Or, is it not true that many of these problems that beset the small business community and the farming community stem from other factors?</PARA>
<PARA>  They are problems that can be solved by a different approach to policy. They are problems that can be addressed. In many cases, they are problems that have been, as I have said before, deliberately created by a government that has had no sense of direction, no understanding of individual needs and hardships, a government which has devoted itself incessantly to internal factional fights and divisions and has not really shown any genuine concern about the pain and hardship that has been inflicted on average Australians as a consequence of its focus on internal Party differences of opinion, factional fights and so on. We can do a lot for farms and small business, but we will have to fundamentally change the way this country is governed and change policy to a direction different to that taken in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA>  As my colleagues know, I have spent a lot of time thinking of the best way to assist families. In taking this decision, it would be totally wrong to conclude that, of course, we are not in favour of assisting families. But in the context of the circumstances I have described--of the recession and the prospects for our children that I have described--we have to face some pretty tough decisions about how best to assist families in current circumstances. A lot of the policy package that we will be bringing down in the near term actually addresses the issue of family assistance in, I think, the most fair and equitable way we can. </PARA>
<PARA>   In current circumstances it is, of course, very much a question of balance. We would ideally like to be able to support all families in Australia. We would ideally like to be able to support all children in Australia. But in the economic circumstances in which we find ourselves--with people already complaining about the extent of debt, the level of real interest rates and the level of taxation--we have to make some pretty tough choices in directing that family assistance to those most in need and ensuring that it is effectively targeted. The alternative should be very clear. There has to be higher taxation, probably higher real interest rates and more debt, more pain and hardship. Maybe there will be short term gain for some families at the expense of long term pain for those same families. Indeed, a very strong argument can be mounted in the present circumstances that one can make it worse for the families one is trying to help, by trying to throw money at them rather than dealing with the problems and the root causes of those problems. </PARA>
<PARA>  So when we come to the issue of family assistance, as we do in this particular piece of legislation, we have to recognise the fact that there is a need in these circumstances for targeting. When one looks at that, one recognises that, of course, families in different parts of Australia have different needs and that it is very difficult on occasions for governments to effectively target. </PARA>
<PARA>  This particular measure, this assets test, as it is now brought to us, has gone through several phases in the course of the last several months as the Government has responded to pressure and seen the error of its initial ways. Earlier on we drew to the Government's attention the particular problem we had with the first version of the assets test as it was set up. We drew attention to the fact that we do have some asset wealthy, income poor, groups in our society who are finding it particularly difficult in current circumstances to get by. A significant percentage of that group is, of course, the farming community which is being forced this year to live on very low average incomes of just a few thousand dollars and are unable to do very much about their assets. It is very difficult, of course, to even contemplate the possibility of changing the nature of their asset structure and yet being forced into particular periods of hardship, as circumstances way beyond their control have been inflicted upon them. </PARA>
<PARA>  In those circumstances, we were very concerned that the initial policy proposal of the Government really did not address the issue. It did not adequately take account of the nature of the farming situation, farmers' income and their assets. It certainly did not understand anything about hardship. We made a very strong play about that; we took a very strong position on it. It is as a result of that that we now have this alternative proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>  As many colleagues here have debated some of the bits and pieces of that decision, I think we need to recognise that again it is, in the end, a choice on balance. We think the Government has come a long way in cutting the asset level off at $600,000, rather than closer to $300,000 where it started. It has particularly come a long way in defining that to be net of the family home, net of curtilage and net, importantly, of debt, which is a particular aspect of the hardship of a large part of the rural community at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA>  In those circumstances, the Government has given a lot of ground and has been dragged screaming to reality in terms of recognising the magnitude of the problem, particularly of the farming community. Over and above that, of course, it has now recognised the need, although it initially mocked it, to do something about hardship. There are hardship provisions in here which my colleagues in the House, and those in the Senate as well, will continue to scrutinise very carefully to ensure that hardship is effectively dealt with under this particular piece of legislation. But in the end I say it is a choice. It is a difficult choice. It is a choice that raises for us a lot of our history, a lot of philosophical challenges and a lot of very difficult decisions about the best way to make sure that we are doing the best we can for those we represent in this place. </PARA>
<PARA>  On balance, we have come down in favour of the view that we should support the Government on this particular assets test, in this particular form. But clearly we will continue to monitor the situation to see whether in practice it actually does what it appears to do on the paper on which it has been written. </PARA>
<PARA>   The final point is to step back a bit from the particular issue of the assets test and assistance to families as I have discussed it, and raise another issue which I think is raised by a lot of the comments that have been made in this debate and have certainly been a feature of the consideration on my part and the part of a lot of my colleagues in recent days. It goes really to the very issue of what type of country we are trying to build in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>  A lot of people pine for the days of Bob Menzies, and why would they not? They were great days. They were days in which this country had very low unemployment, very low inflation, very low debt, and very real opportunity. It was a country of great dynamism. It was a country that was really moving and establishing its place in the world. There is a very sharp contrast between that type of world and the type of world we have today in 1991, the type of world that we have been dragged into by this Government that has absolutely no understanding of the magnitude of the pain and hardship that it has inflicted on average Australians. This Government has incessantly focused, as I said before, on silly leadership contests and games which have preoccupied it now for the 18 months since the last election to the point where it has not done anything to deal with the problems that are confronting the Australian economy and Australian society at this time. Indeed, every single decision it has taken in that 18-month period can be linked back to one deal or another. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have right before us now the issue of the Fairfax bid. It reeks of a deal. It is being dressed up as if it has nothing to do with deals. We have had television ownership decisions and the Budget itself--a series of deals. But all through that period we have had no genuine attempt to deal with the problems that confront the average Australian. There has been no visible concern for the fact that there are now nearly one million people, even on the fudged data of the Government, unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA>  The damage that the unemployment of one million people has done to Australian families should never be underestimated. It will stand as a monument, as I have said before, to our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), who claims to have a special relationship with the working people of Australia. It will stand as a monument to him and to his administration that, in the centenary year of the ALP, he has created one million unemployed. This Government has seen a system develop where there has not been an effective understanding of how to deal with problems and how to act in the best interests of the people of Australia. If one is a member of the ALP and if a problem arises, one does another deal. The Government does not have any sense of direction, or vision, or understanding of the sort of society that we ought to be building in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  To me, it is a very clear cut choice and increasingly, between now and the next election, the people of Australia will be given a very clear cut choice. For the first time in a very long time, when we go to the next election people are going to see us as being fundamentally different from the ALP and they are going to see us as standing for a fundamentally different type of country from that which the ALP has built, one that will be managed in a fundamentally different way from the way the people on the other side of the House have decided to run it. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is in that context that I get very offended when I hear the suggestion that, because we support in current circumstances something like an assets test on family allowances, we are somehow embracing a socialist ideal. We have no intention of embracing the sort of socialist ideal that those opposite flourish on. Communism may be dead in eastern Europe, where the people may be tearing down the barricades and the walls and may be building market based economies. But socialism is alive and well in Canberra. The main proponents of that socialistic approach to government are sitting here at the table, and I refer in particular to the one with the green folders, who is smirking. They have built the sort of system that has now taken jobs away from average Australians and has built a sense of dependency that is not consistent with the type of world that we want to build. </PARA>
<PARA>  When we look at allocating assistance in 1991, we look at giving it to those in need. We do not look at using it as a way of building an empire, or as a way of building a whole structure of dependence. We do not look at it as a way of taking away from individuals what should rightfully be theirs. We do not look at it as a source of more compulsion, more control, more regulation and more government determination. We are looking at an alternative society in which the individual plays a much greater part, where individuals are left very much to themselves, beyond those who need genuine assistance from government. We want to create the type of world, in fact, where there is going to be enormous opportunity for individuals to look after themselves. </PARA>
<PARA>  That goal is not possible under the sort of system that this group of people in government have built. They do not understand the advantages of market based processes. They do not understand the advantages of individual choice. They do not understand the advantages of competition. They think about control, they think about deals, they think about compulsion, and they think about achieving ends by taxation, charges and levies rather than about creating the sort of world in which individuals have a realistic opportunity to look after themselves. At the very beginning of that process in circumstances in which there are one million unemployed, the best thing one can do for families in Australia is make sure that those who want jobs can get jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>  Those on the other side of the House do not understand even that basic element of what is required to build a new society. They do not particularly care that people get thrown out of the work force, because they go about building a social security and welfare structure that in time locks people into a situation in which they cannot have a job or do not want to have a job. They change people's attitudes, they change their livelihood, and they destroy the things that people really pride most--an opportunity to get a job, the self-respect and decency that go with having a job, and the ability to take home a sufficient amount of money to look after their children. </PARA>
<PARA>  The fundamentally important point that we have to make in this debate is that, while in the difficult circumstances that exist in Australia today we support the very difficult decision that has to be made on an assets test for family allowances, we in no way embrace the socialist ideal of the other side of the House. As we bring down the detail of our policy package in the next few weeks, it will be quite clear to the people of Australia that we can build an alternative system; we can build a system in which individuals have an elevated position, one in which they are left to make choices for themselves, one in which the role of government is significantly reduced, one in which the reliance on centralised control is gradually broken down, and one in which individuals have a real opportunity to get a job and to look after their families. </PARA>
<PARA>  That is what the debate is going to be about in the next few months, 18 months or whatever time it takes until the next election. It is going to be focusing on the difference between the centralised, individual deal dominated, regulated, non-market government process that this lot opposite have built and the one which really does try to re-establish the supremacy of the individual and the role of the individual in our society. </PARA>
<PARA>  So it is for those and a lot of other reasons that we come to this debate willing to support the Government on a particular and difficult decision in relation to the assets test on family allowances which has seen the Government move a long way from the position in which it started. But it should in no way believe that we in any sense embrace the type of society that it has built. I do not want a situation in which, for example, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) determines which books my children read; nor do I particularly like the type of society in which the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) determines whether I can go to the doctor, or how long I am going to sit in a queue, or what my cities are going to look like. We are going to fundamentally change the nature of this country to the betterment of the individual and to the betterment of Australian families. That is what this debate is all about.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) would like to be here to answer the debate on this particular aspect of his portfolio responsibilities, because not too often do we have an opportunity to see such a spectacle as we have seen in the House tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) has concentrated a lot on the hardship provisions within the social security system, particularly as it relates to people in primary industry. But also contained in the Bill, and not touched on by many honourable members, is a wide range of other measures which have certainly made life a lot easier for a lot of people who also deserve that extra support from the Government and from the community simply because they are older, have large families or are unemployed and are suffering from a lack of income because of a variety of factors. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the Bill, we look at issues such as the special child bereavement payments; the education entry payments; the extension of the hardship provisions for the carers who have been left behind when, perhaps, the person they have been caring for has gone into a nursing home; the extension of the Job Search allowance and sickness allowances; the changes to the rent assistance to give particular support to younger people; the child disability allowance increases; and the extension of the lodgment period for claims for family payments and bereavement payments. All those and more are part of this very important Bill that has come before this House. </PARA>
<PARA>  But what we have seen, particularly in the contribution by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), is an attempt simply to distract the Australian community and certainly to distract his split Party from the real issues that are facing his own Party, the issues that it is attempting to grapple with as it pretends to prepare for coming into government. If his speech and his Budget response were any indication of a preparedness to come into government, then those opposite should not worry about the next election in 18 months time; they should look a few years down the track, closer to the end of this century before they need to be prepared to come to government. </PARA>
<PARA>  The fact of the matter is that we cannot be blamed by honourable members opposite--particularly the Leader of the Opposition, who was an adviser to the Fraser Government which officiated over double digit inflation, double digit unemployment, a rocketing debt in this country, decaying industry, industrial relations chaos, and only a third of the kids reaching year 12. That was the situation when the Fraser Government, advised by the current Leader of the Opposition, went out of government. That is the world that the Leader of the Opposition claims is great!</PARA>
<PARA>  Because the Leader of the Opposition cannot deal with that part of his record and the realities of his past life, he has to go back to the Menzies years. What a great period that was! If people from any period should answer for the position that this country is in, or pay for it or justify it, it is people from those years, and also the years of the Fraser Liberal-National Party Government that left this country in the state that it was in in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA>  Honourable members opposite talked about hardship. I remember well the days when I sat with my grandmother around the radio listening to the Budget and waiting to see whether pensioners would get any increase in the bountiful years of the Menzies Government. Pensioners sat and they sweated. They used to travel up to Canberra with their meagre resources, march or do anything to get a few extra shillings in their pension. Two shillings and sixpence extra in one's pension was a great advance. That was the situation of the pensioners of Australia, in those bountiful years of the Menzies Government, the Liberal and Country Party Government--the same sort of people who would come back here today if they had the chance. That is what honourable members opposite would put people through again--going back to scrimping and saving and begging for money from the social security system. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is no good the honourable member for Wentworth and Leader of the Opposition coming into this House and claiming to represent all the people of Australia, as he does on many occasions, when he is quite clearly set on disenfranchising a very large proportion of them. His attitude and that of his party room is one of not caring for the unemployed. Otherwise, why would honourable members opposite cut them off after nine months? Honourable members opposite talk about hardship. Nine months of being out of work is hardship. Honourable members opposite think they understand it, but they do not. If they did, they would not contemplate, as part of their policy, cutting people off after nine months on the unemployment benefit. That is the situation that the Opposition would have. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us face it, if the Opposition thinks it is really prepared for government, it should let its Leader come to the dispatch box--and let him have the full support of honourable members opposite for once--and tell the people of Australia what he would really do. We will not talk about a consumption tax tonight. We will not talk about all the other lost policies that will probably never surface before this election, the next election or the one after. Let him come into this House when we are talking about social security and explain to the people of Australia his statement of 22 August 1990, a year ago, when he said how much he would slash from social security. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Well, I would have to go through the numbers again but in the last election campaign for example we had identified nearly $3 billion worth of total cuts and there was well over $1 billion--</PARA>
<PARA>$1,000m--</PARA>
<PARA>in the social security area in that package. </PARA>
<PARA>Well, where is it? He should let the people know. The Leader of the Opposition cannot come in here from his split party room and talk about issues such as that without identifying how he will cut $1,000m from social security. The Leader of the Opposition has no credibility, and that is what will play against him at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA>  The reality quite clearly is that the Leader of the Opposition wasted his time completely talking to me, the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins). He was facing the wrong way. He should have turned around and looked at honourable members opposite. The reason he came in here and had to give that speech again is probably that no-one heard it over the uproar in the party room the other day when he was trying to convince honourable members opposite of the reasons behind his giving this speech. He should have been talking to honourable members opposite. Honourable members opposite put on a great big front about support and all the rest of it. They come in here pretending to be united behind their leader. They are not, and we will see a clear example of that in a very few minutes. </PARA>
<PARA>  The fact of the matter is that the Opposition has no credibility. That is not simply because honourable members opposite have a fight in their party room. That is bad enough, but the fact of the matter is that they have no credibility because they are not prepared to take the really hard decisions and they are not prepared to deal with real equity in this situation. </PARA>
<PARA>  Here we see the sectional interests of the Liberal and National parties coming out. Let us deal with people's hardship as hardship. There are people who suffer in rural areas who are primary producers; there are other people in rural areas who suffer just as much, just as there are people in urban areas who suffer at times like this and at other times. Honourable members opposite have not been able tonight to describe for the people of Australia a real solution. All they have done is said that they would like, as would the Government, to do more for many people in various sections, particularly those involving rural interests and primary producers, who are going through very tough times. There are a lot of people going through tough times. </PARA>
<PARA>  I respect the fact that the Leader of the Opposition has today at least had the guts to take the decision that he did and to front up in the Parliament and say it. It is the job of oppositions and governments to make the right decisions in balance. Quite clearly, I believe that the Government has made the right decision. I respect the Leader of the Opposition for supporting the Government on this matter, but I go back to the point, which I make very clearly once and for all, that the Opposition will not have credibility with the people of this country unless it can demonstrate what it would do with its tax policy, its health policy--whatever policy, but particularly its social security policy. The pensioners of this country will not go back to the days of Menzies--the glorious days of Menzies, as honourable members opposite would have it--and sit around their radios waiting for another two shillings and sixpence. </PARA>

<PARA>  Clause 38, page 14, lines 9 and 10, omit proposed paragraph 838(d), substitute the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA>    "(d) the value of the person's assets does not exceed $2 000 000 plus an additional amount of $100 000 for each additional FA child (after the first)".</PARA>
<PARA>The savings proposed in the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) are $16.1m in the current financial year and $40.2m in a full financial year, as compared with expenditures of $101,000m and taxes of $96,000m. It is a notable point, which is quite clear in the Hansard, that every honourable member who spoke tonight raised the issue of the level of this assets test. One in particular said that he was opposed to it completely. All the speakers expressed this point of view. </PARA>
<PARA>  The amendment does not oppose the principle of an assets test on the family allowance, and for me that is a massive shift from a principle which I have adhered to since before I joined the Liberal Party. The amendment purely attempts to set the assets test at a level that recognises the business reality that farm and small business returns on net asset values, particularly as set by bureaucratic valuation, are more like 3 per cent than 10 per cent. As I pointed out, previous information has suggested that the rural community would represent 75 per cent of the people affected by this decision. That, I understand, is NFF information. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics has advised me that in 1988-89 the return on total farm assets was 3.7 per cent, in 1989-90 it was 2.5 per cent and in 1990-91 it was 0.3 per cent. In other words, it has never been a good sort of return, even in good years. Somehow or other we have to make an adjustment for the fact that this asset test is after debt. As I also pointed out in my speech in the second reading debate, it is a simple fact that farmers in particular, and other small businessmen, do not have the sort of gearing that was available to the captains of industry a few years ago. They have never been considered particularly good risks by the banks and most would not have debt levels in excess of 30 per cent of some asset valuation. </PARA>
<PARA>  I mentioned in my speech in the second reading debate my situation with a three-quarter acre block that I own, facing a secondary highway, not a major highway, in the Perth metropolitan area--not in the city. The Valuer-General has just decided it is worth $400,000. Someone operating his own small business on that would have a building that costs, say, $300,000, and it would not be unreasonable to suggest that he would have stock and plant worth another $300,000. That is a total of $1m for a tiny corner small business. If he had debts of $200,000, which would still leave him with $200,000 above this asset limit, his interest bill would still be $40,000, because notwithstanding the fact that the Government keeps trumpeting interest rates of 10 and 12 per cent, that little guy does not get them. He is paying 15 to 20 per cent. If he had the loan for five years he would have to find an additional $40,000 to repay it. He does not have much left in the present environment. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, the farmers are even worse off. It is an outrageous situation confronting most of them. They cannot borrow; they cannot sell. They have little cash flow relative to their debt servicing. They cannot be helped by tax deductions, because they have got no income, and in their depressed rural areas they cannot get a job. They are being compared with someone who is eligible for unemployment benefits--the dole. That person can be married with a home in the suburbs and have assets of $157,500, and still get the dole. </PARA>
<PARA>  What we are talking about here is not what the programs of the future might bring; we are talking about people being denied their last $20 or $30--the only bit of cash that comes into the family. They are not eligible, because of the more restrictive assets tests that apply universally in other areas, for those sorts of benefits. They can only get the family allowance. The person who gets it is the wife of the farmer--the one who feeds the kids. It is no use talking about a grand future, because, to put it simply, the grocery bill has got to be paid this week and next week. In my electorate many people are confronted with just that problem--finding the money to pay the grocery bills.</PARA>
<PARA>  Others have talked about pulling their kids out of school. That happened at the beginning of the year. They were pulled out of the Government hostels too, because their parents could not afford that. That is what I am talking about. We talk about poverty traps; these people are in a gigantic one. All I am saying in this amendment, and in fact in pleading with the Government, is at least raise it to a level that recognises the values, even in these depressed times, that the bureaucrats are putting upon these properties, and the assets that exist upon them--the buildings, the plant, the stock and the livestock. </PARA>
<PARA>  Honourable members should think about that and lift it to $2m. I know we can throw bricks at $2m as it sounds like a fortune; but I have just given the simple $1m example of a corner small business. Inflation has had a massive effect on what was a lot of money. The real point I am making to the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) is that at $2m it would relieve the problems of most farmers. We would probably go from a situation of 75 per cent of the total being farmers to something below 25 per cent. It is a more realistic figure. We have the income test, which is $62,057, plus sums for additional kids. All that I have done to arrive at $2m is to work back at 3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  If Government members think that $2m is too high and that I have not made sufficient provision for, say, debt, then please get up and tell me that $1.75m is fair and reasonable. I will accept that. I will accept anything that will get these people a fair deal. If there are new programs coming from either side of politics that give them a better future, I will fight for them when they arrive. I am talking about what the Government is going to do to some people in desperate circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister talked about his old grandmother or his mother and her pension. She has got one. These people do not have one, and it is probable that their parents do not have one either, because they are asset tested out of it as they are still part owners of the farm. They cannot afford to transfer it, because they do not have the funds to do so. Do not tell us that those hardship provisions will work. They are not the solution. They are grossly demeaning, and I think they will be quite impossible for people to handle. I have got to say that my dealings on the assets test for the pension have never been all that encouraging. It is a matter of scratching and fighting at all times to help old people who also have no resources. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is what I am talking about. I am talking about one simple thing. I will concede the Government its assets test, but I say to it that on all the evidence available--the ABARE, the Government's company, a Government institution--it has never got 10 per cent on its returns yet, and in the present environment it is not even getting one per cent. I am saying that at $2m the Government would probably strike the average. That is the purpose of the amendment. I repeat that it is one that has been supported by most members in this Parliament. I have found myself in a position of moving the amendment because I am prepared to put my vote where my mouth is. I am not prepared just to talk about this. I am determined to act upon it because I have no choice. My first responsibility, as should be that of those opposite, is to the people in the electorate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I participate in the debate at this stage for one main reason. During the second reading debate the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) was asked to respond to several questions, and we had a waste of 15 minutes with his summary, which did not address any of the three points that I brought forward, and that I am sure other members would be interested in, to find out exactly what the Government is going to do in relation to certain things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The first matter was in connection with rental assistance. The Minister did not devote any time at all to this. What we were saying was that on the face of it this proposition appears to be nothing more than a back door increase in benefit rates, which appears to be unnecessary to us because the rent assistance is already tax free and indexed and also property prices and rentals are currently in a depressed state. I think everybody has taken that stance in the debate. What I want to ask the Government is this: what evidence is there of an increased need for a reduced waiting period in view of the elements I have mentioned?  As I said, it appears to us in the meantime that it is just a back door method of increasing benefits for those who have an eligibility. That was the first point to which the Minister did not respond. </PARA>
<PARA>  The second point was very closely tied up with the financial hardship provisions of the liquid assets test. We have in the Bill the provision that `liquid assets':</PARA>
<PARA>in relation to a person, means:</PARA>
<PARA>  (a)  the person's cash; and</PARA>
<PARA>  (b)  the person's shares and debentures in a public company within the meaning of the Corporations Law; and</PARA>
<PARA>  (c)  any amount deposited with, or lent . a bank, building society, credit union or other financial institution by the person.. </PARA>
<PARA>  (d)  any amount due, and able to be paid, to the person by, or on behalf of, a former employer of the person; and</PARA>
<PARA>  (e)  any other readily realisable assets of the person;</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think there was an honourable member on our side of the House who did not refer to the fact that there is a need to understand that in any small business or any farm across Australia there are times when farmers and businessmen come into a cash deposit which is set aside specifically as running expenses or working capital in order to plant a crop, pay a debt or something else like that. </PARA>
<PARA>  We had hoped that, in the absence of any recognition that liquid assets did not include working capital, the Department would not take into account such items as a $20,000 receipt from proceeds of a farm or a business where that amount is specifically held for the time being in order to provide working capital and follow-on funds such as those required, in a farm, for paying the rates, paying for the fertiliser, paying for the seed or paying the wages or, in a small business, paying the debts outstanding at the time. That was not addressed. I listened to the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) when he said that we will be closely scrutinising this particular aspect in the Senate to see what the answer is. The answer is not revealed within that definition and the Minister did not respond. </PARA>
<PARA>  The third matter that has to be addressed is one that again came in for universal comment. How do we value the assets of a business or a farm? Who is going to make the assessment and on what basis is that evaluation being made? I will tell honourable members why it is important. This year we found a major corporation in Australia writing off the value of assets to a nil value and leaving the property in the hands of the bankers. I am referring to Mount Isa Mines, MIM, which has completely written off the value of two coalmines and a port establishment and said to the bankers, `It's all yours'. As far as MIM is concerned, the value of those two mines and the port facilities is nil. </PARA>
<PARA>  In many cases throughout Australia there are businesses and farms that are in exactly the same situation. I mentioned in my speech in the second reading debate that I went out to Charleville a fortnight ago. It was demonstrated clearly that the value of the bankers' security was less than the amount that was being lent. That is happening right across western Queensland and it is happening in the cane farms that I represent in the electorate of Dawson. Twelve months ago the valuation of properties was twice as much as it is at the moment. The banks are keeping people on properties only to maintain them there, because they know that the value of those properties as going concerns is almost zilch. Is this type of thing going to be taken into account as far as the $600,000 value is concerned?</PARA>
<PARA>  I think one honourable member mentioned that in Western Australia at the moment the Valuer-General has put out a valuation on properties assuming that the 1989 boom is still upon us. I tell the Minister that the boom is not in the rural areas of Australia. The boom is not with small business in Australia. We ask: who is going to make the assessment; will it be a realisable and a realistic assessment; and will it take into account the particular deprivations of people living within the area?</PARA>
<PARA>  The final question we ask is: is a business asset, that is, that ready cash that I was speaking about, going to be classified separately from the liquid assets--the private cash assets--of an individual, either as a member of a partnership that may have working capital in hand or as a corporation to which he or she is a shareholder? We did not get the answers to those questions. As I said before, I am sure that we will be scrutinising those aspects very carefully in the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-My reason for supporting this amendment is that I believe that clause 38, proposed paragraph 838(d) of the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1991 is grossly unfair to small businesses, both rural and urban. I might add that the general lack of faith in this Bill is clearly the view of the majority of my coalition colleagues who have spoken in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  A wise man once said, `Never forget the block from which you are hewn'. As a Liberal member, I cannot in all conscience support proposed paragraph 838(d) as it stands, because I am not prepared to forsake the grassroots of the Party to which I have belonged for 18 years and which I have represented in this place for 13 of those years. </PARA>
<PARA>  Small business is the distinctive element of Liberal philosophy translated into economic terms. I for one will not be part of making the lot of Australian small business men and women more difficult, not only during this `recession that we had to have', according to the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), but at any time. Surely the farmers and small business people of this country have suffered enough during the past decade under the Labor Government. They have been forced to endure crippling interest rates on mortgages, increased taxes and an ever increasing plethora of government regulation. </PARA>
<PARA>  Six hundred thousand dollars, the figure at which the proposed assets test would apply, might sound like a great deal of money to many people. But, without adequate income, or without any income at all, no asset will put food into the mouths of children. </PARA>
<PARA>  We only have to watch television, read newspapers or even observe those around us to know that many farmers and business people who are asset rich are finding it very difficult in present circumstances to feed, clothe and educate their children. Probably every person in this place would know of examples similar to the two I now mention. I personally know of a small hire equipment firm and a small manufacturing company, both established Victorian family businesses and both with a sound assets base. In each case their income level is low, due to a prolonged absence of orders; in both cases they have to support families, and they are not finding it easy to feed, clothe and educate their children. </PARA>
<PARA>  Paragraph 838(d) of the Bill, as it stands, would very directly affect them and many others adversely and in a very unfair manner. Such people have for years provided services or produced and provided employment for Victorians and are entitled to family allowance just as other taxpayers are. Moreover, the extremely limited hardship provisions in the legislation will not resolve their particular problems. </PARA>
<PARA>  Future policies of a Federal coalition government will work towards resolving our current difficulties. That is very clear and very obvious. However, that is some time away yet. Accordingly, present dilemmas must be faced in the context of present policies and present legislation. That is a reality for us here tonight in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA>  Therefore, in conclusion, if I supported paragraph 838(d) as it stands, I would be denying my basic Liberal philosophy and abrogating my responsibilities as a Liberal member of Parliament. </PARA>

That report showed that 100 of his clients had a total debt of $31m, which is an average of approximately $276,000 per farming family. I draw the attention of the House to the fact that this was only one of five rural counsellors in the electorate of Mallee. All would have similar figures. As we all know in this House, many people under these rural counsellors would be receiving, or would be entitled to receive, household support, but only if they left the land and only if, instead of staying in their businesses, they got out.

<PARA>  I have people in my electorate at the moment who, for the first time since 1930, are making charcoal out of eucalyptus trees and drying eucalyptus and natural bush flowers and selling them in an endeavour to survive. This Government has forced a generation of young people, who are our best skilled and best equipped people to carry on the productive cycle, out of the country areas and into the cities in search of work--and they will never return. It has forced older people with a heritage in farming, a heritage that this country is going to need in the future, into bankruptcy. </PARA>
<PARA>  Some time ago in this Parliament when the Government suggested that the assets test threshold on family allowance should be $300,000, this Parliament took action. A motion was moved and supported by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) and myself and, to their credit, it was also supported by the honourable member for Grey (Mr O'Neil) and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell). I believe that particular debate ultimately brought about the Government decision to recognise that the $300,000 then proposed was insufficient, and so we see tonight this Bill that raises the assets test limit on the family allowance to $600,000. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe this has been a major improvement and, under normal circumstances, I would believe that the raising of the limit to $600,000 was reasonably fair. However, we have a crisis in Australia at the present time. As has been said, the crisis is not just in the rural areas; it is also in the cities. But the circumstances in rural Australia are different for farming families and for small business people. They simply have no option to gain any social equity under the existing arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>  When I returned home to the Mallee from school, I received #5 from my father at the weekend and was allowed the use of the family car. I was extremely happy because I was well fed and there was a vision that, with a little bit of work, the opportunity existed for me to develop the farm, to take over the farm and ultimately to become a successful farmer. However, that vision does not exist any more. It has been removed from our rural and farming youth and it has been removed from small business youth. </PARA>
<PARA>  If someone had told me five years ago that two of the cities in my electorate today would be without Toyota or General Motors-Holden's agencies, I would not have believed them. But that is the position. The whole social fabric of our rural communities has been destroyed because of the destruction of economic viability. I say to Government members that, if they wish to preserve the true economic base of this country and create the sort of employment opportunities and standard of living that we should expect in Australia, in these times of hardship an assets test is totally inappropriate. In the administration of family allowances there is only one test that can be applied, and that is an income test. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I was not here for most of the debate. I am covering this Bill for the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca). I will make several points and if the questions are not answered to the satisfaction of the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) then I am sure that Senator Richardson will respond fully in writing to him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In relation to rent assistance, the position is that the waiting period will be reduced from 26 weeks to 18 weeks for persons without dependent children, with a number of other provisos. Most people would understand the reasons for that. Twenty-six weeks--six months--is a very long time. The Government felt that it was important to give a bit of extra assistance to people often in very high rent situations to be able to deal with their incomes at a particularly difficult time. According to the officers of the Department of Social Security, there is considerable evidence that the length of that waiting period is causing hardship. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Dawson questioned the method of valuing properties. The answer that has been given to me by the Department is that the value given by the claimant is the one accepted by the Department, unless it looks significantly wrong, in which case the Australian Valuation Office would be asked to make a valuation. The Australian Valuation Office, and certainly the Department of Social Security, would be very well aware of the circumstances that affect the value of properties, particularly at the moment, and they would certainly take into consideration any assessment or reassessment of the value given by the claimant, which would be the primary value accepted. </PARA>
<PARA>  The other question from the honourable member for Dawson was about working capital. I will do my best to give the honourable member an answer, but again I will ensure that if it is not fully answered the Minister for Social Security will respond further. A farming family in real hardship usually has an overdraft and thus, while in that overdraft situation, it would qualify under the hardship test. For example, when the cheque comes in from the wool clip or whatever, the farm or business puts some money aside for business purposes rather than family needs. That is obviously the choice that the person makes. We all have to prioritise the use of the funds available to us either for personal use or for use in business. </PARA>
<PARA>  The family payments paid by the Government are not a business assistance measure but are really to assist families, and those funds should be targeted under the hardship test to those most in need at a particular time. That is not to say, for example, that once the wool cheque is spent the person may not again requalify under the hardship test. That is all the information that I have specifically available to me at the moment. If that is not sufficient, then we will ensure that it is responded to. </PARA>
<PARA>  While I certainly respect the feelings of the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) on this matter--he is obviously concerned, like all honourable members are in different ways for people in their electorates at this time--the Government will not be supporting his amendment. I make the point that making comparisons with someone in the city is probably not the best way to put his case, because what he was proposing to put forward was a levelling up--if it is okay for someone in the city, then we level it up for the rural areas. The position is that there are many people who would not have assets worth anywhere near $2m, no matter how they are valued, who are currently unemployed and on very small incomes who would be requiring assistance with social security, particularly from unemployment benefits. I regret that the Government will not be accepting this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-George Bernard Shaw once said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  When two people are under the influence of the most violent, most insane, most delusive, and most transient of all passions, they are required to swear that they will remain in that excited, abnormal and exhausting condition, continuously until death do them part. </PARA>
<PARA>Some 70 years later we are faced not so much with the trauma to which Shaw alluded but with the personal, social and economic tragedy of family breakdown on an unprecedented scale. As next week is Marriage Education Week in Australia, it is timely to reflect on the size of the problem and our contribution to the education of the community generally. </PARA>
<PARA>  Each year more than 40,000 marriages end in divorce. In 1990 the number of divorces represented some 36.45 per cent of the number of marriages in Australia and, as distressing as the personal and emotional trauma may be, there are other consequences for our community. It is estimated that some 55 per cent of the divorces in 1990 involved one or more children; that is, 45,000 Australian children were left in single parent homes last year. Since the introduction of the Family Law Act in 1975, more than 700,000 children have been deprived of the care of one parent for some part of their lives. By the end of the decade this figure will have risen to over one million children. </PARA>
<PARA>  In its report Our Homeless Children the inquiry into youth homelessness pointed to family breakdown as one of the major causes of an estimated 60,000 to 70,000 street kids leaving home. Divorce can be a wrenching experience for children. The debate about the long term effects was touched off with the publication by Judith Wallerstein, a Californian psychologist, of a book in 1989 described as the first ever long term study into the consequences of divorce for children. In the book Second Chances: Men, Women and Children A Decade After Divorce Wallerstein reported that many of the children of 60 middle class divorced families from the San Francisco area studied over a 12-year period experienced difficulties in education, social and interpersonal relationships. She found that 10 years after their parents had divorced, only 34 per cent of the children in the study were doing well; another 37 per cent were depressed, could not concentrate in school, had trouble making friends and suffered a wide range of behavioural problems. In a magazine article drawn from the book, Wallerstein described the 37 per cent figure as `a powerful statistic', and declared:</PARA>
<PARA>It would be hard to find any other group of children--except perhaps the victims of a natural disaster--who suffered such a rate of serious psychological problems. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that 50 per cent of all separations occur within the first seven years of marriage, in many cases leaving a woman struggling to raise a young family on a social security pension. </PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, there is the major economic burden to the nation. It has been estimated that family breakdown costs this nation some $2.5 billion annually. The Australian Institute of Family Studies has estimated that each separation costs society some $12,000. Yet it has been estimated that only some 10 per cent of Australian couples undertake any form of marriage preparation. Currently, the Federal Government spends some $16.6m on family services, of which $11.7m is expended on marriage counselling and just $500,700 on marriage education; that is, we spend less than $5 per marriage on education programs when the cost of picking up the pieces is $2.5 billion, or over $12,000 per separation. The value of marriage education has been established and reiterated by research studies not only in this country but elsewhere, and a leading American educator showed that when couples undertook a program, some 12 to 15 per cent of those couples either postponed or cancelled their wedding. It is better for us to deal with a cure before a problem arises which afflicts this society so much. </PARA>
<PARA>  I therefore hope that all honourable members will use the opportunity presented by the fact that next week is Marriage Education Week in Australia to promote measures of education to assist all couples in this nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Tonight I wish to make a few comments about the one government in which the Liberal Party provides the Premier and the Ministers--that is, the New South Wales Greiner Liberal Government. The Greiner Government, certainly from Mr Greiner's point of view, has long seen itself as the government which shows the way for liberalism for the 1990s. In the 1 1/2 minutes I have before this debate must end I will look at the achievements of the Greiner Government. The most spectacular achievement of the Greiner Government in recent days is the fact that the Greiner Government has decided to go into the business of having a State-owned raceway. I refer to the $70m Eastern Creek fiasco. The Greiner Government is saying that, because of the economic disaster which it has created in New South Wales, it is going to have to sell off the Government Insurance Office. The Greiner Government intends to sell off, when the price is right, the State Bank of New South Wales; it has had to break numerous promises to provide rebates on electricity to the ordinary people of New South Wales; it has had to place a surcharge on their water and sewerage rates; but it thinks there is enough money, there is $75m to spare, for it to bail out the Eastern Creek raceway. It is of such importance to the Greiner Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Why is it of such importance? Because Mr Greiner entered into certain business agreements with a few businessmen who were involved with the Eastern Creek raceway and it was too much of an embarrassment to let those involved go belly up. Of course, that is the reason why the Greiner Government has got itself into the ridiculous position of advocating a Stalinist planned economy model for raceways in Australia. I am sure they will show the world; they will beat the Moscow central government in showing that a State-owned raceway is even better than one run by a private enterprise in Victoria or elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the last 15 seconds available to me I emphasise to my honourable colleagues opposite how right Terry Metherell was. Greiner will be brought down by his arrogance and by the fact that he has walked away from all of the promises and policies that he had in opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Leader of the House, upon notice, on 22 August 1990:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) Would the installation of an electronic voting system in the House of Representatives Chamber cost between $250,000 and $1,000,000 depending on the levels of information and security of the system chosen.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) Would votes in the Chamber still require four minutes for assembly, counting and checking if an electronic voting system was used.</PARA>

<PARA>  (4) Is he able to confirm that there are only five parliamentary chambers with fewer than 200 members which use electronic voting.</PARA>
<PARA>  (5) Has the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet estimated that electronic voting would save 60 hours per year; if so, (a) what is the basis for such a claim and (b) does it involve Ministers, Members or their staff voting from outside the Chamber.</PARA>
<PARA>  (6) Has his attention been drawn to claims that the time saved based on the current incidence of divisions would be between (a) seven and ten minutes per day from a change to electronic voting and (b) five and ten minutes per day from a change to a modified United Kingdom House of Commons system.</PARA>
<PARA>  (7) Would the time savings referred to in part (6) amount to between eight and twelve hours per annum; if so, would the cost per minute saved by using electronic voting be between $800 and $1000.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) Installation costs have been estimated at $200,000 (for both Chambers). This information was provided to the Prime Minister by the Presiding Officers. A paper presenting an industry survey of electronic voting was prepared by PISO at the request of the Presiding Officers. This report estimates the capital cost of electronic voting at between $1 million and $2 million and maintenance costs of $225,000 per annum. These estimates are for both Chambers.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) This seems a reasonable estimate.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) Savings in time for any system replacing current practice for counting divisions would depend on procedures adopted. Estimates of time saved are impossible to make without also specifying these procedures. The United Kingdom House of Commons system may provide some time savings. With little or no capital, installation or maintenance costs it is a cheaper alternative than electronic voting.</PARA>

Telecom considers that it benefited from increased productivity brought about by staff commencing and completing work at the worksite, rather than having to be allotted work each day at a depot. Home garaging also achieved significant savings from the reduced need for secure parking areas to garage and protect vehicles out of work hours. At this time part-private use was not permitted.</PARA>
<PARA>  The new policy introduced in 1989 was based on recommendations arising out of an independent industry study of vehicle arrangements operating in other Government Business Enterprises and private sector companies. However, as it was not possible to resolve the matter in negotiations with the unions, the subsequent dispute was referred to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC) in November 1989. Following the public hearing of the case, the AIRC issued recommendations on the issues in dispute and these were accepted by Telecom and the unions.</PARA>
<PARA>  Intrinsic to the introduction of part-private use was a range of limitations on the use of vehicles and the requirement for staff to contribute to incremental operating costs. The current contribution rates are $11.70 for `front seat only' vehicles and $20.50 for vehicles with front and rear seats.</PARA>
<PARA>  Vehicles must be returned to Telecom during leave periods (excluding rostered days off) of more than two days (intervening days at Christmas/New Year and the Easter period excluded, subject to operational requirements).</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) Yes. These radial distances were set by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission as part of the proceedings referred to in part (1).</PARA>
<PARA>  (4) Yes. Rather than requiring staff to maintain log books, Telecom utilises a specialised motor vehicle database, FLEETMIS, which provides local management with appropriate audit and control mechanisms. At present this database is not being fully utilised but, as part of a current review of its motor vehicle fleet, Telecom is aiming to ensure that FLEETMIS is adopted as the Corporate System for total fleet management.</PARA>
<PARA>  (5) Yes. However, whilst Telecom is unable at present to guarantee that each of its vehicles are used within the terms and conditions of the part-private agreement, including distance constraints, any employee who is found to have breached the terms of the agreement must surrender the vehicle and, depending on the circumstances, may also be subject to further disciplinary action.</PARA>
<PARA>  (6) The exact net cost is not known by Telecom. Telecom considers that whilst there would be an overall net cost in operating the part-private use scheme, significant savings would have been achieved as a result of improved productivity and reduced vehicle storage and security costs. Telecom considers there have also been considerable savings in containing recruitment and training costs because skilled technical staff are provided with an employment benefit equal to packages offered throughout the telecommunications industry. These staff are, therefore, less likely to be lured by a potential competitor with the offer of use of a company vehicle as part of an employment package.</PARA>
<PARA>  The cost of the scheme is also offset, to a degree, by the weekly contributions paid by staff for use of a vehicle.</PARA>
<PARA>  (7) (a) As indicated in the reply to Part (6), Telecom advises that it is not able to give a precise figure of the cost of the scheme as many of the benefits achieved, such as increased productivity and reduced recruitment and training costs, are not quantifiable.</PARA>
<PARA>  (b) The amount received from employees for part-private use, based on the current contribution rates, is estimated at $8.16 million per annum.</PARA>
<PARA>  (8) No. Part-private usage is not seen by Telecom as a subsidised private transport scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>  (a) and (b) Not applicable.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The declarations under the International Covenant on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights are two procedures for international monitoring of compliance with human rights obligations. The Government has long held the view that the first Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is the most significant of such procedures and has indicated in this place its intention to achieve accession to that Protocol before proceeding to consider the related questions of the declarations under the instruments to which the honourable member refers.</PARA>
<PARA>  As the honourable member may be aware, Australia acceded to the Protocol on 25 September 1991. The Government will now consider the question of the declarations under the International Covenant on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. That consideration will include consultation with the States and Territories in the forum of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr Howe</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Budget Paper Number 4 for 1991-92 identifies 19 specific purpose health payments to the States and Territories in 1991-92 (16 recurrent and 3 capital). The basis for allocating these payments depends on the specific objectives the Commonwealth has established under its various financial assistance programs. The distributional criteria applied to these programs usually reflect the need for equity between States as well as the need to ensure adequate access to services. In some instances the relative differences in health status between States and special needs and conditions are also taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA>  Some programs have very specific purposes and</PARA>
<PARA>may not apply to all States.  For example, the basis for allocating funds to Tasmania for the construction of Stage II of Launceston General Hospital was a negotiated agreement between the State and the Commonwealth to cost-share the project against an agreed budget.</PARA>
<PARA>  Other, more general purpose grants, are allocated on a variety of bases, including per capita distribution, agreed project costs, cost-sharing requirements and arrangements that reflect specific needs and conditions. For example, most of the Hospital Funding Grants are allocated on a per capita basis which is also weighted for age and sex to reflect the relative differences in hospital utilisation due to an ageing population. On the other hand, the AIDS component in the Hospital Funding Grants is determined on the basis of the number of AIDS patients being treated in a particular State during the relevant grant year.</PARA>
