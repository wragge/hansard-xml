<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The main purpose of the Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill is to extend the so-called GIRD scheme, the grants for industry research and development scheme, until 30 June 1994, and a number of related matters. The scheme comprises two elements, namely, discretionary grants and generic technology grants. It was introduced in 1986, although a similar predecessor scheme operated for over a decade before that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The grants scheme is complementary to the 150 per cent tax incentive for research and development expenditure implemented after the 1984 election. That-the 150 per cent incentive-was an initiative of the Opposition science and technology policy at that time; but we were happy enough to see the Government take it over. The point is that in the case of some companies developing an innovation, particularly small and often start-up companies, there is not yet a profit stream to enable them to take advantage of the 150 per cent tax incentive; hence the significance of a grant under this GIRD scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition, somewhat reluctantly, supports this legislation to extend the life of these schemes-the discretionary grants scheme and the generic technology scheme. There is no doubt, of course, that industry research and development is critical to the development of a more internationally competitive industry sector in Australia. That is especially so of the `development' component in research and development, which means the translation of scientific research and innovative ideas into actual industry technology, leading to profitable job generating businesses-sometimes creating entirely new industries, but, more often and more importantly, having the effect of furthering structural change and by creating, revitalising and renewing existing industry. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been and remains a great lag in Australia in that area. In science, it can be said that Australia ranks very highly in the world scale. With 0.3 per cent of the world population, we produce about 2 per cent of the world's science, quantified in terms of internationally recognised scientific papers. But in this domain of private industry research and development-as I have said, the translation of scientific research and innovative ideas into actual technologies and job generating industry-Australia has long tended to lag. </PARA>
<PARA> Our reluctance in supporting this measure stems not from any lack of appreciation of the importance of industry research and development for the healthy competitive growth of industry in Australia, but from a questioning of the efficacy of the grant process as incentive to increased industrial research and development. The grant process involves an administrative allocation of the available resources-$32m-an onerous task which is undertaken with undoubted competence and integrity by the Industry Research and Development Board. The Opposition's belief is that this sort of resource allocation cannot be effectively carried out by administrative mechanisms. When the chips are down, this is not a process we would like to see governments involved in at all. </PARA>
<PARA> While not opposing the extension of the schemes, which the Government itself has given notice will be subject to comprehensive review before committing funds beyond 1994, we would judge that at best the impact on Australia's industry research and development effort and industry growth is marginal. The truth is that what is important for an effective industrial research and development level, new investment and industry development are the financial capacity to research and invest-which is largely a matter of profitability, competition, and an internationally competitive business environment. </PARA>
<PARA> That is just what we have not had over most of the life of this Hawke Government, and that is the thrust of the amendment moved by the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), which is to the effect that whilst not refusing to give the Bill a second reading, this House is of the opinion that this measure attests to the Government's failure to carry out important necessary economic reforms. </PARA>
<PARA> This amendment involves the whole gamut of policy for economic growth and development-policy to realise the boundless potential of this richly endowed country. Lest one be subjected to charges, as was the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) yesterday by a desperate Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), of selling this country short, let me assure the House that I have great faith in the boundless potential and great future of our Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently, however, the Australian economy is in dire straits and we need to recognise that. We have the deepest recession since the Great Depression of the 1930s. Notwithstanding the measure of improvement in the last balance of payments figures, the current account deficit remains stalled, despite the recession, at about 4.5 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). At that level, the foreign debt problem will continue to intensify. Currently, the gross debt is about $165 billion, which represents more than a fivefold increase under this Government. It will continue to intensify, undermining living standards, constraining future development and making this country extremely vulnerable to external shocks. Let me stress that the country will continue to borrow heavily, going extra into debt at the rate of about $50m a day to pay the interest bill on existing debt!</PARA>
<PARA> I referred a moment ago to the correlation between research and development and investment spending on the one hand and profits on the other. I have before me several graphs, one of which appeared in the 12 April issue of the Business Review Weekly. It shows the close correlation between the level of recent profitability in relation to a required return, and investment. When that falls, so does investment-as is happening very strongly at this moment. I seek leave to incorporate that graph in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was another very relevant graph on the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald last Monday week. The top line of this graph charts profits, measured by the gross operating surplus of business as a percentage of GDP. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) is wont to regale this House with what he regards as the very positive feature of his administration, that the share of profits, until recently, has been at historically high levels-not smashed by a 1981-82 style wages explosion. So he has taken the line that the recession should not be as severe as that in 1982-83, and recovery will be quicker. There is a second line on that graph. I seek leave to have the graph incorporated in Hansard, if it is technically feasible.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9G4">Dr HARRY EDWARDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The second line on the graph charts the very different course of the profit share, allowing for the murderously high interest rates over the period from mid-1988 to early 1990 and the credit explosion. The graph shows the course of the profit share after interest costs. It has plunged to a level almost as low as in 1982 and is forecast to fall further. That is why we have to face the very real possibility that recovery from the present recession will be much slower than has been previously experienced.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is accepted, as was stated in the debate yesterday, that inflation is coming down. That is important, a very key positive in the present situation. Persistent high inflation is a great distorting influence in the pattern of research and development and investment spending, but the problem is that nothing is being put in place to keep it down. A sound macro-so-called-policy, a consistent sound monetary and fiscal policy, was lacking over the 1987-90 period. As I set out in speaking to the Supply Bills the other night, the Government deliberately eased monetary policy in the early part of 1987 and thereafter, on top of a commodity price surge, and the effect was to dramatically overheat the economy. I elaborated on that the other night. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not just a matter of change in the macro area but also of change in the so-called micro area: real industrial relations change in the direction of genuine enterprise bargaining-not what goes by that name in current discussions-and major and urgent change in transport, the waterfront, telecommunications and so on to bring them up, hopefully, to international best practice. These changes are absolutely vital for a low inflation, dynamic, high productivity, high standard of living economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday in debate the Prime Minister pointed proudly to Government activity in the area of tariff reduction as a component of micro-economic reform. Of course, the trouble is that in the 12 March statement announcing the policy of further tariff reduction there was little other than rhetoric and posturing in respect of the areas that really matter-labour market reform and meaningful, effective structural change. The fact is that the two must go hand in hand. The Opposition has repeatedly stated, in supporting and advocating a program of tariff reduction to negligible levels by the year 2000, that that must go hand in hand with fundamental change in the industrial relations area and in the micro-economic area. </PARA>
<PARA> As we are under a limitation of time in the debate, I conclude on that note. While the Opposition reluctantly supports this measure, we believe it is essential that proper policies be put in place to generate a dynamic, high productivity, high standard of living economy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As has been mentioned by previous speakers, the Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill deals with a number of matters within the industry, technology and commerce portfolio. Primarily, the Bill could be described as being of a housekeeping nature, containing as it does a number of corrections to drafting errors in various Acts and certain minor administrative amendments to others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, to say that the Bill is primarily of a housekeeping nature greatly demeans one very important amendment that has been included which will have a significant role to play in the continuing progress of economic reconstruction in the growth of this country. I refer to the Industry Research and Development Act 1986, which operates as an important arm of the Federal Government's program to encourage Australian industry to look to technology, new products and new ways of doing things to maintain growth and increase our export potential. </PARA>
<PARA> I think all honourable members will agree that research and development efforts, and the attitude that Australian executives and their shareholders exhibit to research and development, will play their part in determining Australia's place in the world in the years to come. As honourable members are well and truly aware, international trade has grown tremendously over recent years on the back of factors such as the accelerating progress of world industrialisation, the continuing transport revolution and the internationalisation of finance markets. New technology and product innovation have became the order of the day in this increasingly competitive world marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA> Paramount among the new technologies that have changed the face of world trade is, of course, the computer revolution. Just as the space race brought with it a range of new and industry-adaptable technology such as teflon products, superglues and heat-resistant tiles, the emergence of computers as an everyday tool in business has thrust secondary industry into a headlong technology race. Competition for new and improved products has been immense. Countries and industries which have failed to meet the challenge of research and development have found it increasingly difficult to meet these new challenges. </PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably, it is true to say that Australia missed the boat in the early great leaps forward which occurred in the secondary industry area in the 1960s and 1970s. Although our relatively small population was used as a scapegoat, the truth remains that our lack of government leadership on the issue and our national aversion to meaningful expenditure on research and development precipitated the almost total destruction of our whitegoods, electronics and textile industries against others. The fact is that while we were satisfied to make our living on the back of primary industry and resource exports, and with tried and true technology, we let slip away the lucrative value added market which has been so comprehensively captured by countries such as Japan who have been prepared to forgo short term profits for the sake of a more profitable future. </PARA>
<PARA> The saddest aspect of Australia's failure to respond to the manufacturing industry challenges of the 1960s and 1970s is that our political leaders and our industrialists failed to heed the very clear messages of history. By the end of the 1960s it had become patently clear that the two economies which were sustaining the greatest levels of growth were the defeated Axis powers of World War II-Japan and West Germany. To even the most undiscerning commentators the reasons for this phenomenon where abundantly clear. At the end of the war the economies of those two countries had been completely destroyed-bombed out of existence, so to speak. This meant that secondary industry re-establishment had to take place from the ground up. </PARA>
<PARA> While Australia, Britain and other members of the Allies went back to post-war industries with the same tools and techniques as before, the Japanese and Germans were rebuilding their industrial enterprises from the ground up; they were completely new. They were not faced with the choice between continuing with the old ways and the expense of tooling up with the new war-induced technology. The new way was the only way they could go. Therefore their manufacturing industries entered the 1950s with a huge advantage in technology over their rivals-an advantage they have been keen to maintain over the years. Although we did not know it at the time, our slowness in responding to the immediate post-war technology boom set the scene for our dramatic failure to compete when the new technology revolution took off in the 1960s and 1970s and for our continuing problems into the 1980s and 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of our failures in the past, and with new technology now playing a central role in the process of economic growth, it is little wonder that over the last decade almost every commentator and economist in Australia has screamed `high technology' to anybody who would listen. Unlike our forebears in the 1950s and 1960s, they can see the problems that are there for advanced countries coming from behind the eight-ball into the manufacturing industry race. Although it is simplistic to believe that high technology goods such as our touted computer software can carry Australia alone, the fact is that after years of falling behind we have had to find a niche suitable to our talents and to our circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia had to have a government which recognised our problems and had the ability to create a business environment conducive to secondary industry growth. This has been one of the great strengths of this Government. In a direct fashion, the Hawke Government grants for industry research and development scheme, which was part of the Industry Research and Development Act 1986, has played a key role in encouraging Australian companies to invest in new products and product improvement. It has shown industry that the Government is prepared to provide solid backing in the area if the idea is right and the company's research is right. </PARA>
<PARA> Two important elements of the grants for industry research and development scheme have been discretionary grants and generic technology grants. Discretionary grants are awarded to companies unable to use the 150 per cent tax incentive, such as new companies developing an innovation which may not turn out a profit for several years. They are the Government's way of assisting innovation in such circumstances. Generic technology grants are awarded to researchers who are involved in research with commercial partners on schemes which have a potential for widespread use. The grants are an important tool in encouraging the best possible outcomes for research. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Bill currently before the House, those two grant forms will be extended until 1994. The amendments sanctioning the extensions have been necessary as a result of a sunset provision in the 1986 Act, which stipulated that they should cease as at 30 June 1991. With the passing of this Bill, all the Government's industry research and development support measures will have been extended, and will therefore be complementary. </PARA>
<PARA> In its research and development policies, the Hawke Government has worked hard to encourage Australian industry away from its traditional aversion to spending for the medium to long term. Despite the fast-buck merchants who proliferated in the 1980s, Labor has been successful because it has provided a total framework for industrial growth. </PARA>
<PARA> Although constrained by the individual policies of the States, the Hawke Government has by and large got the message across that the campaign for a national reconstruction and rejuvenation is in earnest. Our success in various high technology fields, such as the transplant field and the computer software industry, shows that we have the ability, and that is shown also by the results achieved by some of our more adventurous research bodies such as the Garvan Institute and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. Likewise, our universities are producing first-class research results, particularly in the medical area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government has put in place policies such as the Industry Research and Development Act 1986 which gives R&amp; the public backing it needs to succeed. The Bill before the House, therefore, will ensure that industry has those appropriate policies in place, so that it is able to make medium term research and development decisions with surety. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As has been said, the Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill before us contains, for the most part, provisions of a housekeeping nature, which, as would be known, are supported by the Opposition. However, the provisions dealing with the Industry Research and Development Act 1986 and the enactment of the national procurement and development program agreements do make a number of important changes and offer an opportunity to consider an aspect of the industry research and development scheme which is causing increasing misgivings in the business community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In saying that, I refer to the Industry Research and Development Board's conflict of interest guidelines and the manner in which they are being administered. Over the past six months I have received representations from three companies, all of which expressed concern at the operation and conduct of the industry, research and development scheme. In considering their specific complaints, I believe that there are good and necessary grounds for a thorough revision of the scheme's conflict of interest guidelines and the manner of their administration. </PARA>
<PARA> On 5 December last year, and prompted by the representations I have referred to, I asked a question on notice which sought to identify the extent to which research grants have been made to applicants who had some association with a member of the Board or with its several committees, schemes or programs. The answer to my question revealed the surprising fact that since 1986-87 almost 18 per cent of approved grants and about 30 per cent of the dollar value of total grants have gone to companies and organisations which had an association with Board and committee members. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me immediately say that I have no evidence suggesting any impropriety on the part of individual Board or committee members, or indeed of the Board as a whole. I would like to make that plain. But the Board and the Government must be aware of the dangers which such circumstances hold for an agency which is empowered to administer one of the most significant areas of research funding to Australian industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Those dangers are very real and must not be underestimated, for it is surely of some significance that three totally unrelated companies making representations to me about the operation of the industry research and development scheme all mentioned their misgivings about an agency that can allocate 30 per cent of its funding to applicants associated with its membership, while it gathers a reputation as a body which is rejecting countless applications of merit. </PARA>
<PARA> One company making these representations had excellent grounds for complaint, as it met all the criteria. It has established a small but impressive export market with a high technology product, yet successive applications over six years for a modest research grant have all failed. </PARA>
<PARA> I was disturbed about this and got in touch with the secretariat of the Industry Research and Development Board and it provided me with a copy of the conflict of interest guidelines which govern industry research and development procedures and also a detailed explanation of the way in which these were applied. For example, guideline No. 2 states that:</PARA>
<PARA> Where a member is aware of a conflict of interest, the member should advise the meeting and this should be included in the minutes. The member should then leave the room. </PARA>
<PARA>The secretariat expressed confidence that these aspects of the conflict of interest guidelines were being closely adhered to, but obviously reservations must be felt about phrases such as `where a member is aware' and `should advise the meeting'. Similar reservations must be felt about the wording of guideline No. 6. I turn to guideline No. 3, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Board or Committee should decide, in the absence of the member, whether it wants the member to be present and/or participate in discussion or not. </PARA>
<PARA>Guideline No. 4 states:</PARA>
<PARA>In general, requests from applicants that certain members not see applications be rejected. </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat: `requests from applicants that certain members not see applications be rejected'. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA>In exceptional cases, where such requests may seem reasonable, the Secretariat as appropriate to discuss the request with the applicant and the relevant Chairman and/or Board Chairman. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, guideline No. 5 provides:</PARA>
<PARA>Members who declare an interest will not receive reports or information on those matters in which they have an interest, where their interest is known before meetings. Discussions regarding their interest will be deleted from their copies of the minutes, unless the Board decides that they should be present-</PARA>
<PARA>during relevant discussions and decision making. If I can go back to guideline No. 2, it will be recalled that it provides for a member to declare a conflict of interest, for that to be minuted and for the member to leave the room. There is little satisfaction for an applicant in such a procedure, as the documentation containing important commercial information will have already been sighted by a competitor in reaching the decision to disclose a possible conflict of interest in terms of guideline No. 2. </PARA>
<PARA> In any event, there is little comfort in all these provisions when guideline No. 4 provides that, `in general, requests from applicants that certain members not see applications be rejected'. It is the wording of guidelines Nos 3, 4 and 5, and their relationship to guidelines Nos 2 and 6, that bothers me very greatly. That also bothers the three companies which have made representations to me on these matters. Also, we know that it has bothered Monash University and ICI. They were joint applicants for a grant and, as disclosed in the Minister's reply to my question on notice, they requested that Board member Mr Hanley, who was associated with the company Memtec Ltd, not be involved in the assessment of their project. Mr Hanley left the room while the matter was discussed, but the Board decided that Mr Hanley should participate and noted that, under the Board's conflict of interest guidelines, requests by grant applicants for certain Board members not to see an application should normally be rejected. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus we have a situation where the Government's premier industry research funding agency has not only approved more than $55m over 4 1/2 years to applicants that have an association with Board and committee members but also handles applicants' confidential commercial information in what can only be described as a cavalier fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> This raises a number of questions. In how many instances of the 80 grants identified in the answer to my question as having a conflict of interest association with Board or committee members were those members allowed to retain their participation in the decision making process? Is not a considerable commercial insensitivity, at the very least, shown by the Board in having a guideline stating that an applicant's request for his or her application not to be sighted by certain members will generally be rejected?</PARA>
<PARA> Is there not a most unsatisfactory contradiction between guidelines Nos 4 and 5 where the former states that requests for applications not to be seen by certain members will generally be rejected, yet the latter states that reports and/or information, presumably in relation to ongoing deliberations, will not be made available to a member where conflict of interest is known beforehand? In other words, a member may be given the application and its documentation but then be excluded from subsequent information about its progress through the Board. There is little comfort to the applicant in such an arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> Is there not also a serious inconsistency between guidelines Nos 4 and 3? The former states that requests that applications not be seen by certain members will generally be rejected and the latter that where the Board or committee may decide that there is a conflict of interest and that a member should be excluded from further participating in that subject. </PARA>
<PARA> It is these several aspects of the guidelines which I and many people in the business community find totally unsatisfactory. The circumstances of one of the companies which made representation to me is particularly relevant to the above consideration. This person's product was directly competitive with a product being developed by a member of the Board. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the rejection of his application was obviously a disappointment, his and my concern is that the Board's conflict of interest guidelines are being administered in a way which means that highly confidential commercial information became available to a competitor company. Further, even if his competitor had admitted to a conflict of interest, it seems very likely that the Board member would have been readmitted to the meeting to participate in the decision making. Even if he had asked for his application not to be disclosed to his competitor, all the available evidence suggests that this was unlikely to be agreed to by the Board. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps if the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean), who is at the table, were to experience the reality of commercial life, he might appreciate why the business community has very good grounds for its growing mistrust of the Board's conduct. In saying that, I want to re-emphasise that I do not have any evidence to question the integrity of individual Board members. However, I am saying that it is totally unsatisfactory for an industry research funding agency to conduct its conflict of interest guidelines in such a manner as to place its members in a position which creates needless and potentially damaging doubts about the agency's impartiality. </PARA>
<PARA> For the sake of the excellent work being done by the Industry Research and Development Board in fostering important projects amongst small and medium sized companies with thin capital support, it is not good enough that the business community's trust be jeopardised by, at the very least, imprudent conflict of interest guidelines and their insensitive administration. The work of the industry research and development scheme is so important that its conduct must have all applicants' unequivocal confidence that sensitive commercial information is not being sighted by competitors and that the selection process is, and is seen to be, of unimpeachable integrity. </PARA>
<PARA> To achieve this, I suggest that the conflict of interest guidelines need to be redrafted and administered such that, in the first instance, all Board or committee members would be provided with only an applicant's name and a synopsis of the product or process involved in their application. Members would be required to declare a conflict of interest on the basis of that preliminary information. A declaration of conflict of interest will exclude that member from receiving a copy of the applicant's application and supporting documentation; participating in any meeting or discussion at which that application is being considered; and from receiving any reports or other information on Board or committee discussions or decisions. As well, irrespective of whether a conflict of interest has been declared, an applicant must have the right to ask that certain members not be provided with a copy of his application or its supporting documentation and that the request be granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The industry research and development scheme provides a valuable role in supporting industrial research and development among companies which would otherwise find it almost impossible to obtain the necessary financial backing. As we all know, Australia is presently at a place in its history where it is a matter of great national importance that industrial research and development be encouraged and its effectiveness maximised. My comments are directed towards both goals, and I would hope that the Minister at the table will treat very seriously the concern and misgivings which are widespread within the relevant community about the operation of the Board and take closely to heart those suggestions which I think would tighten up the conflict of interest requirements very considerably and very properly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill continues the Government's real commitment to ensuring that research and development and the broad range of research and development initiatives in industry are given a positive Government impetus and that the programs set in place and the extension of those research programs are treated with priority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one looks at the measures in this Bill and at the measures announced in the industry statement on 12 March and if one takes account of the recent growth in a number of reform areas such as in our telecommunications reform, one will see a common thread running through those arrangements-a commitment to industry, research and development and a recognition on the part of the Government that government has a part to play in many fields, particularly in innovative technology areas, in ensuring that there is a strong scope to provide the stimulus to ensure that research work is undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> I guess it has been one of the features of industrial development in this country that less emphasis has been put on research, in a pure and applied sense, than in many other countries. As other speakers in this debate have said, the fact that in the past we have been able to rely so strongly on primary production and resource development has meant that a lot of inventiveness that was certainly always a feature of our life has not been able to develop to its full potential. The value added aspects of our industrial development have not always been achieved because of a number of factors, particularly the fact that there has been a lack of research effort and a lack of capital for development of product. We have tended to rely on primary products producing the export wealth that we can use to buy imported goods rather than encourage production at home. </PARA>
<PARA> The reforms that the Government has progressively undertaken in the area of tariffs have all been part of ensuring that we were internationally competitive and that we were engaged in productive processes that would enable us to compete in the world market. As a result, the recent trade figures show that our export earning potential is growing. It certainly has the potential to grow even further, providing that we recognise both the importance of the research and the development of the value added industries here and the strength of where our real markets are for so many of the products that we develop. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the real scope for us to become a major exporter and to develop our industry is in the Asian market. Historically, industrial research and development has tended to overlook that potential. Indeed, stories have been told about our trying in the past to engage in export of refined wool products at the same time as direct participants in the industry were saying, `Well, don't worry about that, we can just sell the raw material overseas and we do not have to worry about the productive processes down the line'. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation currently before us provides the scope for companies which are seeking to develop that research effort, both in an individual sense and in a collective and collaborative way between research institutions-be they the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) or other research establishments-and industry to apply that research endeavour in a more rigorous way. I think this is particularly important. Only in recent weeks we saw the example of an Australian company in the field of aviation winning a major contract for the development and manufacture of parts of the tail of the new Boeing aircraft. That is the sort of thing that can be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it will be achieved only if we set in place arrangements that provide a positive stimulus and a sense of purpose to the research effort that we undertake. Many members opposite constantly refer to this in a negative way, saying that is picking winners. The fact that we set up a process that gives very positive tax benefit to people to engage in research is fundamental. This scheme provides that companies that are not covered by the normal tax concession processes for research will be covered by the discretionary grants arrangements. In addition, there are the generic technology grants arrangements, which through this Bill are being extended to June 1994. </PARA>
<PARA> All of those things are important, because many small businesses that actually develop in the technological and electrical fields need only fairly modest assistance to develop their products to a stage where, with financial support and stimulus and the capital that is provided, they can go on to become substantial exporters. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently, I had the opportunity to visit the Alcatel operation at Botany in Sydney. There is no doubt that its achievements, considering the potential of what that company could actually achieve in Asia in the telecommunications area, are a great reflection on the skill and capacity of the researchers in Australia and also on their capacity to link that into international operations, as I say, particularly in the Asian market. </PARA>
<PARA> We can achieve more of those sorts of things if we are conscious of the fact that we must have an ethos about the development of such industries. We do not have to say that they all need to have protective tariffs and that sort of thing. That was the way of the past and clearly that is now inappropriate. What we do need to say is that, in something like our telecommunications reform measures, to which we have devoted a lot of energy, we are very conscious of the industry potential that those reforms should offer. </PARA>
<PARA> Part of the process of establishing the reforms in telecommunications surely should be that the skills and the opportunities that reform process offers actually provide wealth and advancement for the Australian industry as a whole. That can be achieved. The way to do that, in part, is for the Government to provide research assistance that can be targeted to those important areas. </PARA>
<PARA> In this respect, there is a great deal of opportunity in the various medical technology fields. Organisations such as the CSIRO play a particularly important role in conducting research in the area of its own endeavour and assisting with research skills in the medical faculties of universities, as well as with companies in the pharmaceuticals area, for example, where again there is a tremendous opportunity for a collective effort to achieve development in the pharmaceuticals area. This can be done if we provide the sort of stimulus provided through these sorts of grants. </PARA>
<PARA> Only recently I made a visit to Westmead Hospital in my electorate, where medical researchers are engaging in particularly practical research projects in the field of development of treatment for the elderly. Their projects include more appropriate ways of developing the technology for hip replacements, for example, so that, as the population ages, we can benefit from innovations in medical technology. The many elderly people who need hip replacement operations will no longer require the difficult and long rehabilitation processes that go with them. </PARA>
<PARA> The medical technology research that is going on at Westmead Hospital has the potential to be a great asset to medical science not only in this country but also in the world. One of the difficulties that institutions like Westmead Hospital and its research institute have concerns provision of the funding to get many of these projects going in the first place. We need to ensure that, until something tangible comes out in the way of results, such projects will be adequately funded in the initial stages. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important for government to play a part in that process. Often once people have seen that something is starting to flow from it they will come along and be prepared to take up research effort. However, to have the researchers and academics able to do the research devote the time to it, means that the resources must be there in the first place. They need the resources to enable them to undertake the very painstaking work needed to establish that their field of inquiry has a purpose and is going to achieve a result. This needs government support in the field of industry research grants and it requires working in a collaborative way, because so many of these projects are indeed an amalgam of effort between companies, between the CSIRO or other research organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> The best way of achieving that is actually to have some positive and collaborative way of achieving that development. So many people in the research field say to me that what they really need is just a seeding sort of grant to get those endeavours going. Once they get that, they can then move on and achieve results which would mean no doubt that many people, if they were successful, would be able to move very constructively forward, once they saw the value and the real earning capacity that those inventive processes offer. </PARA>
<PARA> For all those reasons, the sorts of measures set out in this legislation are really very critical in the development of our industry base. We should not be prepared to sit back and say that industry base will just take care of itself. Governments have a responsibility to give the lead in focusing on those fields, particularly in the technologies areas. For that reason I believe that this legislation, in conjunction with the measures in the industry statement, are really vital to ensure that the industry development that we have started to achieve becomes an even stronger reality over the next decade. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to oppose the amendment and to respond to a number of points that have been made in the debate. The amendment itself is a confusing one. On the face of it, it seeks to be critical of the Government's failure to carry out necessary economic reforms, which has resulted in a number of things: the incapacity of Australia's economy to derive full benefits from technological innovation, the high cost of capital and the inability of small start-up companies to access capital. But in the context of that criticism, it opposes the extension of a measure that has been an integral part of the Government's fundamental economic reforms to achieve the result of linking the application to the discovery.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Therefore, I find it a confusing amendment. I can understand the confusion, given the fact that the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), who moved it, seems to think that the solution to these problems is a free market one, where all one really has to do is get the economic fundamentals operating correctly for the necessary investment to take place and industry to make the decisions necessary to enable the better application of our discovery. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me just go to those points because the statistics reveal that when this Government came to power the percentage of the gross domestic product that the private sector was prepared to spend on research and development was 0.2 per cent. That was, in essence, leaving it to the market. It was leaving it to the market in circumstances in which, for a number of years, the cost of capital was not the problem. It was leaving it to the market in circumstances in which plenty of investment was available, but it still did not happen. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Labor Party, however, the reality has been that that 0.2 per cent of gross domestic product has risen to 0.52 per cent. The contribution of the private sector has, in fact, seen a trebling of its expenditure on research and development. This has occurred because schemes such as the grants for industrial research and development have been there as an integral part of encouraging and fostering the framework in which the private sector responds better. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me just briefly explain what our framework for encouraging that outcome has been. It has been built around three very important planks in science and technology policy: firstly, continuing to foster the environment for the excellence of our research effort, which is world-recognised; secondly, ensuring that there is better cooperation between the competing research endeavours, in both the public and the private sector; and, thirdly, ensuring that we are not just clever at discovering things but that we become more clever at developing and applying, in commercial terms, the outcome of that discovery. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Government's approach to science and technology, to meet the first point the Government has secured the science and research base in this country. The last Budget, for example, saw a 2.3 per cent real increase in expenditure on science and research in this country against, for Budget outlays generally, a cut of 0.6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Towards the end of last year, we saw the commitment to guaranteeing triennium funding for the three science agencies. We saw the increase in the salaries of the scientists employed by the CSIRO, and we are pursuing the other issues going to the question of capital infrastructure and the supplementation of the salaries issues to ensure that the research base for the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and related agencies is not cut into. We have seen the development of setting external targets for the agencies to obtain funding from the private sector-all of which has been able to be retained by those agencies-which has not only forged better linkages, but which has given a much more solid funding base. </PARA>
<PARA> In overall terms, the Government's commitment and public expenditure on R&amp; in this country is high by Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development standards. This country has fallen down in the past-and we are starting to redress it, but we still have a long way to go-because the private sector has not seen the same need to concentrate the effort and expenditure on expanding its R&amp; effort to ensure a more competitive position. A nation cannot become competitive unless it is prepared to be innovative and it cannot be innovative unless it is prepared to spend money in the development of research. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this Government we have seen a number of programs-this Bill is but one of them-which have fostered an environment that has seen a trebling in private sector R&amp; expenditure. There is the 150 per cent tax concession that the Government announced in the March economic statement, the extension indefinitely of a tax concession for eligible R&amp;. There is the external funding, which I have alluded to, which has seen much stronger linkages between not only the science agencies but also the universities. Better linkages between industry and our research effort is resulting in better applications, but also involves industry being prepared to support the research effort not just verbally but by putting its money in as well. </PARA>
<PARA> The cooperative research centre program-the first 15 centres have been announced-in essence has been a strategy to get linkages between the public and private research effort in this country and to get linkages between industry and research in this country. The Government, whilst it made a commitment to an additional $100m over the next five years to fund that, has used that as leverage to get a multiplier impact. That $100m will at least be matched by participating agencies and a substantial proportion of that will be coming from the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Those policies to date have seen a trebling in private sector expenditure on R&amp;; they will continue to see growth in private sector R&amp;. In fact, until the recent recession, the reality was that expenditure by the private sector on R&amp; in this country had been the fastest of all the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries-not because we allowed the market to finally bring a realisation to these companies that they should be starting to spend, but because we have gone out and prodded them, levered them and given them assistance. That is why this measure and its extension is an important recognition of that approach, of that strategy. It has worked and it will continue to work. It has worked only because we have had that strategy. The alternative being proposed in this wishy-washy amendment which effectively says, `Let us get out of all these things; leave it to the market and everything will be rosy,' has failed this country in the past and it will fail it in the future. It is for that reason that we oppose the amendment that is proposed. The honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar) raised the question of conflict of interest and whilst it is not technically an issue in the Bill before the House, I take the opportunity to respond because I think the issue that he raises is his concern, but I think it is a misplaced concern. </PARA>
<PARA> I say that for two reasons. The conflict of interest test has been rigorously applied in terms of the grants for industry research and development (GIRD) scheme. For the reasons that the honourable member raised-it can be open to criticism; certain interests might be looked after at the expense of others-a very rigorous approach has been adopted to circumstances in which a conflict should be declared. I think that point should be understood when looking at the absolute figures in terms of how many conflicts are registered. The figures appear high, but that is because of the rigour of the circumstance and the conditions under which conflicts are registered. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to give an example, because I had these figures drawn out and I think they have probably been forwarded to the honourable member for Warringah in response to the question he had on the Notice Paper. In the two-year period ending 30 December 1990, the Board recorded 75 instances of conflict of interest-75 out of some 246. But of those 75 instances, 32 involved a direct conflict of interest where a member was an employee of an applicant or owned shares in the applicant. Of the 32 instances, eight involved the CSIRO during the period when Dr Colin Adam was a director of the CSIRO's Institute of Industrial Technology. If we take those eight instances away from the 32, we see that 24 out of 246 instances involved a direct conflict of interest. Another five of the 75 instances of conflict of interest involved a less direct conflict of interest where the member or his employer was associated with the applicant's commercial or research collaborator. </PARA>
<PARA> In these cases, the member's organisation did not receive funds, although it could have benefited indirectly from a successful application. A total of 37 conflicts occurred where the member, or his employer, was affiliated with the applicant in some way, through its being a parent or subsidy company, through the provision of professional advice or as a competitor. In one case-and I guess this is the one to which the honourable member for Warringah referred when he mentioned the cavalier approach in terms of the response to Monash University's application-the conflict of interest was requested by the applicant, but the member's exclusion from the debate was subsequently disallowed by the Board. In answer to the question about how many were in that category, it would seem on this information that there was only one-one of the 75, but of the 75, 24 only involved a direct conflict of interest. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect of this question, and the figures do not precisely overlap because they relate to different periods of time, is that there were many applications associated with members which were rejected. For example, there were 65 rejections between 1987 and 1990. That is the first point. I think we have to get into perspective the significance of these conflicts of interest in the total picture. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point is that even if people think that 24 out of 75 is still a high number, they have to understand the nature of this Board. What we as a government have set about to do is ensure that we have the highest calibre of people on this Board-people who have the expertise and the experience in knowing where the research is at and where industry should be going. They are the people whom we have asked to give their time in assisting us to get this country going in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Warringah has acknowledged the capacity of those people on the Board. He does not impugn any of them, and I accept his comment in that regard-indeed, I welcome it. But I just make the point that if we have been so successful in getting the highest calibre of people on the Board, is it unusual for them to be involved in some of the applications that come before the Board, given that the people on the Board have been successful, effective and know where they are going? I do not find that strange at all. </PARA>
<PARA> What I think one has to do is not just criticise the numbers, but assert more effectively that the scheme is not being administered properly. I do not think, on the face of the figures and the statistics, that one can do that. I hope, in going to those points, that I have helped allay some of concerns that the honourable member for Warringah has expressed. The Government opposes the Opposition's amendment and commends the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition does not oppose the amendment now before us. However, we do not intend to allow the occasion to pass without recording our supreme annoyance that this was a necessary course of action by the Government. Quite frankly, it is sloppy work that this amendment was not contained in the Bill when it came before the House some weeks ago, and it is simply not good enough.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean), I notice, has failed to advise us why we now must consider an amendment that was left out of the Bill earlier on. It is not a practice we will condone and it is, quite frankly, bordering on incompetence, either by the Minister or by somebody within his Department. </PARA>
<PARA> I might be entirely unfair here, but I would ask why is it that so many of these blunders are associated with the Minister for Science and Technology? Somebody will tell me if I am being unfair, but it is a string of coincidences that every time the Minister for Science and Technology has charge of some legislation, something goes wrong. Either the amendments are tabled at the last moment, he is not here to hear the opinions of members from both sides of the chamber or, as on this occasion, for the third time when I have been personally involved in this session, we find another piece of sloppy work-an amendment being introduced at the last moment to correct a deficiency that was, sadly, apparent in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> We have to be charitable to the Minister for Science and Technology because, after all, he has only been in this place five minutes. Of course, he is a Minister, the Minister for Science and Technology, which is a matter, no doubt, of supreme annoyance to some of those who have laboured on the back bench for a very long time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House is now considering the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment Bill 1991 and the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Royalty) Amendment Bill 1991. I point out to the House, to the gallery and to others that the Bills have been available to the Parliament for less than one week. Clearly, this does not best serve the due processes of democracy because there is a need to give detailed consideration to this type of complex legislation. It is hard to understand, in one sense, why relatively uncontentious Bills such as these could not have been drafted and introduced earlier in the session so that we were not, as always, faced with this logjam legislation-by-sausage-machine process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Be that as it may, on our side of the House we have a commitment to ensuring as much as possible that proper consideration is given to all legislation, including these two Bills. We have prepared our position accordingly, and our position is not to oppose these two Bills but, indeed, to move a second reading amendment and to examine this legislation further in the Senate, where more appropriate processes exist to facilitate that. </PARA>
<PARA> In saying that, I also highlight that, again, it is a case of both sides of the Parliament being in fundamental agreement in relation to legislation. Indeed, some 90 per cent of all legislation goes through Parliament with the agreement of both sides. That is not fully understood by the public at large. It is worthy of note that we have again reached that conclusion in respect of these two Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the parent Act contained in the royalty amendment Bill will enable the efficient determination and collection of royalties from the North West Shelf project, which is now the only region offshore that is subject to these royalties. As a result of this legislation, an interim royalty will be paid by the producers in circumstances where full agreement on an actual level of payment is yet to be finalised. Once agreement has been reached, adjustments to the interim royalty payment will be made. Any overpayment to the producers is required to be paid back within 28 days. Any royalty payment which has been made by the producers will now be considered as an interim payment until such time as the full details of the royalty calculation have been verified and accepted. </PARA>
<PARA> The adjustment to royalty in cases of overpayment or underpayment will be facilitated and, indeed, where there has been an overpayment there will be effectively another 28-day period in which the adjustment will be made by a reduction to the subsequent royalty payment required. So on both sides of that equation there is a similar period. Overpayments are required in 28 days and, by one method or another, refunds from the Government to the producers are also required within one calendar month by a downward reduction to the next royalty payment. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the point, however, that sometimes there can be quite massive amounts involved, as in the extraordinary circumstances of the excise tariff saga in 1990 and the incorrect ruling by the Government relating to rates of excise payable by the Bass Strait oil producers. It reached a situation where some $200m was in dispute with regard to certain royalty payments. I make the further point that, whether it be Woodside or any other company with respect to the North West Shelf, a sudden requirement to pay an amount of $200m within 28 days would be a very great burden to place on any company, especially in these tough economic times. </PARA>
<PARA> I put to the Government and to the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) that they should take up that point and give further consideration to the correction of the payment time period of 28 days. I choose not to move a specific amendment; the coalition recognises that there is a similar time period on both sides of the equation. Nevertheless, any further assurances the Minister can give with regard to this 28-day time period for payment of adjustment would be appreciated and will be considered by the Liberal and National parties, especially as this legislation is examined further in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The other Bill before the House is the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment Bill 1991, which will make a number of miscellaneous amendments to the parent legislation: firstly, enabling delegation to appropriate officials of routine administrative decisions that are required under the parent Act; secondly, requiring holders of offshore petroleum titles to take out appropriate insurance against environmental mishaps rather than the present system of lodging securities with the Government; thirdly, encouraging seismic surveying on a speculative basis of offshore areas not held under a petroleum title; fourthly, terminating the lease of a petroleum exploration permit which lies partly in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and partly in the Torres Strait protected zone; fifthly, removing any ambiguity that exists with respect to royalties obtained from the North West Shelf project, which has been agreed to by the Western Australian Government-in between all its other distractions at this time; and, finally, removing minor ambiguities relating to the Crimes Act. </PARA>
<PARA> These amendments are routine, except perhaps for the termination of the permit in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. I want to make it very clear that the Liberal and National parties support that termination. We do not support drilling for oil and producing oil in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The holder of this permit, Petroz NL, through no fault of its own, is being forced to relinquish control of a permit which did have considerable promise. In fact, I understand that the company was greatly impressed by the potential of this permit. </PARA>
<PARA> I say again and emphasise that we do not take issue with the decision to terminate the permit. At the same time, the facts speak for themselves. The Australian oil exploration industry has a good record with regard to environmental management. Far more oil has leaked naturally from the seabed around Australia than has ever been spilt by the oil industry. The Great Barrier Reef is a natural treasure. It is also a national treasure and deserves extraordinary measures to protect it. </PARA>
<PARA> Disagreements will arise about the lengths that must be gone to to protect the reef, and I do not dispute the decision embraced by this Bill. However, the company involved invested time and money in the permit on the understanding at that time that it would be able to carry out its exploration program and then reap the benefits of oil production if the program were successful. Of course, to a large extent this took place prior to the declaration of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The company began exploration activities trusting that the Government would not break an agreement. Having proceeded on that basis, it now faces this termination. That then leads to the question of compensation. </PARA>
<PARA> Many companies have complained about the lack of consistency in these things when the rules of the game are changed. Again and again I meet managers of Australia's resources companies-people who are creating export dollars for Australia-who tell me that one of the significant problems with new investment is interference from government; namely, the important question of sovereign risk. Why? Because the Hawke Labor Government cannot be trusted. Only the Hawke Government would need to resort to resource security legislation because the forestry industry, with complete justification, has had to threaten to withhold future investment given its uncertain circumstances. Only the Hawke Government can cripple the potential billion dollar industry by restricting the nation to three uranium mines. </PARA>
<PARA> Overnight we have learnt that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) no longer has the courage to take forward a policy change decision to the Hobart conference to abolish Labor's illogical three mines policy. Indeed, it would now seem, from media reports, that the illogical policy is going to stay in place. That word `illogical' is not my word; it is the Prime Minister's own description of uranium policy. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DG4">Mr TIM FISCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So, come in spinner. I have to say that the honourable member for Prospect ought to be aware that the Bill relates to the question of sovereign risk, which is extraordinarily relevant to the oil and mining industries. In that context, I say to the House that the world is watching Australia and its critical decisions with regard to this legislation, uranium mining and Coronation Hill. The rest of the world and Australians-businessmen, small and large, and Australians individually-are very concerned about the national interest and jobs, jobs and jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the context of this legislation overall, we want to see more decisive leadership from this Government because only the Hawke Government has got it so wrong that all the concerns about jobs, resource security and the like have arisen. Those concerns were added to because of the Hawke Government's decision to break a legally binding contract with a private company to try to sell off the pipeline bringing gas from Moomba to New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, I could refer to other decisions in that context, but I will refer to just one other in respect of the oil industry, which is dealt with by this legislation; that is, the decision of the Hawke Government to rush through legislation to obstruct hearings before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT), which was about to make a correct decision, an awarded decision-presumably advisedly-against the Government and in favour of two oil companies. That occasion goes to the heart of sovereign risk. The Government decided to legislate, rather than allow the umpire, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, to make a proper determination with regard to Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd (BHP) and Esso Australia Ltd. Is that a fair-minded approach? Is that the type of approach which builds confidence so far as investors are concerned with regard to oil, mining and business in general? Of course it is not. The Government plucked the decision from the umpire and said, `We will have legislation on the matter' and the AAT then was not able to proceed with its determination. </PARA>
<PARA> The Great Barrier Reef is dealt with specifically in relation to this legislation. Petroz NL, having had its permit terminated, is putting time and money into exploration elsewhere. It put a great deal of effort into this particular permit. But, of course, it is the decision of the Government and the Parliament to terminate the particular lease within the Great Barrier Reef and we support the decision. Equally, we ask the Minister what his view is with regard to the question of compensation. We ask the Minister what the relevant parallels and guidelines are with regard to compensation. The fact that another operator may have decided to walk away from an area and not seek compensation does not necessarily mean that there is not a relevant principle involved, as this legislation takes from Petroz a permit which no longer can be operated by proper decision of government and parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I invite the Minister to address this question of compensation in terms of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment Bill because it has ramifications wider than this one-off circumstance and it is one which will be further pursued quite properly in the Senate in the light of the Minister's response to the queries that I have raised quite properly here today. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the Petroleum (Submerged lands) (Royalty) Amendment Bill and the Petroleum Submerged Lands Amendment Bill, I say again that the Liberal and National parties are not opposed to the legislation. But I say again, as the Minister has now joined us, that there is need for clarification with regard to the 28-day question on the payments, as I have sought from him by way of response, because some quite large amounts may well be involved and 28 days could be a very tight timetable. I recognise that 28 days is provided for the additional payments and, in effect, a calendar month is also provided for refunds. That needs to be taken into account. Equally, I ask that the Minister respond with regard to the circumstances of Petroz as it is dealt with in respect of this legislation and the quite proper following through of decisions of the Parliament taken previously to create the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and to respect that marine park. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said all that, I do two things. Firstly, I point out that there is a capability of the oil industry to be environmentally responsible and drill in close proximity to sensitive adjoining areas. In Holland, other places in Europe, California and elsewhere it has been shown that one can have operational oil wells within suburban areas without any difficulty whatsoever. Honourable members who have been to Los Angeles airport and along the coastal fringe of the massive and sprawling city of Los Angeles will have seen right on the edge of beaches and the like oil wells pumping away. Oil is produced from fields underneath the city of Los Angeles and underneath the golden beaches of California without duress environmentally in relation to that operation. </PARA>
<PARA> It should not be taken as read that whole areas of Australia should be locked away from the oil industry. There is a great prospectivity for oil in Australia and the Minister has spoken of that prospectivity on other occasions. We need to be careful to ensure that we do not paint a picture which will lead to public demand that whole areas of our offshore continental shelf be locked away from oil exploration when there is a need to explore responsibly and properly and develop the areas where there is a chance of production of oil and, of course, to do that within proper guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> The second and last thing I would like to do in the context of the remarks I have made is move the second reading amendment which has been circulated in my name. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That all the words after ``That'' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words. </PARA>
<PARA> ``whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House calls on the Government to review the issue of compensation for holders of terminated exploration leases, noting-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the loss already incurred by the lease-holders in investments made in the leases which cannot now be recouped; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the loss of potential income from oil production in the leases caused by the Government's failure to give appropriate consideration to the issue of compensation for the termination of exploration leases''. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in support of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment Bill and certainly not in support of the amendment. I think that the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) has possibly, when reading clause 14, misunderstood what is involved in acquiring a permit. After all, the Government is not going to gain from it. It is just asking a particular company to relinquish a permit. Otherwise we are going to have illogical legislation in this House such as would virtually provide that a person who went for a permit to drive a car would be compensated if he did not go ahead and get his licence. One has to look at where we are going in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill, in seeking to terminate oil exploration, is certainly, I believe, a step in the right direction. Our Government has a policy which promotes an efficient and competitive petroleum exploration and production industry. Its goal is to maximise the contribution that industry makes to the well-being of all Australians. However, this contribution must entail sound operating, safety and environmental practices and must not be to the detriment of our delicate ecosystems. </PARA>
<PARA> In addressing the 1990 Australian Petroleum Exploration Association, the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) unequivocally stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Petroleum exploration cannot take place in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, and I see no future for exploration in the park. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister said that environments such as that in the Great Barrier Reef must be protected from any chance of damage, however small, from a spill and that the industry's main focus should be preventing oil spills arising from exploration and development activity. I completely support the Minister in this stand, and I am glad to see that the Opposition does too. Having had the opportunity to see the tremendous beauty of the Barrier Reef as late as last year, I believe exploration should never again be allowed to occur. This Bill is a step towards achieving that goal. </PARA>
<PARA> Oil companies stopped drilling in the reef area in 1971, following a public outcry which led to a royal commission in 1975. There has been no further exploration since that time, but it is clear that the Great Barrier Reef would always be in danger if exploration permits were allowed to continue to exist. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Canberra Times on 9 April a petroleum engineer said that it would be possible to `exploit the reef in an environmentally sensitive way' as the `risk of spills was so negligible as to be meaningless'. He also said that because Australian crude oil was lighter than others it `did not pose the same risk to coastal life as spills elsewhere in the world'. I refute those statements. With such a delicate and sensitive ecosystem in our control, it is every Australian's responsibility to ensure that, no matter how small oil explorers see the risk as being, the Great Barrier Reef is protected against any chance of an oil spill. This means banning all oil exploration and development practices in and around the reef, as this Government has now done.</PARA>
<PARA> If this Bill is passed, and I hope that with the debate in the Senate eventually it will be passed, there will be no more exploration permits either within the reef or surrounding it, and the Government will not even consider releasing these areas for exploration or development. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has assured us that any proposals for exploration in the vicinity of the marine park would be subject to the strictest scientific and environmental analysis and that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority would assess any proposed activities. </PARA>
<PARA> Late last year Chevron Asiatic Limited voluntarily-I emphasise that-surrendered the four oil and gas exploration permits it held in the Great Barrier Reef area. Those four permits, covering 12.34 million hectares from Cairns to the south of Rockhampton, have now been cancelled and will not be reinstated. The permits had been acquired by Chevron in 1963 and two wells were drilled in 1968, following the completion of a 5,000 kilometre seismic survey. Through its action in relinquishing those four permits Chevron has shown not only to Australia but to the rest of the world that it is an environmentally responsible company. </PARA>
<PARA> Perth oil explorer Petroz NL, to which the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) referred, still holds the remaining permit, and this Government has asked Petroz to relinquish its title to the acreage. If Petroz had relinquished the permit to the Government of its own accord there would now be no need for this section of the legislation. I therefore appeal to Petroz to attend to its environmental responsibilities and follow Chevron's lead by voluntarily surrendering its exploration permit now. </PARA>
<PARA> Our Great Barrier Reef is the largest system of corals and associated life forms in the world. It is encompassed in a marine park within the Great Barrier Reef region covering an area of some 350,000 square kilometres on the Australian continental shelf. The reef is a complex 2,000-kilometre-long maze of about 2,600 individual reefs; the habitat of some 1,500 species of fish, 350 species of hard coral, 4,000 molluscs and 240 species of birds. The reef may be the last place on earth in which dugong-an endangered species-are still common and at this stage not in jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA> In the north the reef is narrow and its eastern edge is marked by a series of narrow ribbon reefs, but in the southern areas it broadens out and presents a vast wilderness of patch reefs. Tropical reef ecosystems are diverse, complex and highly productive. The coral reefs, mangroves and seagrass beds are major components. Because of the low physical energy prevailing generally inside the Great Barrier Reef lagoon, beaches and inter-reefal areas are also biologically diverse and very active. </PARA>
<PARA> Water circulation within the Great Barrier Reef lagoon maintains links between reefs. This means that in the instance of an oil spill the events that may occur on one reef could possibly occur on other reefs, even on those reefs that are considerably downstream from the originally affected reef. It seems, from past experience of the petroleum and oil transport industries, that there will always be some risk of a blow-out or spill, even if the technology for prevention and clean-up improves over time. The probability of risk depends on many factors, including the prospectivity of the areas, the technology used for exploration and production, safety measures taken and, of course, weather.</PARA>
<PARA> If a spill did occur, wind-generated surface currents are likely to be the dominant factor in the movement of oil, and winds throughout the year are predominantly from the south-east or east. The most likely movement of an oil spill in the Coral Sea is, therefore, onto the Queensland continental shelf, although the direction and the speed will depend on the winds, the tides and the currents that are prevailing at that particular time. </PARA>
<PARA> The east Australia current flows to the south along the continental shelf over most of the areas adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The large scale ocean currents are likely to be less important than the wind-generated currents in the movement of oil spills. The most likely direction of movement of an oil spill by wind-generated currents from any of those areas would be west-north-west, although there may be considerable variability associated with other influences, such as underlying ocean currents. </PARA>
<PARA> Corals are susceptible to impacts from oil, both from acute and chronic events. The extent of the impact will depend on the volume, the frequency and the duration of the spill and of the character of the oil being spilt. Spills off the Caribbean coast of Panama have shown extensive mortality of corals. The sublethal effects of chronic spills can be extensive and serious through changes to community structure. Invertebrate animals associated with coral reefs can also suffer immediate mortality from oil spills. Mangrove ecosystems are particularly susceptible to the effects of oil and the mortality occurs through the smothering of the tree roots. The problems can become compounded by the entrapment of oil within the mangroves and the sediments. </PARA>
<PARA> We know also that the effect of oil on seagrass beds and on invertebrate fauna living in or on the beds is variable, ranging from catastrophic to slight. Recolonisation can be rapid, although entrapment of oil can be a problem, and the vertebrate fauna such as our seabirds and whales can be seriously affected by oil. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the 1986 summer edition of the international marine journal Oceanus:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the increasing use of Great Barrier Reef waters for navigating large vessels raises concerns over the risks and repercussions of shipping accidents . . . The potential clearly exists for more serious accidents that could possibly lead to major oil spills. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, there are enough risks facing our magnificent marine park outside this Government's control, such as spills by tankers travelling past the area, without contributing to them by allowing oil exploration in and around the area. I commend the Government for its strong stand in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's determination to protect its precious reef ecosystem is famous. According again to Oceanus in its summer 1986 edition:</PARA>
<PARA>The Great Barrier Reef is unique, and the commitment of the Australian people to its conservation is great. This commitment has led to the establishment of legislation and a management system in which conservation is the dominant theme, with reasonable use of the reef's resources being encouraged. The public participates in decision-making, and is to a degree self-regulating. The (Great Barrier Reef Marine Park) Authority acts as the trustee of the Great Barrier Reef, on behalf of the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, the system of management of the Great Barrier Reef is seen as a good example of effective conservation of a treasured area and this Bill will help Australia maintain that reputation. </PARA>
<PARA> I emphasise again that the Great Barrier Reef is part of Australia's heritage. Its sapphire and emerald waters house layer upon layer of countless species of marine animals and its undersea canyons and walls are lined with living corals. Where these giant coral bones break the surface there are islands, golden sands and green palms. This incredible ecosystem, if considered as a single entity, could be the largest living thing on this planet and undoubtedly our greatest living landscape. It would take only one oil spill or accident in the vicinity of the Great Barrier Reef to destroy whole sections of the reef's ecology and cripple its beauty for an incalculable length of time. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend this Bill to the House as I believe that by terminating any remaining oil exploration permits in and around the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park we will be guarding against the destruction of this national treasure for the benefit of the generations that follow us. </PARA>

Areas of minor concern have been expressed in past speeches, particularly by the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer), who moved a second reading amendment which I support. The main thrust of the two Bills has total bipartisan support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a great pity and a little disappointing that when we are confronted which such important Bills as these-they have an important bearing on our environment-there are not more honourable members on the speakers list to speak on these very important matters. In spite of the fact that the guillotine has been put on by the Government, as it turns out a considerable amount of time is available to us. It could be used by others who may be listening and would like to come down and speak on those very important matters. </PARA>
<PARA> I was asked earlier why I wanted to speak on these Bills, as I come from a landlocked electorate which is widely recognised as the most magnificent and beautiful electorate not just in the country but in the entire world. The question that was asked was: why do you want to speak on these particular matters referring to submerged lands or the sea? As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, the river which is sometimes known as the Rhine of Australia and which is otherwise known as the Hawkesbury-Nepean River connects my electorate with the Pacific Ocean on the east coast. It brings to mind, as I think of that beautiful river, the great importance of preserving the waterways and oceans that surround this great country of ours. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, as Deputy Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, I felt it was important that I have something to say on this very important Bill-particularly as it is concerned with the preservation of the Great Barrier Reef. </PARA>
<PARA> I also want to commend, in talking about the preservation of the coast and the nearby lands, the New South Wales Government for the excellent work it has undertaken in coming to grips with the vast amount of pollution that is flowing into the areas immediately surrounding our coastline. It is a problem that has been confronting governments of all persuasions for many years now-it was also on the mind of the previous Government in New South Wales. The work has been carried on and enhanced in a tremendous way by the present Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge the initiative of the previous Government, to which the honourable member for Prospect is referring. I want to make a couple of comments on behalf of seas in general. I have done some research, as did the honourable member for Prospect, with regard to the Great Barrier Reef and the seas. I want to add a few more to put the value of the areas that we are talking about in certain specific terms and I want to speak of the value of protecting the Great Barrier Reef. In the broader context, from the research that I have done I have found out-and I am sure honourable members will know-that nearly three-quarters of the earth is covered by water. As has already been mentioned, the sea is the unique asset of our small world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as we know, no other star or planet has water on its surface. I am mentioning matters that may seem a bit non-related to the specifics of the Bill because it is important, as I am sure the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) will agree, to put the area that we are talking about in context. No other star or planet has water on its surface. Only minute traces of water in liquid state have been found anywhere within reach of our telescopes or space probes. Nearly four-fifths of all the plants and animals on earth live in the shallow coastal seas fringing the continents. They yield almost nine-tenths of the world's annual harvest of fish and shellfish. These are the narrow areas that we are talking about this morning. </PARA>
<PARA> Countless minute plants drift in the water, staining it green. Millions of tiny animals graze these floating pastures and in turn are eaten by the huge schools of prowling fish. Seabirds skim over the waves scooping up the prey, as we often see. On the seabed, forests of undulating seaweed cling to the rocks and a host of creatures filter the water for food. </PARA>
<PARA> Today we are dealing with one way that we can protect the complex ecosystems and food chains that exist in the seas and oceans surrounding the continent and for which we are therefore responsible. I use the word `responsible' deliberately. We in this place should be clear that we are stewards over the vast, beautiful and bountiful seas and oceans that surround our coast. We are stewards for the people of Australia, who have given us the power to develop the necessary laws in these areas. I commend the Minister for bringing these matters before us through this legislation today. </PARA>
<PARA> We also need to be reminded that, ultimately, we are stewards for Almighty God, our creator, to whom we are ultimately accountable, whether we believe it or not, for the care that we take in both caring for and developing the resources of the seas around us. In saying that, I am absolutely right in kilter. Some people might think that kind of comment is out of kilter, but a little over an hour ago, the Speaker, who prays every day in this House, asked for that very wisdom from Almighty God-that we would be directed in our deliberations so that we may bring about legislation that would be good for the true well-being of the people of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I also refer to the words of Jacques Cousteau, who has suggested that one of the great conservation and resource questions before humanity today is, `Can the sea help mankind survive?' What is more, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Can it help man not only to survive but also to lead a full and rewarding life; in other words to live rather than to exist?</PARA>
<PARA>Cousteau is, of course, referring to the still under-utilised potential of the sea as a source of food, high protein food in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation is part of a continuing effort by the Parliament and the governments of both the Australian Labor Party and the coalition to fulfil the responsibilities that we have in terms of that stewardship of which I have spoken. It is part of an ongoing response to the questions which Cousteau and others around the world have raised. I quote from the Minister's second reading speech. Where he mentions the word `governments', I want to put the word `parliaments', because these Bills before us today have total support from the Parliament. I commend the Minister for these words:</PARA>
<PARA>The Great Barrier Reef is a national treasure which all responsible Australian governments must manage-</PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that the word `governments' should be `parliaments'-</PARA>
<PARA>and protect from damage for all time. This Government has made it clear-</PARA>
<PARA>I speak now from the present-</PARA>
<PARA>that there will be no exploration for petroleum in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park or the coastal area extending up to the low water mark. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Given the Government's commitment-</PARA>
<PARA>indeed, now the Parliament's commitment, as we have joined in a bipartisan debate on this-</PARA>
<PARA>to a total ban on petroleum exploration in the park, continuation of the five permits was seen as anachronistic. The Government therefore announced its determination to terminate the permits on 26 July 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>The final paragraph I want to quote from the Minister's speech states:</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will enable the Government-</PARA>
<PARA>I insert `and the Parliament'-</PARA>
<PARA>to terminate the remaining permit in the region. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition supports these Bills. In doing so, the honourable member for Farrer has moved an amendment requesting that full and appropriate compensation be put in place for the five companies that will be affected by this terminating legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> As has been pointed out very clearly, the Opposition supports the legislation. I believe that the Opposition's support reflects its deep and commonsense approach to conservation matters in general. It shows that where the Government moves beyond the grandstanding or politically motivated conservation actions of the type that we have seen in Tasmania and Kakadu-for example, at Coronation Hill-there is bipartisan support for legislation of the kind that the Government has brought before the House. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Bill refers to royalties and matters related to royalties with regard to the operations of oil companies and gas extracting companies off the north-west coast and in other areas. It is very interesting to read that certain companies will be excluded from the implications of part of the legislation before us. I would be interested to know the total cost of operating the natural gas projects on the North West Shelf. Perhaps the Minister will be able to tell us. I know that there is a great deal of expense involved in converting natural gas to liquefied natural gas. I understand that the cooling process required to make natural gas into liquid natural gas is an extremely large operation, the natural gas having to be cooled on site to minus 162 degrees Centigrade. It is then placed in ships and exported overseas-mainly to Japan, at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Specially constructed ships had to be developed for that operation. In Japan last year I visited the Tokyo gasworks and learnt quite a lot about the ships. The Japanese were able to use the liquefied natural gas in the operation of their motors. The interesting thing was that when the gas in its liquid state, cooled to minus 162 degrees Centigrade, arrived at the gasworks in Tokyo they had massive amounts of cooling power available. At very small expense, the Japanese are able to use the sea water from Tokyo Bay to raise the temperature of the liquefied natural gas to bring it back to the operating temperature for natural gas. There were vast amounts of cooling available and the Japanese have been able to use this cooling power, which is available at virtually no cost, and build giant warehouses where they make substantial returns from the deep freezing of vast quantities of tuna and so on. I visited some of those warehouses. </PARA>
<PARA> So I wonder what the overall operating costs are and what it is that makes the North West Shelf operation so tenuous that it is excluded from some parts of this legislation in terms of royalty. Other than that, I am very happy to be part of the bipartisan support for these Bills. </PARA>

<PARA> I also place on record my commendation of the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths). I believe that he has achieved something that will be applauded by industry, environmentalists and the general public. What we have here is a willingness of parties-government, environmentalists and industry-to come together, sit down and think through an issue. Clearly, Chevron has understood this issue to be environmentally important to Australia. So I place on the record my commendation of Chevron for being an environmentally responsible company. This demonstrates what can be achieved if one sits down and talks; that more can be achieved if one uses sugar rather than lemon. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable members may be aware, for the last eight months I have been involved in an inquiry which is looking at the petroleum industry generally. I hope that the consultative, consensus approach that has come through in this legislation will continue to apply as the committee that I am working with sits down not only with petroleum companies but also with other peak bodies to solve a number of the problems that have been besetting service station proprietors, dealers, distributors, motorists and, in fact, in some cases the companies themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The report has been released. I am pleased to say that I have made sure that it is available to the Opposition. I made sure that the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), the Opposition spokesman for energy, has it. I have also ensured that other interested members of the Parliament have the report. I am most pleased that there has been some National Party support in the person of Bob Katter in Queensland. </PARA>

His comments were constructive and positive and addressed the issues. He did not agree with everything that we are trying to do but he demonstrated what I am saying-that we need to talk. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>In summary, there is sufficient that is positive in the suggestions put forward which warrants a closer review by BP and other market players. </PARA>
<PARA>I am using this chamber to try to signal to the other companies that there is a need for this. After all, this is about the issues of micro-economic reform. A change has been initiated by this Government, not just in terms of oil exploration, which is the subject of the legislation before us, but in terms of the preservation and better use of our resources; in terms of trying to ensure that industry is able to access fuel at the cheapest possible price. </PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably, in the past there have been major anomalies which have existed because of, I suppose, attitudes and policies. Take, for instance, the temperature variation issue. I am told by the Automobile Association of Australia that it has argued for 20 years that there is a massive loss to industry, dealers, service station proprietors and, ultimately, consumers in terms of the way in which petrol is delivered. </PARA>
<PARA> As you would understand, Mr Deputy Speaker, there is actually a loss in volume of fuel as it is heated. The temperature is normally corrected back to the international level of 15 degrees centigrade. But people who buy fuel in country areas, in the tropics and even in Sydney where the temperature can be between 25 and 35 degrees, can suffer a major loss. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the Australian Institute of Petroleum Ltd, Mobile Oil Australia Ltd and a couple of others are running a line that that is a non-issue, that it is a nonsense. What I am saying here is that we need to agree to sit down and talk these things through. Back in 1980 the Fraser Government rightly, correctly and with great initiative brought down sites and franchise legislation. That Government tried to resolve the problems that existed in the petroleum industry. Unfortunately, the outcome was not as positive as it would have hoped. </PARA>
<PARA> In those days there were some 20,000 service stations; today there are between 8,000 and 10,000, depending on the figures that are used. In those days, there were 2,500 distributors; today there are some 500 distributors. In those days the companies had 426 sites and they controlled about four per cent of volume. They still have 426 sites, but today they control about 16 per cent of volume. That does not include the fuel sold on company paper, the equity deals that they have entered into or the diesel stops and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> The committee has asked for a proper, tolerant debate. We do not want a brawl, we do not want to go out and go headhunting; instead, we want some even playing rules. I suppose it is like the State of Origin. Most honourable members who come from Queensland or New South Wales understand the concept of the State of Origin. What we have there are basic rules. We have an independent referee and independent touch judges. The teams then go out, and may the best team win. If a person wants to nick down the sideline, hoping he can get around Meninga without being sent 15 metres into the crowd or something, he might risk that; if he wants to plod along with the forwards up the centre, he might risk that. A person knows when he is playing in the State of Origin that if someone head-high tackles him, then he can call on the independent referee and the aggressor could well be sent into the sin bin.</PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, in the petroleum industry today if the oil company tackles someone head-high, he gets sent off because it is the oil company's referee. We have some real problems within the industry. I am hoping that in the next couple of weeks as I move around Australia, meet with representatives of the Australian Institute of Petroleum Ltd (AIP), and continue to talk with representatives of the service station industry, I can come up with some answers-answers that I believe are necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to change the sites legislation-not to have mad regulation, but just to strengthen the existing regulations and laws. We need a model franchise Act; we need a model franchise agreement. We also need to ensure that there is an ombudsman. I raise the point that at the moment the AIP is saying, `We want to regulate, to bring in some sort of referee system'. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable members that the banking industry brought about its own ombudsman structure on a voluntary basis. Very shortly we will find that the insurance industry will bring about its own model on a voluntary basis. There is no reason why the oil industry should not be required-and I hope not by legislation, but certainly on a voluntary basis-to establish a fair and independent ombudsman system. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, I have heard honourable members on the other side say that we ought to have fair rights for small business people. I notice that the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull) has just walked into the chamber. He has taken up the banner for small business people in the past. We need to ensure that section 52a of the Trade Practices Act, on unconscionable conduct, applies to small business people to give them a chance. I suppose we are really saying, `Let us sit down and talk it through, and let us ultimately end up with a system where service station proprietors have a right to buy from any supplier at the lowest possible wholesale price that is available'. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the sorts of things the report recommends. We are not out to restructure the law, to legislate or to reregulate. We want an even playing field. As I said with the analogy of the State of Origin; we want to ensure that the people who are contributing to Australia-they employ a lot of people at the distribution and retail levels-have a fair go; we want to ensure that the oil companies get a fair return on the massive billions of dollars they have invested. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that we will achieve this if we can get rid of the nonsense that the AIP is now running with. It is trying to run the line that it is all going to regulate the industry again. We want to take the good rules and strengthen them and, where the industry can do its own thing, let it do it. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) has come into the chamber. His report was a breakthrough in some of these areas. He first signalled to the marketplace that there was a need for change. What we are really saying in this committee is that we want to take up some of the recommendations that the Minister and other members of his committee put forward-and they came from both sides of the House-and we want to ensure they apply fairly to the oil industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Resources has been able to achieve these outcomes today by consultation, cooperation and understanding the broad needs as well as the specific needs. I only hope that in the next few weeks we can achieve the same results. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to ensure that the nonsense is cast aside. We must leave out the party politics and get down to what is fair and reasonable. I advocate that, if the oil companies, through the AIP or individually, are willing to do this with the motor trades associations of Australia, with the service station associations, with the Australian Automobile Association and other groups, then that shall be the outcome eventually. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a few remarks on the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment Bill and the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Royalty) Amendment Bill because of a concern I have about several areas relating to the availability and supply of oil, both onshore and offshore. I agree entirely with the observations made by my friend and colleague the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster), with whom I inspected the liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Japan at the time of the arrival of the first shipments from the North West Shelf. There is obviously a capacity for refrigeration that we are not utilising in the way we might in Australia. It was worth observing the nature and practice of the extent to which that freezing ability was used in conjunction with the storage of many highly perishable products, particularly tuna, including tuna from Australia, by the Japanese. We really do not utilise our resources in the way we might, and I thought that the observations of the honourable member for Macquarie were quite correct.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, I agree with the observations and worries of the honourable member for Capricornia (Mr Wright), the preceding speaker, about the availability of fuel supplies to petroleum outlets. There is significant difficulty, I know, in parts of Queensland and elsewhere in Australia with the distribution of fuel. While that is not specifically addressed within the Bill, as referred to by the honourable gentleman, on this side of the House we are concerned that individual private outlets-that is, outlets not within the ambit of the distribution of the major oil companies-should be allowed access, on the same terms and conditions as others, to fuel which is under almost total control by those oil distributors. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been given various reasons why there is such a fuel price variation around Australia, but I have always found them to be inexplicable. There is certainly, in rural areas and outback Australia, a price differential which makes the mouths of people from those areas water when they pass by a city bowser, particularly in Brisbane, Sydney or Melbourne, and see that quite frequently the fuel is available for up to 15c, 20c and even more per litre below the price that they pay and pay consistently. There is inevitably a concern about this in much of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I see the shadow Minister for tourism and aviation, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), seated at the table. There is no doubt as to the impact of this problem on the whole field of tourism, and the degree to which we prejudice our productive industries and our tourists outside the main cities is a problem. So the observations of the previous speaker about his concern for equal access to fuel for private retailers-that is, petrol retailers-and the extent to which there are price differentials I think are correct, and it is a major problem. I know that governments cannot by regulation easily control these differentials, but there is a real difficulty there and that we cannot overcome it I think is a pity. Although I do not want to see undue government intervention, it concerns me that the impact of the present price differential is to the disadvantage both of productive industry and of tourists around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say several things about these two pieces of legislation before us. As we are endorsing the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment Bill we cannot be said to oppose it. It is worth observing, firstly, that any improvement in efficiency in the determination of royalties needs to be commended. But the very fact that there is a secondary tax on an industry is something that has always worried me. I know why it is there; I know governments have to raise moneys. I know States have charged royalties, and the Federal Government long ago decided it might as well be in on the act. But secondary taxes have concerned me in that they, like so many other aspects of our society, are a deterrent rather than an encouragement to the generation of economic activity.</PARA>
<PARA> I understand why those secondary taxes are there. I know that both sides of the House have supported the maintenance and continuity of royalties. Those taxes and the resource rent tax-which we will talk about on another occasion in the House-exist because it is thought that the oil companies are on a good thing. It has always seemed to me to be perhaps not the way that we in government should go about things. What we ought to be doing is trying to encourage production. We are in a devil of an economic mess. That has really been the subject of debate in this House for a fortnight. We register, as we move around, the economic statistics that are forthcoming. We are aware of the rising burden of debt, the enormous lift in unemployment, and we are concerned that, as Senator Peter Walsh has said, we could be moving into a depression. </PARA>
<PARA> These circumstances have to be redressed by looking at how we can encourage productive activity. Sure, in a minimal way, we can adjust the administrative arrangements in order perhaps to get greater equity in the determination of royalties, but really we would be better off if we did not have royalties or secondary tax but applied one tax system and that tax system took off the profits in a fair and equitable way and left encouragement for people to produce. </PARA>
<PARA> Sure, royalties are an established fact. If States attract them, why should we not also? I understand that there is a resource there which has a public value and a public significance. However, there is a difficulty in the application of these secondary taxes, and I believe that we always need to be conscious of them when dealing with a piece of legislation such as this. </PARA>
<PARA> The Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment Bill also refers to the Great Barrier Reef. Nobody in his right mind wants a spillage of oil. The Exxon Valdez disaster highlighted the implications, particularly for any place with a unique and fragile environment. I suppose that the fires and the destruction brought on the oilfields and oilwells in Kuwait by Saddam Hussein and his forces constitute one of the great environmental disasters of all time. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as oil exploration is concerned, we must recognise that the techniques are changing. Whilst I accept and believe that there should be no exploration on the Great Barrier Reef, I do not think that should apply to seismic exploration. I am not sure, from the form of this legislation, whether it is in fact excluded. We do need to know what resources are about. I am not even sure whether, in the application of the ban on exploration, the Bureau of Mineral Resources is denied the right of seismic exploration. One of the difficulties that we have, thinking of management of the Barrier Reef, is that nobody is too sure just what is prejudicing the growth and development of coral. All sorts of theories have been put forward, none of which seem to have been proved correct. For example, we are now told that the problem with the crown of thorns starfish, which people worried about, is probably cyclic and that it might not be doing the damage that we thought it was. </PARA>
<PARA> I will make two points about exploration. First, as far as I am concerned, seismic exploration should be capable of being undertaken right through the Australian economic zone. That does not mean that we will necessarily drill for it, but it will mean that we will know more of the character and nature of the resources around our continental shelf and our continent; and that is to Australia's advantage. Secondly, whilst there is no doubt that there should be no drilling on the Great Barrier Reef, as all of us accept, we should bear in mind that the circumstances and character of the extraction of oil are now changing dramatically and are far more sophisticated than they used to be. We should encourage that and try to pursue greater safety procedures so that, whether it is on the Great Barrier Reef, on the North West Shelf or in Bass Strait, if there is to be oil exploration, it is done having in mind the environmental damage that could occur if there were a spillage. As far as I am concerned, spillage is bad anywhere, not peculiarly on the Great Barrier Reef.</PARA>
<PARA> With reference to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Royalty) Amendment Bill, from my point of view, there is the question raised by the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) concerning the time frame for overpayment of royalties. I believe that that does need to be resolved. It is a matter that seems to me to be not acceptable. I refer to Woodside's concern that 28 days is insufficient to allow for the repayment of any overpayment. Although that is perhaps a minor matter, it should be redressed because many dollars are involved. Any operating company needs to be allowed a reasonable time within which it can operate. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the legislation but express those reservations and, in particular, I would be grateful if the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) would advise whether his Government is prepared, as I believe we should be, to permit seismic exploration, wherever it might be, around Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-Going to the last question first, I want to make it quite clear on behalf of the Government that under no circumstances will seismic exploration in the Great Barrier Reef be permitted. I suppose that shows a different attitude between the Government and the Opposition parties. Needless to say, I think the suggestions of the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) could be somewhat controversial where he indicated that organisations such as the Bureau of Mineral Resources (BMR) might be allowed to continue to pursue seismic surveying and so on in the Great Barrier Reef environs. That is certainly not going to be the case, although of course BMR, which has a much wider brief than simply petroleum matters, will engage in scientific work relating to non-petroleum exploration areas--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DG4">Mr Tim Fischer</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What about aerial evaluation by BMR?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0H4">Mr GRIFFITHS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can understand the sensitivity of the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) to the matters that have just been raised, and quite explicitly put, before the House. The right honourable member for New England actively advocated the continuation of seismic surveys in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. What I am stating on the record is that there is a clear difference between what appears to be the attitude of the National Party to seismic surveying in the Great Barrier Reef, and the Government's position, which is totally and absolutely against any such seismic surveying. It is consistent with the Government's attitude to one of the seven great wonders of the world that we really want to send a powerful and unequivocal signal-that is consistent with our response to the termination of Petroz's leases in the area within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park-that not now, nor in the future, should there be any possibility of oil exploration and production in the Great Barrier Reef.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I go briefly to some of the other issues raised. The Leader of the National Party, and I think also the right honourable member for New England, went to the issue of the 28 days. In a situation where the producers are assessed as having underpaid royalty, the outstanding amount is required within 28 days from the date of the final assessment being issued by the designated authority. This period corresponds with the timeframe that exists with respect to the payment of normal royalty on a month on month basis and compares favourably with the arrangements that exist for company tax and resource rent tax and also those that apply for crude oil excise payments. </PARA>
<PARA> The amounts of royalty likely to fall within this category are expected to be relatively minor in nature as they reflect corrections to previous calculations. So where there was a suggestion that we are talking about very large amounts of money, I think that is unlikely to be the case. In the case of an overpayment of royalty, the Commonwealth would make a refund within a month by crediting the producer's royalty liability in the following month by the amount of the overpayment. I also say that the $200m referred to by the Leader of the National Party was an excise adjustment, not royalty; the amounts of money involved in royalties are, by definition, considerably smaller. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter raised by the right honourable member for New England that I want briefly to go to was the issue of the attractiveness of Australia for investment; that is, that we do not want to take any action that would deter interest in-I am paraphrasing him-exploration and production. I think in these areas we are often our own worst enemy; that is, we are sometimes prepared to argue a view that is totally inconsistent with international opinion-and this is just a classic example. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not sure whether the right honourable member for New England is aware of the Robertson survey, which clearly is an internationally well regarded survey of 66 international oil companies that are pre-eminent in the field of oil and gas exploration. The survey, which was released some six or seven weeks ago, ranked Australia at No. 4 internationally as the most desirable place for investment dollars to be directed for oil and gas exploration. </PARA>
<PARA> Again we can be subjective, or we can attempt to be objective, but I think we would all agree that, if we are putting these matters before the bar of international oil and gas exploration opinion, and if we accept, as I think we must, that the Robertson survey is one of considerable importance, then we ought to accept its findings. Just concluding on that issue, I might add that we jumped--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Tim Fischer" NAMEID="DG4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DG4">Mr Tim Fischer</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What about compensation?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0H4">Mr GRIFFITHS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I will come to that in a moment. On this, we jumped from No. 20 last year to No. 4 this year. So, I think we can say that the objective international opinion is that Australia is a very good host country for oil and gas exploration, and we ought to be talking that up, not talking it down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now turn to the matter of the environment and oil and gas exploration. I shall keep my comments brief-I do have some notes, but I will not refer to them. In relation to this whole issue, I think it is worth making a couple of points. The first is that in Australia's less than 30 years of offshore oil and gas exploration and production, it has produced some 2,600 million barrels of oil and during that total period we have spilt 350 barrels of oil. If my memory serves me correctly-one should refer to notes-my calculation was that this represents 0.0001 per cent-a minuscule quantity and one which, in terms of offshore oil and gas exploration, gives us the best record bar none. </PARA>
<PARA> As well, in this context I might say that mother nature herself is sometimes `guilty' of spilling oil. A phenomenon in offshore Australia is natural leakage. There was one incident that I recall in the Otway Basin where the equivalent of some 7,500 barrels of oil spilt, I think it was in 1988, as a result of natural leakage, that is, as a result of mother nature acting in her sometimes capricious manner. When putting that natural leakage, in one incident alone, against the 350 barrels spilt in the whole of Australia's offshore oil and gas exploration and production industry, that puts the matter into some overall context. </PARA>
<PARA> I might also say that, where organisations such as Greenpeace propose a ban on our offshore oil and gas exploration, they ought to think very seriously about the implications of that. There are enormous economic implications, of course, but moreover, and I suspect more importantly for Greenpeace, there are significant environmental implications; that is, were we to ban offshore oil and gas exploration in this country, we would be required by definition to import oil from other countries. By and large, that oil is a heavy bituminous type of oil, unlike our light sweet crudes. It would have to be transited to this country by a tanker. Clearly, the major danger of oil spills on the oceans is related to tanker traffic, and one can refer, for example, to the Exxon Valdez incident and a number of others which, regrettably, are just part of modern-day industrial societies. </PARA>
<PARA> If that were the case, we would have 200 million barrels of oil a year being transited across some of our most sensitive offshore areas. It seems to me that Greenpeace has taken an extraordinarily stupid attitude in relation to these issues. I suspect strongly that Greenpeace's recent activities in relation to the seismic surveying of Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd in the Otway Basin have on balance lost it public support because for the first time Greenpeace has been forced publicly to shift its ground and has been exposed for what I consider to be misleading the public in relation to these issues. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by addressing the issue of compensation which was also raised by the Leader of the National Party. I preface my remarks by repeating the results of the Robinson survey, which gives Australia a very high order of priority in world terms-No. 4-as the most desirable country for oil and gas--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Tim Fischer" NAMEID="DG4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DG4">Mr Tim Fischer</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Was that because of the Gulf war?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0H4">Mr GRIFFITHS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it was unrelated to that; it was related to the desirability, taking into account all issues, of Australia as a target for international investment dollars. I will be happy to send a copy of the survey to the Leader of the National Party because I think that in a bipartisan sense everyone in this House would agree that, where we have a good story to tell, we should not diminish it by painting a gloomy picture.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to the issue of compensation, I take the opportunity to congratulate Chevron, which voluntarily gave up its exploration lease in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. I think that Chevron's action ought to be acknowledged. It was a very public spirited response by Chevron, a company which has an enormous future in Australia in this area, and one which is, by any definition, a good corporate citizen. </PARA>
<PARA> Petroz NL, the other company referred to here, did not see itself as able to surrender its lease voluntarily. However, I make the point that exploration in the Great Barrier Reef has been inactive for two decades or so. Petroleum exploration in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is prohibited under the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975, which I strongly support. In the context of compensation, the Government does not propose to compensate unless the termination of permit Q11P is found to be an acquisition of property within the meaning of section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution. If that is adjudicated upon and found in that way, obviously the Government would have to reconsider the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The legal advice available to me and my clear recognition of constitutional law-albeit now going back some considerable time-leads me to the view that because the Commonwealth is gaining no benefit from terminating the permits, compensation does not and should not be an issue for the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Tim Fischer interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0H4">Mr GRIFFITHS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If they take a different view from government, every company, whether it is Petroz, and every individual ought to have the right to test that in the courts. I seek neither to encourage nor discourage Petroz. Petroz is a good and exciting company too. I am certain that a slight difference of opinion on this issue will not impact on that company's contribution in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A number of other issues were raised by honourable members, but I do not think any of them are of sufficient moment to require me to respond to them. In relation to the Petroz issue, clearly it is incumbent upon governments to make judgments about competing interests. When we are talking about one of the seven natural wonders of the world-the Great Barrier Reef-I think the importance of that area overwhelms all other considerations. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a responsibility on government to ensure that not only now but also in the future we protect that very fragile ecosystem. That is why, when the public debate was on some time ago about whether the Government was allegedly going to allow exploration and production on the Great Barrier Reef, I watched with dismay. It was a classic example of how in this country misinformation on emotional issues can be badly distorted through the media. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that every member of this House would agree that our primary obligation is the protection of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Indirectly, that is what this Bill intends to do, in part at least, and I am sure that before the bar of Australian public opinion that would find a very high degree of approval.

<PARA> This debate is an opportunity for the Opposition and other members of the House to say something about what is clearly lurking beneath the surface of the Government's industrial relations policy agenda; that is, the issue of the resurrection of the labour court proposal which was hastily buried in the lead-up to the 1987 election. You may think, Mr Deputy Speaker, that that is a fairly long bow to draw in a debate which, in relation to the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill, the first Bill we are considering, deals with a number of what can fairly be called machinery amendments to the Industrial Relations Act relating to a number of issues, including a shortening in the qualification period for people as potential appointees to the Remuneration Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) picks up, in substance, the recommendations of the Gleeson committee, which was established by the Government to resolve the undignified row that has broken out, and has gone on for several months, between the members of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and the members of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) over the effective breaking of the nexus between the presidential members of the Commission and judges of the Federal Court of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Gleeson has come up with a recommendation which seeks, not surprisingly, given his brief, to be all things to all men and to satisfy both of the warring parties. However, the Government, in picking up that recommendation and inserting it in Amendment Bill (No. 2), has in part anticipated the establishment of a labour court or a separate industrial division of the Federal Court. And, of course, the Opposition has profound objections to the establishment of a labour court. </PARA>
<PARA> I did not lament the breaking of the nexus between the salary and remuneration of presidential members of the Commission and judges of the Federal Court because I do not regard-and nor does the Opposition-the Industrial Relations Commission as being a court. It has always appeared passing strange to me, since it was decided in the boilermakers case in 1956 that the then Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission could not exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth, that we have in any way persisted with the notion that members of the Commission, either the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission or its successor, the Industrial Relations Commission, should have the status of judges. I do not say that out of disrespect to the members of the Commission. I do not suggest that they should not be properly remunerated. I simply do not accept that there should be an ongoing nexus between the remuneration of judges of the Federal Court and the remuneration of members of the Industrial Relations Commission, irrespective of the qualifications of members of the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> It is because Amendment Bill (No. 2) in part anticipates the establishment of a labour court that the Opposition will oppose the Bill in this House and it will be opposed in the other place, on the assumption that the Government, with its numbers, will put the Bill through this House. I want therefore to spend the time available in this debate to say something about the issue of a labour court. There is no doubt that the Government has worked very hard to win the support of the Australian Democrats to move to take away the common law remedies now available to employers and the very effective remedies made available under sections 45d and 45e of the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to take the House back to 1987, when the current Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) introduced an industrial relations Bill that was very largely based on the recommendations of the Hancock Committee of Review of the Australian Industrial Relations Laws and Systems. In 1987 the Government proposed to establish a Commonwealth labour court. That Commonwealth labour court would have been under the jurisdiction, in a ministerial sense-if I can put it that way-not of the Attorney-General but of the Minister for Industrial Relations. </PARA>
<PARA> That court would not have been able to apply the remedies under sections 45d and 45e without a number of preconditions being fulfilled. Those preconditions essentially involved the parties to a dispute being required to go before the Industrial Relations Commission to see whether their dispute could be settled by means of conciliation before they would have the legal right to invoke the protection of the Trade Practices Act or, indeed, the available common law remedies. </PARA>
<PARA> Apologists for the labour court could well say, `What is wrong with that?'. What is wrong with that proposal is that, if it were implemented, it would destroy the most effective element of section 45d of the Trade Practices Act. That most essential element is the capacity of a party that is at the sharp end of predatory union conduct, which is destroying that party's business, to go immediately to a Federal Court judge and obtain an injunction from the Federal Court ordering the union in question to stop destroying the person's business and to lift the boycott that has been placed on that business. </PARA>
<PARA> If the 1987 design pattern for the labour court were ever to become the law of Australia, then that immediate remedy under section 45d of getting an injunction-telling a union to stop wrecking somebody's business-would no longer be available. A businessman in that situation-that is, the situation envisaged by the 1987 design-would be forced to go to the Industrial Relations Commission. There would be two or three weeks of mindless jawboning and in the process he would be bled white, his business would go and he would be forced to capitulate in order to save his business. That is why the Opposition will never support a proposal to establish a labour court. We will never support a proposal to take away from the ordinary courts of Australia the power to administer not only the common law remedies that are available but also the very effective weapon that has been available under the Trade Practices Act since 1977. </PARA>
<PARA> The union movement in this country is very fond of talking about the hard-won gains of the past. I do not take any umbrage at that. There were gains that needed to be won by employees in this country. I do not refer to that particular endearing phrase of the union movement in any pejorative sense. If I were the President of the ACTU I would talk about hard-won gains and I would remind my dwindling membership of what the union movement had been able to achieve in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not only Martin Ferguson and Bill Kelty who have hard-won gains in Australia's industrial relations debate. I regard section 45d and the establishment of common law remedies as being a hard-won gain of those in the Australian community who have fought very hard over the last five or 10 years to bring about a reformed industrial relations system. It is only five years ago that Professor Hancock, George Polites and Charlie Fitzgibbon comprised the membership. All of them in their different ways were very eminent people in the industrial relations scene in Australia. On some issues I would not find myself agreeing with all of them, although I might agree with some of them on some occasions on some issues. </PARA>
<PARA> I seem to recall, incidentally, that back in 1985 Charlie Fitzgibbon wrote a very erudite paper on the value of enterprise bargaining. I do not think it got a very warm reception from the current Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) or from the then Minister for Industrial Relations because it was a bit ahead of its time. In fact, it was almost dangerously New Right in some of the terminology that it used. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Prime Minister. In welcoming today's improvement in inflation, I ask: will the Prime Minister embrace as a policy objective for this term of government a zero to 2 per cent inflation target? Further, will he give a commitment that this target shall be met by improvements in productivity and efficiency rather than sustained high levels of unemployment?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to that question is no. Let us examine the nonsense that the Leader of the Opposition has been going on with. By way of background, we might establish the credentials of the Leader of the Opposition on this question of inflation forecasting. He has been very interesting on this subject. I just go to some of his comments in the past. This is what he had to say in February last year:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The message that comes out loud and clear is that the Government's given up on inflation control-completely given up.</PARA>
<PARA>In his press release of 21 February 1990:</PARA>
<PARA>Double digit inflation-</PARA>
<PARA>this was his forecast just over a year ago-</PARA>
<PARA>-the end of the Hawke-Keating Government.</PARA>
<PARA>On 15 February last year:</PARA>
<PARA>If the ACTU gets its way, on the basis of past experience this looks highly probable, Australia will be looking down the barrel of double digit inflation by the end of 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>On 10 June 1990:</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister is wrong to say that there is `general acceptance' that inflation will fall to 6 per cent in the 12 months to June 1991.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, when we get to this question of inflation, the Leader of the Opposition has a hopeless track record. He hoped that, as far as this country is concerned, there would be a position where double digit inflation occurred. He hoped that out of that situation he would get some political advantage.</PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that this Government determined a course of policy which had as one of its major objectives a significant lowering in the rate of inflation in this country. I would have thought that it would be very sensible for the Leader of the Opposition, in throwing around this sort of stupidity he does about nought to 2 per cent, to take time off to examine what is the achievement of this country in regard to our major trading partners. The position now is, of course, that we have a figure starting with a four, and that is 4.9 per cent to the year ended March.</PARA>
<PARA> The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development figure is 6.7 per cent-that is the OECD average. He is talking about zero and 2 per cent. As I said yesterday in regard to the great achievement of this country in the area of exports of manufactured goods, those on the other side of the House, instead of going on with the nonsense that they have been going on with, should be saying how proud they are that this country has now reached a position under the leadership of this Government that we have an inflation rate which is significantly below the OECD average.</PARA>
<PARA> The average of our major trading partners is 5 per cent. We are now under that. Let us look at the figures for other countries-5.7 per cent in the United States of America, 9 per cent in France, 6.6 per cent in the United Kingdom and 6 per cent in Italy.</PARA>
<PARA> In other words, as a result of the deliberate policies of this Government, we have brought about a position-as distinct from the position that we inherited from those opposite of double digit inflation-where inflation is now down to under 5 per cent. That is something on which the Opposition should say, `That is a magnificent achievement', instead of talking about this nonsense of zero to 2 per cent. It is not a figure which is capable of achievement by any of our major trading partners-we are now under them. As I say, instead of members of the Opposition going on with their hollow hypocrisy which characterises everything that they have to say in the area of the economy, they should say to this Government and to this Treasurer that they spend so much time bagging, `Well done, we are proud of you'.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The CPI inflation in this quarter was in the negative. We were actually deflating in the quarter by 0.2 per cent. The result was that over the course of the year the inflation rate came down to this low number of 4.9 per cent, compared with 6.9 per cent for the year to December-a 2 percentage point change in the quarter. It puts beyond doubt the Government's belief that Australia is to have an historic victory on inflation and it is, without doubt, the best number of fundamental economic significance in two decades.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is the most profound sign that Australia is entering the 1990s with a transformed economy, a low inflationary economy. It is the first negative quarter since December 1963. It is the largest quarterly fall since December 1961. It demonstrates that the Government's policy-which has been to deal with inflation via monetary policy, fiscal policy and wages policy-has been successful and that the rise in inflation to nearly 10 per cent stemming from the fall in the exchange rate in the middle 1980s has now been dealt with and that inflation has now come down in a trend way, along with inflationary expectations, to be at the level of our trading partners and, as the Prime Minister said, well below the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development average.</PARA>
<PARA> Not only that: in the quarter in which we are now living, we have seen falling petrol prices, we have got virtually no wage increases coming through the system-very small wage increases coming through the system-and we have further falls in mortgage interest rates, which augurs well for a low June quarter CPI. By way of illustration, if the CPI for the June quarter were to be positive by half a percentage point, the annual inflation rate would fall to 3.8 per cent. In this quarter, if the CPI ends up being around 0.5 per cent, inflation will have fallen to around 3.8 per cent, but for the moment it is 4.9 per cent-under 5 per cent-the lowest quarter for the first time since 1961.</PARA>
<PARA> This means a great deal to the economy. It means that we are entering the 1990s with a transformed economy. It means that we have got over the hurdle of inflation, which our opponents opposite were never able to do. It means that no longer will we have our competitiveness leaching away by three or four percentage points a year, against our export competing and import competing industries. It means that Australia is not fated to have high nominal rates of interest into the future, as there is a capacity to bring interest rates down--</PARA>

The fall in nominal interest rates may not simply be that which equals the fall in inflation, but it might be by more as markets consider what real rate of interest Australia should pay. That is the dividend of being successful. It is those lower nominal and potentially real rates of interest which will lower the cost of capital to Australian business and which will spur investment on through the 1990s; and it is that investment and that growth which will pull down unemployment and give us a low inflationary, prosperous economy as we continue to lift these export volumes, which I spoke of at length yesterday, and start to bring to fruition the picture I painted yesterday of rising exports through the 1990s--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. In my electorate of Hunter and in other coal producing electorates the coalminers-magnificent men all-are making strenuous efforts to try to improve occupational health and safety. Can the Minister outline to the House the areas of concern to the Government and how the Government is ensuring that standards of occupational health and safety are maintained and improved in Australia's major export industry?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3767" SPEAKER="Kerin The Hon J.C." NAMEID="QH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WERRIWA" MINISTERIAL="PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First of all, as we all know, coal is now our No. 1 export industry. Exports in the year ahead are expected to be around $6.3 billion. That is an increase of about 17 per cent since 1985-86. Coalmining, by its very nature, is a very difficult and very dangerous task. Figures for the honourable member's area, for example, show that since 1965 there have been 41 deaths because of roof fall alone in the Newcastle and South Maitland districts. Of these, 24 occurred in the great northern seam. If we look at the total deaths and other statistics from 1980, we see that these numbered 53 in the northern district and seven deaths in the great northern seam. There are real worries about safety on a continuing basis in this industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The interests of the honourable member and of coal workers in maintaining and improving standards of occupational health and safety are mine and those of the Government. In 1989-90, man shifts lost as a result of illness or accident totalled some 278,000, or 67 per cent of total man shifts lost. In underground mines, about 220,000 man shifts were lost.</PARA>
<PARA> In the case of underground mines, pneumoconiosis-more commonly known as dusting-has been of particular concern. In 1946, pneumoconiosis was prevalent among coalminers, affecting about 20 per cent. The latest figures indicate that that figure has been reduced to about 0.7 per cent. That is much lower than in the United States and other advanced countries. That is due to the work of the Joint Coal Board (JCB)-which is a joint Commonwealth-State authority-the companies and the miners themselves. They have all been very instrumental in reducing this level of the occurrence of pneumoconiosis.</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members would be right to wonder whether the 0.7 per cent was still too high and what the implications would be if we expand underground mining operations further. The Commonwealth Government is committed to seeing that standards are maintained and improved, and we acknowledge the pivotal role of the Joint Coal Board in this issue.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Hunter also mentioned occupational safety, and I have given some statistics about the whole problem of roof fall. Appropriate occupational research and development is essential in the industry if those in the work force are to be assured that their working conditions are safe. It is fair to say that the examples of wind blast and roof fall are relatively low, but it is very important to understand the factors that contribute to this. It is to the full credit of the JCB that a research and development effort is now under way to fully investigate the causes and to determine appropriate remedial action. The efforts which the various players-the JCB, the unions and the companies-have made, resulting in improved working conditions, stand to their credit.</PARA>
<PARA> In summary, there is an ideological belief that we can scrap the JCB and all the work that has been done in this area. That would only represent a trashing of the progress that has been made. The prime interest of the work force and the union in this industry is occupational health and safety, and I would give an assurance to the honourable member that there will be no changes that detract from maintaining and improving the record that has been established.</PARA>

I can assure the House that, in respect of the Budget outcome this year, it broadly remains the same as stated by the Treasurer to be the case a couple of months ago: that is, a surplus of about $1.7 billion. That figure remains broadly our current estimate of the outcome for this year. That contradicts absolutely one of the points the honourable member was making.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The obvious long run portents of a low inflation rate are, in the first instance, enhanced competitiveness in the economy and, over time, a lower cost of capital. That means, given the fact that the Government in this context has delivered to business a high profit share, that the level of investment and employment growth would be obviously much higher than they would be were inflation itself to be much higher; that is, in terms of a long run influence on the economy, via employment, the CPI outcome is of course entirely significant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is very interesting to find the Leader of the Opposition saying today, `Why wouldn't inflation fall amidst the deepest recession in 60 years? You'd be appalled if it didn't'. When it did not in March 1983, when it was 11.5 per cent, he must have been awfully appalled then. He must have been awfully appalled in the depths of the last recession, which reached its trough in March 1983. The best the Opposition could come up with was 11.5 per cent inflation compared with 4.9 per cent under this Government. So the Leader of the Opposition said, `Why wouldn't inflation fall amidst the deepest recession in 60 years?'. The fact is that it did not when those opposite were in government. They had a wages policy which smashed profits to pieces and they had unemployment out of control. As I said yesterday when I tabled the Treasury note, on today's participation rate they had a 15 per cent unemployment rate--</PARA>

I know the point: it is that the Leader of the Opposition's muddled mind cannot even produce a consistent argument on a piece of paper. He is saying `to be free of political interference', so the slur is that the bank and its board have been politically interfered with in relation to interest rates, whereas three sentences later he is saying that they have been too strong. Where does the Leader of the Opposition get off with this sort of rubbish? That is all it is-rubbish. It is not comment; it is rubbish.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Then he says that we ought to have an inflation target of zero to 2 per cent-which just expropriates the 4.9 figure which has taken us years to put into place, those negative outlays which took years to put into place. He says, `Thank you. I'll have that. Now we'll take it from zero to 2 per cent', when he knows that in order to get to 4.9 per cent the economy is recessed and unemployment is rising.</PARA>
<PARA> What sort of scorched earth policy would there be to get to zero? What interest rates would still obtain out there if we were heading for zero or 2 per cent? At the same time as he is shedding crocodile tears about the unemployed, whom he will tip off benefits after nine months, he is saying that the situation is terrible for the unemployed but that what we ought to do is ram more of them onto the unemployment queue to drive inflation down to zero. That is his policy, and it has always been his policy-to stand back cowardly behind some group of unelected officials and smash the economy to pieces, and the public with it. That is the policy and it indicates the absolute insincerity of the Leader of the Opposition's position. As the Prime Minister said, it was not even a policy that the Leader of the Opposition was committed to; it was, he said, another bubble that the Leader of the Opposition had blown.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At least the Leader of the Opposition has plucked up the courage to ask me a question. There is a first; there is a mark on the wall. This Government has always approached inflation with three policy arms: monetary policy, wages policy and fiscal policy. The evidence of that has been in the staggering size of the tax cuts in 1990 of $5.5 billion, which held the wage system in check through 1989-90, and the further $3 billion which we paid from 1 January to hold nominal wages and to secure a lower inflation outcome, so as not to provide a monetary policy-scorched earth policy-a la Hewson. The Government has always rejected that policy; that is why we have an accord-a basis of agreed income determination with the people who run organised labour in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the very essence of an accord process: to see what proportion of national income goes to profits and that which goes to wages. That is the essence of trying to secure lower nominal outcomes to secure lower inflation, but coupled with a sensible monetary policy sensibly applied.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is not the policy of members of the Opposition. They do not believe in tax cuts for lower nominal wage outcomes because they do not want any dialogue with the unions and, therefore, they do not want to use fiscal policy. They do not wish to use wages policy under an accord; they only have monetary policy. That is the point I have often made to Dr Hewson and his colleagues: by simply using monetary policy, one simply provides a scorched earth policy which wipes out activity and employment. At the same time, if the inflationary trend is not pulled down, once activity picks up, it will simply pop out again. There will be no low inflationary phoenix rising from the ashes, but a full inflationary phoenix rising from the ashes, as there would have been. That is the point.</PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition tries to make these points about monetary management. The fact of the matter is that he has always had a simple model in his mind, rooted in the early 1960s and 1970s, whereby one applies the scorched earth policy of interest rates to the system and that alone is simply necessary to pull the inflation rate down, and that is the consequence of that. Our decline in inflation was engineered down from the 9.8 per cent it rose to after the depreciation of the exchange rate via a number of accord processes, a succession of tax cuts, a sensible monetary policy and lower nominal wage outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that in a period of lower activity one expects to have a deflationary component. That is there. But the principal reason inflation is at 4.9 per cent today is that wages did not go to 15 per cent in 1989-90. When employers were offering 15 per cent in 1989-90, we brought wages in at 6.5 per cent. We broke the dismal legacy of 30 years in coming into a boom and out the other side with wages at 6.5 per cent and not 15 per cent. That was simply because of accord mark 5 and $5.6 billion worth of tax cuts. That is why. It is because of the accord process that inflation is where it is. The Opposition has no such process. The Opposition eschews any such process. The Opposition rejects any such process. If the Opposition had been around during that boom inflation would have been as it was at the end of 1983, at about 11.5 per cent. That is the difference between us and the Opposition.</PARA>

<PARA> The fact is, unfortunately, that apartheid is not yet dead. Many developments are indeed promising, but there remain significant areas of concern; there is particularly, as I think all members of this House would agree, the appalling violence in the townships for which the South African Government must bear a significant responsibility. The process of dismantling apartheid and building in its place a just, democratic and non-racial South Africa will on no account or by any analysis be a simple process. Likewise, the response of the international community cannot itself be simple.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition today said that his colleague the shadow Treasurer is currently drafting legislation embodying the changes required, and he said, `If the Government fails to act on this essential task, we will bring our own legislation to the Parliament'. This is following a paragraph which says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It is absolutely essential that the Reserve Bank be free of political interference to be able to implement monetary policies in a sustainable, consistent and transparent manner.</PARA>
<PARA>The implication of that sentence is that the Board is politically interfered with and that the operation of its duties is not transparent, not consistent and not sustainable. I want to quote some things from the Reserve Bank Act to put some of this matter in context. Section 10 (2) says:</PARA>
<PARA> It is the duty of the Board, within the limits of its powers, to ensure that the monetary and banking policy of the Bank is directed to the greatest advantage of the people of Australia and that the powers of the Bank under this Act, the `Banking Act' 1959 and the regulations under that Act are exercised in such a manner as, in the opinion of the Board, will best contribute to-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the stability of the currency of Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the maintenance of full employment in Australia; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the economic prosperity and welfare of the people of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, that section means that the primary responsibility of the Board is to do what it thinks is right-`in the opinion of the Board'. In other words, the implication in the sentence which the Leader of the Opposition has in his press statement is that those Board members have breached that section, and that they have done things which, in their opinion, are not best to contribute to these factors. That is the first point. The second point is in section 11, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The Board shall, from time to time, inform the Government of the monetary and banking policy of the bank.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In the event of a difference of opinion between the Government and the Board whether that policy is directed to the greatest advantage of the people of Australia, the Treasurer and the Board shall endeavour to reach agreement.</PARA>
<PARA>So the drafters of the Act require the Treasurer and the Board to endeavour to reach agreement. It is a requirement of an Act of parliament that I and the Board, in this case, endeavour to reach agreement on monetary policy. I have had, of course, no difficulties whatsoever in that respect. It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> (3) If the Treasurer and the Board are unable to reach agreement, the Board shall forthwith furnish to the Treasurer a statement in relation to the matter in respect of which the difference of opinion has arisen.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, it says:</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Treasurer may then submit a recommendation to the Governor-General, and the Governor-General, acting with the advice of the Federal Executive Council, may, by order, determine the policy to be adopted by the Bank.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the Governor-General, acting on the advice of the Federal Executive Council, may determine the policy of the Board of the Reserve Bank of Australia upon advice from the Treasurer.</PARA>

<PARA>Mr Johnston agreed that the allegations by the Opposition leader, John Howard, and shadow finance spokesman . . . questioned the integrity of the board. I find it a very severe slur, not only on the board but the staff of the Bank, he told Today's Michael Pascoe.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Johnston, in retirement, told me that he upbraided the honourable member for Bennelong privately for his comments, as he did to the honourable member for Wentworth. They are the people who have made these mealy-mouthed charges and which a Governor has put asunder in the most explicit terms. When the honourable member for Wentworth, the professor, had a go at this issue, again in 1988, the Australian Financial Review said:</PARA>
<PARA>Hewson must offer hard evidence. In this case, his evidence would not even hang a cat, let alone a Reserve Bank Governor. Yet he admits his evidence is merely from secondary sources.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Hewson is in the big league now. If he is to continue making charges of such seriousness he should be prepared to offer them some hard evidence to back them up. Otherwise, the only conclusion that others will reach is that it is he who is playing mere politics, not the Government or the Reserve Bank.</PARA>
<PARA>That was well said at the time. This is a serious issue because I believe the drafters of the Reserve Bank had the appropriate balances between the prerogatives of the Board and the interests of the board in dealing with inflation, employment and the welfare and prosperity of the Australian people through its economy, and the interests of the government of the day, and gave a sensible mechanism for the resolution of issues.</PARA>
<PARA> As the Prime Minister alone here knows, we have never been at a point of disagreement with the Reserve Bank board. In the course of the Government's period of office we have never had to exercise any of these mechanisms. But they are sensibly there. How can a person who would like to describe himself as a democrat say that he will put asunder the democratic notion that the Parliament of the Commonwealth-the government drawn from the House of Representatives-in the end should be subjugated to the view of an appointed board which will smash up the economy for a nominated inflation rate?

<PARA> It is very interesting to read what the Opposition would be doing in respect of the future of inflation. The Leader of the Opposition said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is because we had those elements that we were able to transform the inflation situation in this country from a picture of over 11 per cent, which was the coalition's contribution to Australia, and bring it down to one now where it is under 5 per cent and beneath that of our major trading partners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The shadow Treasurer asked me what I can promise for the future. What I can promise for the future in regard to inflation is a continuation of those sorts of policies which have already more than halved the inflation rate which those members opposite dumped on Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not an accident that we have been able to reduce inflation. There can only be the essentials of an inflation reduction policy if there is a wages policy. Without a wages policy, inflation can never be reduced. When Opposition members were in government, they practised a non-wages policy. Everything was left to the market. There was an 18 per cent wages blow-out. And that is what the Opposition is promising Australia again.</PARA>
<PARA> So in answer to the honourable gentleman's question, while I can, yes, promise that we will continue policies which will mean continually low inflation rates, it is inevitable, it is certain, that under the policies that have been put forward by those opposite, there would immediately be what there was before: a wages explosion, inflation going up because of that and accelerated even further, because bringing in a broad-based consumption tax would of itself immediately increase inflation. The unions, naturally enough, in those circumstances would build that fact into their wages claim, so there would be accelerating inflation.</PARA>
<PARA> So, as distinct from those opposite, I promise a range of policies which will ensure a continuation of low inflation. Against that, Opposition members would have the certainty of exploding inflation and a total inability to control it. That is the choice that the people of Australia will have, and there is no doubt what their choice will be in 1993.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for her question. I think that all members of the House would recognise that it is very easy in the present circumstances, with the spectacular and well publicised tragedy of the Kurdish people and of the disasters in Bangladesh, to neglect the ongoing but potentially equally great tragedy in the Horn of Africa.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Therefore, I am announcing today that the Government will add a further $5m in assistance to the Horn of Africa in order to deal with the enormity of the growing problem, particularly in Ethiopia and the Sudan.</PARA>
<PARA> The extra moneys that we are forwarding will be split between the two countries. They will be channelled through the Australian relief agencies and through the world food program. The bulk of the assistance, because it is the most relevant, will be by way of Australian wheat and flour: some 3,700 tonnes of wheat to Sudan, some 2,000 tonnes of wheat and flour to the rebel held areas of Eritrea and Tigre in Ethiopia.</PARA>
<PARA> This will bring the total assistance to the Horn of Africa this financial year to $16m; the earlier allocations being some $9m in predominantly food aid to Ethiopia and a $2m relief package for the Sudan.</PARA>
<PARA> As is known, the Government has had to supplement Australian International Development Assistance Bureau funds for emergencies and refugees because the Budget allocation for this item for the entire financial year is already virtually exhausted. That should not be surprising, because this has been a very difficult year, not just for governments but for all organisations providing overseas aid, because of the unprecedented number of disasters and emergencies which have placed extraordinary demands on the funds of both governments and agencies.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last December, the Prime Minister and I announced the intention to begin a process of reconciliation between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and the wider community. A discussion paper was issued outlining proposals for the reconciliation process-the establishment of a council for Aboriginal reconciliation through legislation, and a decade-long commitment to raise the level of awareness of non-Aboriginal people about Aboriginal history, culture, dispossession, continuing disadvantage and the need to address that disadvantage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The discussion paper made clear that the reconciliation process was to be accompanied by a national commitment to address areas of Aboriginal disadvantage as a national objective leading to the centenary of the Australian Federation. The discussion paper was widely distributed and consultation has occurred with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations, church leaders, leaders of political parties around Australia, trade unions, business organisations and major non-government organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to report to the House that the result of these consultations has been extremely heartening and, might I say, deeply moving. Support has been given by Aboriginal community organisations and organisations such as the Central Land Council, the National Coalition of Aboriginal Organisations, the Queensland Aboriginal Coordinating Council, the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation, the Torres Strait Islander Advisory Board and the Uniting Aboriginal and Islander Christian Congress.</PARA>

<PARA> Letters have also come from State Premiers and from the Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory. As honourable members would be aware, the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, in its final report tabled last week, gave consideration to the reconciliation process and concluded that the process was the fundamental backdrop to reform and change. The Royal Commission recommended:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . political leaders use their best endeavours to ensure bi-partisan public support for the process of reconciliation and that the urgency and necessity of the process be acknowledged.</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, I am particularly pleased to welcome the Opposition's in principle support for the process of reconciliation which was expressed in a letter to the Prime Minister yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA> The letter indicates that the Opposition has some concerns about the proposal but that the possibility exists for all sides of politics to go forward together for the benefit of Aboriginal people. I believe that the Government's plans for the process will address the Opposition's concerns. I welcome the Opposition's proposal expressed in its letter that the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation should have measurable goals for the reconciliation process. I have repeatedly said that there can be no reconciliation without justice, and therefore welcome the Opposition's support for a close monitoring of the success of government programs to address Aboriginal disadvantage. I highlight the important role by State and local governments in addressing that disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA> I particularly welcome the Opposition's view that the work of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation should be focused at the grassroots and community level. It is absolutely essential that all sections of the Australian population be involved in this reconciliation process. The Opposition is quite right to highlight the need for consultation with both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians for the reconciliation process to succeed. I can assure the Opposition, and, indeed, all Australians, that consultation will be the hallmark of the reconciliation process.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has always firmly intended that the process would involve practical benefits for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and this has been supported by the Opposition. The Government has also made it clear that the focus of the process would be the process itself and not on any possible outcome. Indeed, the words of the Royal Commissioner, endorsed by the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), echo the words of the Prime Minister and myself in relation to the reconciliation process. Commissioner Johnston said:</PARA>
<PARA>The approach should concentrate on a process of reconciliation and not an instrument that might be an outcome of the process.</PARA>
<PARA>We have consistently endorsed this view. The Opposition's support for the reconciliation process is an important demonstration of what is a growing national commitment to this initiative. I confidently believe that, when the proposal comes formally before the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, we can succeed in getting unanimous backing for it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During Question Time today, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) sought to deliberately misrepresent my position in relation to a commitment to price stability defined in terms of an inflation target of zero to 2 per cent. He deliberately quoted from a transcript in which I was talking about the possibility of a contract between the Government and the Governor of the Reserve Bank. The question of the target was never the subject of that quote. So he has taken a series of remarks about a possible contract between the Government and the Governor and used it as though I was commenting on the inflation target and our commitment to it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The latest consumer price index figure is a good figure, and I welcome it. It is better than market expectations and a bit better than expectations in general. It means that Australia's inflation rate has dropped from 6.9 per cent to 4.9 per cent. I am sorry that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) is not in here to debate the issues because one of the reasons that we have initiated this debate is to take the debate to the Government. He has been crowing about it-read his press release: an historic conquering of inflation by the world's greatest Treasurer-but the truth of the matter is that I do not believe the 4.9 per cent is nearly low enough. Furthermore, I do not believe we have reason to expect that it will stay down other than for the period of recession.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It will not surprise people to hear that, in a sense, the Treasurer exaggerates the figures. That has been the hallmark of his career for many years. If we take out the effects of mortgage costs and petrol prices, then the minus 0.2 per cent actually would be 1.2 per cent and the annual inflation rate would be 5.8 per cent; but that is still an improvement, from 6.9 per cent to 5.8 per cent. There is no doubt that it could well go lower: it will go lower as unemployment rises, as the scorched earth policy which this Government has introduced continues to wreak its damage on the Australian electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> Inflation always subsides as a consequence of a recession. Here we have the patient lying on the operating table. Yes, the Government has got the blood pressure down, but further surgery is still required. Yes, it has got the blood pressure down, but I ask the Treasurer: so what? Part of his defence is that he says that it did not happen in the last recession-blaming it all on the last Government. But in 1984 inflation actually fell to 3.9 per cent. It actually fell. We have been in the position we are in today before, with a low quarterly inflation figure. It fell dramatically in the Great Depression, and of course it came up again afterwards. Back in 1961 we had that short, sharp credit squeeze. I hope the political point is not lost on the Government. The Menzies Government nearly lost office; it stayed in office only as a result of the preferences of a communist, I think in Jim Killen's seat. So the electorate will certainly wreak its revenge upon the Government at the next election. In 1961 inflation fell. It was a very short, sharp contraction at that time, and inflation fell as a result of that sharply contracting economy.</PARA>
<PARA> None of that is really surprising. The only thing that is surprising is that these blokes get up here in Question Time and try to deny the obvious. Inflation is the consequence of excess demand chasing limited supply, and higher interest rates are certainly very effective in crushing demand, both consumption and investment, as I think most people now realise as they look around and see the Australian economy literally being destroyed brick by brick as a result of high interest rates. Not only does it destroy our manufacturing base but, as well, for our great exporters it makes the dollar higher than perhaps it otherwise would be. It makes it hard for us to export and easy for us to import-the two things that, of course, drive that massive current account deficit problem that we have. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has done exactly what it promised at the last election not to do; that is, it has run a scorched earth policy. It is indisputable that Australia has an appalling record on inflation. This applies not just to recent years; basically it goes back 20 years, to the 1970s. As one of my backbench colleagues has said, it goes back to the Whitlam years, as so many things do. In the 1970s, inflation averaged 9.4 per cent, and in the 1980s it averaged 8.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also indisputable that the economic and social costs of high inflation are very great. I shall not dwell on that point, because I think that even the Government spokesmen in this debate would acknowledge the huge costs of inflation. It robs people of their savings. It discourages savings. It is theft. It discourages productive investment and it wastes a lot of time and effort as people put their resources into trying to hedge against it. </PARA>
<PARA> It distorts investment patterns. In fact we have seen that in recent years. The Treasurer boasts of the big increase in investments through the late 1980s, but we must ask ourselves: where has that investment gone? Has it gone into factories making widgets to help our export performance or to replace imports? No, it has not. It has gone, as it always has in recent years, into unproductive investments. We have had a building and housing boom, which is so typical of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Welcome though it is, today's figure is simply not good enough, and I urge the Treasurer, when he responds, to put aside self-congratulation. He should stop patting himself on the back, telling us how he has conquered inflation, and at least acknowledge that 4.9 per cent is not good enough. Secondly, my view is that the figure is not sustainable, and I have very good reasons for taking that view. In fact, I have seven reasons. First, this Government has never had a real commitment to tackling inflation. We can go back to 1982 and see a classic from the Treasurer. In fact, the longer he is in office, the more pleasure we take from reading some of the things he has said in the past. In 1982, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>So, fighting inflation first (as a policy) is, frankly, a failure and we've gotta ditch it. </PARA>
<PARA>So he started as Treasurer without any commitment to fighting inflation. He has only found a commitment to fighting it now because he got a lucky break in September, which he grabbed with both hands. He knew the recession was coming; he knew inflation would come down as a result of it; and he wanted to ride in on its back. If one goes back to the last Budget, one finds that inflation was not the principal target; it was the current account deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Government has publicly abandoned any specific targets for inflation. We had evidence of that again today when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was twice asked a very simple question-just a yes or no question-during Question Time. It was along the lines of, `You reckon you have inflation licked; give us a guarantee it will not go over 4.9 per cent'. That was a very simple question, but the Prime Minister failed the test absolutely miserably. And no wonder. The bloke he relies on-Mr Miller, who, the Prime Minister told us, is a good economist who used to work for the Treasurer and now works for one of the best firms in the country and is a good bloke, when reflecting opinion among many economists predicted that inflation will go up to the June quarter 1992. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has never had a real commitment to attacking inflation; in fact, it has abandoned targets for inflation. Why is that? If one wants to see what the decisions of these guys are based on, one only has to look at the most recent poll. The Government says that it is not attacking inflation because there is no constituency to tackle inflation and it is not prepared to wear what it sees as the electoral costs of it. </PARA>
<PARA> The third reason I am not confident is simply this: the public has seen inflation come down before. As I said, back in 1984 it was 3.9 per cent. For years this Government has peppered us with false claims about its success over inflation. Honourable members may remember this classic promise made in 1988, when the Treasurer said that the Government's policies:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . will secure for Australia an inflation rate of 3 to 4 per cent in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA>Another one of his promises about lower inflation. I have another, which goes back a bit further to 1985 and is a classic Keating quote:</PARA>
<PARA>Inflation has been licked, we've got inflation back to the OECD average. </PARA>
<PARA>Does that not remind honourable members of what they heard half an hour ago? The Treasurer used virtually the same words. As a result, the Government has no credibility on the issue. That is very important because if we are to get inflation down, to keep it down and to minimise the costs, it is well recognised that having a government with credibility on inflation is a key part of that agenda. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, I do not believe the Treasurer for the simple reason that the Government has no commitment to secure the fundamental changes that could assure this country that we could really lock in the gains. Again, it has been paraded before the House today in respect of the Reserve Bank of Australia. During Question Time this Treasurer talked about the Reserve Bank and its independence, but let us look at the public record. Do honourable members recall the Treasurer's Placido Domingo remark in that private chat to a couple of hundred journalists at the National Press Club? On that occasion he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Leadership is about getting people into your pocket. . . . [I have] Treasury in my pocket, the Reserve Bank in my pocket, the financial community . . . both here and overseas, in my pocket. </PARA>
<PARA>That was not the first time he said that. In February 1989 a journalist asked him:</PARA>
<PARA>If your opinion is that monetary policy should be eased and you tell that to the Reserve Bank, surely they will be implementing otherwise . . . ?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Keating replied:</PARA>
<PARA>No, but we don't have conflicts. I have been operating monetary policy with the Reserve Bank now for 7 years and I only instance the remarks of the ongoing government to underline that. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no question about it; this is the man who said he has them in his pocket. He is Placido Domingo to some but Placebo Drongo to others. If inflation comes about through demand being in excess of supply, one side of the solution is to boost the supply of goods and services. What do we need to boost supply? We need higher investment and productivity through industrial relations reforms and all the micro reforms that have been waiting on the back burner for the past five years. And, of course, yesterday was the anniversary of the Treasurer's `banana republic' statement. </PARA>
<PARA> Why am I am not confident? This Government has sown the seeds of higher inflation in the times ahead. The Government did that deal before the last election-accord mark 6-when it was then talking about a soft landing; it did a deal with the wharfies; and it went back to Whitlam, and it has the Public Service pacesetting again on wages. No wonder people question whether the Government really has a commitment to controlling inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> Lastly, because of all these things the Government has gone nowhere in breaking inflationary expectations. The market thinks inflation is coming down, sure-and the Government has lots of quotes to support that-but the market also thinks inflation is going to go up. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth is that we must get some structural changes. The Treasurer says that he has won game, set and match. I say to him, `We are going to win the rubber, and that is the rub for you'. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes to tackle inflation will have to be extensive. Firstly, the incoming government will have an unshakeable commitment to beating inflation. Secondly, we will set a clear target for eradicating inflation. One cannot be a little bit pregnant, as honourable members opposite want to be. Most commentators accept that a target of nought to 2 per cent, as set today by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), is a realistic one. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, we will secure real independence for the Reserve Bank by amending the Reserve Bank Act 1959. I have already prepared a first draft, which will be an exposure draft in due course, of the amendments on which we will seek comment, and which we will eventually introduce. The legislation will establish a new charter for the Reserve Bank with price stability, beating inflation or taking on inflation as its principal objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we ought to take the Secretary to the Treasury off the Reserve Bank, not to break entirely the links between the Government and the Reserve Bank-obviously those links will continue-but to mark the independence of that institution. We will require the Governor or an appropriate person from the Reserve Bank, a couple of times a year, to turn up before the Parliament to report on the bank's efforts to tackle inflation. We will also provide for the establishment of the Government's inflation target. There are three objectives-a commitment, a target and amendments to the Act.</PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, of course, we will develop between the bank and the Government the concept of an employment contract where the Government specifies the inflation target and, critically, the necessary and complementary economic strategy from government to achieve the target. We will put together a broad economic package within which that fits. </PARA>
<PARA> High on our list of priorities must be industrial relations reform. It is absolutely critical to the implementation of our policies. We will have a structurally tighter fiscal policy so that we can reweight and rechange the mix and the stance of Government policy as it is today. </PARA>
<PARA> We will move ahead with privatisation-not the Mickey Mouse 30 per cent of some bank, but real privatisation. We will have genuine waterfront reforms, shipping reforms, taxation reforms-which are another critical part of our early legislative package-communication reforms and tariffs. These changes are radical, but only for Australia. Quite frankly the Treasurer will say that it is naive and that it is quackery. If the Treasurer were to look at the rest of the world he would see that most of these changes have already been introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister failed to give us a pledge. It was a pretty simple question: will you give us a guarantee that inflation will not go over 4.9 per cent? I ask the Treasurer to give us a simple answer-yes or no-to the question. Will the Treasurer give that pledge? The whole Parliament awaits his reply. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can understand that the Opposition is politically smarting under the number which the Australian Statistician has published today, because it is the lowest quarterly negative fall in inflation in the consumer price index since December 1961. That is a generation ago-30 years ago. It is the first negative quarter since December 1963. It is there for trend reasons, as the Opposition knows. It is not just a flash in the pan; it is there because the Government engineered inflation down with wage tax trade-offs through 1988 and 1989, and it had the wages and nominal wage discipline which has come through the processes of the accord with the Australian Council of Trade Unions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It burns right into members of the Opposition that such a result can be produced in cooperation-not by bashing people, abusing unionists, putting out nasty press statements or by trying to use central banks to do things which they know they were never designed to do. </PARA>
<PARA> It galls them to think that a cooperative process can actually reduce inflation. In this Budget we have an average weekly earnings target of 7 per cent. This year we will bring wages in at about 5.1 per cent against the target of 7 per cent. That is the reason. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt, as I said at Question Time, that today's result puts beyond doubt the Government's belief that Australia is to have an historic victory over inflation. I repeat what I said then: it is the best number of fundamental economic significance that we have seen in two decades. It is the most profound sign that Australia is entering the 1990s with a low inflationary economy, a transformed economy, which will prove to Australians and others that Australia is not fated to have permanently high inflation and high interest rates. That means that as Australia joins the low inflation countries again it does so with the belief in the minds of many that inflationary expectations are down. </PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), in his very ordinary address was hinting that this was a flash in the pan. He said that we had had a bit of luck in the September quarter and that, while the markets think inflation is down, the public does not. That is not true. I passed over to him the table of inflationary expectations from that survey conducted by the Australian Statistician, which shows that the nation believes and expects inflation to come down and that inflationary expectations are coming down. That is the most important thing-not just that there is a low number but that people expect it to be low and they expect to see inflation declining over the period. </PARA>
<PARA> For Australia this means that we will not go on as we did in the 1970s and 1980s, with our inflation rate leaching our competitiveness by four or five percentage points a year and the adjustment having to come via the exchange rate, which is inflationary, which drives up the stock of Australian denominated debt, which makes our nation poorer in world terms, which cuts the values of Australian assets in world terms. Now that we have an inflation rate at that of our trading partners, below the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development average, and with the prospect of its falling further in the June quarter, with that kind of scenario we have the capacity to keep our competitiveness together and to trade our way successfully into the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday I referred to the quarterly accounts of the Statistician in relation to exports. I gave the statistics on the strong export growth through the 1980s. We have had phenomenal export growth through the 1980s. Yesterday I was discussing with my advisers some of the largest categories of manufactured export performance, and the largest category was `Miscellaneous'. It was not a big petrochemical project or liquefied natural gas project. `Miscellaneous' includes all sorts of things-hot water heaters, air-conditioners, taps-as the nation responds to the internationalisation of Australia, as it responds to this new found competitiveness. That is why our manufactured exports are growing, as they have grown in the 1980s and will grow in the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said yesterday, if we had even halfway decent terms of trade we would be running a current account deficit with a debt stable now at 2.5 per cent or 2.75 per cent of gross domestic product. If the debt is stable now, it means that we end up running merchandise trade surpluses through the 1990s. Sure, we have a problem to deal with the stock of accumulated debt, but we are dealing with that $100 billion of accumulated private debt by, in the first instance, putting $60 billion worth of assets offshore, to countervail that debt onshore with private assets offshore. If we regard that as the price we have paid for the indolence of our past in the 1960s and 1970s but in the future, from here on, we run a merchandise trade and services surplus and have a low inflation rate with a lower cost of capital, lower nominal interest rates and, possibly, lower real interest rates, which then fuels, with a high profit share, a stronger rate of investment in those export industries, what prospect does the 1990s hold? A good prospect. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is. I saw an article recently where Gary Pemberton of Brambles said, `We are just now learning to bring dividends home'. One of the reasons we did not bring dividends home was that we had a foreign tax credit system. We have abolished the foreign tax credit system by putting a foreign source income system in place, which means that now one can distribute from a company in North America or Britain back to Australia without worrying about needing to top up tax under a foreign tax credit system, and that distribution will countervail the net income deficit that the honourable member for Bennelong speaks about with the interest payments going offshore.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The most important thing is that we are not adding to the debt at source from our trading goods and services. Last month's balance of payments shows that we are running a goods and services surplus. If we can run a goods and services surplus, that is, pay for all the goods and services we buy from the world, into the 1990s-and from now on we are running a trade surplus which is cutting that debt-our problem then is to attend to the debt of the past, not to be adding any into the future. With that low inflation rate and a structural surplus of this variety, a structural Budget surplus and occupational superannuation pumping 3 or 4 per cent of GDP a year into savings, Australia's savings imbalance must change and the current account deficit must come down. </PARA>
<PARA> If the current account deficit comes down with a low inflation rate, lower interest rates, better cost of capital, more investment, more product, more exports, more import competing products and a larger surplus, we join that virtuous circle where Australia once and for all gets out of the shocking period when we believed we could take our benefits and our living standards from a tariff wall. We will get away from that dismal legacy where we thought we could progress ourselves by cutting ourselves off from the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> That is what these years are about; they are about that transition. In the transition the party got overheated in 1988-89 and the Government had to take the punchbowl away. We have done that for the greater good of Australians-to give them that period into the 1990s of low inflationary growth so that the transition that we started and undertook in 1983-84 will be a transition we successfully complete. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not have the slightest doubt that we are now going through this fundamental transition. We are doing it successfully as our export sector, our external sector, picks up the slack and starts to really make the pace. I have no doubt that the transition we began in 1983-84 is well and truly on the way. We have had the problem of the globalisation of markets in the 1980s, of the growth in credit in nearly all of the economies around us, and we are now seeing recessions as a result, not just in Australia but in Britain, Canada, and the United States, and a slowdown in Japan for exactly the same reason-inflated asset prices and too much credit growth by the financial system with the globalisation of markets. That is behind the lot of us. </PARA>
<PARA> The low inflationary period that dragged the United States along in a low inflationary environment, which Paul Volker gave to it in 1980 by a recession of this very variety, is one which we will keep as we rebalance ourselves and find that credit markets start behaving sensibly and ration resources properly. If credit markets are free, as we have in a deregulated financial system, and they are rationing resources correctly and sensibly, there are, for a start, more resources to ration because the Government has cut its call on savings by $30,000m a year by cutting government spending and there is a structural Budget surplus. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen those changes and the savings coming through the superannuation system and more corporate savings. With dividend imputation we allow companies to save, whereas the coalition governments taxed dividends at 78c in the dollar. We are now taxing them at 39c if they do not distribute and at 47c if they do. We have cut the effective rate on tax and distributed income from 78c to 39c, or 47c if they distribute personally. That means that the middle size corporate sector can save for the first time in our history. It is those savings which will give Australia a decent sized medium corporate sector, which the United States has but we have never had. We have had little companies, small businesses or large companies. There has been very little in between. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why it is important that that big category of merchandise exports is `miscellaneous' from all quarters of the economy-no particular description-and from all these businesses, which are now finding that clever ideas can be sold abroad, that they do not need to simply build major billion dollar projects to do any good, and that we are actually getting this quantum change. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the 1990s. I am quite certain that we will make it. There is no problem with that. As I said yesterday, the only problem for the Government is that we want to be around to see our work come to fruition. We want to be here to enjoy the creativity. The honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) is trying to interject, but he knows that his Party could never have put this together. The Opposition would not have put together the agreed incomes approach under the accord. It would not have taken the risks we took with the floating of the spot rate and the exchange rate and the removal of exchange controls, or the absolutely revolutionary change to dividend imputation and the change to occupational superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA> These are path breaking. We have done this in a way in which we have pulled the weaker people in society along with us. We did not say, `Oh, look, only the strong people get the prizes here'. We said, `That is not a goer. We want kids in school. We want kids from working class backgrounds to get a decent education. We want to see the poor looked after and low income families receiving benefits such as the family allowance supplement. We want to look after the health of all Australians. If a member of a family of six wakes up sick, sore and sorry, that person will be covered for health purposes. That person will be protected under Medicare'. We have tried to bind society together while we have made these changes with the cooperation of the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA> Bashing people, confronting them, butting them, doing all the things that conservative governments tend to do, does not produce that kind of society. A cohesive society gives more manageable economic outcomes. We have proven that today with this inflation rate. Those more manageable economic outcomes have, during the 1980s, given us three times the rate of employment growth of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. </PARA>
<PARA> Sure, at the moment we have fallen on hard times in terms of employment. But we will get those jobs back. When we get them back we will keep, as we have to date, the 1.5 million jobs that we have created since 1983-84. Those are the prospects for Australia. I want them to be the prospects for Labor, not the prospects for a collection of individuals in parties which, frankly, never had the wit, the creativity or the courage to construct such a sophisticated model. They never worked with the departments; they never worked with the bureaucracy; they never worked with the central bank; and they never worked with the Treasury. They always believed that the bureaucrats were trying to cheat them. They spent two years booting the guts out of the bureaucracy after they lost office, as though it was its fault. </PARA>
<PARA> We have done it by bringing these institutions together and by taking our cue from the labour movement-by being faithful to the precepts of our own Party; not by running off with some alien philosophy but by trying to marry a compassionate policy with an economically efficient economy and, in doing so, knowing that that is where we are producing wealth and employment. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why we are faithful to our Party's creed to look after the poor, to see that people get a share of growth and to have a fairer society. That is why we get the cooperation of the unions; that is why the inflation rate is down; and that is why we are entitled to run Australia in the 1990s. I know that those opposite are going to try to stop us. But they will not. We will beat them again. The truth, as I have said here before, is that we are better.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In his usual soothing but typically misleading manner, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) is clearly out to extract every ounce of advantage that he possibly can out of today's consumer price index figure. But the plain truth is that the Treasurer opportunistically has seized on reducing inflation, which is a highly desirable objective, because it has turned up as the one achievable objective that might just save his political neck. He should have been concerned about it a long way back.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I noted what the Treasurer had to say about the balance of payments. But let me say this about the non-policy track that the Treasurer is on in the industrial relations area and the micro-economic area: there is no way that as recovery returns the recent figures that we have had in relation to reduced imports and increased exports are going to be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me repeat, on behalf of the Opposition, that the objective of reducing and, indeed, eliminating inflation, reaching for actual price stability, is, as the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has said, a paramount objective of policy. We unequivocally welcome today's figure. </PARA>
<PARA> In saying that, though, I would urge the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer not to get too carried away. I am not sure from where the Prime Minister and the Treasurer get some of the comparisons that we have heard them use today. For instance, I notice that in the inflation table in the latest Economist, France is 3.2 per cent, and in the most recent three months 1.9 per cent; Germany 2.5 per cent; Holland 2.6 per cent; Italy, admittedly, 6.6 per cent; Japan 3.9 per cent; the United Kingdom high at 8.2 per cent but coming down with the most recent figure being 2.4 per cent; and the United States of America 4.9 per cent, coming down to 3.3 per cent. So I suggest: do not get carried away. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the arguments against inflation are well known and I do not need to enlarge on them. But some are: one, simply, `daylight robbery' that causes an arbitrary redistribution of income; two, inflation at levels higher than our trading partners undermines competitiveness; three, it leads to high interest rates; four, it distorts the pattern of investment, encouraging too much short-termism-too many office blocks and retail shopping centres rather than productive business investment, which is what has happened; five, it discourages saving. And so on. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Opposition welcomes today's figures, we quarrel vehemently with the way this has been achieved and the horrendous high cost. That high cost is the tragedy, the devastated self-esteem, the deprivation and suffering of 850,000 Australians who are recorded as unemployed and another 825,000 who are working limited hours and who want to work more. We are talking about 1,700,000 Australians unemployed or under-employed. </PARA>

<PARA> Let me say something about the way in which this has been achieved. The efforts of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to evade direct responsibility for this deepest of recessions since the 1930s, which is the prime cause of the fall in inflation, are pathetic. Twice during Question Time last Thursday, the Prime Minister gave a parrot-like exposition of the way in which national spending ran ahead of production in 1988-89 and necessitated, according to him, the sustained murderously high interest rates in that period. In fact, it was the Treasurer's inadequate policies which, in the main, brought on the dramatically overheated economy of 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA> The truth is that after the downturn of 1986 the Government wanted to boost the economy. On top of a commodity price upsurge-I recognise that the Treasurer deliberately eased monetary policy in the early part of 1987, he did it again after the stock market crash later that year and, again, in the run-up to the March 1988 New South Wales election-we had a dramatically overheated economy. </PARA>
<PARA> There was no really tight fiscal policy to assist, taking some of the weight off monetary policy; no productivity enhancing wages policy; no significant structural reform of transport, the wharves and so on. There was just a total reliance on the blunt instrument of, as I have said, murderously high interest rates which, sustained for so long, had their inevitable destructive effect in 1990. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely callous; and this continues today. This brings me to my central point that while the fall in inflation is unequivocally welcome, the truth is that nothing is being put in place to keep it down. Perhaps I should say that not enough is being put in place fast enough to keep it down. A successful anti-inflation policy is, first, a matter of sound so-called macro-economic policy-consistent sound taut monetary and fiscal policies, not the unbalanced politically driven policy mismanagement of the 1987-90 period that I have just outlined.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), has foreshadowed, in the monetary policy area we will legislate for a more narrow charter for an autonomous independent Reserve Bank, not a reserve bank as the Treasurer has so often boasted in the past that he had in his pocket. A successful anti-inflation policy and at the same time a strong growth and high employment policy with a decreasing current account deficit is also a matter of change in the so-called micro-economic area. In both areas great change is needed. It needs to be greater and faster than has ever been so much as hinted at by this Government, save back in 1986, let alone spelled out clearly and explicitly so that the Australian people can come to grips with it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have just heard 25 minutes of waffle from members of the Opposition about a matter of public importance, which only they would have the front to put up. We always remember when the Liberal Party of Australia came to government in 1975 on a `fight inflation first' policy. But it never got there. The records show that in June 1976, after the effects of its first Budget, the inflation rate stood at 12.2 per cent. When it lost government in 1983 it was 11.5 per cent. By their own standards of `fight inflation first', those opposite were abject failures. They were the high inflation specialists-and would be again if the people of Australia were mad enough to give them the chance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another comparison which I think is worth looking at is the downturns from 1981 to 1984 and from 1990 to 1991. When we went into the recession, engineered by the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), in December 1981 the inflation rate stood at 11.2 per cent. In March of 1983, after the recession that those opposite engineered, it was 11.5 per cent. They have claimed that a recession has lowered the inflation rate for us, but it did not lower the inflation rate for them. So it went from 11.2 per cent to 11.5 per cent under their recession. In fact, inflation went up. Under us, in March 1990 it was 8.6 per cent and, of course, today it is 4.9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> So we can see from that that, when we talk about high inflation rates, those in the Liberal Party were the specialists. But, of course, one thing they have not mentioned today is one of the ways that they are going to tackle inflation-that is, to bring in a consumption tax. One can only imagine the effect of a consumption tax on inflation: it would put it through the roof. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has pointed out on more than one occasion, those opposite have no wages policy at all. They cannot get along with the unions. In actual fact, they talk about putting troops on the waterfront. One has to wonder about the effects of that policy on wages, on output and on the gross domestic product once Australia grinds to a halt. But, of course, when we have a look at what they propose to do, these people are world beaters in opposition. They are always `gonna do' something. </PARA>
<PARA> Here we have today for the first time ever the Liberal Party saying in the Parliament that it is going to set a target for inflation of nought to 2 per cent. Let us remember that it could never get it under 11.5 per cent before and it is not even gracious enough, when it drops down to 4.9 per cent, to say, `Well done'. But it says that it would get it down to nought to 2 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How can we believe it? As the Minister rightly points out, how can we believe those opposite? One thing I do know is that it is going to take strong leadership to get it down. If we have a look at the leadership of the Liberal Party at the present time, we really have to wonder whether the guts are there to do it. We all remember on this side that, when we put an assets test on the family allowance in the last Budget, the Leader of the Opposition was rolled by the back bench. Those opposite could not accept something as tough as that-where the recipients were getting $60,000 a year and could have half a million dollars in assets before the family allowance was taken away. Those on the back bench opposite could not even wear that; they rolled their leader. That is how strong he is. That is not all. The Leader of the Opposition could not even get past Senator Newman the $3 charge down at the Australian War Memorial, although he had agreed to it when rung by Dame Beryl Beaurepaire. Senator Newman rolled him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We saw in the paper the other day on the disclosure legislation that he is backtracking as fast as he can because the Party is starting to roll him now. What we really have to understand is that the Leader of the Opposition just has not got the guts. He has not got the guts to hold his back bench; he has not got the guts to be able to straighten out Senator Newman; and he has not got the guts now to stand up to his Party on something as fundamentally important as the disclosure legislation. If he cannot do that, how the hell would he, as Prime Minister, be able to take the hard decisions that he would have to take to get inflation down to nought to 2 per cent? He cannot take hard decisions. We have seen him in operation. He has no guts. In actual fact, he cannot stand up to the people I have indicated. </PARA>
<PARA> In the contributions today we have heard about the hard slog. We also heard words from the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) about waterfront reform. Let us once again contrast the approach of the Opposition to the approach of the Government on waterfront reform. Those of us who were watching television on the night of 22 May 1987 would have seen the honourable member for Bennelong, who was Opposition leader at the time, together with six forgettables, at a Brisbane shipyard. The Canberra Times of that date, under a heading `Liberal spotlight on worker rorts' stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Rorts among unions, the Public Service and in industry would be sought out and exposed by an Opposition ``rorts task force'', the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Howard, announced yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Howard said the task force would investigate restrictive work practices which bedevilled Australian industry and would expose all manner of rorts from dim-sim allowances to flextime in the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA>What a great old rorts task force! It met once. I asked the Parliamentary Library to go through its press releases since that date: there was not one. What hypocrisy it is for those opposite to talk about rorts on the waterfront. Who was in government when the rorts were there? It was the Liberal Party. The honourable member for Bennelong was saying that at a Brisbane shipyard; it was later found that that shipyard closed down when the Liberal Party was in government. </PARA>
<PARA> One has to have front, and there is no-one with more front than the honourable member for Bennelong. There he was in the Brisbane shipyard with six forgettables, trying to set up a rorts task force. The simple fact, as we know, is that we have to work with the unions, as this Government has done, to increase productivity and to get rid of the so-called rorts. But the rorts task force, because it never ever met again and never issued another press release, is actually acknowledging that this Government has got these so-called rorts out of the system-and of course we have. But we did it by cooperation, not by taking them head on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would not be so unkind. But once again, we can see the contrast between the Government and the Opposition; we can see the Government working with unions, working with employers-as the Prime Minister did recently with the waterfront reform-getting down and ironing out our differences. As for the Opposition's rorts task force, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Willis) called it a publicity stunt, and of course history proves that he was right. The Opposition was never at any time able to sustain a rorts task force because this Government was busily getting those rorts out of the system as fast as they were exposed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In respect of industrial disputation and the cost of labour, from the March quarter 1983 to the December quarter 1990, under a cooperative approach, the real labour unit costs have reduced by 11.2 per cent. Of course, that is reflected in the figures here today. We can see that the rate of industrial disputation over the same period has gone down from 348 per thousand employees to 216 per thousand today-once again brought about by working with people, working with the trade union movement and also with employers, to make sure that the outcomes for this country are so much better than they were under the confrontationist policies of the Liberals. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be really surprising if the Opposition had learned something in the last seven years. Those of us who believe in public policy and that at some time the Opposition may form a government would hope that it would have learned something, that its rhetoric may have changed. But it has not changed certainly in the last 20 years, and it gives one little hope that, if it were ever to be in government again, we would not see inflation going back up to 11 1/2 per cent-the level it was at when Opposition members were kicked out of office. The Government rejects this matter of public importance for the cheapness that it is. There is nothing that has been said in the contributions by the two honourable members opposite which gives this Government any hope that the Opposition has learned anything. We therefore believe that we will do the public a great duty by winning the election in 1993. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Purpose built computer centre for Australian Customs Service, Bruce, ACT. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed work recommended by the Standing Committee on Public Works involves the construction of a purpose built computer centre for the Australian Customs Service at Bruce in the Australian Capital Territory. Work will involve the construction of a two-storey building of approximately 3,780 square metres of gross floor area, provision for parking facilities for 30 cars, landscaping and associated site works and services. The computer mainframe is to be located in the upper floor, while plant, loading dock, storage, staff amenities and minimal office accommodation will be located on the ground floor level. It is anticipated that construction will commence in June 1991 with the work to be completed by December 1992. The project will employ about 150 workers at the peak of the construction activity. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works in November 1990. The Committee tabled its report on 14 May 1991 recommending construction of the building at a limited cost estimated at $16.9m at November 1990 prices. The Australian Customs Service and property services program have noted all the Committee's recommendations. However, despite their support for the project, some of the issues raised require comment-and I acknowledge in the Parliament the Chairman of the Public Works Committee, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis). </PARA>
<PARA> The site selected for the Australian Customs Service computer centre is adjacent to the site for the Australian Taxation Office computer centre at Bruce in the Australian Capital Territory. The reasons for the two computer centres not having been combined and developed as a single project are: firstly, that the Australian Taxation Office requirements for new computer facilities were developed in 1988-89, and were examined by the Government and approved as part of the 1989 Budget process, while the Australian Customs Service requirements were developed in 1990, and examined and approved as part of the 1990 Budget process. Secondly, after examination by the Public Works Committee of the possibility of combining the two projects, it was concluded that this option would be more costly during the design and construction phase and that it would impose significant delays, especially on the Australian Taxation Office project, thus resulting in the reduced efficiency of revenue collection functions. Both clients are attracted to having separate computer facilities for reasons of individual security requirements rather than being in favour of any proposal for collocation. </PARA>
<PARA> In providing a solution for the two separate facilities, Australian Construction Services has carried out the instructions of its client departments. As a result of the concern that two similar buildings could be built next door to each other, the Committee recommended that the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) carry out a review of Commonwealth departments and authorities to ensure that, as far as practicable, facilities such as computer installations are collocated. This recommendation, incidentally, is currently being considered. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the issue of coordination of future capital works projects needs to be considered in the context of the Department of Administrative Services no longer having an overall regulatory role. Each department or agency of the Commonwealth is now responsible for its own property in capital works. Nonetheless, given the Public Works Committee's recent comments, the Minister for Administrative Services has asked his Department to discuss with the Department of Finance ways to address the matters raised by the Public Works Committee for future capital works projects. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Capital Territory Electricity Commission and Water Authority insists that two independent electricity supplies be provided at the computer centre for part of their overall strategy to supply a high level of service and availability to the user. It also allows the Authority to undertake maintenance work on substations without undue disruption to client power supplies. The reason a back-up diesel generation unit is still required is that, as there is only one active power supply entering the building at any one time, in the event of a power failure it may take officers some time to manually energise the second supply, in which case, without the diesel generation unit, the building will have no power. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Australian Customs Service will consider the fitting out of its existing computer facility located in the Edmund Barton building as a back-up facility for other Commonwealth departments and authorities, and it is planning the refurbishment of that site. I thank the Committee for its report and commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall), who I know is representing his colleague in another place, has not given the Parliament adequate responses to the matters raised by the Standing Committee on Public Works and, in particular, the Chairman, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), when he presented his report here yesterday. In fact, I think we are seeing very much a case of the Yes, Minister syndrome, where the Parliament is being treated with a certain amount of contempt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There were some very grave concerns raised by the Public Works Committee yesterday and by the Chairman when he presented his report: about the way the Department of Administrative Services has been operating over this whole matter; about the way the Minister has been operating; and, probably most importantly, about the accountability of this Department to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that in putting forward this motion today the Government has taken on board the concerns of the Public Works Committee properly. It ought to be noted that it is rather rare for the Public Works Committee to bring up such grave concerns. The reservations that the Public Works Committee has brought up are worthy of considerably more work than bringing in the report one day and on the following day, without proper consideration of those concerns, debating the motion that the work proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> I think all honourable members ought to be aware that we have a rather ludicrous situation where there are two buildings side by side. As the Minister for Small Business and Customs tried to point out today, the decision to build one was a year ahead of the decision to build the other. But the buildings are side by side, both of them doing virtually identical things. It is just a nonsense. Yet it seems that the Department of Administrative Services is going to proceed as though everything is quite rosy, there is nothing more to explain, and the Public Works Committee has had its inquiry and raised a few concerns, but that is just tough. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has said, `The fact that this has occurred is being considered', as he has just pointed out, and the Department, through its Minister, will be looking at it for the future. I honestly believe that this is far from satisfactory and, from the point of view of accountability to the Parliament, I think that the Public Works Committee has every right to demand a much better response than that which has been given so far. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth highlighting exactly what has happened. It was understood some years ago that both the Customs Office and the Australian Taxation Office were going to need these facilities. It was understood some time ago that it would save money to have a joint facility for their computer installations, so that there would be no need to have two buildings duplicating power supplies and all the various things that go with it. This was worked out years ago. However, apparently Customs fell a year behind. </PARA>
<PARA> The question is then raised: why was this allowed to happen? Why did not the Department and its Minister ensure that there was proper coordination? We are seeing what amounts to a waste of money. I do not accept the explanation given today by the Minister that it would have been more costly had the two been put under one roof. It certainly could not have been more costly if proper planning had been undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw attention to this matter because I do not think that we can afford this at the best of times, let alone right now when this country is in a very serious recession, probably the most serious recession we have seen in 60 years. It is just unacceptable that we are seeing what amounts to waste and duplication when it has been known for years that these facilities had to be built. </PARA>
<PARA> I will quote from the comments of the Chairman of the Public Works Committee. These same comments were read into the Senate Hansard by my Tasmanian colleague Senator Calvert. The points made have not been properly responded to. The honourable member for Throsby stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee was of the view that substantial overall savings would have been made had both facilities been in the same building from the earliest planning stage. Accordingly, the Committee has recommended that the Minister for Administrative Services should conduct a review of all Commonwealth departments and authorities to ensure that, as far as practical, facilities such as computing installations are collocated. </PARA>
<PARA>It is just not adequate to move a motion the following day to the effect that the Government will go ahead irrespective. We believe that it would have been more costly. It seems that all the work, time and effort put in by the Public Works Committee has just been cast aside by the Minister who said, `My Department has told me it is probably a bit hard, therefore we will just ignore what the Public Works Committee has said'. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a very grave matter that cannot be brushed aside or swept under the carpet. It is a matter that the Public Works Committee ought to be bringing forward in a response to Parliament. It should demand to know why the Government is paying such lip-service to the very valuable work that it has been doing. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Public Works Committee has rightly observed, it seems that, when the two departments involved suggested that risks of industrial disputation and sabotage were an excuse for this decision not to have the joint facility, it fails to see how this risk is reduced by having two almost identical facilities right next to one another. The Public Works Committee has raised another question to which there has not been a satisfactory response, namely, why must there be a duplicate backup power supply when the two facilities are side by side? Again, to give a very brief response which seems to brush off the whole matter raised by the Committee is not satisfactory. The Committee deserves congratulations on having called on the ACT to look into better road works so that there would not be parking problems associated with this construction. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, this whole process raises very serious concerns about the accountability to Parliament of the Department and the Minister. It raises very serious concerns about the work which has been so painstakingly done by the Public Works Committee and which just seems to have been overlooked. There are very serious concerns regarding the considerable wastage of public money through very poor planning. </PARA>
<PARA> We have two virtually identical facilities being built side by side. The best excuse that can be offered is that planning did not facilitate this; yet it was known five years ago that these two facilities would be needed and that they could be combined into one building. However, despite that knowledge, it has been overlooked. It is not satisfactory for the Minister to brush it aside and say, `There will be a review in the future and we may look at the Committee's recommendations'. I believe that the Parliament deserves and should expect a far better response from the Department and the Minister than it has been given today. </PARA>

<PARA> That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of a Chancery and associated recreation facilities on approximately 8,000 square metres of land at Jalan Rasuna Said, Jakarta, Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed work recommended by the Public Works Committee is the construction of a Chancery and associated recreation facilities to be occupied and used by the staff of the Australian Embassy in Jakarta, Indonesia, for the Department of Administrative Services. Australia's relationship with Indonesia is one of this country's most important bilateral relationships. A positive and constructive relationship with Indonesia is crucial to Australia's interests. Our physical presence in Indonesia, as epitomised by our Embassy building, should be consistent with the importance of the relationship. </PARA>
<PARA> The need for a new Chancery in Jakarta has been recognised since the early 1980s when the existing Chancery became too small to house all the Embassy staff. The stage has been reached now that half the Embassy staff are housed in separate leased premises. After much searching and lengthy negotiations, a contract has been signed whereby our Chancery site at Jalan Thamrin has been exchanged for another site of similar size at Jalan Rusana Said, in the Jakarta central business district, with a substantial cash settlement in our favour. This was the only suitable site for which title could be guaranteed.</PARA>
<PARA> In common with other diplomatic missions in Jakarta, the title of our site will be a hak pakai title which gives right of use in perpetuity for Embassy purposes. The concept design and approximately 30 per cent of the total documentation required for construction of the building has been undertaken by the Australian Construction Services. The successful tenderer will be required to complete the documentation as well as undertake the construction. The design of the building is energy efficient and environmentally friendly. An energy audit of the building will be undertaken following completion, and a copy of the report will be provided to the parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works as requested. Extensive input has been provided to the development of the proposal from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, the Department of Defence and Austrade, as well as from staff associations and the Embassy. </PARA>
<PARA> Subject to parliamentary approval, the overseas property group will place a contract in August 1991. The completion of documentation and construction period is estimated to be 20 months. As is the case with all major Commonwealth building projects, construction work will be performed by a private contracting firm. Australian content and expertise will be maximised to the greatest extent possible. The limit of cost estimate of the project as presented to the Public Works Committee is $13.28m at December 1990 prices, with an estimated completion cost of $15.25m. I thank the Committee for its report and commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition parties support this motion. My only comment is that we are surprised it has taken the Government so long to acknowledge the importance of one of our most significant regional and bilateral partners. As the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) pointed out in putting this motion, half the Embassy staff have had to be located elsewhere in recent times. That in itself is a sad indictment of the priorities the Government seems to give in setting up some of its expenditure in our region. Clearly, our relationship with Indonesia is very important and is one that deserves a ongoing, high priority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> While this is a welcome move, it is a pity it has taken so long, especially when we look at the Government's ability to find money for other causes. It spent $14m to support the African National Congress, yet it can only find less than half that for the Kurds. So far we have seen only just over $2m for the tragedy occurring in Bangladesh. It does seem a strange set of priorities sometimes that the Government pursues. Nonetheless, we welcome this move and no doubt it will do quite a bit to help our presence in our very important neighbour and bilateral partner, Indonesia. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) proposes amendments to a range of Acts dealing with Commonwealth criminal law. The most significant amendments are:</PARA>
<PARA> - those which amend the Passports Act 1938 and the Crimes Act 1914 to introduce an effective procedure to ensure that the existing scheme under which the passports of persons charged with, or convicted of, certain serious offences, particularly drug offences, may be surrendered; and</PARA>
<PARA> - those which amend the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988 to enable information obtained under that Act to be provided to a foreign law enforcement agency to which the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 applies. </PARA>
<PARA>I shall briefly discuss each group of amendments proposed in the Bill. Part 2 contains several amendments to the Australian Federal Police Act 1979 (AFP Act). The first of these will considerably widen the scope of the witness protection scheme. It is in line with the Government's concern to provide the maximum protection possible to people who are under threat as a consequence of witnessing or being present at an event, or because of their relationship with such witnesses. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment will remove any suggestion that witness protection arrangements apply only to people who have actually witnessed an event and are called to give evidence and not to their families who may be used as tools by the criminal element to orchestrate the witness's silence. </PARA>
<PARA> The second amendment will adapt the management initiated retirement scheme to overcome some practical difficulties. It allows compensation to be calculated after appointment where a determination was not validly made at the time of appointment to the AFP. Currently, a determination may only be made on appointment. It will also allow the Commissioner to end a person's appointment before the expiry of his or her term. Previously, the appointment could only be ended by the person who made the original appointment. This could create practical problems as the AFP employs over 3,000 people on terms of appointment from five to 10 years. It might therefore happen that the person making the original appointment was unavailable. </PARA>
<PARA> Parts 3 and 7 of the Bill amend the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988 (CTR Act) and make related amendments to the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987. Part 3 of the Bill contains a number of amendments to the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988. Many of these are of a minor nature and are intended to assist the Director of the Cash Transaction Reports Agency (CTRA) in the performance of his functions under the Act and clarify the position of cash dealers in relation to certain matters. For example, subsection 16 (1) of the CTR Act requires cash dealers to report to the CTRA those transactions which the cash dealer has reasonable grounds to suspect may be relevant to tax evasion, a Commonwealth offence or the enforcement of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987. Subsection 16 (5) provides protection against legal proceedings for cash dealers and their employees in relation to any action taken pursuant to section 16. </PARA>
<PARA> Concern has been expressed that, unless all the requisite preconditions set out in subsection 16 (1) are strictly met, the cash dealer will not be able to claim the benefit of the protection against legal action contained in subsection 16 (5). For example, if a teller reports a particular transaction in the mistaken belief that it is relevant to tax evasion or to a Commonwealth offence and, after investigation, it is found to be relevant only to a State offence or to have an innocent explanation, no action should lie against the teller. </PARA>
<PARA> Other amendments implement the recommendations of the Group of Seven (G7) industrialised nations Financial Action Task Force on Money-Laundering. Although not a member of the G7, Australia was invited to participate in the task force when it was established in July 1989, because of the comprehensive nature of our anti-money laundering measures. The task force made 40 recommendations on anti-money laundering initiatives which relate to greater vigilance by financial institutions and increased cooperation with law enforcement agencies through initiatives such as suspect transaction reporting and consideration of import and export reporting and significant cash transaction reporting together with law enforcement initiatives such as confiscation of proceeds of crime and mutual assistance at all levels. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia meets most of the requirements of the G7 recommendations because of the provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987, the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987 and the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988 and associated changes in the practices and procedures of our financial institutions. There are, however, a number of recommendations which Australia must implement before achieving full compliance with the G7 recommendations. These include prohibiting cash dealers from disclosing the making of suspect transaction reports and permitting the international exchange of information concerning suspicious financial activity subject to appropriate confidentiality undertakings. These matters are addressed in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Financial Action Task Force now includes participants from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, and most have endorsed the recommendations, there is a growing body of information available internationally which will significantly assist in providing evidence of the true nature and extent of criminal activity in Australia and render both prosecution and confiscation more effective. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill therefore amends the CTR Act to provide that I am entitled to have access to CTR information for the purpose of transmission to a foreign country to which the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987-the MA Act-applies. Where I am given access to CTR information for this purpose, and I am satisfied that the foreign country has given appropriate undertakings as to confidentiality and control of the information, I may communicate that information to the foreign country. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposed amendments to the MA Act in part 7 of the Bill permit regulations to be made, specifying a foreign country as a country to which the MA Act applies for the purpose of obtaining access to CTR information. Where such a country asks for such information I can direct the CTRA to give me access to that information for the purpose of complying with the request. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also amends the CTR Act to enable the Director of the CTRA to give access to CTR information to a wider range of domestic law enforcement agencies. These are the Independent Commission Against Corruption of New South Wales and the Criminal Justice Commission of Queensland. The ability to conduct financial investigations is central to the investigation of corruption, and the investigative functions of these bodies will be greatly assisted by access to CTR information. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains a provision requiring the Director to provide me with an annual report on the operation of the CTRA. The availability of annual reports will be of particular assistance to Parliament when the operations of the CTR Act are reviewed in 1993 in accordance with the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also contains several amendments to clarify the intention underlying the new Federal sentencing legislation, which was enacted in the Crimes Legislation Amendment Act (No. 2) 1989 and came into force on 17 July 1990. The amendments are required to clarify the circumstances in which non-parole periods and recognisance releases should be fixed. It is the intention of the legislation that, where the total federal sentence is less than 3 years and the court wishes the person to be released under supervision, the court can only make an order for the release of the person on recognisance. Where the aggregate sentence is greater than 3 years the intention of the legislation is that the courts be able to make either a recognisance release order or fix a non-parole period. Because there have been doubts expressed about the operation of the relevant sections, namely, sections 19ab, 19ac, 19ad and 19ae, these sections have been repealed and replaced. In addition, the opportunity has been taken to make a small number of minor technical amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> Several parts of the Bill amend provisions of the various Commonwealth Acts dealing with confiscation of assets. The Proceeds of Crime Act was enacted in 1987 and was a major new weapon for law enforcement in Australia. It is encouraging to note the increasing success of the new procedures introduced by the Act. Until 30 June 1990, recoveries and forfeitures under the Proceeds of Crime Act-and the related provisions of the Customs Act-have totalled nearly $7m. In addition, the net value of property restrained to meet future orders was nearly $47m as at 30 June 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1987 a number of decisions by courts exercising jurisdiction under the Act have shown that there is a need for minor modification of the Act. This Bill proposes those changes, and also proposes amendment of the corresponding provisions of the Customs Act and the Crimes (Superannuation Benefits) Act. The amendments are all of a minor policy nature and are discussed fully in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated to honourable members. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will make amendments to the National Crime Authority Act 1984 to give the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) Government the same status as the State and Northern Territory governments and to allow it to participate in the activities of the Inter-Governmental Committee. This is appropriate now that the ACT has responsibility for its own criminal matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The participation and cooperation of the ACT in the activities of the National Crime Authority (NCA) is essential to the national focus and scope of the Authority's investigations. It is only the issuing of references by State and Territory governments that provides the NCA with the powers necessary to investigate offences across State/Territory boundaries. The NCA operates as a cooperative national law enforcement agency. The inclusion of the ACT in this process reflects the Territory's status within the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The ACT is currently drafting its own underpinning legislation and the amendments to the Commonwealth legislation will not commence until the ACT legislation is passed. If, however, the amendments are not proclaimed after six months they will be automatically repealed. This is to ensure that important NCA operations in the ACT are not prejudiced by delays in the passage of the ACT law. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of an initiative of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, the Bill contains amendments to the Crimes Act and Passports Act which are designed to render more effective the existing power of the Minister under the Passports Act 1938 to cancel or refuse to issue a passport to persons charged with, or convicted of, a serious narcotics offence or other prescribed offence against a Commonwealth or Territory law. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 7b of the Passports Act already prevents an authorised passport officer from issuing a passport to a person if the officer has reason to believe that the person is, by order of a court or under a condition of parole, recognisance, surety or bail bond, to remain in Australia or to refrain from obtaining an Australian passport. The Act also provides that a passport, whether in the possession of the person to whom it was issued or not, can be cancelled by the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments empower a court, when imposing bail or recognisance conditions or sentencing a person for such an offence, to order the person to remain in Australia, refrain from applying for an Australian passport or to surrender any Australian passport. The order may be varied or revoked as the court sees fit. A copy of any order made by the court must be given to the department administering the Passports Act and the registrar must retain any passport surrendered until the order ceases to have effect or the passport is cancelled or expires. </PARA>
<PARA> As the proposed scheme was the subject of a reference to the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, the Bill inserts a new section in the Crimes Act designed to complement any State law empowering courts to make orders in relation to passport surrender. </PARA>
<PARA> The only change to the Passports Act contained in this Bill is to amend section 7b to provide additional grounds for the refusal of a passport where the requirement to remain in Australia is a condition of release by licence or any similar instrument of early release granted under State or Territory law. </PARA>
<PARA> The totality of these relatively minor amendments is in my view a significant strengthening of our legislation to ensure that persons charged with serious offences cannot evade detection and prosecution nor reap the benefits of their illegal activities. I commend the Bill to the House and present the related explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>In August last year I announced that the Government had decided to repeal and replace the Service and Execution of Process Act 1901, following consideration of the Law Reform Commission's report on service and execution of process. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the Law Reform Commission's recommendations mentioned in the announcement was an extension of the Act to proceedings before tribunals. At present the Act only applies to proceedings before courts. This extension would apply with respect to tribunals that resolve disputes and to tribunals that conduct inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable members are aware, a number of important inquiries are being conducted in Australia at present. I refer particularly to the royal commissions in Victoria, Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill amends the Service and Execution of Process Act to enable royal commissions and other investigative tribunals to serve subpoenas on persons interstate, and to provide for interstate enforcement of subpoenas to give evidence to investigative tribunals. The new provisions are based on the Law Reform Commission's recommendations. The Act already provides for interstate service and interstate enforcement of subpoenas issued by courts. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as enabling investigative tribunal subpoenas to be served interstate the Bill provides appropriate safeguards to protect the interests of persons served with an interstate subpoena. At present State or Territory royal commissions and other inquiries can effectively subpoena witnesses only within the State or Territory concerned. This can be a serious restriction on the effectiveness of the inquiry and can inhibit its capacity to uncover all relevant information. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes investigative tribunals, including the royal commissions I have mentioned, should be given the power now to summons witnesses from interstate. These tribunals must be able to conduct full and thorough inquiries so that the greatest possible public benefit can ensue. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is bringing forward this reform as a separate Bill, rather than in the Bill to replace the Service and Execution of Process Act, so that it will be available for current inquiries. The chairman of one royal commission has informed the Government he considers that, without the powers being conferred by this Bill, the commission's work may be restricted in some important respects. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the Government's heavy legislative program the replacement Bill will not be ready for introduction until the next sittings. As it is a substantial law reform Bill we would then wish there to be adequate time for examination of the Bill by honourable members, the legal profession and the public, before it is passed. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will insert a new part 3a into the Service and Execution of Process Act. That part will apply to investigative tribunals which, for the purposes of the part, will be persons appointed by a State Governor-such as royal commissions of inquiry-or under a State or Territory law, and bodies established under a State or Territory law, for the purposes of inquiring into and reporting on matters, where those persons or bodies have the power to take evidence on oath or affirmation. </PARA>
<PARA> A subpoena requiring evidence to be produced to such a tribunal will be able to be served out of the State or Territory of issue, by leave of that State or Territory's Supreme Court. Leave may only be granted where the court is satisfied that the evidence sought is relevant to the tribunal's functions and cannot reasonably be obtained from a person within the State or Territory. The Supreme Court will specify the date by which the subpoena must be served. A notice will be attached to the subpoena setting out the rights and obligations of the person to whom it is addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> Reasonable expenses of complying with the subpoena will have to be paid to the person subpoenaed. That obligation will be placed upon the State or Territory in which the tribunal is established. A person subpoenaed only to produce documents or things will be able to comply with the subpoena by delivering them to the secretary of the tribunal not less than 24 hours before the date for compliance. </PARA>
<PARA> Where a subpoena is addressed to a person in prison, the Supreme Court of the State or Territory in which the subpoena was issued will be able to order that the prisoner be taken interstate to give evidence. The State or Territory in which that order was made will be required to pay the expenses reasonably incurred in connection with compliance with the order. </PARA>
<PARA> I appreciate that there is a question whether the Commonwealth has power to legislate to provide for the service and execution of process of State tribunals. The Government has been advised that it has power to do so under section 51(xxiv) of the Constitution, which confers power with respect to `the service and execution throughout the Commonwealth of the civil and criminal process and the judgments of the courts of the States.'</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is expected to have no impact on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue. I commend the Bill to the House and table the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>Both Labor and coalition governments have in the past supported the protection and wise use of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, and I hope that this bipartisan support will continue. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been 16 years since the passage of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act and the creation of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Over that time practical experience gained from managing the marine park has highlighted areas where protection of the reef could be improved. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has noted with concern the effects of spillage of oil and other toxic substances on the marine environment around the world and is of the view that such risks to the Great Barrier Reef should be minimised as much as possible. The effects of an incident such as that of the Exxon Valdez would be quite disastrous to the Great Barrier Reef environment, and even smaller spills of toxic material would be very damaging. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to improve the protection of the Great Barrier Reef against possible spillages of oil and other toxic substances by introducing compulsory pilotage through the northern inner shipping routes of the reef. These routes offer relatively calm waters, but are shallow and intricate in places. Approximately 10 per cent of the 2,000 large ships or ships carrying potentially hazardous cargo using the passage every year are not adhering to the current voluntary system of pilotage. Extensive diplomatic representations have not brought a higher level of compliance with the voluntary scheme. The Government acknowledges the 90 per cent of ships which do adhere to the present system of voluntary pilotage. The responsibility of their masters and owners is appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA> The current voluntary pilotage system covers ships of 100 metres in length and over, as well as ships carrying potentially hazardous cargo. A lower limit of 70 metres has been set in the new system because of the number of groundings of ships in the 70 metre to 100 metre range occurring in recent years. There has been at least one per year. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is committed to the uniform application and development of international law and international cooperation, rather than unilateral action, in protecting our marine environment. Hence we sought recognition by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) for the special status of the Great Barrier Reef and endorsement of the compulsory pilotage system. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia was successful in having the IMO pass two important resolutions in November 1990. The first was to identify the Great Barrier Reef region as a `particularly sensitive area'-the first such listed area in the world. The second was its recommendation that all governments recognise the need for effective protection of the Great Barrier Reef region and inform ships flying their flag to act in accordance with Australia's system of pilotage. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the first time that the international community has endorsed such a system. It marks a new development in international law, recognising the dynamic balance which exists between protection of the marine environment and freedom of navigation. The proposed amendments to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act will give effect to these IMO resolutions. </PARA>
<PARA> Vessels meeting criteria recognised in the IMO resolutions will be required to use the services of a person holding a Queensland and Torres Strait pilot's licence while navigating the inner route or Hydrographers Passage. </PARA>
<PARA> At present pilots hold licences as coastal pilots issued by the Marine Board of Queensland. These licences will be recognised in the regulations. The regulations will also enable additional licences to be introduced. It is intended that there be extensive consultation with interested parties and organisations before any other forms of licensing are introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> Three offences have been created to enforce the compulsory pilotage system. In the first, the master and owner of any vessel over 70 metres and any loaded oil tanker, chemical carrier or liquefied gas carrier, irrespective of size, will be liable to prosecution if that vessel navigates without the assistance of a pilot in the areas between the northern boundary of the marine park and latitude 16 degrees 40 minutes south, and also in Hydrographers Passage, which is just off Mackay. The maximum penalty imposed following conviction would be $50,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The other two offences are linked to the subsequent entry into an Australian port of a vessel which has navigated in the designated areas without a pilot. In the first of these two, both the owner and the master will be liable to prosecution if the ship enters an Australian port under the command of the master who navigated in the compulsory pilotage area without a pilot. In the second, if a ship navigates in the compulsory pilotage area without a pilot and later enters an Australian port under the command of a different master, only the owner will be liable. Again, the maximum penalty imposed would be $50,000. These port entry related offences have been included to take advantage of the clear authority which Australia has under international law to control the entry of vessels into its ports. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government intends that inspectors appointed with respect to compulsory pilotage will normally be officers of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. AMSA officers are more likely than Great Barrier Reef Marine Park officers to be in a position to exercise the power to seek evidence concerning pilotage as they frequently board vessels to carry out inspections under the Navigation Act 1912. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act has been chosen to implement the compulsory pilotage system is to indicate Australia's commitment to greater protection for the Great Barrier Reef environment. It clearly demonstrates to the international community that the measures are aimed at reducing navigational hazards in this particularly sensitive area, for its enhanced protection. </PARA>
<PARA> After these measures are introduced and enforced, the rate of compliance, already 90 per cent under the voluntary pilotage scheme, is expected to be total. A particularly vulnerable part of the reef will thus be more effectively protected from the possibility of an environmental disaster caused by a shipping mishap. </PARA>
<PARA> In deciding on this course of action, the Government considered other options, including the suggestion by some conservation groups that tankers should be prohibited from the region. This was rejected as impractical for a number of reasons:</PARA>
<PARA>1. Much of the tanker traffic operating inside the reef is servicing the population centres of far north Queensland. Without access to such shipping these communities and the industries on which they are dependent, such as tourism, agriculture and mining, would not be able to satisfy their energy and other needs. </PARA>
<PARA>2. The waters of alternative routes in the Coral Sea are less sheltered and less well served with navigation aids. Ships transiting via these routes therefore constitute an equal or greater risk to the environment than those inside the reef. </PARA>
<PARA>3. Ships navigating in the inner route of the Great Barrier Reef are exercising the right of innocent passage under international law. It would not be open to Australia to completely restrict this right. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, this Bill represents the Government's resolve to improve the protection of one of the world's greatest natural assets, the Great Barrier Reef. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill, and I commend this Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian National University Bill 1991 provides for the amalgamation of the Australian National University and the Canberra Institute of the Arts from 1 January 1992. In July 1989 the Australian National University (ANU) and the Canberra Institute of the Arts finalised an affiliation agreement with a view to amalgamating by 1 January 1991. In July 1990 the university and the Institute of the Arts agreed to amalgamate. </PARA>
<PARA> Legislation to give effect to this amalgamation was to be introduced into Parliament last year but was deferred because of the possibility that the report of the committee to review the Institute of Advanced Studies of the Australian National University-the Stephen report-would have legislative implications. This has proved not to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will be aware that I made a statement earlier this year on arrangements for higher education in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) on the basis of advice contained within the Stephen report and the advice from Professor Chubb. In that statement I endorsed new administrative arrangements which will encourage the Australian National University and the University of Canberra to coordinate their efforts and cooperate more closely in order to provide the best possible educational opportunities for the region. I also endorsed new funding arrangements for the Institute of Advanced Studies of the Australian National University which will enhance the institute's role as a national resource and result in an appropriate performance evaluation and peer review process to guarantee the best use of research funds. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members could not have failed to notice the reports in the media about these decisions. There has been persistent misrepresentation of the Government's intentions towards the Institute of Advanced Studies. On Friday 10 May, I met with the ANU council to discuss points of difference in relation to the Government's decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> This provided me with an opportunity to clarify a number of key points with council members. I stressed that key issues such as the performance criteria to be applied every five years and the composition of the review panels evaluating each school and centre within the Institute would be matters on which the Administrative Review Council (ARC) would need to consult, and seek agreement with, the ANU. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Government continues to believe that it is legitimate and appropriate for it to be able to receive expert advice from the ARC, the only body with broad-based knowledge of research activity throughout the higher education system, except the National Health and Medical Research Council for medical research, as to the overall distribution of research funds between the Institute of Advanced Studies and the rest of the higher education research system. In arriving at such advice, the ARC would draw on the reviews of each component of the institute and would notionally apportion a level of funding to each. It is not the Government's intention, however, to require that the ANU's internal resource allocation decisions would correspond to its own notional apportionment. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no implication in any of this that the institute's funding should be cut-in fact, the new review arrangements could mean more funds. Like Stephen, I acknowledge the high quality of much of the institute's research and see value in retaining a concentration of research resources and personnel. However, funding at the level provided to the institute must be a demonstrably effective use of scarce research funds and the Government, quite properly, will demand advice on the `opportunity cost' involved in funding the institute at a given level compared with other research activities in the higher education research system. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate, however, that the present Bill is entirely separate from these new arrangements for higher education in the ACT. Its purpose is to put into effect a longstanding agreement to amalgamate between the Australian National University and the Canberra Institute of the Arts. The Bill abolishes the Institute of the Arts as a separate institution and adds to the functions of the university the requirement that it provide facilities for courses at higher education and other levels in the visual and performing arts and, in doing so, promotes the highest standards in those fields. The Bill also provides for the students and staff of the Institute of the Arts to be transferred to the university on terms and conditions no less favourable than they enjoy at present. </PARA>
<PARA> The amalgamation can be expected to enhance the national and international roles of the university through the addition of the visual and performing arts to its range of disciplines while at the same time allowing the Institute of the Arts to become a member of the unified national system. With its small student load, the Institute of the Arts would be unable to enter the unified national system of higher education in its own right. </PARA>
<PARA> The amalgamation will permit students from both institutions to benefit from a wider range of course options. The development of higher degree courses at the Institute of the Arts will benefit from the university's greater experience in graduate education. In addition, the consolidation of adjacent campuses under one administration will lead to cost efficiencies and the rationalisation of shared services and amenities. The local community can expect to enjoy greater benefits from an expansion of university extension programs with the addition of more musical, art and gallery activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also provides for a change in the qualifications and method of appointment of members of council from the ACT. This change will exclude members of the Legislative Assembly of the Australian Capital Territory to ensure that members appointed from the ACT will be drawn from the wider community with either expertise or interest in the activities of the institution-for example, from the professions, industry, the trade union movement or community organisations. The appointment procedures will be streamlined in that the Chief Minister will be able to appoint the ACT members directly rather than making nominations to the Governor-General through the Commonwealth Minister. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill and commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the luncheon adjournment, I was telling the House that it is not only the trade union movement in the area of industrial relations which has hard won gains. The hardest won gain in the industrial relations debate over the last 10 years has been to establish-through the decisions of various courts in the Mudginberri case, the pilots dispute, the Dollar Sweets case, the meatworkers case, the gasfitters and plumbers case and, indeed, a number of other cases-something which would have been regarded as undreamt of, unheard of and an absolute industrial relations heresy in this country as recently as five or 10 years ago, and that is that trade unions, if they break the law, can like the rest of us be made accountable before the ordinary courts of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I said before lunch that the Opposition was uncompromisingly opposed to any legislative change that would alter that situation. It is a hard won gain to be able to say at long last in this country that in this area there is equality before the law. </PARA>
<PARA> It always amazed me that the Hancock Committee of Review of Industrial Relations Law and Systems could say, as it did in 1985, that we cannot make unions subject to the ordinary laws of this country because they are strong enough to disobey them. In substance that is what the Hancock Committee said on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I remember debating this subject with Professor Keith Hancock, a person whom I respect, at Flinders University in 1985 when I was Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He repeated that assertion. He believed that it was part of the industrial relations folklore of this country and something which could never be compromised. I disagreed with him then, and the course of events over the last five or six years has validated the position I then took. </PARA>
<PARA> Our concern is that the Government is conjuring up a deal with the Australian Democrats. Senator McLean is being well looked after. He has been to the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU); he has talked to the leaders of the movement; he is going to Geneva; and he is going to be very well looked after. Fair enough. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not saying that the Government has any ulterior motive in doing that, but I wonder whether the precedent being established in relation to the visit to the International Labour Organisation (ILO)-that is, the Government's pattern of matching the Minister with the shadow Minister-is going to be repeated. On that three-month stint to New York, are we going to have an Australian Democrat, a member of the Opposition and a member of the Government comprising the Australian delegation to the United Nations in New York? I can be forgiven for believing that Senator McLean's invitation to the ILO is part of the pay-off for support for the Government's proposal to set up a labour court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator McLean's views on industrial relations are to the left of a number of people in the Australian Labor Party. I grant the Labor Party that. He has indicated publicly on many occasions that he supports very strongly the centralised model with the Australian Industrial Relations Commission sitting at the pinnacle. In that sense, he is different from the Labor Party. I am not sure whether the Labor Party any longer supports a centralised model with the Industrial Relations Commission sitting at the pinnacle. As a result of the rejection of the Commission's decision in the national wage case, those of us who follow the industrial relations debate closely are genuinely puzzled as to whether or not the Government any longer supports that model. </PARA>
<PARA> I put it to the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) and to the honourable member for Eden Monaro (Mr Snow), who follow these matters very closely and have some understanding of the industrial relations debate, that in this country there are really only two alternatives. We can either have an industrial relations system where the Commission is genuinely the umpire and the referee, on the understanding that the players do what the referee says; or, alternatively, we get rid of that centralised model and allow outright enterprise bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government and the ACTU rejected the wage case decision a few weeks ago. I can only believe that at that time the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was so disoriented by the problems he was having with former Ambassador Brian Burke that he took his eye off the game and was swept along by other people who wanted to join the ACTU in rejecting the decision. I cannot believe that the present Prime Minister, given his history with industrial relations, does not still believe in his heart that we ought to have the pure centralised model with the Industrial Relations Commission sitting at the pinnacle. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable members in the House know, I have long wanted to change that model, but I am prepared to acknowledge that in a debate the best argument for the alternative to my policy is to argue the role of the Commission. As far as I am concerned, that made the decision of the Government to oppose the Commission's decision absolutely mind-boggling. To use the sporting parlance, it was like kicking an own goal in soccer. It is like Queensland going into the State of Origin without Wally Lewis. It is, from the Government's point of view, trying to run this industrial relations debate without arguing the role of the Commission. But it is not for me to advise the Government on tactics for that debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Going back to the labour court, we are concerned that the Government is in the process of buying off Democrat support for the labour court proposal. I remind the House-and, through it, supporters of the Australian Democrats-that in 1985, when the Australian Democrats were a different organisation, they opposed the Government's attempts to abolish sections 45d and 45e of the Trade Practices Act. That attempt by the Government effectively to abolish it by shifting it out of the Trade Practices Act was defeated. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned, with the passage of time and the change of attitude inside the Australian Democrats, that we are fast approaching a situation where the Government will present a Bill to the Parliament, in effect, to revive the labour court proposal of 1987. That labour court proposal is to shift to a new labour court, which would not be a proper court, in the sense that it would not be free of the mandatory resort to the Industrial Relations Commission before the remedies administered by that court could be made available to parties. </PARA>
<PARA> A labour court of the Government's 1987 model would not be able to enforce the remedies available under section 45d without first saying to the parties, `You go off to the Industrial Relations Commission. You try to sort out your argument. Then if you can't do it-and only then-you come back to us and we'll consider applying section 45d'. </PARA>
<PARA> If that happens, section 45d will be utterly and completely destroyed, because the real value of section 45d, as I said earlier, is that individual employers can go along and say, `Look, we are the subject of a secondary boycott. It is sending our business broke and unless we get immediate injunctive relief we are going to suffer the consequences of that secondary boycott'. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the House, and to the Minister, that if that is not what the Government has in mind, why else would it still be thinking of a labour court proposal? Some people have said to me that what we really need to do is to put all of the industrial remedies into a special court. I am a very suspicious man and I always become very suspicious of people who want special courts. When there are special courts, there are special deals and special arrangements. They are different from the mainstream. If we believe very strongly, as I and the members of the Liberal and National parties do, that one of the milestones in the industrial relations achievement of the last 10 years has been to establish the principle that people are equal before the law and are fully accountable to the ordinary laws of this country, I suspect that what the Government has in mind will be a very serious step back from that. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that all of the employer organisations in Australia understand the implications of what a labour court proposal would mean for the hard won gains of equality before the law. I know that most of those organisations do, but I am concerned that some of them may not. I would say to those organisations that it is simply not possible to have a labour court of the type this Government would undoubtedly have in mind and, with a straight face, to seriously say that we are going to have that but we are not going to touch the effective section 45d and common law remedies that are currently available. </PARA>
<PARA> The interesting thing about the application of the common law and section 45d to union conduct when it is in breach of the law is that, like the rest of us, trade union officials take notice of ordinary courts. When we are told by an ordinary court to do something, we normally do it, because we know that in a law abiding community there are certain consequences. The same thing applies to union officials. I have never believed, as some have alleged, that all union officials are in some way less respectful towards the ordinary laws of this country. Most of them have as much commitment to the rules of law as I have. They take notice of ordinary courts: that is why they do not like being subject to ordinary courts, and that is why the supporters of the traditional approach to industrial relations in Australia have always wanted special arrangements. They are, in a sense, frightened of themselves when it comes to ordinary courts, because they have to take notice of them. </PARA>
<PARA> It was an achievement getting that principle established over the last 10 years. I acknowledge the generous and fulsome contribution-nobody made a greater contribution-of the Prime Minister to establishing the principle of accountability of unions to the ordinary courts of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Let it be remembered in this debate that it was the Prime Minister who encouraged the airlines of this country to sue the Australian Federation of Airline Pilots. He encouraged them to sue the pilots because he said that they had a case. At no stage did he argue that the Australian Federation of Airline Pilots, a trade union, should not be made accountable to the ordinary courts of Australia. I congratulate the Prime Minister for doing that, and I thank him, because he has made a magnificent contribution to establishing that very important principle. I say to the Prime Minister, `Don't upset that principle; don't be seduced by Martin Ferguson, Senator Cook or anybody else into embracing the labour court proposal'. </PARA>
<PARA> In a political sense I suppose I should hope that the Government does embrace the labour court proposal. Such has been the change of mood on industrial relations around Australia over the last year or so that I believe the coalition could fill every hall in every provincial city of Australia in leading protests against the establishment of a labour court which would take away that hard-won gain of having the union movement-like everybody else, not in any discriminatory way-subject to the ordinary laws of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In talking about the alternative industrial relations policy of the coalition, I have repeatedly said that there are four fundamental changes that we wish to make. Firstly, we want to give to individual employers and their employees the right, if they choose-subject to the observance of a minimum wage and subject to the observance of health and public safety laws-the right to make bargains at an enterprise level without the intervention of unions, employer organisations or industrial tribunals. We are not saying that everybody must do that. We are saying that they may do that if they so wish. As everyone in this Parliament knows, we cannot do that under the present law. If we want to do our own deal we can only do it through a union or through an industrial relations tribunal. We believe that that requirement is burdensome, unnecessary and anti-productivity in many cases. If people so wish they should have the right to do their own deal. </PARA>
<PARA> The second fundamental principle is that we are totally opposed to the closed shop and compulsory unionism. We intend to entrench the principle of voluntary unionism. The level of private sector membership of unions in Australia is now about 31 per cent. The overall percentage of 42 per cent is boosted by the fact that some 68 per cent of people in the public sector belong to unions, due almost entirely to the de facto compulsory unionism that exists in the public sector. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that there are plenty not in unions. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro correctly interjects that there are plenty not in unions. Of course, there are plenty not in unions. My argument very simply is that it should be purely and simply a matter of choice. We will never place a penalty on people who want to join a union. We will maintain the tax deductibility of bona fide union dues. There will be no attempt by us to put a penalty on people who belong to unions, but we will prevent people being forced to join unions. In this day and age that is an utterly unexceptionable principle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third pillar of our industrial relations policy is to allow the emergence, once again if they are desired, of enterprise unions. We are not saying that we have to have enterprise unions. We are not saying that we cannot have craft unions or industry unions. We are saying that if we want to have an enterprise union we should have the freedom to do so. That is why we oppose the foolish change the Government made to the Act only a few months ago to introduce a minimum membership level of 10,000. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is just crazy. I think it is a super mistake, rather than being a super union. I cannot think of anything more illogical, seriously-I say this to honourable members opposite-than to be running around the country saying, as the Government is, `We believe in enterprise bargaining and we believe in exalting the enterprise. The enterprise, right or wrong, is going to be the theme of the 1990s. The enterprise is beautiful', when in the next breath it says, `Hang on, we are going to make it impossible to belong to a union, to have a union, unless you have 10,000 members'. It is a contradiction; the two things are going in the opposite directions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The final principle that is a pillar, a cornerstone, one of the irreducible minima of our policy, is equality before the law. That brings me back to the substance of our objection to this Bill. We believe that everybody should be subject to the ordinary laws of this country, administered by the ordinary courts. We will have no truck with toy courts and we will not compromise on our opposition to the re-establishment of the labour court idea. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the Government: if it wants to resurrect the labour court proposal it should go ahead and do so. It will cost it very dearly in political terms. It will be a retrograde step in terms of ordinary principles of industrial relations justice and, if it is successful, it will overturn for a temporary period what many Australians regard as a hard won gain-that is, the simple proposition that in a nation that has always prided itself on its egalitarian principles it is surely not unreasonable to say that everybody should be equal before the law. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is something of a pleasure to listen to the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard); he is a genuine craftsman. It is a real pity that, craftsman as he is, he gets things wrong as often as he does. He has quoted the aberrations in the industrial relations system as the norm, as if they were to be followed. It would appear that he has reverted to a view that I thought he had gone beyond some years ago-that the answer to industrial relations problems is the threat, the penalty, the sanctions mechanisms, and that is how we should regulate disputes between people in industrial relations and how we should regulate disputes on award conditions, rates of pay and the like. All of this is then wrapped in and camouflaged by the rhetoric of free choice, which is a phrase I will come back to. It is one of the great misleading features of the Opposition's position on industrial relations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is almost one year ago to the day that I made my maiden speech in this place. In the course of that speech I said:</PARA>
<PARA>One of the key areas which will be pivotal in ensuring a strong and competitive Australia is industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA>The events of the last 12 months, and particularly the last six months, have demonstrated just how true that is. I went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>It is sad to note that at a time when enormous strides have been taken in industrial relations, with changes occurring in workplace practices, with award restructuring and with second-tier negotiations of recent years, the conservative parties in Australian politics have opted for a course of confrontation, for a return to the simplistic and basic right wing fundamentalist views characterised by groups such as the H.R. Nicholls Society. </PARA>
<PARA>The performance of the honourable member for Bennelong and the sorts of things that we have heard said by the Opposition in recent months on industrial relations re-enforced that view I expressed 12 months ago. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last decade there has been an enormous improvement in industrial relations in this country which is one of the major achievements of the Hawke Labor Government. There can be no denying that the in the last decade we have replaced the entrenched confrontation which so characterised the 1960s and 1970s with negotiation and consensus. The Government has facilitated union amalgamations. I wish I had the time to talk more about that because clearly there are some major differences between the Government and the Opposition on this point. Again, I believe the Government is correct. The Opposition's view is myopic. </PARA>
<PARA> We have provided stability throughout industrial relations and the spin-offs that provides for our economy through the operation of the accord. Probably the best barometer of that, and the one which throughout the 1960s and 1970s would have been used most often as a criticism of the way in which industrial relations operated, was the number of strikes-the number of days lost to strikes per thousand employees. If we look at those figures throughout the 1970s and the 1980s we have confirmed the view that industrial action has subsided dramatically throughout the 1980s. At the end of the 1970s we were witnessing highs of 780 working days lost per 1,000 employees. That was not just in one year; 780, 680 and 780 working days were lost in successive years at the end of the 1970s and the early 1980s. In 1989 that figure was down to 190, less than a quarter of the peak. Now it is operating slightly above that; the latest figures are 220 working days lost per 1,000 employees. </PARA>
<PARA> The facts are that industrial relations in the last 10 years has seen a return to sensible negotiation and constructive development of our economy trying to set right the problems we have in our factories and our workplaces, but doing it in a way which is not only economically sensible but socially just. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other spin-offs from the accord has been a reduction in unit labour costs to a level which is now lower in real terms than it has been for a decade. I noticed the other day in Question Time that members of the Opposition interjected on that point. One of the things that tend to be forgotten when that figure is referred to is the benefit that this Government has provided, as a result of the accord, in the social wage-things such as the increases in the family allowance, the introduction of the family allowance supplement, Austudy, child-care fee relief and Medicare. These benefits have all improved in a dramatic way the social wage of Australian wage and salary earners. </PARA>
<PARA> We are talking about significant sums of money for ordinary working Australians. The family allowance supplement provides a family with two children under 13 years of age up to $106 a fortnight tax free. Families can receive up to $85 a week for child-care fee relief. These substantial tax free payments in the hand are a direct result of the accord which the Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions have negotiated. The Opposition has failed to acknowledge them as a major step forward in industrial relations and an improvement in the quality of life of many Australians. These achievements and many others are now being threatened by the sorts of policies that the Liberal-National coalition and the more extreme elements within employer groups have been promulgating over recent months. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer to the fundamental question of hours of work. During the adjournment debate on 9 May I referred to a Courier-Mail article which reported the Queensland Confederation of Industry (QCI) as saying that it believed that Queensland industries would benefit from a return to a 48-hour working week. As I mentioned the other night, the 48-hour working week was the standard in 1904 when the industrial relations system was established. In April of this year the Queensland Confederation of Industry suggested that we would all benefit from working a standard rate of 48 hours a week. </PARA>
<PARA> I was somewhat flattered on 9 May when a member of the Opposition front bench was motivated, following my adjournment speech, to come into the House and respond to my comments. I should say that on reflection I concede that it was only the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) and not truly a cause for any great excitement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has made clear its position on the question of hours. On a number of occasions the honourable member for Bennelong has pointed out his support for a 40-hour week. His view is opposed not only by this Government and the trade union movement but also by employers. On 19 February, a day or possibly two days after a press release was issued by the honourable member for Bennelong, the Australian Financial Review included an article which said:</PARA>
<PARA> Both the Confederation of Australian Industry and the Business Council of Australia have rejected the proposition made by the Opposition's spokesman on industrial relations, Mr Howard. </PARA>
<PARA>This was concerning the 40-hour week. </PARA>

I would have thought that by now he would have resiled from that position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The statement of the honourable member for Bennelong was reported in other newspapers. Clearly, other interviews were given. Those statements go to the heart of what the honourable member for Bennelong has said today about industry agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no problem, as a member of the Australian Labor Party and as a former trade union official, with enterprise agreements negotiated between unions and employers, preferably within the national guidelines and approved by a commission. I was somewhat surprised and disappointed that-and, admittedly, his remarks had been paraphrased-the honourable member for Bennelong indicated that there were only two courses that could be followed in determining wage--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Three.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ET4">Mr BEVIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are three courses-I must have missed one. I understood the honourable member to say that there were only two. The question of how many solutions and mechanisms there are to resolve industrial matters is a bit broader than that. A little bit of lateral thinking would have helped overcome the hurdle of only two or three options.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said, I have no problems with enterprise agreements negotiated fairly between unions and employers within known guidelines and preferably approved by a commission. There should be an understanding across the country within the jurisdiction, be it State or Federal, of the ground rules and an understanding of the base conditions which apply. </PARA>
<PARA> However, that is not the sort of industrial agreement or enterprise agreement which the Opposition and the major employer organisations are proposing. The hidden agenda behind what is being proposed by the Opposition is far more sinister. In a Sunday Telegraph article of 24 February, the honourable member for Bennelong is reported as having said:</PARA>
<PARA> However, under a Coalition government much of the labor market would move to negotiations at an enterprise level instead of being tied to the centralised system. </PARA>
<PARA>That is fine, as far as that goes. The article went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> For example, if you wanted to work a 50-hour week it would be a matter for negotiation. </PARA>
<PARA>That reminds me a little bit of the Opposition's health policy under which it is going to replace Medicare and replace it with vouchers. The Opposition health spokesman has told us that some people will be worse off but only by choice. One will choose to be worse off. We have a nation of masochists waiting to be inflicted with this pain. The honourable member for Bennelong says that if people wish to negotiate a 50-hour week as their standard hourly basis, they can do that as a matter of choice. The article went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> `Until we have a system where working hours can be negotiated at an enterprise level the Government should approach the Industrial Relations Commission to bring back a general 40-hour working week. </PARA>
<PARA>So there we have the clear scenario that we should now move to increased working hours for Australians through the award system, that we should move to make it 40 hours but as soon as we can free up the award system to let enterprise agreements be established, we want to see it go above 40 hours. In April the QCI told us that it wants to see it go to 48 hours. </PARA>
<PARA> On 9 May I put the question to members of the Opposition who were in the chamber, `What is your policy? What do you see as the standard hours of work which should apply for ordinary Australians?'. It is a question that they should address before the next election. The people of Australia will want to know whether under the Opposition's stewardship they will be facing 40 hours, 48 hours or, as the honourable member for Bennelong has suggested, 50 hours. </PARA>
<PARA> If the honourable member and his supporters are committed to enterprise agreements, the approach needs to be even-handed. The process of enterprise agreements means that some people might in fact do a little bit better. The only enterprise agreements that I have seen the Opposition and employer organisations herald are those that seek to reduce conditions below base award rates. That is the practice overseas-it is the practice in New Zealand, the United States of America and Britain. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is also the practice here in Australia. I want to quote from an article in the Courier-Mail of January of this year. The article states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Queensland's private schools were yesterday granted permission to oppose an award which would give teachers at a Brisbane school up to $6,000 a year more than their State-award colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not surprising-one would expect the employers to oppose an award claim that would provide teachers in one school with $6,000 more than their colleagues elsewhere. But that is not the way it was. The $6,000 increase was in fact a negotiated enterprise agreement. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The Queensland Confederation of Industry is leading the campaign against the John Paul College agreement. </PARA>
<PARA>It then says-and this the absolute height of hypocrisy:</PARA>
<PARA> The QCI is the State's leading employer group and one of the strongest supporters of enterprise bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA>The teachers' union in Queensland which covers those people negotiated an enterprise agreement without industrial action that resulted in a $6,000 a year pay increase. The first thing the champions of enterprise agreement wanted to do was to get down to the Commission and stop it becoming law. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members opposite, the Queensland Confederation of Industry, the Australian Confederation of Industry and the other employer groups have consistently demonstrated their support for enterprise agreements that reduce conditions. Whenever there has been an enterprise agreement that seeks to dramatically improve conditions, negotiated freely between the union and the employer, they are off to the Commission-a commission which they say we should not have; a commission which should not interfere in these matters-in a effort to stop those agreements being registered. That is in fact what has been occurring in Queensland in the last month with the Queensland Confederation of Industry. It is mockery for the honourable member for Bennelong to stand here and claim otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> As time is short in the debate today, I simply wish to round off by reminding the Opposition and the people of Australia that fair-minded Australians will again reject the sort of provocative policies that would return Australian industrial relations to the mindless confron-tation of the 1960s and the 1970s. </PARA>
<PARA> The Hawke Government will continue to work with unions and employers to collectively improve our work practices, in what has been and will continue to be a socially and economically responsible manner. I commend the Bill to the Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), of course, demonstrates what he openly admitted to-he is an ex-union bureaucrat and his mind is locked into that situation. He, like the rest of them, is busily protecting his little nest. They are all in there. The one worry the honourable member has in terms of industrial relations is this: `Will there be a job for me back at the union when I get kicked out of this place at the next election?'-as he inevitably will. That is his worry and that is the problem with the whole industrial relations system in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member has just told us how everything is going to be worked out. He does not mind enterprise bargaining, provided it is between the union bureaucrat and the employer bureaucrat. I have no time for employer bureaucrats either, because I think both sets of bureaucrats are in the one club. The Bill before us today is to make sure that the other option is available to the honourable member: if he does have to go back to the club-and it does not seem to matter which side a person is on from time to time-there will always be the future opportunity of this wonderful range of salaries if he can make it to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, the third arm of the club. They all sit there scratching one another's backs. They are never out of work when there is a strike. In fact, I believe they claim overtime. They are the people who are very much about protecting themselves. They have never had anything to do at the genuine workplace. They have never got a bit of grease under their fingernails. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the honourable member's background? What did he do? Tell the Parliament. He has never done a hard day's work in his life. I can claim to have done that. I have been a painter, a truck driver and other things. I know what it is like. I have talked to those people-I have talked to them as a fellow worker and I have talked to them as a boss. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Brisbane talks about enterprise agreements. There are millions of them done every year, if they can keep union bureaucrats out of the job; and they operate very satisfactorily. The honourable member talks about hours. I can remember saying to the members of my hotel staff-about 40 of them at the time-`Look, I am fed up with my wife having to spend all morning working out your wages at all the various rates that now apply in a highly complex award. What say I pay you a flat hourly rate and you tell me how many hours you want to work?'. I told them the hourly rate, which happened to be created by dividing all the hours they worked into all the pay they got, and they said, `That is great; I have never seen that much money in my life'-only because they saw it up front. </PARA>
<PARA> The other fact of life is that they then settled down and decided how they wanted to work. Some of them wanted to work 15 hours a week; some of them wanted to work 50 hours a week; some of them wanted to work at night-time, because they were married and they could be at home with their kids in the daytime; and some of them wanted, at that flat rate, to work weekends. That is what they wanted, and they were all nominating when they wanted to work. It was the happiest time I ever had. But unfortunately the bitumen road was creeping closer to Carnarvon, and we knew that, when the bitumen got in, the trade union bureaucrats would turn up. They would not drive up the gravel road to protect the workers of Carnarvon, but we knew that, once the bitumen was up there, they would be coming along. </PARA>
<PARA> What were they interested in? Union dues. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) made the point-and I reinforce it-with one little bit of information about forced membership of trade unions in the public sector. When a Government in Western Australia-I think it might have been a Labor Government-found itself in dispute with the teachers' union over there, it refused to continue to forcibly collect the dues; and the membership of the Western Australian teachers' union fell in half almost overnight. So much for how willing they are. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member talks about our policy of threat and penalty. I talk about our policy of protection-a little bit of protection for people. Let me give an example published in the Western Australian newspapers not that long ago. There was an industrial site, a lot of activity, some danger inside the fence and no room to park motor cars. Everybody understood that they had to park outside, including the site boss. Along comes a member of the Plumbers and Gasfitters Union and says, `I want to drive my car in there to talk to the fellows'. The guy on the gate said, `I am sorry, you don't take cars inside here'. After a lot of argument, the bloke parked his car and walked in. The next day he turned up and he said, `I want to drive my car in today; I am somebody; I am a trade union bureaucrat; I am someone special'. The bloke on the gate said, `I am sorry, you can't'. He went around to the boot, took out a hacksaw, walked over to the meter and sawed through the water supply. He closed that site down because the toilets and everything else would not work. </PARA>
<PARA> I read about it in the newspaper and I rang the police. I said, `Has this man been charged with an outrageous act of vandalism?'. They said, `No, the poor old employer was so frightened that he has asked us not to proceed'. Is that what the honourable member believes is industrial relations? Is that enterprise negotiation? Answer: yes. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me tell the honourable member how we see enterprise agreements and why we do not need the trade unions involved. They go to the umpire, the Industrial Relations Commission-and he is a nice fellow when he comes down on their side, which is pretty handy. I am interested to know where in fact Mr Kelty stands. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Do not worry about wage increases. We support wage increases on one simple criterion: that they are matched to productivity. That is a matter of importance for every housewife in Australia. Fundamental to the honourable member's livelihood is having another application before the Industrial Relations Commission, because if he does not he is out of a job and he cannot build his reputation and get his endorsement to Parliament. That is his problem as an industrial relations bureaucrat.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He stood up and tried to convince the Parliament, of course, that without him and his fellow union bureaucrats the worker has had it. For 75 years the workers of Lincoln Electric have done without the union bureaucrats. They have never had a trade union bureaucrat assisting them in their negotiations with their company, and they have never had to change the rules-disaster for the likes of Kelty and the honourable member. They do not need to change the rules, because the rules say that the workers get a bonus of 25 per cent of the pre-tax profits of that company. The 25 per cent never has to be changed because, if the workers work harder, they keep increasing the profit and the bonuses go up with it. The average bonus last year was $5,000 a worker, and the company says, `We are very satisfied with our return on capital for the 75 per cent we keep'. </PARA>
<PARA> Here is a Queenslander trying to say that every time there is a voluntary agreement the worker suffers. Of course, he actually talked himself into that. Honourable members were standing up here in the Parliament carrying on with that sort of rubbish about Power Brewing, but Mr Goss, in his wisdom, eventually forced Power to tell the terrible truth. It was forced to expose all the secrets of how it was mistreating its work force! What did the world discover? The workers were getting $60 and $80 a week more than the trade union bureaucrats could negotiate for them down at Castlemaine Perkins Ltd, which makes XXXX beer. They are two occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> I know a lot because, unlike the honourable member, I am not a trade union bureaucrat. I have seen it from every angle. The mere fact is that we are going to have some enterprise bargaining because Bill Kelty wants some enterprise bargaining. How did it work up at the Newcastle shipyard the other day? Were there lengthy negotiations? No. They just came in and told the poor devil, `We have picked on you because you are the only place up here with any work. You have got three ships to deal with. We know you are vulnerable. Pay up or we strike tomorrow'. That is lovely, is it not?</PARA>
<PARA> If that bloke loses money on those contracts and becomes perhaps the last shipyard to close in Newcastle, honourable members opposite will all say, `Well, we did it for the right reasons; we had to'. As Bill Kelty said to the combined unions conference, `You have to protect your power'. That was the word he used: `power'. That is what is wrong with industrial relations in Australia. We now have this massive self-interest group, the industrial relations club. While this Government remains, there is no hope for Australian workers. </PARA>
<PARA> We are talking today about the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill. We are talking about salaries for members of the club-a position to which all those opposite aspire-of $100,000-plus. We are talking about having a special labour court. We all know the rules of industrial negotiation a la Bill Kelty and the industrial relations bureaucrats: `If you can close the bloke down long enough, he'll give in'. Government members do not want the opportunity for that bloke on day one to go to a proper court and a properly qualified magistrate or judge and say, `I am being subjected to a secondary boycott' or `I'm being bullied; my business is at risk and so is the welfare of many of my workers, who do not even agree with this action. I want something done about it'. The court might say, `Well, that's a matter of natural justice. Let's listen to it. We will consider your proposition'. </PARA>
<PARA> Those opposite do not want that. They want a labour court where, as the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) described it, the employer goes along and says `Help', and the court says, `We'll wring our hands over this matter. Go away and talk; be closed down for a week; have some negotiations'-the employer is broke at the end of the week-`and then come back and we'll see what we can do for you'. That is what those opposite want because that is fundamental to their negotiating position. </PARA>
<PARA> That is not what the Opposition wants. We believe that both sides should be able to sit down and talk about it and get a result, without closing down the business. Who are the losers when a business is shut down? The workers themselves do not do too well. When they get their pay rise at the end of it and the wages they have lost are deducted, it takes them about eight years to recover lost wages after a prolonged strike. I can give the House examples of exactly that happening in the Pilbara. It took 10 years for one group of workers to recover what they lost in pay while they struck for what was eventually $10 a week, led on by some trade union bureaucrat. Those workers did not like it very much; I can tell honourable members this because the workers talked to me. What I am saying is that under what we propose people can be paid in terms of their productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> This morning we had the Treasurer (Mr Keating) telling us about how he has achieved a drop in inflation. He has certainly done that, as 850,000 unemployed people will attest. The simple fact is that he has tried every so-called economic instrument to bludgeon the economy into this situation, and he has done it at a huge price. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the productivity proposals of the Opposition, we can have nil inflation simply by maintaining productivity relative to wage increases. The point I make to the House is that we can do that, and the first beneficiaries are the worker's wife and family because when they go down to the shops the prices are still the same. That is how we can contain inflation and keep jobs. Unless the Government understands that, it will never get this country on its feet. Its instrument has put 850,000 people out of work, and that is not very bright. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall finish now because I presume the reason the Opposition Whip, the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson), has come along is to lean on me a little. I have just been complaining about that! The whole point about it is that people can have individual wage agreements and get paid relative to what they do. The more the merrier, as far as I am concerned. I hope our policies will double wages; they certainly do pretty well for the blokes at Lincoln Electric. A survey in Canada has shown that companies that pay productivity bonuses make 12 per cent more profit. It is a good idea. Government members should embrace it, not try to bully people and just keep their jobs because they need them. That is the major problem now. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many other things I would like to have said. I get quite wrapped up in this. For the information of the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis), I too made my maiden speech in this place on industrial relations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -It is a pleasure to speak in this debate. I thank the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) for his compliments to me and the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) on our association with the union movement, and to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) for his insistence on accountability. The Prime Minister is a great negotiator. But the honourable member for Bennelong and the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) have taken an extreme approach to this matter. It is particularly dangerous when we have a great parliamentarian such as the honourable member for Bennelong taking such an extreme view. Everyone likes him, but people do not realise that what he is propounding is extremely dangerous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Bennelong is saying to us, `You have a choice: open slather enterprise bargaining or centralised fixing of wages and conditions'. That is the sort of choice he is offering. He thinks that the matters that were sorted out at the end of the last century and the beginning of this century could never result in the sorts of conditions that existed in the last century-child labour and the Ebenezer Scrooges of business. The people who are breaking industrial relations rules today are actually the precursors of what would happen under the sort of legislation that is being proposed by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Does the 1908 case mean nothing? I appreciate that the H. R. Nicholls Society resulted from the objections that were raised then to the Harvester decision in 1908. But what would really happen under enterprise bargaining where the employer and the employee negotiate, where there is a strong union, probably in a capital city? I say again that there is little compulsion, even in the public sector, for people to belong to unions in most industries today. </PARA>
<PARA> If we had a strong union, then it would make sure that the employees got higher wages. The strong unions are the ones that can exert pressure, whether unionism is compulsory or not. There will be situations where strong unions will get the higher wages. They will exert pressure, costs will go up, inflation will go up and prices will go up. We will get a wage-price spiral simply because this will happen in the big industries. </PARA>
<PARA> What about places where there are weak unions or where there are no unions at all-small towns such as Bombala and Braidwood, where people do not have a big choice? The honourable member for Bennelong is going to have a minimum wage. I do not know what it will be. Will it be the wage that they have in the United States of $3 an hour?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have a figure. If the honourable member for Bennelong can give me a figure, then I will be happy. My fear is that what would happen here would be the same as happened in the United States and the United Kingdom. The minimum wage in the United States is $3 an hour. Translated to Australia, that is $3.50. People would be pushing around their worldly possessions in shopping trolleys and sleeping under bridges. I have seen it in the United States. The pressures would be on once this is taken away from the Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To be fair, the honourable member for Bennelong has great faith in employers; great faith in enterprise bargaining; great faith in his own side-the Opposition is not moving for a low minimum wage. He is not at all suspicious about those people but he is very suspicious about special courts, about having a labour court. We have a Family Court that is doing a great job. We can have a labour court that is doing a great job. </PARA>
<PARA> This will be the sort of negotiation that will occur-although not in every case, I know. In a town such as Bombala or Braidwood, let us say, the boss will say, `I'm sorry, Mary, times are pretty hard; I can only afford to pay you $4 an hour'. Mary thinks, `Well, we're not going to be able to pay off the mortgage. My husband's got a job in the timber industry here in Bombala on a pretty low wage. We are trying to pay off the mortgage; we've based it on the fact that we're both going to get an income. We're going to have to cut our costs with the family; but what choice have I got? There aren't a lot of shops in Bombala. I'm going to have to accept $4 an hour'. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the sort of person who would be hurt, not those in strong unions. Honourable members opposite are talking about getting rid of compulsory unionism; I am talking about people who are not in unions now or who are members of unions that are not particularly strong and are not in a particularly good bargaining position. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition wants sanctions on workers who object to conditions, yet it wants freedom for employers to slash the incomes of people. That is exactly what would happen. Similarly, the Opposition's policy for the Industrial Relations Commission will hurt employees. Some of the Opposition's policies are the sorts of bubbles that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) were speaking about today. On all sorts of issues the Opposition has not come up with firm policies. With respect to social security, honourable members opposite have talked about charities being involved in assessment, chartered accountants being involved in the payment of Medicare, no Medicare levy, and taking us back to the expensive private funds. But they have not really come up with policies. Similarly, we hear that the Opposition's policy will be that the Industrial Relations Commission no longer will be the sole wages umpire, that minimum wages may not be set and that the Commission may no longer have any role here. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard that the Industrial Relations Commission's jurisdiction will be absent in respect of voluntary agreements. There will be no jurisdiction in respect of voluntary agreements. We say that that will be dangerous, that jurisdiction will be confined to areas that are traditionally within the award system. </PARA>
<PARA> I am a little worried about the Opposition's policy relating to no access to superannuation by the Industrial Relations Commission via arbitrated awards. What we are doing with superannuation is making sure that people are covered for retirement so we do not have huge outlays by government in the next century, especially when the postwar baby boomers start to retire. We need superannuation systems well in place. That is why the situation has been turned around from one in which 30 per cent of people were on superannuation in 1983 to one in which 70 per cent are on superannuation now. We want it as close as we can to 100 per cent so that we can have minimum outlays by way of pensions and so that we can have a minimum of interference with assets tests, means tests and all that sort of thing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is really about getting rid of union power, which was hard won, which is important and has been important in the history of our country and of the world. I called on Father John Morrison, the local relieving priest, when he happened to be at Braidwood one day, not long before his retirement. He asked me about my support of unions. He said, `Young man'-I was over 50 then-`the trade unions have made this country'. He is so right. If we look at the history of this country, particularly recent history, we see how the trade union movement has taken a completely responsible attitude in conjunction with the Government to ensure that the economy is set right in very adverse circumstances, and we see a situation where poverty is occurring throughout the world on an unprecedented level. </PARA>
<PARA> Here in Australia we are making sure that an unselfish approach is taken by the trade union movement, the Government and many employers, so that we are getting it right, and the trade union movement has been heavily involved in getting it right. However, the Opposition has offered us structural changes, such as the sort of enterprise bargaining I was talking about, privatisation-which will lead to the situation that currently exists in the United Kingdom in telecommunications and other industries-and a consumption tax. That, of course, will mean that people on lower incomes will be paying higher taxes and will be paying taxes on food, clothing and other essentials, whereas employers or those in business will be having to furnish a return to government, just as they did in the days of the Bolte consumption tax in Victoria. Those days are easy to forget, many years ago in the 1960s when employers and businesses had to put in a return. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly with wages, because of workers' lower incomes small business will be hurt because there will be less spending in local towns. Employers will not be sure what they really should be paying, and they will be forced by competition from the less scrupulous employers into paying lower wages. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposals before us tonight are strengthening the Commission. They are also strengthening organisations such as the Trade Union Training Authority. Through the savings measures that have been implemented there has been a redirection of resources in training which has increased training days by the Authority and increased the number of students training. The legislation is particularly important, including that which reforms the Industrial Relations Commission, and I am pleased to support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This has been an invigorating debate this evening, has it not? I am delighted to enter the fray. It is a great shame, though, that the Government saw fit, or at least claims that it is necessary, to gag debate on such an important issue, and one that so many on both sides of the House seem to have the desire to address. I will confine my remarks to the first of the Bills, the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill, and I refer honourable members to the second reading speech of the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) wherein he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It is particularly important that there is flexibility to appoint tribunal members with appropriate knowledge and experience, including an appreciation of current industrial relations issues and government administration. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a mouthful, is it not? Goodness gracious! The Minister has said that it is the system itself which is all important. It is the system, not the results, not the outcomes that count in this debate about industrial relations. We must at all costs maintain our highly structured, rigid, inflexible, dogmatic industrial relations system and the club that drives it. The Minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA>The existing seven year disqualification period has created difficulties in finding replacement members of the Tribunal with the necessary skills and experience to enable them to operate effectively. Members of the Tribunal are required to have regard to the wage fixing principles of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and, therefore, need to be cognisant of the principles of contemporary wage fixing arrangements. Accordingly, a more flexible provision is required. An amendment is therefore proposed to the Act to reduce the disqualification period from seven years to one year . . .</PARA>
<PARA>What a lot of rot! This Bill admits that this totally inflexible, rigid, centralised system, which it is so imperative that we maintain, is now faced with the real problem in finding competent people who are entrenched within the system to act on the tribunal. Well, that is sad, but so what?</PARA>
<PARA> The problem we have is that this Bill provides that the Commission is an example of jobs for the boys. If someone is not within the system, he cannot play the game. No system, no game; nothing happens. The Government must continually fix up its own industrial relations legislation in order to make the system work because the system is so highly legally based. </PARA>
<PARA> I tell honourable members and you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that industrial relations labour law in Australia today is in a crisis. No-one from either side of the House in this debate has any confidence that this Government, the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) or the Industrial Relations Commission have any idea in what direction the system is going. The Government and the ACTU, in accord mark 6, stitched up the latest deal which made a decision on working conditions for every man and woman in every enterprise and at every location across this vast nation. We might as well be in communist Russia, might we not?</PARA>
<PARA> What happened was that two sides of the triumvirate, the Government and the ACTU, made their agreement, stitched up a deal and then went to the Commission. For once the Commission did not play; for once it stood up to the accord partners and said, `No, boys. This is not in the national interest. We are going to play the game a different way'. So what happened? The Government and the ACTU took the ball and the bat and went home. They said, `We will start all over again'. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us examine what some people had to say about that particular issue. I refer honourable members to the Age of 15 May 1991 where Mr Kelty is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>Power is not something you can achieve by the unilateral assertion of it. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course it is not. Where has the trade union developed its power from? It developed its base of power in the field. It has consolidated that power in its stitched up deals with its mates in this Federal Government; that is the basis of the accord deals. But now the accord deals are not working because the Commission will not play. So the system is falling down and the system does not work. That always happens to complex systems. That is what happens when one creates cartels-they work for a while but they are never totally successful and, at the end of the day, cartels always fail. That is what we have in industrial relations in Australia-a cartel between the bureaucracy of the labour movement, the bureaucracy of the Government, the bureaucracy of enterprise management associations, and the bureaucracy of the Industrial Relations Commission. Mr Kelty went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>I think there are a lot of people out there who have not got the benefits of award restructuring and as a consequence have been exploited. </PARA>
<PARA>People have been exploited because he believes that the last deal stitched up by the ACTU and the Government has not been totally delivered in the field. I remind honourable members that less than 40 per cent of the work force in this country now belong to trade unions. But the trade unions still represent them. It is absolutely necessary, is it not?</PARA>
<PARA> We do not have compulsory union membership, unless one happens to be in the construction industry or the meat industry or one happens to work for the Commonwealth Government or a State Government. Exploited-goodness gracious! Here we are in the middle of the greatest recession for 60 years and we are talking about exploiting workers by not granting dramatic pay increases. Mr Kelty also dismisses the argument that a wages push in the current economic climate will exacerbate unemployment. He says:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . wage and salary earners are not responsible for unemployment, and can hardly be called upon again to exercise restraint. </PARA>
<PARA>There are one hell of a lot of people in my electorate who would really love to have the opportunity to exercise a bit of wage restraint if they could get a job, but they cannot. They would be delighted to have the opportunity to work for reduced wages-perhaps more flexible conditions of employment-if they could get a job. But they cannot get a job and they are on the scrap heap. </PARA>
<PARA> Not just builders labourers, but carpenters, brick layers, tilers, electricians, company accountants, consultants-people from middle management all across Australia-are hurting. The reason they are hurting is partly due to the highly inflexible industrial relations system that the Government keeps wanting to hold up. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis) said that there is something sinister about Opposition policy in industrial relations. He hinted at a hidden agenda wherein the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) supposedly would like to see hours of work now moved back to 40, 48, 50, 60-or maybe more. We might exploit workers who wanted to work 50 hours a week. What the policy is all about, at the real level of where people work, is giving people the opportunity to make a choice for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) said, `My goodness gracious. The honourable member for Bennelong wants to give people choice. Isn't that awful'. The Labor Party does not believe in giving people choice-it believes in coercion, it believes in direction, and it believes in control. </PARA>
<PARA> The Training Guarantee Act is a terrific example of how not to go about encourageing people to do things. That Act forces people to do things. Industrial relations law forces people to belong to a rigid system that can be controlled by the Government and controlled by its mates in the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Brisbane talks about unions as if they were the centre of the world, the beginning and end of the debate. I remind honourable members that only 40 per cent of people in the work force in this country are members of trade unions. It is down to about 32 per cent of those in the private work force. If honourable members come into this House tomorrow morning and debate and support my industrial relations amendment or my Industrial Relations (Membership of Associations) Bill which calls for voluntary union membership, union membership will continue to decline because public sector union membership is bound to fall once membership is voluntary. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one last point I want to make. The honourable member for Brisbane seemed terribly confused about Opposition policy on industrial relations. He talked about two streams, two ways to go. Let us try it once again. I have been in this House many times on this issue and I have heard the honourable member for Bennelong many times on this issue. He has quoted the policy so many times-so have I-that I would have thought it had sunk in. But let us try it one more time for the record. Firstly, if we like the centralised system and want the Commission to set the conditions, then we should stay there. Secondly, if we want vertical agreements and want to have unions negotiate with management on a vertical industry basis, then we must have section 115 of the Industrial Relations Act. But if we do not like either-and I do not very much-then we should let employees and employers at the work face level, where it really happens, opt out completely and let them decide how they want to approach their working life. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8T4">Mr FERGUSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously, by his contribution. There is, indeed, a plethora of enemies out there for him. The Gleeson report came back with something that was all things to all men because of the indications given by the Government as to what it was going to produce. If we actually bothered to read the reference it received, we would really question the validity of that first paranoid outburst by him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report talks of examining the categories of membership of the Industrial Relations Commission and the structural arrangements which should apply; the total remuneration package; and maintaining and protecting independence, et cetera. If we read those references we might come to the view that rather than have a series of riding instructions they were given wide ambit to come to a variety of decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike the honourable member for Bennelong, having read this document, I think most people would come to the view that in some areas it represents an agreement with the Government position and in other areas it represents a disagreement. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the position of the Australian Democrats, another of these so-called enemies who, apparently for questionable and horrible reasons, disagree with the honourable member for Bennelong. What is their position put down to? As to their evil attitude towards this Bill, it was implied that they have been corrupted by an offer of a trip to Geneva. In the same breath, having said that the Democrats' position is based on trips to Europe and that Senator McLean will be looked after, the honourable member then turned around and said in the same sentence that Senator McLean is an extreme left winger whose ideological line is far stronger than that of members of the Australian Labor Party. Obviously, he is trying to have it both ways: he says that the Democrats are doing this on a corrupt and immoral basis, yet he also says that they do have genuine positions that dictate the course they take. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike the honourable member for Bennelong, I actually think that the Democrats' change of position since the question of sections 45d and 45e of the Trade Practices Act was considered might have something to do with looking constructively at realities in this country. It is not a matter of whether the Democrats are getting a trip to Geneva. As the honourable member for Bennelong said, in the period since the legislation was last considered we have seen a series of court cases that have seriously undermined the trade union movement in this country. He recited a series of cases. There is no doubt that this has seriously impeded the financial position of trade union members in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> When talking about trade unions, people sometimes talk about thuggery and union bureaucrats, for example, using all this sloganised rhetoric, but in this country the reality is that, because of a variety of legislative action from both sides of the House, we have a trade union movement that suffers from the requirements under which it must operate. The Democrats might have come to the view that such legislation was hurting organisations that are democratically controlled and, in the end, hurting the financial position of the individual members. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note the part of the industrial relations agenda for this country that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has endorsed. Admittedly, the shadow Minister, the honourable member for Bennelong, was a bit more reticent. He is aware of some of the electoral damage that this might do to the Opposition in the lead-up to the next election. However, the Leader of the Opposition has come out with a wholehearted endorsement of what is happening in New Zealand. One of the major measures of the New Zealand Government-and these measures were not too clear cut when they were put forward before the election-concerned the internal affairs of trade unions. New Zealand has ended the requirement that trade unions be registered, and thereby ended the requirement for internal democracy and accountability. We will see in New Zealand the emergence of groups like Maori Black Power intervening in industrial relations. We will see a recourse to teamster style, gangland intervention in trade union affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> I have dealt with the second level of paranoia on the part of the leading spokesman for the Opposition on this matter, the honourable member for Bennelong. We have the report of the Gleeson committee, we have the position taken by the Democrats, and, of course, we have this simple analysis of trade union activity in this country, which talks of `predatory union action destroying businesses'. That is a summation of the whole vision of industrial disputation in this country by the Opposition spokesman on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Referring to the contributions made by the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) and the honourable member for La Trobe, and the comments about all this vicious industrial action out there, we had no recourse to statistics on industrial disputation in this country over the period that the Labor Government has been in office. With the accord and the attempts by both sides to reach accommodation on industrial relations over a variety of matters, as well as the move towards a system of enterprise bargaining, a system that is controlled in its processes in directing people in a new direction, there are people who appreciate that there is more depth to the matter than simply saying that it is just a question of predatory union action, trying to close down businesses. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, another thing that comes under the sledge hammer from the honourable member for Bennelong is the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC), which has been accused of mindless jawboning. There are occasions when the resolution of disputes and the discussions might take too long. The Gleeson report considered the question of the formation of panels. Whilst the committee did not come to a final position on that, there is probably legitimacy in saying that that is a matter that should be considered, because of delays. </PARA>
<PARA> The lead spokesman for the Opposition has ascribed to anyone who dares to oppose his views the worst possible motives. Finally, after giving a message to the Democrat voters out there in electoral land, he gave another message to employer groups which have had the temerity to disagree with the Opposition's position on these matters. Once again, I suppose that he considers that those people have questionable motives. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for O'Connor, in his contribution, cited an unsubstantiated Canadian survey, which showed, apparently, that companies that have productivity deals gain 12 per cent more in profits. As I say, that was not a cited survey and not attributed to any documentation at all. However, I think that even honourable members opposite would appreciate that one thing we can substantiate, from a variety of journals in this area, is the wage differential between unionised sectors, both internally, within countries, and between countries, when other factors are taken into consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the nub of the Opposition's position in relation to industrial relations. When all is said and done, the fundamental intention of this is to reduce conditions. The intellectual gurus in New Zealand that 10 or 11 honourable members opposite, including the Leader of the Opposition, flocked over to see last week have indicated that that is clearly the intention of the legislation there, that it is quite clear that there will be a reduction in conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen and heard on many occasions the Opposition's failure to actually come clean on details of the minimum conditions and minimum rates that will cement this new system. If they were to succeed electorally, this is crucial to the whole process we are talking about. What we will see in the service sector of this economy, as we have seen in New Zealand, in the recent negotiations in the hotel industry and in the cleaning service industry, is the need for some kind of protection of minimum conditions. This is because there will be a very drastic downturn in the living conditions of people, if and when these kinds of measures are put in place. </PARA>
<PARA> Briefly, in regard to the Australian Trade Union Training Authority, these measures continue a process that TUTA has itself moved down. In the last few years there has been a saving of $560,000 through a process of cutting back on the payment of attendees who do not obtain payments through award rights. There has been an increased charge for attendance at the Clyde Cameron College itself, as well as a variety of other measures in relation to cost cutting. There has been the appointment of a national director, to ensure that its programs are more aligned with the needs of award restructuring in this country and to move most of these courses towards industrial style training, rather than having totally union oriented requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of the organisation that I worked with for eight years, there is a situation where some courses are taken in consultation with TUTA but with their own instructors, while in other cases they use TUTA's facilities totally. I want to mention particularly the question of cleaning service delegates courses run by our union, in conjunction with TUTA. This is another area that indicates what will happen if honourable members opposite get their way with industrial relations. The trade union movement in New South Wales, and in particular the Miscellaneous Workers Union of Australia, has protected the preference clauses for widows and single mothers in the government cleaning sector. One of the great initial moves by the Greiner Government was an attempt to slaughter those preference clauses and thus deprive those women who had lost their husbands and who depended on their jobs. I am pleased to say this was unsuccessful. Courses are conducted for that particular industry by our union, in a variety of country centres, including Dubbo and Tamworth. </PARA>
<PARA> Among other changes through this TUTA measure is the disappearance of State and regional councils. Obviously that will involve some monetary saving and means that the organisation can be directed more towards one focus. That, as I said, appeared through the appointment of national training officers in the past few years. There is a reduction in the number of ACTU representatives and the introduction, for the first time, of a consumer representative. While the Confederation of Australian Industry continues to have a consultative role in the appointment of employer representatives, its non-appearance at every meeting since 1986 indicates why it should not continue to control appointments totally. </PARA>
<PARA> The other part of the legislation deals with the question of Vice Presidents and Senior Deputy Presidents. Unlike the honourable member for Bennelong, I think the recommendations of the Gleeson committee have more ground for respect than his contentions. On page 36, the committee justifies the appointment of the Vice Presidents:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the personal load on the President is undesirable and that a formalised structure ancillary to his power of delegation is highly desirable. The Committee points out that a power of delegation, unsupported by an identified office more senior to other Presidential Members, could possibly give rise to potential difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA>On page 37 the committee once again extensively justifies the appointment of Senior Deputy Presidents. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by pointing out that this legislation results from a report which, despite the contention of the honourable member for Bennelong, does cover the issues. It is a document that the honourable member for Bennelong perhaps should have read before he rose this evening simply to justify voluntary trade unionism and the attempt to undercut working conditions in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the House who said these words:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It is only through enterprise bargaining that we can obtain the great productivity increases available from changing workplace arrangements and conditions and it is only through enterprise bargaining that we can make the wage system more responsive to the changing conditions of demand and supply or to different skills in different regions. </PARA>
<PARA>It could have been me in 1986, but that is not the quote to which I refer. It could have been the shadow Minister for industrial relations, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), five or six years ago, but that is not the quote to which I refer. No, that is a quote from the Treasurer (Mr Keating) when, on 16 April 1991, he stood in this Parliament and embraced a policy and rationale that we in the Opposition have been putting forward in Australia for about five years. </PARA>
<PARA> The tragedy is that it was 1991 rather than 1986 when the Treasurer did it. For those five years between 1986 and 1991, the Treasurer spent all his efforts propping up a centralised wage fixation system-a system that he now concedes is harmful to productivity. When it comes to wage fixation in this country, the trouble with the Treasurer, quite frankly, is that he is always the last person to recognise what is necessary, when he ought to be among the first. Again he returned to that theme in that famous `Why I want to be Prime Minister' interview with Maxine McKew on PM on 30 April 1991, when he had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . if we are going to get to a country which is more productive and more efficient, the essence of productivity will be how product is managed through the wharves and ports system by the practices of those particular enterprises. How, for instance, in a manufacturing facility productivity can be enhanced or how it can be enhanced somewhere else. They are all enterprise specific issues. They can't possibly be managed by a central tribunal and they can't be referred to a central tribunal. There would be too many of them. I mean, how would a central tribunal handle a judgment or an examination, rather, of an agreement around a productivity increase for a change in practices for hundreds of thousands of enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA>How indeed? How would a central tribunal handle an examination of agreements in relation to productivity for hundreds of thousands of enterprises? How indeed would it do that? Yet that is exactly what the Treasurer has been asking the Industrial Relations Commission to do since the 1987 wage fixation principles came down. That is exactly what this Government has been asking over the past three or four years. Now the Treasurer, with a bolt of light on the road to Damascus in his eyes, realises that it cannot be done. But what does he want to put in its place? He does not want to put in place a system whereby individual owners or employees or their bargaining units can agree in those hundreds of thousands of enterprises for productivity examinations. No, he still has an idea that it can be fixed centrally, only this time not by the Commission but by the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU). His current proposal is that the ACTU somehow will be sitting above these hundreds of thousands of enterprise agreements, making sure that they go according to plan. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Treasurer has conceded the case, the concession for him is entirely linguistic. He concedes the case for enterprise agreements; he concedes the case for devolution of powers; he concedes the case for fixing these things at the workplace level; he concedes the case that this is the way in which productivity can be increased. But, of course, when it comes to the substantive issue, he cannot really get down to a structure that will permit it, for the kind of structure that will permit all of those things to take place is a structure that has enterprise bargaining units-with employees either in their own enterprise specific unions or in a loose association with somebody negotiating on their behalf, but negotiating as an enterprise unit. Of course, the Treasurer's idea is that we will still have industry-wide national unions and industry-wide national unions will pick off enterprises one by one according to the ACTU grand plan. And the Treasurer calls that enterprise bargaining. It is no such thing at all. The reason he cannot get to the system of enterprise bargaining that would actually work is that he cannot forgo the reduction in influence that that would mean for those national industry unions and for the ACTU generally. </PARA>
<PARA> I could go through many of the provisions of this Bill, including those relating to the Trade Union Training Authority, and I could, one by one, establish that they are not warranted. For example, take the Trade Union Training Authority. I think it is probably a good idea that trade union officials be trained, but why should that be done using taxpayers' money? Why should the taxpayers pay for the training of trade union officials? If trade unionism is such a good thing and if the employees of this country want to join unions and want trained officials, they will be able to provide the income necessary for it. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I come to the main gist of the Opposition's opposition to this Bill. That relates to the restructuring of the Industrial Relations Commission. In 1988 this Parliament enacted the Industrial Relations Act, which set up a new Industrial Relations Commission. It had a President, Deputy Presidents and Commissioners. In 1988 that was considered a reasonable structure. How is it that three years later that structure is no longer considered desirable? What major changes have occurred in the interim? We know what major changes have occurred in the interim. They are: a distaste by the ACTU for the way in which salaries were fixed in the Industrial Relations Commission; the resulting worry that that caused in the Commission; the undermining of the independence of the Commission that that led to; and, as a result, an attempt to patch it up with a new structure as if that will solve the problem, introducing new levels in between President and Deputy President-the new levels of Vice President and Senior Deputy Presidents. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1988 we got a new Industrial Relations Commission. That replaced the old Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. I will set it out in equation form: Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, minus Staples, equals Industrial Relations Commission. There was no reason why the Industrial Relations Commission was introduced except to get rid of a troublesome judge on the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> I would not for a moment defend all the views and judgments of Mr Justice Staples, but let me make this point: if one believes in the independence of this institution, one could not justify the extreme lengths gone to to get rid of that judge. If he had behaved badly he ought to have been removed through the proper processes, but the Government obfuscated and set up a new commission just to get rid of one troublesome judge. It is indicative of the way in which this Government treats with contempt the independence of that institution. </PARA>
<PARA> If I could set it out in equation form, the restructured Commission which would come about as a result of this Bill equals the old Commission over the ACTU. That means that we have to have the Commission restructured, because that is the only way the Government could keep the Commission going with the approval of the ACTU. So it has to be divided by-is it the quotient--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has to be divided by the lowest common denominator, as my friend the honourable member for Chisholm says. Let me make it clear that I have always held the view that the Industrial Relations Commission, constituted by statute, is entitled to the respect that the statute confers upon it. The statute confers independence upon it. I do not believe that that independence should be undermined.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If one has differences with the Industrial Relations Commission, if one thinks that it is not behaving as it ought, one ought to change the statute. But, whilst that statute constitutes it as an independent body, it ought to be given the respect that it deserves. Of course, this Government will not give it that respect. The ACTU will not give it that respect. When the first wage decision since 1983 came down that did not agree with the accord partners, the Government and the ACTU walked away from it. </PARA>
<PARA> The doctrine of this Government and of the ACTU in relation to the Industrial Relations Commission is this: `All decisions which support us are immutable and all decisions which do not support us are totally negotiable'. That is the view that they have of the Industrial Relations Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> All the rest of the Gleeson reports and all of those recommendations will not obviate that one fundamental point of contempt that this Government and the ACTU have shown for the Industrial Relations Commission. If one wants to change the role of the Industrial Relations Commission-and I believe it ought to be changed-one ought to do it in an honest way by amending the statute, not by leaving the statute in place, pretending that it has statutory independence and then at every available opportunity undermining that independence. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make it clear to this House that nobody has undermined the independence of the Industrial Relations Commission as have the ACTU and this Government. There is no basis on which they can ever again stand and say that it is an independent institution, there to independently arbitrate between parties to industrial disputes. There is no basis for it. The Government and the ACTU cannot maintain that argument. They have disclosed their own contempt. They have mortally wounded the independence and the standing of that Commission, and it ought to be clear that they did it for the most base reasons-their own political interests. If the Industrial Relations Commission as a result has difficulty in the field upholding its decisions and its principles, it is their fault because they walked away from it in the most contemptuous way. For many reasons this is contemptuous legislation. It ought to be rejected, and I urge the House to do so. </PARA>

I say that not because we on this side would say that everything the trade union movement does is correct, but we recognise that in the ACTU we have responsible decision makers who play a part in restructuring the Australian economy and in bringing about desirable outcomes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was interesting to hear the remarks of the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) on this particular day when we have seen this extraordinary inflation result. We are seeing the consequence of an approach to wages policy, and of other economic policies, which has now resulted in lower rates of inflation without massive industrial disputes. One can contrast that with the experience of the Opposition when it was in government and its pattern. For members of the Opposition to come into this place and deride the ACTU-which is what the honourable member for Higgins has just done and what his counterparts tend to do-is just an extraordinary approach to policy making. </PARA>
<PARA> The ACTU is a responsible group of people seeking to represent its members, and also to play a part in restructuring the Australian economy. A contrast would be if we were to come here on a day by day basis and disparage everything that the Confederation of Australian Industry or the National Farmers Federation said. There are times when we do take issue with both those organisations-but not through a constant stream of criticism and abuse such as I have heard about the ACTU for eight years. </PARA>
<PARA> I will say, incidentally, that I think the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) is remarkable because he does not do that. We know why. It is because he is a person of considerable stature. He has been around and he knows how it works. It might be all right for people such as the honourable member for Higgins to unload a bit of ideology from time to time, but the fact is that in government one has to work with and modify institutions. I make that point very strongly. I do not very often take issue with Opposition members in this respect, but I do on this occasion because I find it just extraordinary to hear, after eight years in this place, that the tune about the ACTU has not changed. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at any of the major reforms that we have tried in industrial relations in Australia, we find that the ACTU has been part of that process. Of course it represents the trade union movement and of course it does not always say the same thing that we, the Government, the Opposition, the Parliament or the community might say. That is by the nature of it. But one cannot always criticise it for having bad motives because I do not think that applies. I also do not think it applies in respect of the remarks of the honourable member for Higgins when he spoke about the independence of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC). </PARA>
<PARA> As we heard earlier today, looking at the approach of the Opposition to the role of the Reserve Bank of Australia, the question of independence of institutions is important. We cannot have it both ways; we cannot have a monetary policy by which we instruct the Reserve Bank of Australia-from the way I read the remarks-and we cannot then say that we are concerned about the independence of institutions. We must have institutions which are independent and respected. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the next matter I shall deal with. One of the issues I am particularly pleased about is this question of the joint jurisdiction of State and Federal commissions. I note here that the role of Commissioner Halliwell and Commissioner Coleman from Western Australia will be very important in the role of this joint Federal-State jurisdiction. We are getting improvements in the way the Australian Industrial Relations Commission is working; we are getting improvements in the way the whole industrial structure is working. </PARA>
<PARA> The only way to examine an approach to wages policy is to do so without the sorts of remarks I hear far too often about the ACTU. From my dealings with it, and I am certain it applies to the dealings of my colleagues, one cannot ascribe bad motives to the ACTU on most occasions. One can certainly ascribe very strong motives, and for that I respect it; but one cannot ascribe bad motives. As I said, the honourable member for Bennelong did not get onto that track, but the honourable member for Higgins did. It might satisfy him and his constituency, but it does not satisfy the debate in which we are involved, and that is the crucial issue. We are involved in a debate about wages policy and about the role of the AIRC and its recent decision. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been a lot of discussion in this Parliament about this recent decision. The Government took as a view that the accord was central to the whole strategy of both wages and prices policy in this country. The nexus between those, the properly negotiated positions of the accord and the trade-offs which are part of those elements, are very important. The fact that the AIRC chose to ignore those is another matter of which I will speak in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> We regard it as important for us as a government and for the ACTU to work together. One of the reasons for that is because of the outcome we get in terms of reduced inflation and reduced wage pressure. Clearly, there are other reasons. We have much reduced demand and we have an economy in recession; I recognise that they are factors which underpin a lower rate of inflation. It would be folly to claim otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> An element of that is the wages outcome, so the accord is seen as central. It is obviously going to be a matter of judgment by people in this chamber as to whether or not we always accept the umpire's decision. One of the things that bedevil industrial relations is that too often there are trade unionists and there are employers who do not accept the umpire's decision. That is a worrying thing. In that respect, we do get anecdotes about behaviour amongst some trade unionists who are ignoring the umpire's decision. They are ones that we as a community need to address. </PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, we have also what I think is a very significant issue, that is, the element of non-compliance in relation to 3 per cent superannuation. We have seen a lot of employers who have not complied-sometimes, I believe, out of ignorance because the information has not been put in front of them. That is understandable, and that is a job to be done. At other times it is simply because either they think it is a way of reducing their costs-and it is, because there has been a wage cut-or their circumstances are so tight economically that, when they are faced with other bills, superannuation is the last that they tend to pay. Whatever the causes of that are, as a community we have to examine this question of the superannuation arrangements and the proper payment of that 3 per cent that was dealt with in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that that brings us to this current case. The Industrial Relations Commission has said that it would welcome the opportunity to look at the question of the future of superannuation. I think there is merit in saying that we as a community ought to be examining this whole question of superannuation in respect of three issues: firstly, the current levels of compliance; secondly, the future of superannuation so that we get to a quantum of superannuation which makes it worth while for people to be in it, because at this stage the amounts involved are relatively small; and thirdly, if we are going to have a retirement incomes policy which has, on the one hand, pension payments and, on the other hand, superannuation, how the community regards that and what the strategy for it is to be. </PARA>
<PARA> Incidentally, clearly an approach which looks at this issue and is successful will result in a greater lift to our national savings, which I think both sides of Parliament would regard as significant, because our current savings ratio is unacceptably low when we look at the overall needs. As a consequence, we have lived off other people's savings; hence the effect on the current account. The whole pattern is there. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of that specific decision, my view is that there is merit in responding to what the Commission said. I think that is something that will take time to work through, but that is where I stand. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I think it is very important that the whole question of the future of the industrial relations system be still under review. It is never fixed in concrete, nor should it be. It is a living institution in which the players in the game play a significant part. Many employers to whom I have spoken respond by saying that there are many merits in the industrial relations system. </PARA>
<PARA> I heard the honourable member for Bennelong talk about the Power Brewing experience, but I think that when we look at individual companies and talk about the experience of individual company's management and employees, there is a lot to be said for getting good relations in the workplace, which result in those types of outcomes. I do not think there would be a lot of opposition to that amongst honourable members-certainly not from me-because if we can get those sorts of outcomes and they bring increases in productivity and improvements in workplace behaviour, clearly they have to be the goal. </PARA>
<PARA> The mechanism to get there is clearly one that is a matter for debate between our two sides of the chamber. I am still of the view that I do not think we will get there by throwing away the whole system and starting again. Frankly, I do not think the honourable member for Bennelong is saying that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I beg your pardon! I will come to the honourable member in a moment. I find it interesting that the Labor movement claims to be so proud of its treatment of its own members and that it constantly crows that we on our side of the House, and those who might be connected with us, cannot, or could not, run a satisfactory industrial relations policy. We often hear, for example, that our policy and our approach is a recipe for a wages blow-out. Inherent in this reasoning is the belief that if we cease to control employees, they will react by breaking out and behaving irrationally and against both their own interests and the nation's best interests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The irony of this seems to escape Government members, from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) downwards. The irony lies in the fact that it takes a very low view of Australian workers. It is to confirm the view of the Industrial Relations Commission (IRC) when it recently said that we are not yet mature enough in this country to cope with enterprise agreements. Implicit in that condemnation is the patronising attitude that it is necessary to determine what is best for the bulk of the Australian work force and then to impose those decisions upon workers from on high, because to allow them to run their own affairs would be to run the risk of industrial anarchy and economic mayhem, as our workers are not capable of thinking out their own best future. </PARA>
<PARA> This narrow and unsatisfactory view is reflected again in some of the material now before us. For example, the reticence of the Government in getting on with its review of Comcare provisions so as to allow people over the age of 65 to enjoy Comcare cover reeks not only of the Government's tardiness in making sensible reforms but also of its commitment to the centralised control over the way we work, the way we are paid and the way we generally behave in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA> On 6 November last in this place, in a debate on the future of the Australian National Maritime Museum in Darling Harbour in Sydney, we saw the then Minister for Tourism and Arts, Mr Simmons, trying to defend the indefensible when the Opposition sought to move amendments to the relevant legislation that was before us at that stage to allow people who were older that 65 to serve on the museum board, because, as it stands, people over 65 cannot be on the board of directors. The principal reason given for that related to the inflexible nature of Comcare and the fact that anyone over 65 who served on the board could not be covered. </PARA>
<PARA> On that occasion the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney), in the committee stage, pointed out that this was an absurd situation and, in reference to something that I said, referred to my having pointed out that many of people who are peculiarly able to contribute to the understanding of the issues that will be faced by that museum, people who are particularly aware of the history of maritime matters, may be people of mature years. In those circumstances, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we are potentially depriving this Museum of people who could be of enormous value to it. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say that he had a second broad concern which was a matter of simple justice. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it is the view of the Opposition parties-a view which is reflected in our formal and published policies-that those people in Australia who are aged 65 and over should not be treated as second-class citizens. It is our view that those people are entitled to be dealt with without discrimination on the grounds of age. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet here tonight we find that this same issue appears to be no further along the road to resolution at all. The refusal to employ people over 65 is offensive enough in itself. In this particular case, the reason was quite trivial. Yet we find that just as the Minister then sought to defend the Government's policies at the time, very little has happened since. In rather convoluted English he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The important point that I keep coming back to is that we do have a process in train at present to look at the very issues that the Opposition is raising. Somehow or other I am being accused in some sort of cursory way of being dismissive of the amendments. I have sought to explain to the House that that is far from my intention. We are very conscious of age considerations and it is for that reason that the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) sought to extend this process further. We are conscious of it not just within my portfolio responsibility but right across the broad area of Government responsibility. In that context, we are looking at the total question of age and some of the inconsistencies that I acknowledge are there at present. </PARA>
<PARA>That was on 6 November. We do not seem to have got very far, if anywhere at all, in the process of review that we were promised was being undertaken at that time. I understand that amendments will be moved tonight, amendments which should not need moving. If the Government accepts them, as it ought, some of these absurd discriminations against people over 65 will end. So, too, will the small chink of the Government's overweening control of the workplace and of the people in it. Why should those over 65 who want to work-many of whom still have a great deal to contribute-not be able to do so? This whole question of breaking down this drab hand of control that the Labor movement and the IRC-the club, if you like-seem to feel must be kept imposed is something that is surely quite critical for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths), who is at the table, knows something about the bureaucratic imposition of labour market control from the top end. He presides over the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) which, amongst other things, runs around 1,400 or 1,500 meat inspectors, plus quite a few who are redundant and do not actually do any meat inspections. The Government, despite regular promises that there would be no increase in cost recovery above 60 per cent, now charges an amount of 100 per cent as from 1 January this year. Abattoirs across the country now find them themselves forking out very close to $65,000 per annum for meat inspectors who earn, on average, $31,000. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard consistent promises in response to the concerns of the meat industry that if 100 per cent cost recovery is paid, major improvements in efficiency and work practices would be granted. We have not seen much of that. Consequently, we have just had a dispute in New South Wales where the domestic abattoirs refuse to pay 100 per cent cost recovery. In response, the Minister withdrew the provision of AQIS inspection services. Amongst other things, that produced the farcical situation at Cowra where $200,000 worth of prime meat was written off as dog food. It was inspected by two fully qualified meat inspectors but they were regarded as illegal because there are normally eight. The real issue is that it would appear that we do not need anything like eight meat inspectors to do the job. </PARA>
<PARA> It becomes a question of protecting inefficient work practices and not getting on with the job of streamlining this operation. We hear from the Minister that streamlining and reductions are taking place. Yet I am told that of the 30 abattoirs that were surveyed towards the end of last year in this regard not one recorded a drop in inspection manning levels and some recorded an increase. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the challenge is there for the Minister, AQIS and for the whole inspection service to answer some of the questions that are floating around out there. Why are we so grossly inefficient in meat inspection services in this country compared to our American trading competitors? Why does it cost a plant in Australia up to twice as much as an equivalent plant in New Zealand for inspection services? These are the sorts of areas that need to be examined as a matter of urgency if we are to develop a lean and efficient economy of the sort that allows us to compete in international trading places. It seems astonishing to me that we can have a major industry statement designed to set out initiatives for the boosting of our export performance and yet at the same time we go on crucifying the few winners that we do have. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that our industrial relations policy is designed to promote genuine industrial relations-I emphasise the word `relations'-genuine consensus, a genuine identification of common goals by both workers and employers and the scope for both parties to work towards their mutually identified and mutually advantageous ends. The Government's model of centralised control is based on a model of confrontation by its very determination to impose discipline from above in the belief that the failure to do so will result in chaos. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia can no longer afford this kind of buffoonery. The number of Australians who know that is increasing daily. We have heard a bit of talk tonight about the number of Australians who belong to trade unions in this country. I place on record the comment made by a trade union official to an acquaintance of mine the other day. He said that if the union movement cannot make itself more relevant-if we were to introduce compulsory, genuine voluntary unionism in this country-it would be lucky to hold 10 per cent of private sector work force. </PARA>
<PARA> The other day in this place the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) claimed in his contribution to a matter of public importance that much of our industrial relations problems could be traced to poor management. I think this is the other side of the coin. I want to touch on some of these issues tonight. I frankly think that he had a point, though I, in turn, would say that in our current plight that is all the more reason for us to do something about reforming the way we work and live out our lives in the workplace. Lord Nelson was reported to have once said to the King:</PARA>
<PARA>Give me decent lieutenants and I will build you a proper navy. </PARA>
<PARA>That is relevant for us to consider. I want to place on record some very interesting comments which were recorded by Ross Gittins in the Sydney Morning Herald last Monday morning. He quotes Dr Michael Deeley, boss of ICI Australia, who said:</PARA>
<PARA>We need to move from seeing employees as an undesirable and variable cost to seeing them as an important investment; as the key to improving performance through fully utilising their talents. For such a cultural shift to be successful, a company's policies and actions must reflect a change of attitude of management to its employees. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a need to move from a culture where employees are controlled, to one of commitment. This is where employees are trusted and empowered;-</PARA>
<PARA>not controlled from on top-</PARA>
<PARA>where management provides support and motivation by focusing on performance and outcome. In a workplace based on commitment, the individual will have a job that is flexibly defined and part of a comprehensive career structure . . . to problem-solving involving the company, its employees and their unions. </PARA>
<PARA> Our experience demonstrates that shared goals and values-combined with empowerment and trust-can create more productive workplaces, and benefit both the company and employees. Agreements negotiated at individual sites are the obvious products, but it is the process by which they are reached that is crucial. </PARA>
<PARA>I would assume that the first thing one could rule out in terms of that process to enterprise based agreements would be the Prime Minister's approach to the problems of the waterfront whereby the Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions have combined to bludgeon the life out of the employers until they agree. That is not enterprise based bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA> To conclude, it seems to me that we need to rethink as a matter of great urgency the way we work and pay ourselves in this country if we are to have a future. That is broadly acknowledged. No successful economy in the world has a centralised system like ours. It is true that Russia and China do have centralised systems and perhaps they could match our model. But they are hardly successful economies. Nor will we be until we start to show a little more maturity in this whole area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak tonight on the Industrial Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 1991. I was not too sure whether I was going to get the opportunity to do so. Of course, industrial relations is a very important issue to members on this side of the House. Our record since 1983 in the industrial relations arena is something of which we can be justly proud. That has been emphasised in this place today not only in this debate but also during Question Time and discussion on the matter of public importance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill specifically seeks to amend the Commonwealth Employees' Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988, known as the CERC Act, and the Remuneration Tribunal Act 1973, known at the RT Act. It also proposes certain consequential amendments to other legislation with the one exception to this being certain machinery amendments to the Cash Transaction Reports Act 1988. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to speak on one of the elements of the Bill which are of relevance to the many Commonwealth employees in my electorate of Oxley and, indeed, throughout Australia. While this legislation has something of a direct impact on Commonwealth employees, I would like to take this opportunity to give credit to the hundreds of Commonwealth employees in the Ipswich and west Moreton area working in Commonwealth Government departments and agencies such as the Australian Construction Services at the Amberley Royal Australian Air Force base, which is located just outside of the city of Ipswich. It is fitting, given the commitment of these men and women, that they are to be rewarded with the more flexible compensation arrangements that this Bill proposes. It is also appropriate that the scheme itself is to be amended accordingly to facilitate more effective operation of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to turn to some other elements of industrial relations. As I mentioned at the start of my speech, the advances follow the equitable industrial relations thrust that has become a hallmark of this Government-a direction that has brought great benefits to the workers of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Against this commitment, we have seen the Opposition come out over the years with many variations of what is essentially the same thing-and that is a plan that would erode the lifestyles and values of the average Australian and certainly the average Australian family. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been some weeks now since we have heard the latest variation of the coalition's draconian industrial relations agenda. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) has put on record that he is so committed to the implementation of the Opposition's enterprise bargaining arrangements that the Opposition would be prepared to subject the Australian people to a double dissolution if, after the election of a coalition government, the reforms were knocked back in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I read in today's paper that the Premier of New South Wales has indicated his policy and attitudes to the people of New South Wales. Hopefully, the people of New South Wales will take note of what he is offering. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to quote from an interview that was conducted between the Opposition spokesman for industrial relations and Matthew Abraham on Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio on Thursday, 21 February this year. In that interview the Opposition spokesman clearly spelt out what the coalition would do to the industrial relations framework if it were lucky enough to be elected to office. After the poor performance that we have seen day after day from members of the Opposition, the people of Australia will certainly find out at some time the shallowness of their policies. In that interview, the honourable member for Bennelong said:</PARA>
<PARA>We would put up our industrial relations legislation immediately a change of government took place, and if it were blocked in the Senate, it would be back again in three months, and I would be saying to the new Government, in the event of it being rejected again, that it should seek a double dissolution because reform of the industrial relations system is not only necessary in its own right but it is the absolute cornerstone of the economic reform program that we have. </PARA>
<PARA>As I mentioned before, the Premier of New South Wales is making the same sorts of threats to the people of New South Wales. I can assure honourable members opposite that this dictatorial attitude is not the way to go about industrial relations reform and will certainly not win favour with the Australian electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> It is rather interesting to note that during the recent Labour Day celebrations in Queensland the chairman of the local chamber of commerce made an attack on workers in which he advocated taking away from them this one day that they celebrated each year. He is also on record as saying that workers should be required to go back to working 45 hours a week as well as foregoing maternity leave and leave loadings-you name it, anything that has been of benefit to workers over the last 100 years. This man wants to take us back 100 years. I have received outstanding support for what I have been doing for the people of my electorate. I take this opportunity to thank them and my local trades and labour council for the support that they have given me in my efforts to highlight to the people of my electorate the draconian attitude that was expounded by the chairman of the local chamber of commerce, who obviously has been reading Liberal Party policy papers. </PARA>
<PARA> In that same interview, the honourable member for Bennelong went on to describe the industrial relations framework as `the total linchpin' and `the tent pole' of the economic picture. I must say that I concur with the honourable member on this point. However, when it comes to providing the best system to make our industries internationally competitive, I am glad that I am on this side of the House, sitting with those who truly represent the workers of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Opposition's spokesman implies that the industrial relations differences between the Opposition and the Government are the linchpin of economic policy, he is dead right. What is highlighted here is the fundamental difference between the Government's unprecedented success in achieving predictable and sustainable wage outcomes and the Opposition's complete lack of a policy in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard all the rhetoric about enterprise bargaining and profit sharing. But I ask honourable members opposite to look at the reality behind their blurred vision of ideals and come up with real alternatives if they believe the Government's modus operandi is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> What employers want is to be able to budget for long term decisions and an integral part of that is to know how much they will need to allow for wage increases in coming years. And that is exactly what employers have been delivered through the wages and incomes accord since 1983. It has everything to do with a wages policy and obviously those opposite have no idea of what a wages policy is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> The accord means that when any Australian employer wants to know how much he needs to allow for wage increases in, for instance, 1991, the answer is contained in the proposals in the accord. Under the Opposition plan, there would be 1,001 different wage outcomes for 1,001 different companies, making it impossible to set any national wage goals, let alone achieve them. </PARA>
<PARA> There has also been the recent obsession within the Liberal Party with a consumption tax. This highlights the ignorance on the other side of the House of the wage-tax equation. Today we heard the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) speak about the effects that a consumption tax would have on inflation in this country. The Liberal consumption tax plan is riddled with social inequities. We need only look at the figures to see the enormous gap that would develop between the rich and the poor under the tax regime proposed by those members opposite. A consumption tax and its accompanying impacts on inflation would have particular dire effects for low income earners. </PARA>
<PARA> When speaking in this House earlier this session on taxation legislation, I made reference to the specific implications of such a tax. Given the relevance of those remarks to the broader industrial picture, I feel that they are worth noting again. Based on a consumption tax of only 10 per cent-we do not know the actual percentage that the Opposition is speaking about but I have heard figures mentioned of up to 15 and 20 per cent-people on an income of $18,000 a year would get a tax cut of $2.05 a week but because of a 9 per cent increase in prices, their net take-home pay would be $22.43 a week less. People on incomes of $45,000 a year would take home an extra $17.85 a week while at the higher end of the wage scale those on incomes of $125,000 a year would end up $259 a week better off. The lesson here is simple: the higher the wage, the higher the benefit under a consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA> In contrast with this, the Hawke Government has provided genuine commitment to making sure Australian workers get a fair deal through a wages system that also provides predictable outcomes by which clear economic directions can be set. For example, when we look at the case of people on an income of $18,000 a year, we find that such people have benefited under the 1 January tax cuts afforded to them by the stability of the accord-a tax cut of $4.15 a week, equivalent to a pre-tax wage rise of $5.95 a week, without the 9 per cent inflation that would accompany the Liberal alternative, the consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard all the allegations by the Opposition that a consumption tax was talked about by the Government in 1985, but again they have missed the point. The Government's intention was to use it as a means of reducing the pay-as-you-earn tax scales, something that we have been able to achieve without a consumption tax. I remind honourable members opposite that this has been largely due to the success of the wages and incomes accord, through the stability it has provided in delivering predictable wage outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us not forget that it is what ends up in the hip pocket at the end of the week that matters most to our workers. As exemplified by the case I have just mentioned, the Government recognises this. The Opposition clearly does not. I am sorry to disappoint honourable members opposite, but their jigsaw of suggestions to make the Australian machine work better just will not fit together. </PARA>
<PARA> I also take this opportunity to put on record my complete disdain for the Opposition's support for extended trading hours for the service sector. Its position on this issue is deplorable. In the same Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio interview to which I have just referred, the honourable member for Bennelong again said that the Opposition policy on this issue will be to leave it to people to `make their own agreements without the interference of the Industrial Relations Commission or the trade union movement, in a veto sense, and that they can decide that penalty rates will go'. That is another attack on the workers. </PARA>
<PARA> The people of Australia should also be aware that the Opposition views penalty rates in service industries as ridiculous and as being the sort of thing that ought to go. The workers of Australia should know these points, because penalty rates are the only small incentive and compensation afforded to low income earners for the irregular hours that they are asked to work. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Opposition forgets is that the type of people who would be affected by such a move are the low income earners. We are not talking about the high fliers who are sitting pretty on their $50,000-plus annual salaries. In this argument, the Opposition is talking about people on very average incomes, who rely heavily on overtime and penalty rates to make ends meet, and who rely on their leave loading just to have their holiday once a year. Imagine the effects of taking away the leave loading on our tourist industry! From surveys I have seen, I know that the leave loading is one of the areas that is most supported by families, and it has an impact. Families benefit greatly from it and it has been extremely popular. I would like to see the honourable member for Bennelong get by on an income of $15,000 or $18,000 a year with a family of three children without the benefit of a few penalty rates. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also the issue of family values and how they would be eroded under such regimes. What of the children in families where both parents work in service industries? If the Opposition had its way, most of those children would grow up rarely seeing both their parents at the same time. The concession by the honourable member for Bennelong that our 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week society requires services to be provided around the clock shows total disregard for the rights of families working in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> In contrast, the Government has demonstrated both its consistency and commitment to implementing industrial relations initiatives which have genuine regard for employees. I have probably overstepped the mark a little bit and gone a bit too far. In conclusion, while this legislation--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I have in the chamber three students visiting the Parliament from my electorate. They are all visiting the national capital for the first time and are part of my annual scholarship offered to senior high school students within my electorate. They are the twenty-ninth, thirtieth and thirty-first students to participate in this program since 1983.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The three are Jeni Evans, a year 11 student from Geraldton Senior High School; Mark Ralph, a year 10 student from Christian Brothers Agricultural School, Tardun; and Nathan Morgan, a year 12 student from St Patricks College, Geraldton. I take this opportunity to thank Ansett Airlines of Australia and Australian Airlines Ltd for their assistance in transporting these students to Canberra. All three are my guests so that they can learn at first hand the operations of this Parliament and visit some of the points of interest in Canberra. Geraldton is the major centre for all three students, although the Christian Brothers college at Tardun is some 140 kilometres from Geraldton. It is always part of this arrangement that my guests prepare a speech for me to deliver to the Parliament, and I will now proceed to do just that. Jeni says:</PARA>
<PARA>Geraldton Senior High School was founded in 1939 and it was the first secondary school to be built for the Geraldton region. The highlight of the school calendar is our annual Founder's Ball, where both students and teachers join in on the celebrations. </PARA>
<PARA> Our motto is `The Seeker Finds' which is a form of encouragement and a promise of reward; when the going gets tough, the motto is an incentive to try harder. Our Headmaster is Mr Tom Tuffin. Music and sport play a large part in our school and in the region in general. Geraldton Senior is justifiably proud of its own school band and choir. </PARA>
<PARA> We produce our own school newspaper which is distributed throughout the community. Our school is fortunate to have the support and encouragement of our local businesses. Geraldton Senior has an enrolment of 1,042 students, 130 of whom reside at our two hostels-Dellahale and John Frewer House. These students come from as far north as Wyndham and as far east as the Northern Territory border, encompassing many of the mining towns in the north-west. </PARA>
<PARA>Mark's contribution is to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Tardun Agricultural School was originally an orphanage right up until about 1960. In 1963 Tardun had no orphans and was just a school farm and it now assumes its present role as an agricultural school from years 8 to 10. The school can cater for up to 90 students and is set in 13,000 hectares of land running wheat, sheep and cattle. </PARA>
<PARA> Tardun offers an extra two subjects including farm practice and agricultural science. This includes working on the farm and learning about animal husbandry, also horse mastership. </PARA>
<PARA>The shadow Minister at the table, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), would be pleased to know that I have already tried to inveigle Mark into being an apprentice jockey. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Tardun is run by the Christian Brothers and is situated in the northern wheat belt, 460 kilometres north of Perth and 140 kilometres east of Geraldton. Our Headmaster is Brother Peter O'Driscoll. Although boarding at Tardun, I come from Kalbarri, a small town along the coast at the mouth of the 600 kilometres long Murchison River. It was named after a famous tribesman from the Murchison Aborigines. The present population of Kalbarri would be around the 2,000 mark.</PARA>
<PARA> Kalbarri's main occupations would be crayfishing/fishing and work on the fishing boats operating along the coast; shops also offer a lot of jobs based on the tourist industry. Kalbarri is surrounded by national park and during the wild flower season this is a big tourist attraction as well as the spectacular gorges. Kalbarri has mainly good weather, and it is also a popular holiday spot for tourists.</PARA>
<PARA>Nathan, who is the Head Prefect at St Patricks College, says:</PARA>
<PARA>My family has lived in Geraldton for several years and I am presently in my final year at St Patricks College which is a boarding and day secondary school conducted by the Christian Brothers for boys from the Kimberleys in the north to the gold fields in the south. The Principal is Brother John Murray who attended the college as a youth and has seen vast improvements [since his return] to the school. </PARA>
<PARA> This year in our boarding houses we have an inclusion of several students from Thailand which is an example of St Patricks' reputation. St Patricks is only one of the many education institutions in Geraldton. </PARA>
<PARA> Geraldton is the educational hub of the mid-West and although opportunities are available for tertiary and technical education, we fall short on the opportunities and amenities available in the city. Students, like myself, who plan to go to university and further their education must leave their friends and family and move to the city. Being the centre of a rapidly expanding and progressive community, we would like to see more funds made available for the extension of these services. </PARA>

<SPEECH PAGE="3837" SPEAKER="Hollis Mr C." NAMEID="DH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="THROSBY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Throsby)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(7.36 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For as long as I have been a member of Parliament I have argued, ably assisted by my colleague the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin), for a replacement road for the notorious Macquarie Pass. Anyone who cares to go through the copies of Hansard will see speech after speech by me, and I have beaten a path to successive Ministers of transport pleading with them for a replacement road.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The site has been selected, land acquired and various studies carried out. The only hurdle to the construction of this road, which would be totally funded under the Federal Government's rural and provincial road program, is the stubbornness of the current temporary Liberal Government in New South Wales to give it a high priority. Some two years ago in this Parliament I asked: do we have to wait for a major accident to occur before the road will be built? Do we have to have a bus go over Macquarie Pass? How many lives have to be lost?</PARA>
<PARA> I have warned about the deterioration and dangerous state of Macquarie Pass for years. However, nothing has been done while the road has continued to deteriorate. Today there was a serious accident on Macquarie Pass, which has been blocked for 13 hours subsequently. A truck's brakes failed on the top hairpin bend. Miraculously, no lives were lost. </PARA>
<PARA> I again appeal to the New South Wales Government to overcome its mad desire to punish the Illawarra, to stop neglecting the Illawarra, to give this road the high priority it deserves and to stop playing with the lives of the people of the Illawarra. How many more lives must be lost on this road before the New South Wales Government will give it this necessary priority? I must say that, in the roads policy of the Australian Labor Party in New South Wales, there is a guarantee that Caloola Pass would receive high priority to ensure its immediate funding, and the road would be built. </PARA>
<PARA> This reluctance by the Liberals to give this road the necessary priority does not stop New South Wales Ministers from claiming the credit for federally funded roads. Two years ago the Berrima bypass was completed at a cost of $80m-and there was the State Minister in attendance at the opening ceremony. Shame on him! Work is proceeding on the Mittagong bypass which will, by its completion in December 1992, have cost some $98m. Some 12 months ago, residents from Hilltop came to see me with a problem regarding the north facing ramps on the Alpine Interchange. I inspected the area with them-I know that the honourable member for Macarthur is familiar with it-and I made very successful representations to the Federal Minister about the ramps. The Minister agreed that they could be included in the works, but the local Liberal member was not interested. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, as some people might be aware, shortly there will be an election in New South Wales, and-surprise, surprise-the Roads and Traffic Authority of New South Wales last week ordered work on the ramps to be speeded up so that the State Liberal member for Southern Highlands could open the ramps yesterday. I learnt about this quite by accident only late last week and, when I inquired about it, was told that the opening could not be delayed for me to attend this Friday, and the State member would perform the opening ceremony. It was pointed out that not one cent of State Government money had been put into this project and that, as the local Federal member, I should have at least been invited. </PARA>
<PARA> I was told that if I could be there on Tuesday morning I could attend. That is very generous of them! This is almost on a par with the Mittagong Chamber of Commerce holding a seminar two weeks ago about the bypass, and addressed by the same State member, to which I was also not invited. The current New South Wales Government has a tendency to put its State signs on all Federal projects on the national highway. Anyone who goes through Goulburn will see--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Simmons" NAMEID="FJ4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DH4">Mr HOLLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Anywhere, as the Minister at the table has said. They will see a sign proclaiming that it is a New South Wales project. The Goulburn bypass is a federally funded project to the tune of $98m. Recently, in the electorate of my colleague the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin), the State Government was claiming credit for the Picton Road overpass, funded by the Federal Government at a cost of approximately $48m or $49m. And it did not contribute one cent to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I make this appeal to the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) because it is obvious the New South Wales Government will put no money into Caloola Pass: for the sake of lives in the Illawarra, please directly fund this road. Caloola Pass will not be built while the New South Wales Liberals are in government. Our only hope of having that road built lies in having a Labor Government returned at the forthcoming State election in New South Wales. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It certainly is. They came here to witness and to learn the parliamentary processes. They were here at Question Time. What they saw was a government which would not accept responsibility for its actions; a government which would not accept responsibility for the policies that it has deliberately engineered to bring about this recession. They saw a government that would not accept responsibility for the high unemployment rate-now 844,000 people in this country without a job. They saw a government which will not accept responsibility for people losing their businesses, their farms, their homes or, tragically, for families who are now splitting asunder owing to the tremendous financial pressures that people are faced with because of these deliberate policies of this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These students, who come from a small rural town in Victoria, know exactly what it is like to live through a recession. But in case members of the Government present are not aware of what it is like to lose a home, a business or a job, let me tell them what it is like, in the words of a rural counsellor who works with people on a day-to-day basis. She said that, first, there is denial, then restlessness, loss of sleep, then anger, hostility, and resentment. She said these are the emotions that produce violence in families, and that violence in families is ever increasing in this recession, as is the rate of suicide, especially in rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA> What those students also saw today in this Government was the difference between reality and what it engages in on a daily basis-rhetoric. This goes on not just today; it has been going on day after day, year after year. Let me take honourable members back to the now famous statement made by the Treasurer (Mr Keating)-his `banana republic' statement made on 14 May 1986 when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Politics is the clearing-house of pressures, and in the clearing-house one has got to get the right policy through. That is what the job of being a Treasurer or Prime Minister is all about; it is about delivery. </PARA>
<PARA>What exactly has this Government delivered? It has delivered a recession. It has delivered high unemployment. It has delivered high foreign debt. It has delivered a high current account deficit. It has delivered misery on a scale that has not been seen in this country since the 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA> What does the Treasurer have to say about it? Just yesterday in this House when he was debating the matter of public importance, he said that Opposition members may think, `If only we can be lucky enough to inherit their creativity'. I cannot for the life of me understand the use of a word such as `creativity'. It is sheer absurdity. What has happened is that the Treasurer is starting to believe his own rhetoric. He is indulging in the most outrageous fantasy. </PARA>
<PARA> What the students also saw here today was a battle. It is a battle that we see every day between the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer. But those students, as representatives of young people and other people outside this place, are not interested in that battle-a battle of inept parliamentary performances by the Prime Minister or boastful arrogant performances by the Treasurer. What they, like every other Australian, are interested in is sound, stable and sensible policy-a change of policy which a simple change of leadership will not bring about because a change in the leadership of this Government will not accept responsibility for any of the policies that the Government has used to deliberately engineer this recession. People want a change of action, but they will have to wait until we occupy the Government benches. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey), who has just resumed her seat, might well look back to the behaviour and conduct of the Fraser Government during its period of office from 1975 to 1983 and see something of the pain, harm and ruthlessness of that Government in respect of people who could not find employment. If she is really concerned about the future of the students that she has referred to, she might point out to them the policies of the Opposition in respect of its attack upon welfare. She might point out that the main expenditure chops that it wants to make are in the area of welfare. She might point out the Opposition's attitude to education; or its policy of abolition of the support for unemployed people after nine months. I recommend that to her. She might then be able to hold herself in a much more upright fashion when she is talking to students. She might also mention to students the behaviour of the Opposition itself and the fact that, on a daily basis, it is very much like a rabble at Question Time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This evening I want to talk about the very fast train. There is a fascination in this country with great transport projects-whether they are big aeroplanes, big bridges, big trucks, big ships or big trains. They mesmerise many people. It seems the greater the scheme, the grander the vision and the more likely it is to mesmerise even the sceptics-people who, in normal circumstances, would apply a much tougher rule of assessment to such projects. </PARA>
<PARA> It amazes me how politicians fall for these kinds of projects. Somehow the Alice Springs to Darwin railway was considered to be a magnificent project which Australia should have-so they said. But the same people who are espousing those views are clamouring for reductions in Federal expenditure. That is just one example, and what examples such as that do is distract public attention and government attention from doing the things in transport which ought to be done; doing the things which will substantially improve productivity and efficiency. Improving transport efficiency is about doing the things that need to be done; it is not about dreams and visions. </PARA>
<PARA> As far back as the mid-1970s, the Bureau of Transport Economics submitted a report to this Parliament that showed that a very positive result would flow from the upgrading of the Melbourne to Sydney railway. Nothing happened, and a change of government occurred in 1975. In about 1979 Prime Minister Fraser wanted a great project to grab the public imagination-something that the people would really look up to. That project, you might remember, Mr Speaker, was the electrification of the Melbourne to Sydney railway line. But, like all other grand visions, it did not stand the economic test. It took some years until, eventually, the studies were carried out and they showed that it was economic nonsense so it did not proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> The result of it was that, again, attention was distracted from doing what ought to have been done then-that was, the upgrading of the Melbourne to Sydney line, the extending of the passing loops, the widening of the curves and the easing of the gradients. These measures would have provided a very positive return to the taxpayer and to the railway system. They would have halved the journey time, doubled the capacity, and contributed substantially to improved transport efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, on this basis, along came the very fast train (VFT) proposal in 1984, a magnificent project, a private sector project. It was going to take only twice as long as the air journey from Sydney to Melbourne. It did not need Government assistance, but it was promoted on the basis that the imprimatur of Government approval would make it easier to raise private capital. That proposal has changed to one that is now highly geared, with 80 per cent loan money and 20 per cent in equity, and seeking substantial taxpayer assistance of some $1.4 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> In considering this, does anyone seriously believe that by the time such a project was built it would be able to stand up to the competition of a deregulated aviation environment, where aviation would be providing greater services to Melbourne taking half the time of the VFT? The simple fact is that those who want to travel cheaply drive by private car. Those who want to get there in a hurry will go by air. There is no way that one can reasonably envisage that in the future the airline industry will stand by and see, as the VFT proponents claim, half of its traffic being diverted to a VFT. As to whether the project has commercial viability, that is a matter of commercial decision by those interested, and those interested ought to be promoting the project on a commercial basis and should keep their hands out of the taxpayer's pocket. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it somewhat amusing that the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) should have spoken tonight, because there is a certain analogy between Australia and the position of the honourable member for Shortland. As honourable members may well remember, he was dumped before the last election, and the very factions that dumped him have tended to dump Australia over the past seven years. I was going to speak about other matters tonight, but considering the comments that were made by my colleague the honourable member for McEwen (Mrs Bailey), I think I might pursue that area as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the leadership issue, what has happened over the past six months I believe is denigrating the Parliament, the Government and the country. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) should take the time to travel outside Canberra-and we have heard the Prime Minister threatening to go into the electorate of Isaacs whereby he would wreak havoc on the present Liberal member. However, I defy the Prime Minister to go to Isaacs, over a weekend. He would hear what the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson) hears every day of the week. What he is hearing is that people are heartily sick and tired of this Government's paralysis. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has shown over the past six months that it is totally incapable of undertaking proper decision making processes. As you know, Mr Speaker, and as we all know in this House, that is because of the leadership struggle that is going on at the moment. It is paralysing the Government. It is interesting to see the guillotine being introduced again this session. I am beginning to wonder whether that guillotine may well be part of the paralysis we are seeing as a result of this constant leadership challenge. </PARA>
<PARA> The corridors of this place are humming day in and day out. I actually feel quite sorry for the Labor Party backbenchers, because it must be extremely disruptive to the job that they are trying to do. I actually feel sorry for the Minister for Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons), who is at the table. I do not know which side of the fence he is on, but the way they are performing must be interfering with every single one of them. In some respects I feel a bit sorry for them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer is, without doubt, the most unpopular man in Australia at the moment-not necessarily because of the economy, but for various other reasons. One of those is his absolutely gross arrogance, which is evident on the television, in the newspapers and through the radio. I am heartily sick and tired of the crocodile tears that we see day in day out. I do not believe that he is genuinely concerned about the unemployed people in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not say the same about the Prime Minister because he does not cry crocodile tears; when he cries he actually means it. I think that he is, in some respects, sorry for what has happened. If he is constantly involved in looking over his shoulder, waiting for the stab in the back, it is impossible for him to perform the job of Prime Minister, as he was elected to do at the last Federal election. I plead with him either to dump the Treasurer or stand aside so that we can start seeing the Government operate as a government should. </PARA>
<PARA> I listened with interest to the Treasurer this afternoon talk about the fact that he felt for the poor. The reality is that he has started a new generation of the poor. He told us that he had his heart in the right spot and that his head was in the wrong spot. His heart, most definitely, is not in the right spot and I rather suspect that his head is not either. </PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer had the gall to come in here today and start talking about relative inflation figures. The honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards) addressed that question this afternoon. He gave us the real truth about the relative inflation figures for other countries in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development. Australia has nothing to brag about.</PARA>
<PARA> I say to the Minister at the table that I am extremely happy that that inflation figure is down. But let us not use that as an excuse for the pitiful economic mismanagement that we have seen over the last two years. It is not an excuse; it is a start. Tell that to the 840,000-odd people who are presently unemployed. I do not think that those people give a tinker's cuss, quite frankly, about the rhetoric and figures that we have heard from the Treasurer over the last two days to justify his economic position. The people of Ballarat are as heartily sick and tired of what is going on as I am. I am constantly telephoned and people come to my office--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We all know that the Liberal Party of Australia has a fanatical commitment to the user pays principle and the principle of cutting government services and expenditures. There is no unit of the Liberal Party more obsessive about these two concepts than the Government of New South Wales, led by Margaret Thatcher's most ardent disciple, Premier Greiner. That is why, in the face of election promises to the contrary, the election of the Greiner Government in 1988 saw a rash of increases in government fees and charges-from land tax to education expenses, from fuel tax and motor vehicle registration to traffic fines. There was no attempt to provide equity for the poor or underprivileged with increases of that sort. A privileged wealthy few were given land tax and stamp duty concessions. One privileged group received a concession in land tax of $80m. We saw the unemployed, the pensioners, handicapped people and families bear the brunt of it all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my electorate, the cruelest impost was the huge increase in railway fares. Robertson is a commuter electorate with many thousands of workers travelling for over an hour into the city each day. The electorate also has many pensioners who travel off-peak either to the city or on excursions. The lives of these commuters and pensioners were difficult enough already without their train fares being hiked up by huge amounts-in one instance, by 18 per cent. These amounts were far in excess of the consumer price index. </PARA>

Just as in 1988, when he promised that there would be no fare increases and then immediately reneged and hiked fares far in excess of inflation, I am informed by the Australian Railways Union that the Greiner Government already has in place secret plans not only to increase fares yet again but also to reduce services to the central coast of New South Wales. The Greiner Government has a secret timetable, which has already been prepared and approved, which virtually decimates off-peak train travel to the central coast. </PARA>
<PARA> If Greiner wins the election, trains will only run every two hours from most stations and hourly from the major stations in place of the 30-minute service that we have enjoyed for a long time. Not only will that occur, but the whole railway system will be closed down at 10 p.m. every night until 5 a.m. the next morning. People who want to travel at that time will have to catch a bus. Catching a bus to the central coast is not convenient. </PARA>
<PARA> As if the train travellers do not have enough complaints already, with the late running of trains on the central coast, which is notorious, with the many breakdowns that occur between Hawkesbury River and Cowan, causing many people to be delayed-in these hard times, some of them have lost their jobs because of the constant delays-and with the many signal faults that occur with monotonous regularity that travellers also have to put up with, the Greiner Government is now going to phase-out the inter-urban carriages. My constituents enjoy the inter-urban carriages; they are very nice and they have toilets in them. When one is travelling for well over an hour-the delays that occur are sometimes for several hours-it is nice to have a toilet. The Greiner Government is going to replace the inter-urban carriages with the ordinary electric carriages from the city system. That, of course, is something that the pensioners, in particular, will find very difficult to cope with, as will the other commuters. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the people of the central coast have a very obvious choice on 25 May: they can vent their justifiable anger at Mr Greiner and his Ministers for what they are doing to the railway system of New South Wales and vote for Bob Carr's team. That team, like the Labor Party in the past when in government, has given and will keep undertakings to maintain services; to limit fares to the consumer price index, which both the Wran and the Unsworth governments did; to retain inter-urban carriages; to create diversion loops between Woy Woy and Cowan so that breakdowns could be dealt with almost immediately instead of the hour which it takes now; to provide commuter car parks at Woy Woy and Gosford-that is a reality, because the Federal Government is funding it-to staff Narrawa Station so that people in that huge and rapidly developing area can actually buy train tickets in the morning, and to set up a commuter committee in the area so that commuters' needs are looked at. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The contract with Australian Marine Engineering Consolidated (AMECON) for the construction of the ten Anzac ships is on a lump sum basis. It is therefore not possible to identify separately all costs associated with the fitting of the 127mm gun.</PARA>
<PARA> The contract between the Commonwealth and FMC Corporation for the supply of the guns for all ten ships, together with associated spares and technical services is priced at $145 million (April 1988 prices).</PARA>
<PARA> The additional cost to the project of fitting the 127mm gun rather than the 76mm gun originally intended is $105 million (April 1988 prices) for the eight Australian ships. This amount includes up to $5 million in Australian Industry Assistance funding to cover tooling and startup costs to allow Australian manufacturers to compete on an equal basis with established overseas suppliers.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The contract with FMC includes Australian Content of approximately $34 million (April 1988 prices).</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The contract includes an obligation to achieve a further $33 million (April 1988 prices) of Defence offsets.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Each of the contending manufacturers original offers included greater local content but each required a substantial premium on the contract price to achieve this higher level. Since the work will utilise an existing industry capability but not provide any new capability, the payment of the premium could not be justified.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) See (4).</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The total industry program for the gun contract is $67 million or some 46% of the contract price. This could only have been increased if the Commonwealth was willing to pay substantial additional premiums to obtain the additional work. The $5 million of Industry Assistance funding referred to above was the maximum that could be justified by the nature of the work to be obtained.</PARA>
<PARA> The local content in the gun will be under sub-contracts awarded to Australian companies by FMC Corporation on the basis of competitive tendering. The Government will not influence the selection process to exercise a preference for Australian Defence Industries or any other company.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Both guns were assessed as acceptable against the RAN and RNZN performance criteria. The FMC gun was selected after a comprehensive evaluation of all factors.</PARA>
