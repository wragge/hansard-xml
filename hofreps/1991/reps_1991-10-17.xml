The absence of a Medicare office makes it difficult for us to use the national health scheme to its full potential. We experience lengthy delays in claiming rebates on doctors' accounts we have paid because we must either travel to other regional centres to make claims or send claim forms away by post and they must be processed. The system as it operates today encourages people to travel away from Benalla to other regional centres to make Medicare claims, taking important business with them, and we feel this is not in the best interests of our community.

<PARA>  The petition of the undersigned concerned citizens of the State of Queensland respectfully showeth that the Report of the Parliamentary Committee of Public Works of the Forty Sixth Parliament concerning its Inquiry into Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander housing--the Future, should be rejected on the following grounds:</PARA>
<PARA>  (1)  The Committee failed to adequately consult the Aboriginal and Islander people of Queensland in order to obtain their views by failing to advise details of existing guidelines for funding of housing, failing to adequately publicise the Committee Inquiry through the established Aboriginal and Islander networks.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2)  The terms of reference were unsatisfactory insofar as they do not address the vital issue of tenant ownership which creates no incentive for self-determination and not enough time was given for the communities to study the recommendations of the infrastructure on Aboriginal housing as addressed by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3)  Senior Administrator of the Department Housing and Local Government will be delegated the responsibility of expenditure of funds, reinforcing their existing mandate over administration and financial management and vetoing any decisions made by the Housing Advisory Council, who will be responsible to review and advise policy development and implementation and oversee the menial day to day activities such as:</PARA>
<PARA>      (a)  rent assessment</PARA>
<PARA>      (b)  tenancy neglect</PARA>
<PARA>      (c)  tenancy agreement based on cultural differences between land lord and tenant</PARA>
<PARA>      (e)  tenant unions.</PARA>
<PARA>  (4)  No Aboriginal housing trust as exists in other States under the Aboriginal Housing Rentals Program, will mean no economic base or self management for urban and rural blacks and will eventually mainstream tenants and homes, creating further funding under the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement and an endless financial resource institution for the Department of Housing and Local Government.</PARA>
<PARA>  Your petitioners therefore, humbly pray that the Members of the House of Representatives assembled in the Federal Parliament will intervene on our behalf to prevent the State Government from passing legislation through this Report at the Queensland Parliament sitting. We pray the Federal Parliament will act on our behalf because of the Commonwealth/State Housing Agreement and that the Federal Government direct the State to hold further consultations with the Aboriginal and Islander people of Queensland so that a report may be tabled which genuinely addresses the housing needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people of Queensland.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-On behalf of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the Committee's report entitled Report on the Visit of the Defence Subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to Adelaide July 1991.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OG4">Mr LINDSAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In July, the Defence Subcommittee inspected defence facilities in the Adelaide area. These inspections were made in accordance with the tradition of the Defence Subcommittee of conducting familiarisation visits for its members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Subcommittee visited RAAF Edinburgh where it was briefed on the surveillance role of the long range maritime patrol aircraft, the P3C Orions. The visit afforded members the opportunity to gain first-hand knowledge of the patrol's search and rescue function. Members were able to gain some appreciation of the equipment used in carrying out search and rescue, particularly in light of the attempted rescue of the crew of the yacht Rockin' Robin last year. Through discussions with the Commander Maritime Patrol Group, Air Commodore Stafford James AFC, we were also able to obtain a better understanding of the events surrounding the loss of the Orion aircraft in the Cocos Islands. </PARA>
<PARA>  The visit fulfilled its aim of keeping members up to date with developments in technology and defence equipment. The Subcommittee inspected a P3C Orion at RAAF Edinburgh. It was briefed on the aircraft's computer based sensor system, the Barra sonobuoy and the AGM84 Harpoon missile. This was complemented by a briefing at DSTO on the project for the refurbishment of the Orion. </PARA>
<PARA>  At RAAF Edinburgh we were also interested to ascertain the percentages of aircraft that were undergoing maintenance and were `on line' at any given time. We gained a clear understanding of the nature of the maintenance program and of the tests conducted on, for example, the FA18 Hornet and the Black Hawk helicopter by the Aircraft Research and Development Unit. </PARA>
<PARA>  During the visit to the Defence Science and Technology Organisation we were briefed on the impact of the force structure review on DSTO and the approach adopted by the organisation to accommodate the changes to its operations. We also received briefings on a number of major projects in train at the DSTO, such as DORIC, the Kariwara towed array project and the support provided by DSTO to Operation Damask during the Gulf war. We were also interested in DSTO's task of adapting the RBS70 missile system for shipboard use, particularly as our visit to Adelaide included an inspection of the RBS70 at Woodside Barracks. </PARA>
<PARA>  At Woodside the Subcommittee appreciated the opportunity to inspect closely both the RBS70 missile system and the Rapier Fire Unit missile system which had been set up for the occasion. Members of the Subcommittee are concerned that the number of Rapiers held by 110 Air Defence Battery is insufficient to defend more than one vital asset or one airfield in northern Australia at a given time. We were also concerned to learn that the number of missiles available for use by 110 Battery is inadequate for proving the ability of the equipment to fire. We were told that 111 Air Defence Battery (Light) also suffers from receiving insufficient numbers of RBS70 missiles for proving its equipment. The Battery receives an allocation of only six missiles per year. </PARA>
<PARA>  Whilst in Adelaide we inspected the submarine project plan at the Australian Submarine Corporation's plant at Osborne. The inspection complemented another element of the Subcommittee's program; that is, of receiving briefings on aspects of defence support at our regular meetings in Canberra. Earlier this year the Managing Director of the Submarine Corporation addressed members on the submarine project. We were therefore interested to monitor progress on the construction of the submarine fleet. </PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, the visit provided members of the Subcommittee with opportunities for informal discussions with Defence Force personnel. One such occasion was arranged at Keswick Barracks, where discussions with Regular and Reserve personnel from Headquarters 4 Military District, 9 Brigade and 4 Training Group proved most productive. I thank the officers and personnel for that particular meeting. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I want to say a few words on three aspects of this report. The first is that I was concerned that in our visit to Elizabeth we found that the funds available and the problems associated with long range maritime patrol aircraft, the P3C Orion, are getting to a point where there are going to be difficulties in the future. I think most of us have been conscious that the American production has run out and there are going to be difficulties in maintaining what has been an outstanding aircraft in the long range maritime patrol task.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The nature of the funding changes to our Australian Defence Force imposes disciplines which, of course, mean that no individual sector can be isolated from them. I had not been aware of some of the problems associated with the continued maintenance of the P3C. I urge the Australian Defence Force to maintain sufficient funding to ensure that it can continue its duties. </PARA>
<PARA>  The second area that I want to briefly mention is ARDU, the Aircraft Research and Development Unit. There is no doubt that the work undertaken there is outstanding. The aspects of testing and maintaining to the highest possible degree both the technical standards of aircraft in service within the RAAF and the degree to which they can be extended beyond their present bounds by way of add-on equipment, adapting existing equipment and technical devices to them, are really quite important if we are going to get the best value out of the defence dollar. </PARA>
<PARA>  Over the years, ARDU has done on outstanding job. I was very interested to see the current tests under way with the FA18 Hornet and the Black Hawk helicopter and also some tests that are prescribed for the PC9 and CT4. It has always seemed to me to be unfortunate that we cannot use to a greater degree the general services and facilities there, in conjunction with the requirements for the private sector. The capacity is there and I would hope that at some stage it might be possible to use it more. </PARA>
<PARA>  The third area, and the most important, concerns the Defence Science and Technology Organisation. I do not think many Australians realise the sophistication and capability of DSTO. It is the prime research unit for the Services; it has an outstanding record; and many achievements have been recorded to its credit. </PARA>
<PARA>  I was most concerned to find that, in the nature of the cuts now being imposed, there is likely to be a serious reduction in its capability. No body, whether public or private, can ensure continuity. I would not suggest that an area of the Defence Force should be more immune from funding scrutiny than any other field of the public sector. But I am most concerned that, as far as DSTO is concerned, the result of the changes include reducing the civilian staff by some 700 personnel. It seems that as a result some of the highest priorities of research are likely to be seriously prejudiced. Indeed, we were told that some might be jeopardised altogether. I do not believe that is in the interests of Australia. I am sure it is not in the interests of Australia's defence preparedness. </PARA>
<PARA>  I strongly recommend that the ADF have a look at some of those at `Fort Fumble', at the headquarters of the Australian Defence Force. I see a greater capacity to reduce numbers there at the moment. I believe that we would do much better in areas of research and development were we to ensure maintenance of some technical capability, which in due course flows back to the private sector, than if we were to maintain the services of those who are merely pen-pushers and maintaining the administrative services in the defence headquarters in this city. </PARA>
<PARA>  For that reason I was most concerned about the visit. I trust that the ADF and certainly the Government register that what it is doing is to a large degree jeopardising skills that are irreplaceable. I am appalled at the consequences and trust that the matter will be examined. I hope that the numbers will in no way be allowed to be so reduced that the threat, which we were told would jeopardise the highest priority areas of research, is in fact realised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-This is the first time a parliamentary committee has prepared a comprehensive report on the Australian economy. The report entitled Australia's Current Account Deficit and Overseas Debt not only contains an excellent description and analysis of Australia's position with regard to its current account deficit and overseas debt, but also considers issues that go to the heart of the economic policy debate in our country. Its recommendations are designed to comprehensively address the current account deficit in ways which would also reduce unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Current account deficits have been a feature of most of Australia's economic history. Over the 1980s, however, there has been a marked increase in the relative size of that deficit. At the beginning of the decade the deficit was less than 4 per cent of gross domestic product. By the end of the decade it had risen to around 6 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  There was also a radical change in the nature of the current account deficit during the decade. At the beginning of the 1980s the current account deficit reflected primarily a trade deficit. By the end of the decade the current account deficit was overwhelmingly dominated by our foreign debt servicing obligations. By international standards, Australia's current account deficit, as a proportion of GDP, is amongst the highest of any Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development country. </PARA>
<PARA>  The current account deficit fell to 4 per cent in 1990-91 and the recent continuing decline is heartening. The improvement in Australia's export performance, particularly in relation to the growth in manufacturing exports, is particularly welcome. The decline in imports, however, has been marginal and the situation concerning our debt service obligations and other income payments overseas has improved to an even smaller degree, despite the severity of the current recession. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee is concerned that the current account deficit will again return to high levels as Australia comes out of the recession. Unless concerted action is taken to address the underlying causes of Australia's high current account deficit, imports and foreign investment in Australia are likely to return to pre-recession levels. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is considerable risk that Australia could become complacent about the current account deficit because of the reduction in its size over the past year. It must be remembered, however, that it has taken a very severe recession to halt the growth in imports and that further declines in imports cannot be expected once the recession eases. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australia's overseas debt also grew sharply during the 1980s increasing more than tenfold to over $145 billion by 1989. It now stands at $165 billion, almost 44 per cent of our GDP. While Australia's overseas debt has not yet reached the crisis proportions evident in some countries, it would certainly do so by the end of the 1990s if its debt accumulation were to continue unabated at the rate we have experienced, particularly in the mid-1980s. </PARA>
<PARA>  In responding to the problems identified in the report, the Committee has rejected the calls made in some quarters for a return to protectionist policies and regulatory controls. In our view, such a course of action would only serve to reduce Australia's ability to adjust to changing global circumstances. Ultimately, a failure to make the necessary adjustments would reduce the living standards of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>  Equally, the Committee has rejected the view that the growing current account deficit and overseas debt is no longer a problem requiring government action, as this debt has been largely incurred--so it said--by the private sector which is responsible for its repayment. While those who have incurred the debt are individually responsible for its servicing and repayment, there can be no question that Australia's vulnerability to global economic changes will be greater if debt accumulation continues unabated. </PARA>
<PARA>  The market has clearly failed to respond adequately to the situation. In the Committee's view, in the interests of efficiency and equity it is therefore essential for the Government to take the lead. </PARA>
<PARA>  Against this background, the Committee has recommended a package of proposals designed to comprehensively address Australia's current account and overseas debt problems. The three main thrusts to these proposals are:  first, to improve Australia's international trading performance through further reductions in tariff and other universal protectionist measures while the same time implementing a comprehensive package of positive measures to assist the development of Australia's export and import replacement industries, particularly those adding value to our exports; second, to introduce a range of measures designed to increase domestic savings and reduce Australia's reliance on overseas borrowings to finance investment; and, third, to put in place a set of appropriate macro-economic policy settings and necessary micro-economic reforms that are consistent with lowering the current account deficit and levels of overseas debt. </PARA>
<PARA>  Amongst these recommendations are that real interest rates be reduced so as to encourage investment and also a fall in the exchange rate. There are also recommendations for targeted increases in outlays and reductions of taxation which would simultaneously stimulate growth of exports and growth of employment so reducing unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>  The suggested increases in outlays include technical and higher education to improve the skills of the work force, increased outlays on research and development to enhance the dynamism of the Australian economy and to improve the efficiency and extent of our infrastructure of transport and communication in which investment has been declining as a proportion of national income for about 15 years. The proposed tax cuts include an accelerated depreciation allowance for those enterprises adding value to exports or replacing imports. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am confident that, if implemented, the Committee's recommendations will create the climate and conditions necessary to bring about substantial and sustained reductions in Australia's current account deficit and the level of our overseas debt. I urge the Government to quickly accept and implement the recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA>  This inquiry was carried out by the Trade Subcommittee of the Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade Committee and I am very grateful to my colleagues on the Subcommittee for their contribution to this challenging task, particularly the honourable member for Berowra (Mr Harry Edwards), the right honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson), the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), Senator Chapman, Senator Beahan and Senator Childs. </PARA>
<PARA>  I also wish to thank the staff associated with the inquiry: Jane Vincent, the Secretary to the Subcommittee for most of the time of the Committee hearings; our advisers Greg Barrett, Tom Fitzgerald and especially Chris Robinson for his excellent analysis and fine drafting; Margaret Brown, Toni Young and Lesley Cowan who provided administrative support and Jennifer Blood who took over as Secretary towards the end.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-While agreeing with much of what the Subcommittee Chairman, the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), has just said, the Opposition members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade have subscribed to a minority report at pages 141 to 153 of the printed version of the report. The minority report is very brief and the major part comprises an extract from the current Treasury Budget Paper No. 1. Of this, we say in the report that it:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . examines developments in the 1980s; puts the case for relating economic policy more to the medium term; and spells out a comprehensive package of policy and reform, notably labour market and microeconomic reform--to which we would add tax reform--to achieve sustained low inflation economic and employment growth, rising living standards and--</PARA>
<PARA>I stress the `and'--</PARA>
<PARA>a reducing current account deficit as specified in the terms of reference. It stresses the importance of making significant progress simultaneously on all policy fronts. </PARA>
<PARA>We chose to include this extract because in a situation in which we felt some dissatisfaction with the Chairman's draft, constraints of time and resources prevented us from producing a comprehensive report of our own. </PARA>
<PARA>  The difficulties we faced included: one, a sense that the underlying analytical framework was inadequate; two, partly for this reason there was a surfeit of detailed information on some aspects, for example, merchandise trade, and almost nothing on others, for example, productivity; three, a range of questions of the sort people typically ask about the foreign `debt' are not explicitly addressed. I say now in parenthesis that I used quotation marks there and elsewhere in this speech to connote that I am referring to the total of net foreign liabilities, that is, equity as well as debt in the strict sense, which is arguably the proper focus for issues concerning the relationship of this country to foreign financiers. </PARA>
<PARA>  The fourth point is that the recommendations in the report are, in our view, excessively interventionist, not to say corporatist and not, in our view, justified by the weight and balance of the evidence presented to the Committee. As we state in the minority report:</PARA>
<PARA>In our view Australia needs urgently a comprehensive program of policy reform to effect fundamental change to boost national production, productivity, exports and savings. </PARA>
<PARA>We do not believe that this emphasis comes through in the Report. </PARA>
<PARA>  With reference to the analytical framework, as briefly as one can put it, this would surely be that an excessive current account deficit is basically due to two factors: first, inadequate domestic savings; and, second, inadequate international competitiveness. The first factor might more accurately be expressed as `sustained, too high domestic spending relative to our productive capacity'--to adopt the phrase of Mr Fred Argy, until recently the head of EPAC. That terminology has the advantage that it leads one to ask what were the major factors in the debt build up, whether it was excessive government spending, Budget deficits--I believe it was in the first half of the 1980s--excessive private consumption and/or very high investment, as it was, albeit much of it misdirected, in the second half of the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA>  The second factor, inadequate international competitiveness, puts the stress on reducing inflation and increasing productivity as fundamental to increasing competitiveness and thereby reducing the deficit in an appropriate macro-economic framework. It also counsels caution in focusing on the nominal exchange rate, as does the majority recommendation No. 19 on page 134 of the report. As the evidence indicated, the nominal exchange rate is virtually out of the authorities' control in the new era of high capital mobility with the integration of international capital markets and the disappearance of exchange controls. What is important for competitiveness and the balance between the tradeable and non-tradeable sectors is the real exchange rate. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another aspect of the analytical framework is the loose references to `reducing the current account deficit and the level of overseas debt'. The Treasury piece we have put forward as part of the minority report refers much more circumspectly to, `stabilising the debt to GDP ratio', which will prove difficult enough, but it is a comparatively modest objective as against reducing the actual level, at least where debt is read--as the average reader would understand it--as referring to our overall foreign liabilities, as I previously mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA>  To reduce the level of foreign liabilities would require the achieving of an actual surplus on the current account not just a reduction in the deficit. That will not happen in any foreseeable future with the net income payable overseas relentlessly mounting--the prospective balance of payments deficit, even for this deep recession year, is projected to be $14 billion, which adds in one form or another to foreign liabilities and further increases the income payable to foreigners. Thus there is no likelihood whatever of surplus in the current account enabling a reduction in the level. </PARA>
<PARA>  The second main point that I referred to above was that the report does not explicitly enough address the sorts of questions people often ask about the debt, such as: what actually brought about the large and rapid increase in the nation's indebtedness in the past eight to 10 years? There is the question that the Subcommittee Chairman referred to a moment ago, namely that it is often said that because a large proportion of the debt is private rather than public that the overseas debt is not a problem. Is that is a proper view?</PARA>
<PARA>  The issue I would particularly refer to is that within the general economic objective to generate sustainable low inflation, high employment economic growth, sufficient for rising living standards and to reduce the current account and to stabilise the debt ratio, what are the broad dimensions and over what period of years might this be attainable?  We include in our report at page 148 an excerpt of what the Treasury states, namely, that:</PARA>
<PARA>This will require a considerable period. </PARA>
<PARA>There have been a variety of projections and models, by EPAC and others, that might be looked at in this respect and the assumptions clarified and assessed. Without a formal model I would essay the following: there is something of a consensus that just to employ the work force increasing with population, we need growth in GDP of 3 1/4 per cent, say, 3 1/2 per cent over the medium term, to take up some of the existing unemployment. With imports increasing at much the same rate, a sustained increase in exports in the order of $4 billion each year for five or six years would be needed in order to effect the necessary transfer of resources to net exports to reduce the deficit to the more normal level of the order of 2 1/2 per cent of GDP which would stabilise the debt in terms of the net foreign liabilities to GDP ratio. </PARA>
<PARA>  To my knowledge at no time in the past has this country achieved such a consistent growth in net exports, that is, exports over and above imports, and in GDP. Perhaps that is why Standard and Poors are at it again as reported in the news earlier this morning! That underlines the magnitude of the challenge before us. As we say in the minority report, this country needs urgently an across-the-board program of reform to effect a fundamental change in attitudes, the law, institutions, attitudes to performance and work. We have to strive in every corner of the land for best international practice, and also reassert what one might call traditional individual and corporate morality. </PARA>
<PARA>  The process will be a long haul and it will not be easy. Fundamental change never is. But there is no other way. What is at stake is nothing less than an Australia in the future which is a dynamic, prosperous, responsible, compassionate society; a major player in this fast growing Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I initially wish to congratulate the Chairman of the Trade Subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), for his sustained efforts in bringing this report, Australia's Current Account Deficit and Overseas Debt, to fruition. I join with him in congratulating the staff for the efforts they have put in as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  We are all aware that this issue is not only a topic of discussion for major columnists and this Parliament, but within the Australian electorate it is also obviously of great importance. It is increasingly being perceived as the crucial element in a variety of Government policies in other sectors. </PARA>
<PARA>  To summarise the report, it advocates further tariff reductions and an end to universal protectionist operations. At the same time it advocates positive measures to enhance export and import substitution areas, especially in the value added sectors. Also, it advocates the development of domestic savings to lessen our dependence upon overseas borrowings for major investment requirements, and it sets an appropriate macro-economic policy setting and micro-economic reforms. A crucial ingredient is a reiteration of the need for Government involvement in these decisions--that the Government should play a leading role. That is probably the crucial area of difference between the majority and minority views in this report. </PARA>
<PARA>  There were 72 submissions to the inquiry, coming from the Reserve Bank, the private sector, the unions, et cetera, and I think it would be acknowledged by all that a large number of those were of a high quality. The accent was on what is, as I say, a crucial problem facing the country. Our current account deficit has averaged about 5 per cent over the decade, which compares to a figure of 2 per cent only for gross domestic product over the previous three decades. Throughout this report various aspects of that debt are dealt with. As has been stated by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards), there may not have been enough concentration on productivity problems in this country and there could be quibbling over other aspects of its emphasis, but I would say that the work overall does present a summary of statistical material. However much one disagrees with some of the conclusions, the material included in it certainly provides a firm basis for analysis. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I indicated, and as everyone realises, the current account deficit has deteriorated over the 1980s. Not only has this been a traditional problem for this country, but the serious fact is that it has deteriorated even further over this period. At the same time we see an overseas debt of $165 billion, which now represents 44 per cent of our gross domestic product. Whilst exports have remained as the same percentage of gross domestic product, having hardly moved since the 1950s, there has been a sustained reduction in the value of rural exports. But at the same time transformed manufactures, by 1987, still constituted only 11 per cent of our exports. I think that is one of the problems that does appear from the report. </PARA>
<PARA>  At the same time, it is emphasised that the relativity in prices received by the tradeable sector--that is, that sector that competes with imports and is oriented towards export industries--has moved from 102.3 per cent in 1980-81 to over 147 per cent in the December quarter of 1990. That is another factor that the report takes up in its conclusions. The commodities trade balance has moved up by 7 1/2 per cent of GDP, but the manufactures trade balance has deteriorated by 8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  We also have the question of foreign borrowings by this country, many of them largely in the private sector. We all note the reduction of the government ingredient in this, but net income balance has moved from 2 per cent of GDP in 1980-81 to 4 1/2 per cent by 1990. That is another aspect of this problem. The capital account sees peak foreign investment levels in the 1980s. New portfolio investment, rather than investments where there is 10 per cent of equity in Australian assets, has become the crucial aspect of that investment. At the same time, there have been movements in those countries with that sort of investment. The greatest growth in capital account debts of this country occurs with the Japanese. Within the various sectors of that debt, of course, is the absolute growth of the finance, property, business and foreign debt section. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee came to a number of conclusions, which I will summarise. The Committee, whilst advocating a continuation of tariff reductions and the attempt to increase international competitiveness, concludes that a number of the measures already set in train by the Government should be continued. For instance, the Committee came to the conclusion that the export market development grants, with taxable cash grants for up-front marketing involving promotional literature, travel expenses and overseas expenses, should continue for the remainder of the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee advocates that the services provided to exporters by Austrade, which has been investigated by the McKinsey Committee and been asked to orient its requirements more towards Asia and to change its management practices in a major way, be pursued in the remainder of the 1990s. At the same time, the Committee does reiterate the conclusion of the McKinsey Committee that the orientation should be towards Asia and the Pacific rather than towards a number of offices in Florida and other questionable sites. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee has advocated that funding to the international trade enhancement scheme be increased for consortiums, joint ventures and associations to achieve greater efficiency. That involves low interest loans, concessional services, et cetera. There is a call from this Committee that the funding be expanded, not reduced, and that Australia not retract its interests and its involvement in helping companies penetrate overseas markets. </PARA>
<PARA>  Regarding the development import finance facility, which is aimed at developing countries to facilitate their purchase of Australian products, the Committee does not advocate that this country reduce its support for the export industries that gain from this facility. It actually advocates a doubling of finance. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee has asked that tripartite industry committees, involving government, the private sector and unions, have a greater orientation towards export requirements and actually compile industry reports that seek to maximise the export effort of industries. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee advocates a very great increase in investment in plant, equipment and infrastructure. The major proportion of the Committee's time is spent looking at the question of anti-dumping and countervailing duties systems. We know that in the March industry statement measures were taken, but they are still receiving fairly pronounced criticism for the delays, even after these changes, in ensuring they operate. </PARA>
<PARA>  As to superannuation, we know that there has been a variety of discussions between the Government and the superannuation funds--at this stage, it must be said, to very little effect. It appears that the persuasive abilities of the Government have not been effective in ensuring that superannuation funds move towards doing something for the national interest. It is all right to talk about the need for the funds to maximise profits for those people in them, but at the same time, it is the overall profitability of this country that counts. If its inability to penetrate overseas markets continues, the superannuation funds might have other problems in trying to ensure their members' long term financial security. </PARA>
<PARA>  In regards to accelerated depreciation, the Committee has advocated that those sectors that deal with export industries should have a complete write-off over four years. It is stressed that that should not apply to the primary produce industries. In regards to wage policy, we reiterate our continued emphasis on wage restraint in this country, but advocate that it is a bit wider than the average wage earner--that he should not, in summary, carry the whole bag. Essentially, this Committee advocates a more interventionist role by the Government, and it believes that a doctrine has grown up in recent years that there is no role there. </PARA>
<PARA>   In conclusion, I cite a recent book by Steven Chan called East Asian Dynamism, in which he noted:</PARA>
<PARA>In varying forms and to varying degrees, the most successful capitalist East Asian countries have developed powerful government agencies charged with the task of planning, guiding, and coordinating industrial policies. South Korea's Economic Planning Board, Taiwan's Council for Economic Planning and Development, and Singapore's Economic Development Board serve this vital function. </PARA>
<PARA>From the Committee's conclusion, that is the emphasis of its report--a more interventionist role by the Government in tackling the problems.(Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-First, on behalf of the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards) and myself, I extend our compliments to the other members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, particularly the Chairman, and our thanks to the staff, particularly Chris Robinson, for the very considerable efforts put into the production of this report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  As the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) has just stated, the number of submissions received by the Committee, some 72, covering a very wide cross-section of persons interested in our trade and financial well-being, reflects something of the genuine and general concern there is in this field. </PARA>
<PARA>  Indeed, I find it rather remarkable that the day on which we are talking about this report should coincide with a range of comments by a number of quite diverse people about elements that are, of course, the subject of the report. We have had the report by the Deputy Chairman of Standard and Poors about the extent to which we are still far too dependent upon increasing our overseas debt to fund our continued current account deficit. We have had the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) in seeking to address the IMF--I gather that, for reasons that I am not quite certain of, the address was not made--finally acknowledging that this is the worst depression that Australia has faced since the 1930s. We have had the immediate past President of the Labor Party and present Premier of South Australia suggesting that the Federal Government is not spending enough time attending to the problems of unemployment. We have had Mr John Ralph, the Chairman of CRA, in addressing a science and engineering technologists conference here in Canberra, identifying the fact that it is essential that we start removing some of the impediments to progress, some of the Government introduced impediments and some that are, to a degree, the product of scientists and others not perhaps fully evaluating the climates of those impediments, particularly those where it is suggested that development cannot occur because of some consequence that is alleged. </PARA>
<PARA>  Mr Ralph is suggesting that it is time that we had a look at the way by which those particular arguments are developed and not just accept them on face value. He is suggesting that there is a reason for scientists to look at both sides of the question and for us to accept in Australia that, unless we address productivity and unless we are prepared to look at the elements of how this country is going to progress, then we are going to find ourselves not only in an impossible investment climate but slipping further and further behind. Of course, there are also the comments from the Reserve Bank about the extent to which investment is still foundering. </PARA>
<PARA>  The report itself, therefore, addresses a subject about which there is absolutely no contention. Indeed, those of us who endorse the minority report also endorse the first recommendation which identifies the problem and suggests that the rising overseas debts is something that needs to be consciously addressed. When we look at the period from 1969 to 1991, which is set out in appendix one, the escalation of that debt is apparent. It has increased from $3,385m in 1969 to $165,704m today. A $165 billion debt is an incredible obligation for this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have several concerns about the majority report. First, even the debt figures, as the honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards) has stated, do not completely establish the position. It is true that the total liabilities--that is, equity and debt--are very important. Secondly, I do not think many people understand that in recent years we have tended to borrow funds abroad to fund various national developments here instead of investing equity. That may well have advantages. For a long time there was a tendency in this country to accept equity. I believe that was a better course. But we have not really in this report addressed the implications of that. So we really need to look at the total liability that we as Australians have, and not just at the level of debt, to establish what the problems are. </PARA>
<PARA>  I accept that there are those who believe that the Government should be to a far greater degree interventionist, as the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) has just specified--and I might, if I have time, pick up a couple of those recommendations to which he has referred. But the real difficulty that I have with the majority report--and I think I am on common ground here--is that I do not think there is any quick fix. I am also concerned about the directions and nature of particular intervention. We need to get the broad base right. The reason that we have attached an extract from Statement No. 1 of this year's Budget is that it picks up a number of elements which I think are critical. </PARA>
<PARA>  The first thing--and I found it quite fascinating that this is one of the few times that I have seen Treasury recognising an aspect of economic management, something which I have long felt has been deficient in this country--is the need to look beyond the annual Budget. We have to start looking at the medium term. On page 143 of the report, the Treasury states:</PARA>
<PARA>This points to the advantages of relating policy more to the medium-term and assigning policy instruments to their area of greater effectiveness. Such a framework entails:</PARA>
<PARA>    monetary policy clearly enunciated and focused on reducing inflation and inflationary expectations but remaining very much alive to the implications of settings for domestic demand;</PARA>
<PARA>    fiscal policy targeted towards contributing to an appropriate balance between domestic demand and production, particularly through its contribution to raising national savings; and</PARA>
<PARA>    wages policy aimed at restraining aggregate wage pressures to maximise employment growth and contribute to progress on inflation, while increasing labour market flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA>Those three fields are critical in economic management. None of them are subject to the quick fix and tinkering at the edges, which I have felt so many of the majority recommendations do, is not going to overcome the problems. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have mentioned Mr John Ralph's observations. One of my worries is that in development and investment projects there are so many impediments at a government and quasi-government level that progress is just not being achieved. Yet I was taken by one phrase he used--that the problems of today's management are significantly different from those of his predecessors; that today at every level of government, at every level of authority, there seem to be reasons why we cannot do things, not reasons why we can. Trying to attain and implement productivity gains is not just a matter of award wages and adjustment in conditions, it is far more complex. </PARA>
<PARA>  To my mind, the fiddle which I see as the product of so many of the majority recommendations is not going to achieve the turnaround that in general we all accept. Indeed, there are obviously real problems in trying to get a turnaround. I would suggest that one other field that is not in that specific quote--taxation reform--is a fundamental part of it. </PARA>
<PARA>  In other words, we have to look at the whole dimension of government policy and try to remove the obstacles and the restrictions. There has to be a ground swell of change in the altitude of bureaucracy. I was delighted the honourable member for Reid referred to Austrade, because that is part of the trouble. Every time we try to intervene, we create another authority, we create another obstruction. </PARA>
<PARA>  For a while, I was almost convinced that Austrade was a good thing. I have been Minister in the area and have been responsible for the Australian Trade Commission. I know a good deal about the way in which the old Trade Commission operated. I thought for a while that perhaps the way to go might be to set up an independent authority and allow it to supervise and, to a large degree, commercialise the processes of government. The difficulty is that the processes of government are threefold. The first is in international trade negotiations. To my mind that is not a role that can be undertaken by Austrade. For that reason we have got this complexity of departments, as I have said on a number of occasions. We have the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, the Department of Resources and the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, and we even have two Ministers within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade responsible for it. We have got an overlap. Austrade is currently responsible to DITAC. I think it is about to go over to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. We have got all this complexity of interlocking departments. People are writing letters to each other and producing paper without getting any results. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am concerned that we do not just fiddle at the edges. That is my trouble with the superannuation reference, too, as the honourable member for Reid (Mr Ferguson) has mentioned in the recommendation here. We have to get a fundamental ground swell of change; we have to address productivity, introduce employment change; and, above all, we have to understand that unless we do change those conditions within which government operates and in which business reacts to government, frankly, we are not going to be able to address the problem. I commend all those responsible for this report and commend it for wider reading and wider understanding. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The basic thrust of this report involves converting an inflexible administratively based system of spectrum management to one where, for commercial users, spectrum access has become a tradeable commodity. The recommendations that have been made will enable Australia to position itself for rapid technological change. The choice is clear: Australia can be in a position to reap the benefits associated with the communications revolution, or it can lose them. The Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure has produced a forward looking report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I see the introduction of our approach as a win-no loss position. In other words, the advantage in developing a framework that enables spectrum access to become tradeable is that if there is a rapid growth in demand full advantage can be taken of the opportunities that arise. If this growth does not occur, then nothing is lost. On the other hand, continuation of the existing administrative system is a no loss-lose position. If the existing system is maintained, it will cope if demand does not exceed supply. But if demand does exceed supply, losses in terms of economic growth, productivity and efficiency could be considerable. </PARA>
<PARA>  The management of the radio frequency spectrum or airwaves is a subject that is of considerable importance. It is a subject that most people do not understand. In fact, to many the radio frequency spectrum is a mystery and, to others, sections of it are sacred. I will not detail the technical characteristics of the spectrum; readers will find them in chapter 2 of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>  The value of the spectrum lies in its actual and potential exploitation for a range of public, private and commercial information purposes such as broadcasting, mobile communications, controlling and signalling equipment, radio location and navigation, to name but a few. In carrying out this inquiry, the Committee has been mindful of the rapid changes taking place in communications technology and innovations in service provision. The Committee has tried to look forward to consider not only the current problems being experienced in spectrum management but also the impact of increasing demand on spectrum management over the next 10 to 15 years. </PARA>
<PARA>  The report gives a thumbnail sketch of the sorts of developments that we can expect in communications. The possibilities that technology will offer are limited only by one's imagination. This prospect of change and innovation is significant as communications play a critical role in our daily lives and the conduct of business. While developments in radio communications technology are important, advances in optical fibre and the use of computers in intelligent networks are breaking down the old barriers and expanding the means of delivering all manner of services. Nicholas Negroponte of MIT's Media Laboratory has described this process of change. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>  What currently goes through wires, chiefly voice, will move to the air; what currently goes through the air, chiefly video, will move to wires. The phone will become wireless, as mobile as a watch and as personal as a wallet; computer video will run over fibre optic cables in switched digital systems as convenient as the telephone is today. </PARA>
<PARA>For this reason, it is essential that Australia be in a position to ensure that advantage can be taken of the potential benefits offered in maximising use of the airwaves. The Committee has recommended that the primary objectives of spectrum management should be operational, that is, that management should be flexible and timely in meeting the needs of all spectrum users, and that it should ensure that the most spectrum efficient equipment and practices are in use. The achievement of those objectives would benefit all users. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee also recommended a number of other important objectives, including provision for non-commercial uses, allocation of spectrum to the highest value uses, continued observance of international obligations and a system of government charges that is efficient and fair. Details of these objectives can be found in chapter 3 of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>  The current approach to spectrum management has evolved over many years and is based on very detailed planning being undertaken by the Department of Transport and Communications, which is responsible for every aspect of planning and for determining who gets access to the spectrum, for what purpose and under what conditions. In the past there has been ample space on the spectrum for all users. However, over recent times the growth in demand for specific frequencies has outstripped supply for a number of desirable uses, for example trunked land mobile services. To deal with this congestion and to allow for the introduction of new services, the Department has had to follow an extensive process of consultation with the existing users to arrange for their relocation to other areas of the spectrum. The problem here is that this process involves the acquisition of new equipment by users and renders existing equipment obsolete. The only way of achieving this is to allow users several years in which to gradually change over to their new spectrum frequencies. </PARA>
<PARA>  This process is further complicated by the increasingly commercial nature of spectrum use. While it may be possible to agree on equipment costs, the question is: how is the Department to make valid assessments of the costs associated with any loss of business due to a decision to replan and reallocate a band of spectrum to a different use? Under the existing management system, there is no satisfactory method of compensating users for the costs associated with moving on the spectrum. The Committee also found that the Department of Transport and Communications is constrained in its ability to ensure that spectrum efficient equipment and practices are in use. </PARA>
<PARA>  Turning to non-commercial users--while the current system meets their needs for spectrum resources, a major concern of the Committee was to ensure that they used their share of the spectrum efficiently. The allocation of spectrum to highest value uses is a difficult matter to assess. Obviously, value cannot be assessed only in a commercial sense; safety of life services are essential to everyone's well-being and are therefore of considerable value. But in terms of competing commercial applications, the current system cannot select the most efficient user in situations where demand exceeds supply. There is no way of making precise judgments on the comparative values of competing users. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee has also identified major deficiencies in the current system of government charges. Charges are not levied in a manner that enables the individual costs associated with spectrum management to be identified and recovered from individual users. Nor do they provide a means of ensuring the return to government of an appropriate share of economic rents accruing to users from commercial use of the spectrum. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee concluded that the current system fails in a number of significant ways to meet the spectrum management objectives. The Committee considered several approaches to spectrum management. Opinions generally centred upon modifying the current administratively based arrangements or on the introduction of market based principles into the allocation and assignment process. Detailed consideration of these alternatives is covered in chapter 6 of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee considered that modifying the current administrative system would make some improvement in the responsiveness of spectrum management to technological change and increasing demand. A number of changes to current arrangements have been recommended. However, there would continue to be some essential weaknesses. The ability of the spectrum manager to force the pace of change with respect to replanning and reassignment would continue to be constrained. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee also considered the introduction of a market based system as suggested by the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics in its paper Management of the Radio Frequency Spectrum, An Economic Analysis. A market based system would allow spectrum to be traded, combined, divided or leased by users. This approach would involve the creation of access rights to spectrum and would require the conversion of existing assignments to a tradeable right, at a minimum cost to existing users. Unused spectrum would be offered through an auction or tender process. There would have to be special arrangements to guarantee continued access for non-commercial users. There is detailed comment on this matter in chapter 6 of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee considered that tradeability would offer significant benefits in relation to both dynamic and technical efficiency, as it would enable users to acquire spectrum or to relocate in response to their changing needs. It would also encourage users to optimise their use of spectrum in order to maximise the return on their investment. It also addresses the problem of compensation. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee identified a number of problems associated with the comprehensive introduction of such an approach at this time, particularly for non-commercial users. The Committee has therefore recommended the development and introduction of a system of tradeable spectrum access rights for commercial users of the spectrum in parallel with recommended reforms to the current administrative system. This approach should be gradual and should apply initially to unencumbered spectrum or in bands where there is high demand. Non-commercial users should have the option of remaining under the modified administrative system or having their access converted to a tradeable resource. Also recommended is a system of regular auditing of spectrum used by public sector users. </PARA>
<PARA>  One final point is that the Committee believes that the access rights to spectrum should not be perpetual. In order to have a safeguard against the possibility that some users might engage in anti-competitive practices, and also as a means of ensuring any necessary long term planning, the Committee has recommended that access rights be for a fixed term. </PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, I would like to thank all of those who have made submissions to the inquiry. In particular, I wish to thank the officers from the Department of Transport and Communications, who have responded to all of the Subcommittee's numerous requests. They have been very open and forthcoming in the evidence given to the Subcommittee. I thank the inquiry staff--Mr Christopher Paterson, the inquiry secretary; Mr Malcolm Aldons, the Committee secretary; and Mrs June Murphy--for their dedication and support. Above all, I thank my fellow Subcommittee members--the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman); the honourable member for Greenway (Mr Gorman); and the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott)--for their support and assistance right throughout the inquiry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Chairman of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris), has already addressed the broad range of matters covered in the report. I would like to make a few short comments in support of what has already been said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Firstly, could I say that the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), who is the Deputy Chairman of this Subcommittee, has apologised for his absence from this debate. He has been called home because of the likelihood of bushfires around his and other properties. I hope that he and others will be safe and that their properties will be free from damage. </PARA>
<PARA>  This inquiry has been a very enlightening process. I have been involved in the inquiries dealing with broadcasting and pay television, and on both occasions the question of the availability of space on the radio frequency spectrum arose. Each time the Committee was confronted with an engineering perspective as to why things could or could not be done. I am not suggesting that the evidence given on those occasions was in any way incorrect or misleading. It is just that we had difficulty in understanding the processes by which the spectrum is managed. </PARA>
<PARA>  This report removes much of that mystery and will provide the reader with an understanding of the difficulties involved in managing access to the radio frequency spectrum. A simple illustration of the difficulties that the current approach imposes on ensuring that the spectrum is efficiently used is the allocation made for trunked land mobile purposes. This frequency band plan provides for 200 channels. The trunked land mobile is a very efficient use of the spectrum, and access to the band is much sought after by users. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are two aspects of concern related to the use of this band. Firstly, the use of frequency reservation certificates meant that 80 per cent of the channels were reserved by users but not actually used. At the same time, there were, and still are, waiting lists of prospective users. The Committee has recommended that the use of FRCs be discontinued as they enable spectrum to be tied up and left unused even in situations where others wish to use these frequencies. </PARA>
<PARA>  The second point of concern is the inability of the Department to make additional spectrum available for this purpose due to the delays inherent in replanning the spectrum. What is more, where demand exceeds supply, revenue is forgone as the annual charges are far less than those for an actual licence. The Committee calculates that in this case almost $500,000 per year was being forgone in lost fees. The Committee saw little prospect that the current system can effectively deal with situations where demand for frequencies exceeds supply. This means that as new technologies are developed we may be deprived of their benefits. </PARA>
<PARA>  The other point that I would like to raise relates to the conversion of current assignments to tradeable access rights for incumbent users. The Committee was concerned that such users should not be able to make windfall gains by immediately selling the right if it happened to be in the desirable part of the spectrum. It is important that the Department give consideration to ensuring that the capital gains tax will apply in such situations. </PARA>
<PARA>  This has been a very complex inquiry and I believe that it provides a positive approach to ensuring that spectrum use will be maximised and that the most efficient users will be able to gain access to spectrum resources. I thank those who made submissions. It was obvious that all submitters had given a lot of consideration to the issues raised in the course of the inquiry. I thank the officers from DOTAC who appeared before the Committee, and it was refreshing to take evidence from departmental witnesses who were prepared to discuss the issues in a frank and open manner. I thank the inquiry staff, Chris Paterson and June Murphy, for their assistance in the conduct of the inquiry and the preparation of this report. Finally, I would like to thank the other members of the Subcommittee, including the Chairman, the honourable member for Shortland; the honourable member for Mitchell; and also the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott), who stood in for me during my recent illness. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  That the House supports the broad thrust of the recommendations of the report on young people's participation in post-compulsory education and training (the Finn report) and in particular calls on governments to ensure adequate funding to allow implementation of the recommendations so that the targets for access to education and training can be realised by 2001. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia is at a crucial moment in its economic history. We have a severe current account deficit and we are about to have the highest level of unemployment for 60 years. I have just tabled a major report which concentrates attention on the current account deficit and our overseas debt, and on policies which can be adopted to ease those problems. The policies that we recommend would also contribute to reducing unemployment through the growth of employment. One of our strong recommendations is that more attention should be given to post-secondary education. It is quite clear that, if we want to improve our international competitiveness, we have to build up the skills of our work force. I was delighted, therefore, to find that the Government commissioned and has received a report from the Australian Education Council Review Committee, chaired by Mr Finn, entitled Young People's Participation in Post-compulsory Education and Training. </PARA>
<PARA>  Education policy is not my own area of expertise but, as an economist, I was very impressed by this report because it seems to me to get very close to recommending exactly the policies that we should be adopting in the area of post-secondary education. We are going through something of a revolution in this area, because during the 1980s there has been an extraordinary growth in the proportion of school students completing secondary education, and in the proportion staying on well into secondary school. </PARA>
<PARA>  Those school retention rates are the result of all sorts of factors. They are due partly to improvements in the quality and availability of education and the growth in living standards, which enable parents to encourage their children to stay at school longer. No doubt they are partly due to unemployment and the difficulties people have in finding jobs. They therefore stay on at school to improve their education. No doubt there are many other factors. </PARA>
<PARA>  But whatever the causes, there is this very welcome development: nearly a doubling in the proportion of students completing school--from about a third at the beginning of the 1980s to nearly two-thirds now. Consequently, there have to be improved opportunities in all the forms of post-secondary education: vocational training, technical education, apprenticeships and university education. This report makes proposals relating to all of those areas of education. At the beginning of its recommendations it states:</PARA>
<PARA>  Australia as a nation should be committed to providing for all of its young people a program of education/training which prepares them for life as individuals, citizens and workers now, through the current decade and into the coming century. </PARA>
<PARA>A long term strategy is being proposed here. The report sets remarkably ambitious targets in comparison with those of the recent past. For example, it states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . by 1995 all young people by the age of 18 should have attained sufficient vocational skills to achieve at least a base-level traineeship (or other vocational qualifications. . . ) or participation in Year 12 or progress towards a higher level qualification. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it is saying that it is preferable that all young people at the age of 18 still be involved in education. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . by the year 2001 almost all people by the age of 20 should have attained at least a higher-level traineeship (or other vocational qualification. . . ) or progress toward a higher level vocational qualification or a post-Year 12 academic qualification. </PARA>
<PARA>That really is a remarkable recommendation. To be setting that sort of standard for most people aged 20 is very ambitious indeed. That is summarised in a sense when the report states that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . by the year 2001, 95 per cent of 19-year-olds should have completed Year 12, or an initial post-school qualification or be participating in formally recognised education or training. </PARA>
<PARA>Those targets will be impossible to achieve unless there are many other policy changes. The Committee makes recommendations about resource allocation, which I will come to in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA>  It also goes on to recommend the kinds of education and training which should be made available. It talks about increasing the diversity of the forms of education and training that are available. It emphasises that curriculums be appropriate and relevant to the full range of students. It talks about allowing for a range of learning styles and so on. </PARA>
<PARA>  It even attempts the ambitious task of describing key areas of competence which all students should be encouraged to achieve. They include subjects such as language and communication, mathematics, scientific and technological understanding, cultural understanding, problem solving, and personal and interpersonal development. </PARA>
<PARA>  One aspect I think missing from the report is the need for training in community responsibility and understanding how government works. We should encourage people to be active in the community--what some people used to call civics. In other words, there has to be a dimension which goes beyond just personal development to development as part of society. These personal and interpersonal development skills could well be extended a bit further. I am glad to see that ethics is included in the training. Ethics and values in that training are very important as well. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee recommends that nationally comparable ways of assessing young people's attainments should be developed. That too is a pretty ambitious task because it is hard to assess objectively the skills which people have. One point that I would make is that I hope that that assessment can be done against some educational standard rather than assessing people against one another. There is the problem in education, which is partly inevitable but which partly can be avoided, of simply stimulating destructive competitiveness. While, to some extent, that is inevitable, what we want from our students is the achievement of the kinds of standards that this report is outlining. </PARA>
<PARA>  The report also talks about the kinds of funds that are required. It talks about the need for equity programs. I regret to say that it recommends cutting out purely recreational courses from TAFE. I think that is a mistake. The report talks about the special needs of disabled students. It goes on to discuss the resources that will be necessary to achieve these goals. I would particularly like to emphasise that it is essential that Commonwealth funding for technical colleges, vocational training and universities be increased. Yesterday I was delighted to see the statement by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) that the Commonwealth was offering to take a much larger share of the provision of finance for technical education. I think that is essential. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do have one or two more sceptical comments to make about the Finn report. The report is not perfect; no report ever is. I think that there is perhaps some conflict about educational philosophy, between scientific and technological knowledge on the one hand and the civilising humanities on the other. I think that both are very important. It is very important that there be cooperation between the TAFEs and the universities. That is emphasised in the report. It is essential to ensure that educational experience is as fulfilling and stretching as possible. Basically, I moved the motion to draw attention to the report in the hope that it will receive support, and to urge the Government to provide adequate funds to implement it. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am delighted to have the opportunity this morning to respond to the comments of the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore). I would like to congratulate him on bringing this issue before the House of Representatives. Indeed, the report of the Australian Education Council Review Committee, under the chairmanship of Mr Brian Finn, entitled Young People's Participation in Post-Compulsory Education and Training, is a timely and important document. It is clear in all sectors that today we face a crisis in education across our nation. That crisis extends into and is subsumed by the training sector itself, which is what is largely dealt with in the Finn report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The crisis is one of access. We have created a great optimism in the community. We have created a great acceptance, in these beginning years of the 1990s, of the need for high quality and versatile education and training throughout our community and over people's life span. Not only do we need to educate and train our youth, but also we need to realise that education and training will increasingly become a lifelong experience. Therefore, we have  a problem  with  access  because  many young people are unable to attend university. A report in a newspaper this morning talked about the overcrowding in our universities. Our TAFEs are not so much overcrowded as suffering from such excessive demand and lack of facilities that they have to turn away up to 100,000 potential students a year. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Finn report states that we need growth in knowledge and skills. In that respect it calls for growth in education and training. On the issue of training there is no-one with whom I have spoken across Australia who does not support the concept that we need to expand the skills base of our people in order to allow them to participate fully in an active and productive working life. So we do need more places in these institutions; we do need more teachers; we do need more trainers; and we do need better systems. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Finn report sets important targets, both qualitative and quantitative. I have tried to read the methodologies behind the setting of the targets. I am not entirely satisfied that the targets in themselves should be the end rather than the means. It seems to me that we might review the targets either from time to time or more or less continuously so that we determine their relevance as we go through the 1990s. Reaching these targets will cost money; it will cost heaps of money. The question then arises as to where the money will come from: whether the Commonwealth will provide the funds; whether the States will provide funds; whether individuals will contribute to their own training and education; and whether industry also will contribute in this process. </PARA>
<PARA>  It seems to me that we need to have a greater sharing of the resources necessary to educate our youth. In that context some of the things being done by TAFE in Victoria are really quite exciting. The Victorian State Training Board is devolving responsibility to individual TAFE colleges and their directors and those TAFE colleges will now be allowed to increase next year's fees by up to 40 per cent. In some cases, higher increases will be allowed for individual courses. The TAFEs are now competing actively with one another in the market to sell their products to industry and the community. They are now starting to respond to the marketplace and to answer the needs that people have for training and the needs that industry has for skills at specific levels. </PARA>
<PARA>  In this context it is also interesting to note that one of the things that the Finn report discusses in great detail is the convergence of general education and skills acquisition for the real world of work. We all know that we have had this great demarcation in the education scene in Australia for a long time. Schools are there basically to provide a general education and to feed the universities, whereas TAFEs are seen to be set aside from that school system and more closely linked to industry but not yet allied with it. In fact, there are some TAFE directors who say that they know better what industry needs in terms of training than does industry itself. I would question such a statement. </PARA>
<PARA>  In our secondary schools we generally had split-stream education, in which some schools provide vocational training and others teach academic courses suitable for entry to university. However, over the last decade we decided, for whatever reason, that the vocational schools were inappropriate. We did not value their outcomes. In some respects that is disappointing because today we would start from a higher base had we been able to retain that dual-stream system. Nonetheless, we decided that that system was inappropriate. Today, we are faced with the choice of trying to start it up again or to find some other mechanism for making education of real value to young people, particularly in the last two years of secondary school--year 11 and year 12. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Finn report recommends that increasingly we have vocational courses in senior secondary schools and that we increase retention rates by giving young people real skills and allowing certified credit for those skills so that when they finish school they will have done part of the preliminary training necessary for them to do an apprenticeship or an Australian traineeship and they will be empowered, so to speak, to enter the world of work. That is a very important concept, and I support the Finn report absolutely. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Finn report talks a great deal about assessment. Assessment testing is a topic on which I have spoken in this place many times. The report says that we must set standards, we must test the standards and we must agree nationally on the standards we want. It says, in effect, that it is no longer acceptable for one State to have a requirement for welding heavy plate and for another State to have a different requirement so that an individual cannot move from one State to another without taking a new course and a new test. It is a nonsense that we must do away with. We have to establish good, high level standards and we must increase those standards over time. </PARA>
<PARA>  Assessment is important not only in the context of the Finn report, but in the context of primary schools so that we can judge how well the system, which we pay for through our taxes, is performing in producing well-educated young people, particularly in the fields of literacy and numeracy. The Finn report on assessment provides us with an excellent guide for the future. </PARA>
<PARA>  There was only one disappointing aspect of the Finn report in my view. I was disappointed that the report did not address some of the difficulties that we will have in achieving a uniform education system with pathways, with credit transfer between schools, TAFEs and universities, as long as we maintain the huge union bureaucracy which today controls much of the education and training sector. Until we break down some of that control and allow individual schools under their principals to go their own way and seek their own place in the sun, to achieve their own niche of excellence, it is my view that we will not be able to accomplish the aims of the Finn report because we will not be able to get the diversity of provision that will allow freedom of choice and the provision of excellence.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- I am extremely pleased to speak to the motion of my colleague the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), which supports the broad thrust of the recommendations of the report on young people's participation in post-compulsory education and training, commonly known as the Finn report. I would also like to take the time to acknowledge the positive contribution of the honourable member for La Trobe (Mr Charles) in this debate this morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I support this motion with a high degree of confidence, although not entirely. I have some misgivings too, but I will mention those later. The Finn report is ideas driven. It suggests congruent mechanisms and has reconcilable outcomes within the guidelines. It is obviously dependent upon resource implications. There are huge costs involved, as the honourable member for La Trobe and the honourable member for Fraser have acknowledged. In other words, the basic trinity of positive government policy--rationale, process and outcomes--is clearly evident. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Finn report recognises the ideas that both individual and industry needs are leading towards a convergence of general and vocational education. I acknowledge the point made by the honourable member for La Trobe about the loss of technical education in our secondary schools. The dual system was a fine system. Finn notes that internationally there is an increasing realisation that the most successful forms of work organisation are those which encourage people to be multi-skilled, creative and adaptable. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Finn report states that, in order to serve their clients' needs, both schools and TAFEs will need to change. New measures for participation are clearly stated. Key competencies in the areas of language and communication, mathematics, scientific and technological understanding, cultural understanding, problem solving and personal and interpersonal characteristics, along with the national curriculum principles with implications for teachers, are recognised. In other words, within the Finn report there exists a framework, a process, for effective implementation of goals, and they are all recognised. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am not too sure that continued reference to buzz words like `pathways' are particularly useful, but on reflection that should not detract from the more important issue of credit transfers between institutions like TAFEs and universities. The Finn report states:</PARA>
<PARA>The real level of skills and knowledge acquired by an individual in one educational setting should be given due recognition when that individual moves into a different setting. </PARA>
<PARA>I say `Hear, hear' to that proposition. Personally, I am too often appalled at the lack of leadership in education and the feather-bedding of too many--though I admit not all--in higher education at the expense of the TAFE and the school sectors. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Finn report also states a positive recognition of support for the disadvantaged in suggesting that further work needs to be done on the initiatives in relation to young people with disabilities and suggests beginning points as to how this could be achieved. Congruent with the rationale espoused and the processes indicated, clear targets are made, and they are vicious targets. As I said earlier, those targets have huge resource implications. Specifically the Finn report proposes the following targets: as a minimum, at least a level 1 traineeship or participation in year 12 for all 18-year-olds by 1995; at least a level 2 traineeship or progress towards a higher level vocational or academic qualification for almost all 20-year-olds by 2001; and at least a vocational certificate, level 3, or progress towards a vocational qualification above level 3, or a diploma or degree, for at least 50 per cent of 22-year-olds by 2001. We would all agree that they are incredibly ambitious targets. </PARA>
<PARA>  In conclusion, the Finn report holds up extremely well indeed. It is ideas driven. It points to appropriate processes. It sets clear targets congruent with the rationale and suggested mechanisms. </PARA>
<PARA>  One criticism of the report lies with its apparent ignorance of the importance of the foundation years of education, namely, the education that sets the pattern for the future success or failure of all learners at all levels; that is, the education received by the Cinderella sector of education in junior secondary, primary and junior primary schools. Remedy that, enhance the importance of TAFE within a national framework, determinedly foster the relationship between all sectors of education on an equal basis, and we will come to recognise the Finn report as an important watershed and stepping stone.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-As I have said many times before in this place, education in Australia remains at the crossroads in terms of content, of quality, of policy direction, of administration and, of course, in its dependence on the funding linchpin with its attendant degrees of governmental control. On this side of the House we would argue that this Government in general, and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) and the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) in particular have fallen down in many of these areas, at the same time injecting a degree of unparalleled governmental control and political ideology into a policy area which should rise above party politics. Those Ministers stand condemned for their ideological push. Regrettably for this nation their ministries remain some of the most political in the Federal arena.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Undeniably, basic national literacy and numeracy standards are not improving. Whilst for good reasons many of us have concentrated on the technicalities of Australia's economic ills in the short to medium term, there is little doubt that an increasing consensus is emerging not just that the key to our future prosperity lies in the radical economic reform processes that are necessary if we are to get this nation back onto an even economic keel, but that any future prosperity lies, in large part, in the education and training of our youth. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would like to think that the old ocker image that ignorance was blessed is disappearing, and that the days are over when two out of three of our teenagers drop out before finishing school and go off to work. Indeed, that ability to work has taken on catastrophic dimensions as a result of this Government's economic failures with one in three of our 15- to 19-year-olds out of work and many ill-prepared and ill-educated to enter a work force which has to be increasingly clever if we are to climb out of our rut. We remain in danger of degenerating into a nation of educational, professional and commercial mediocrity unless we lift our game. Here is where the Finn report can make a vital contribution. </PARA>
<PARA>  In a very interesting article in the Canberra Times on 25 August, Geoffrey Maslen said:</PARA>
<PARA>The turn around in attitudes to education has been extraordinary. As a society we have gone from accepting that only a small minority of teenagers should finish school and aim for further study to the widespread belief that staying to year 12 is a must and getting another qualification is essential. With almost no debate and no compulsion young people are signing up for education just as their great grandparents rushed to join the Army at the start of World War I but the after school signposts have all been pointing the one way. . . Technical and further education has failed to attract the crowds. While the proportion of young people at universities has jumped over the past 8 years from 6.5% to 10.6% of the 15 to 19 year old population the proportion in TAFE has remained the same. </PARA>
<PARA>It is on this point, as reflected in the Finn report, that I would like to concentrate a brief comment this morning. That report calls for greater emphasis on user pays student charges and resource sharing amongst training institutions to help defray the cost of the proposed reforms to industry and to the public. It also proposes minimum competency standards, national benchmarks for student achievement, the scrapping of quotas for TAFE and post-year 10, and reciprocal acceptance of credit points to strengthen the ties between schools, TAFE and universities--all in themselves very commendable. </PARA>
<PARA>  While Mr Finn points out that funding clearly is an issue that needs to be resolved and that he was reasonably confident that Federal and State governments and industry would provide enough money to implement the proposals, his report of itself did not provide the total solution. The questions of the essential skills that young people must acquire, regardless of the education and training pathway that they choose and the desirable balance between the training and education sectors, are left up in the air. Indeed, the Finn report does not address some of the vital structural issues involved in lifting incentives and improving morale in education and training institutions, wherein there must be an agenda of reform to create more autonomous and flexible institutions with the ability to respond to a student market and to industry alike. </PARA>
<PARA>  It seems to me that, if nothing else, the Finn report will highlight the fact that the willy-nilly push for student numbers on university campuses is not the way to go. Further emphasis is needed in TAFE, which has the prospect of becoming the poor relation should the status quo be maintained. Many of our young people need to realise that not only are they not suited to the pure academic university environment but also that this nation urgently needs large numbers of them to understand that vocational trades are important. </PARA>

<PARA>  That the House:</PARA>
<PARA>  (1)  acknowledges the right of self-determination of the Ukraine;</PARA>
<PARA>  (2)  notes the declaration of independence and that the declaration is to be put to the Ukrainian people for confirmation in December 1991;</PARA>
<PARA>  (3)  believes that, subject to such confirmation and the Ukraine meeting the criteria for independent statehood, the international community, including Australia, should support its independence by diplomatic recognition; and</PARA>
<PARA>  (4)  calls upon the Australian Government in the meantime to support the aspirations of the Ukrainian people by:</PARA>
<PARA>      (a)  establishing a consulate in the Ukraine;</PARA>
<PARA>      (b)  opening a trade office in Kiev; and</PARA>
<PARA>      (c)  ensuring the Ukraine gets its fair share of the training and management scholarships the Australian Government is offering to the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA>We live in very interesting and volatile times, as we have noted particularly in relation to the Soviet Union. The motion that I have moved recognises that the consequences of this are creating difficulties for the world--problems for which there are no easy or immediately identifiable solutions but problems in which we all, to a greater or lesser extent, are involved. These are problems on which we cannot turn our backs. </PARA>
<PARA>  On a number of occasions in this House we have enthusiastically welcomed the democratic reform in the Soviet Union. For 70 years it had been held together by a brutal and totalitarian regime which created enormous privation and suffering for its peoples. The Ukraine bore the brunt of some of the most vicious assaults on people within the Soviet Union. The collapse of the Russian empire during the First World War resulted in the creation of two independent Ukrainian national republics, which were subsequently defeated by the Bolshevik forces in 1920 and were divided between Poland and the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Ukrainian peasantry and intellectuals were decimated in the Ukraine in 1932-33, when over seven million people died of starvation in a Soviet engineered famine--a matter of very real and continuing commemoration within the Ukrainian community because of the hardship that so many relatives and families of those who are here in Australia experienced at that time. Hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians, including leading authors, poets and playwrights, were shot in the purges of 1936 to 1939. </PARA>
<PARA>  When Germany attacked the Soviet Union in 1941, the Ukraine declared independence and became a major battleground between Germany and the Soviet Union. Some six million Ukrainian citizens died. Millions were sent to Germany for forced labour or to concentration camps. The forced repatriation of hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians after the war led to even more deaths and more inmates for concentration camps. </PARA>
<PARA>  The mortar of brutal repression, however, is now crumbling. This has unleashed amongst many of the Ukrainians a fierce nationalism and a desire to reassert their cultural and ethnic values which have long been denied by Russian and Soviet regimes. With economic and political reform in the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev has created the ideal conditions for this to occur. </PARA>
<PARA>   As honourable members are aware, the Ukraine Supreme Soviet voted in favour of an independence resolution on 25 August 1991. The resolution is subject to ratification by a popular referendum on 1 December this year, and presidential elections are to be held at the same time. This declaration envisages nationalisation of all USSR owned enterprises, the printing of a separate currency, and the creation of a Ukrainian armed force. This followed the Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Ukraine enacted by the Supreme Soviet of the Ukraine on 16 July 1990, which proclaimed:</PARA>
<PARA>the state sovereignty of Ukraine as supremacy, independence, fullness and indivisibility of the republic's authority within the boundaries of its territory, and its independence and equality in external relations. </PARA>
<PARA>On 30 August an eight point cooperation agreement was signed between the Russian Federation and the Ukraine. This is acknowledged as being a step forward, in that Russia has conceded the integrity of the Ukraine's independence and borders, and it lays the foundation for cooperative relations between the two states. </PARA>
<PARA>  We in this place should acknowledge the Ukraine's right to self-determination. Subject to meeting the requirements of international statehood, we should go further and support its independence by diplomatic recognition. But we are obliged to squarely face the difficulties that are associated with this. There needs to be ongoing cooperative arrangements for a sensible and peaceful resolution, particularly of minority interests, as well as the aspirations for independence. </PARA>
<PARA>  It needs to be recognised that the Soviet Union contains more than 100 national groupings. Fifteen of these constitute over 90 per cent of the population. They, too, are characterised by many religious, cultural and linguistic differences. Russians account for over 50 per cent of the population. The other Slavic groups--the Ukrainians and Byelorussians--form roughly 20 per cent; Moslem nationalities, approximately 15 per cent; and the Christians of the Caucasus, Armenia and Georgia, another 3 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are an estimated 60 million Soviet citizens, not all of whom are Russians, who live outside their home ethnic territory. There has been an enormous displacement of peoples within the Soviet Union. This creates enormous difficulties for resolving many of these territorial disputes and claims, as the Soviet Union itself is dismantled. This needs to be understood. It has relevance within the Ukraine, which has a population of 52 million. Of this number, 74 per cent are Ukrainian, 21 per cent are Russian and 5 per cent are Jewish. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australia has a particular role to play in assisting in giving some insights to the Soviet Union into the way in which in a multicultural society these differences can be resolved to cement a new nation. Bill Jergaro, a prominent Australian, and former President of the Ethnic Communities Council, was recently in the Soviet Union and encouraged Russia to offer invitations to Australian leaders who might be able to give some guidance in these matters; and other people are offering the view that Australia ought to invite leading Soviet citizens to Australia to see how these matters work in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are in the draft union treaty proposed, on which President Gorbachev was working before the coup, outlined terms for a Union of Soviet Republics, a new concept. That treaty, of course, did not clarify how and under what conditions a republic of the Soviet Union might secede and the way in which the rights of minority enclaves within each of those republics might also seek to obtain self-determination. </PARA>
<PARA>  These matters are going to occasion a great deal of difficulty and time for resolution, but they are matters which, I think, can be addressed sensibly; and there can be efforts to overcome these obstacles. It is as part of this process that this motion has been put to this House. We in the Opposition recognise the difficulties associated with recognising a new independent state, but these obstacles should be fairly faced and dealt with, particularly as the aspirations for independence are likely to be affirmed when the referendum is dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA>  These difficulties should not be so daunting as to prevent us from supporting the aspirations of the Ukrainian people. We can do so--and the motion suggests them--in some very positive ways: first, by establishing a consulate in the Ukraine; secondly, by opening a trade office in Kiev; and, thirdly, by ensuring that the Ukraine gets a fair share of the training and management scholarships that the Australian Government is offering to the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are enormous benefits for both the Ukraine and Australia in immediately pursuing these measures. The opportunities to participate in the reconstruction of the Ukrainian economy by way of technical assistance and expertise would open up significant opportunities for Australian trade. A consulate would provide many with the opportunity to make contact with families in Australia and to take advantage of Australia's new provisions to facilitate migration from areas of eastern Europe. The establishment of these relationships is an indication that Australia is prepared to accept the realities of a changing Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA>  Whatever path the Ukraine decides to take in the future, whether total independence or part of a reconstructed union, Australia will be in a position to offer a degree of assistance if consular and trade links are already established. For these reasons, I strongly commend this motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I support the motion and, in so doing, I wish to make a few comments about the importance of the Ukraine and what is happening there, not merely for the Ukrainian people and, indeed, the whole of the Soviet Union, but for the world community. In fact, the way in which the issue of the Ukraine and the independence of the Ukraine is handled will determine whether there will be a repeat of the tragedy of Yugoslavia or, hopefully, a much more sensible and peaceful outcome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The problems have some similarity. The outcomes can be different, and there are positive signs everyday that they will be different. One of the most positive signs is, of course, the fact that the independence claims and aspirations of the Ukrainian people are increasingly recognised by the leadership of Russia. Although Russia has a very substantial minority in the Ukraine, it has not panicked or carried on about that minority. It has not sought the redrawing of borders and it has not put armed forces to work, as has been the case in Yugoslavia. On the contrary, the Russian people, under the leadership of Boris Yeltsin, have behaved responsibly with respect to the claims for independence by the Ukraine. </PARA>
<PARA>   Indeed, everyday Yeltsin makes statements which indicate increasing acceptance of the various aspects of the independence claims. For example, I have heard on the news in the last 24 hours that the Russian Government is now seeking to issue its own currency, as distinct from the Soviet currency. We may find that there will be a currency in Russia and a currency in the Ukraine. This is in response to the claims of the Ukraine to issue its currency. One could image that in a similar context elsewhere the response might have been different. However, in this particular case it is very interesting that Boris Yeltsin has decided to accept the assertion of independence by the people of the Ukraine and also to move to ensure that Russia has its own currency, a move which, of course, will accelerate the process of the independent republics. </PARA>
<PARA>   The question might be asked: `Is this necessarily a good thing?' After all, it is a bit strange that the Soviet system, confederation, federation--whatever it is going to be--is moving towards a situation where there are going to be separate currencies, whereas, in fact, the European governments are trying to move towards a situation in which they have one currency for the European Economic Community. </PARA>
<PARA>  One might be puzzled by these apparently contradictory movements in different parts of the world. One ought not to be puzzled, because the fact of the matter is that the circumstances that have allowed the Western European nations, namely, highly developed economic nations, to come together in the European Economic Community and to feel comfortable enough to move towards a common currency do not exist in the Soviet Union as it is today. </PARA>
<PARA>  On the contrary, there are severe economic problems. If it is felt that one way to resolve those economic problems is through fulfilling the nationalist aspirations of the various republics of the Soviet Union in a peaceful way, together with issuing their own currencies where it is felt necessary to do so, then so be it, because the fundamental issue is not whether there are one, two or four currencies, but whether the fundamental economic problems of the Soviet Union are going to be dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA>  The failure in the last two or three years, following the promises of glasnost and perestroika, has been the economic failure within the Soviet Union, the failure to actually achieve economic transformation. It is this failure which has now led a number of the republics, not merely the Ukraine, to push not only their nationalist self-determination claims, but also their claims to have control of their own economies and to work with the other republics of the Soviet Union as independent countries in trying to resolve the trading and economic links that they have. </PARA>
<PARA>  Who is to say that this is not a better approach, given that the other approach has not worked?  It might have been desirable for the other approach to have worked better, but the reality is that it has not. That is a severe problem for the Soviet Union, and it is a severe problem for Mr Gorbachev. He is trying to sustain some authority in the emerging confederation of states but, if he wants to retain some authority in that confederation, he has to be ready to recognise, firstly, that these states will be independent states and, secondly, that any confederation in terms of shared powers must be on the basis of consensus between the governments of the various states, otherwise it will not work. </PARA>
<PARA>  One thing is absolutely clear: the attempt to impose from the centre of the Soviet Union some kind of unity on the basis of an imposed unity--whether it is a military unity, a defence unity or an economic unity--will not work. If there are going to be some common elements of unity amongst those republics, they have to be on the basis of agreements between them. </PARA>
<PARA>  But what about the issue which has become the big problem in Yugoslavia, namely, the question of the minorities?  I was very pleased to see that the President and Government of the Ukraine went out of their way to show to the world that they will be serious about the protection of minorities in the new Ukraine. Mr Kravchuk did this in two ways. Firstly, he apologised to the Jewish people for crimes committed by Ukrainians against the Jewish community during the Second World War or after the Second World War. Secondly, he made it perfectly clear that the new state of Ukraine will place very great emphasis on the protection of the rights of every person, including in particular the minorities, which will be essentially Jewish and Russian. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us hope, therefore, that these assurances are taken on board and that the process of independence, which seems almost inevitably to be moving forward, will not result in violence or tragedy, but will result in sensible dealings between the various states, including the Ukraine. Let us hope that a solution will be reached which is acceptable to the people of the various republics, to the Soviet Union as a whole and to the world community. That is the role that President Gorbachev can play in this transition process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In recent times we have witnessed remarkable changes as the old regimes and dictatorships in eastern Europe have collapsed, to be replaced by a new and significantly different order. Nowhere are these changes more obvious than within the former Soviet Union. Of the republics ruled by the Soviet Union for the past 70 years, the Ukraine is amongst those which have suffered most. It has borne the brunt of a civil war, the collectivisation of the peasants, Stalinist purges that have decimated its population, the Second World War and the suppression of pro-independence movements. Understandably, it is also one the republics now attempting to make the transition from Soviet domination to independent statehood. The efforts of the Ukrainian people to throw off the shackles of their communist past should receive our wholehearted support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Ukraine has been described as an industrial and agricultural powerhouse which, in terms of economic muscle, ranks second only to Russia amongst the 12 Soviet republics. It supplies almost 25 per cent of the Soviet Union's food, 25 per cent of its coal, and 20 per cent of its machinery and chemicals. In common with other peoples living in the Soviet Union, Ukrainians have for far too many years been denied their basic right of self-determination. Under the strict and repressive controls formerly imposed from afar in Moscow, they have had no chance to participate directly in the affairs of their own republic. </PARA>
<PARA>  During the years of Soviet rule, the Ukrainian people's cultural and social heritage has been systematically whittled away. Once productive agricultural land has been ruined by poor management, lack of technical expertise and overexploitation. The Chernobyl disaster is but one notorious example of the appalling manner in which the welfare and well-being of the Ukrainian people have been ignored by Moscow's bureaucrats. Five years down the track, they have still not been told the whole truth about this nuclear accident or the full extent of the impact this disaster has had and will continue to have on their lives. </PARA>
<PARA>  But now all this is changing. The Ukraine declared its independence on 24 August this year immediately after the failed Moscow coup. On 1 December, its 52 million people will vote to decide whether or not they should ratify that declaration. After years of repression and neglect, the opportunity now exists for the Ukrainian people to directly participate in deciding their future and that of their nation. At last they will be able once again to take control of their own political, social and economic destiny. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is important that bipartisan support be shown for this motion moved by my colleague the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock). The Ukrainian people need to know that, should their declaration of independence receive the popular endorsement that is already widely anticipated and should they also meet the established criteria for independence, Australia is prepared to join with other members of the international community in moving to accept and formally recognise the Ukraine as an independent state. Like all independent states, the Ukraine should be free to determine the nature of its relations and associations with other states without pressures or influence being exerted from outside. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition believes that the Australian Government must take the appropriate action to acknowledge the changes that are occurring in what used to be the Soviet Union. Such action should include the establishment of closer diplomatic and trade links and improved political relations between Australia and the Ukraine. Already several countries, including the United States and Canada, have set up consulates in Kiev, whilst a number of European countries maintain a diplomatic presence there. We believe the Australian Government should follow these examples and establish its own consulate in the Ukraine. We also believe that the Australian Government should recognise the enormous economic potential of the Ukraine and establish a trade office in Kiev. This latter initiative would undoubtedly help to increase trade between Australia and the Ukraine, providing mutual benefits to both countries and contributing to the reconstruction of the Ukrainian economy. </PARA>
<PARA>  By taking these initiatives outlined in this motion, Australia will not only be demonstrating its support for the current aspirations of the Ukrainian people to regain control of their own destiny, but will also be making a wise investment for the future. I commend the motion to the House. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-As the representative of one of Australia's major concentrations of Ukrainians, in an electorate which also hosts their major religious and cultural institutions, I have pleasure in supporting this motion. I think it must be conceded that the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) has had a consistency on this issue which far exceeds that of most honourable members. He has for many years campaigned around these issues, and this is but one of his many motions that I have seen on the Notice Paper in my period in the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It is propitious that the motion comes before the House so soon after the commemorations of the massacres in Kiev in relation to Babi Yar. One of the concerns that have grown about events in eastern Europe is that, in the aftermath of the decline of repressive regimes, fairly atavistic instincts have surfaced, and throughout eastern Europe fairly major racial differences, where minorities are greatly threatened within some of the countries seeking independence, can be seen. </PARA>
<PARA>  The fact that the Ukrainian regime puts such an emphasis on the commemoration of the mass murder of Jews, gipsies and Byelorussians, et cetera, by the Nazi forces with, as has been conceded, some cooperation by elements in the Ukraine, is a good indication that we can be hopeful that this regime will uphold some of the liberal values that it has advocated. I note that in paragraph (iv) of the declaration of state sovereignty of the Ukraine, which has been mentioned earlier, there is the comment that it guarantees equality before the law of all citizens of the republic regardless of their ancestry, social or property status, racial or national identity, sex, education, language, political views and religious beliefs. Obviously the future of the distinct minorities in the Ukraine--half a million Byelorussians, 10 million Russians, half a million Jews, et cetera--is of major concern. It is not really relevant that the Russian movement there has been to some degree state instigated. It is not really relevant that some of those people might have a belief that Ukrainian independence threatens their rights. What is relevant is the support of the values I have put forward. </PARA>
<PARA>  The espousing of our position today comes at a very timely period. It follows the process of events after the attempted putsch in the Soviet Union in August. While there can be resistance over many decades, as there has been, this development clearly stems from Mr Gorbachev's moves and the founding in 1989 of RUKH, the people's movement of the Ukraine, and its declaration in March 1990 that it would operate as an opposition group advocating independence. It is acknowledged that in July 1990 the Ukrainian declaration went beyond those of the Baltic States in so far as it advocated organising its army and that its internal security and state security operations come under its own control, and moved to veto the transfer of Ukrainian citizens outside its borders. </PARA>
<PARA>  At that stage it also made demands in relation to gold and currency. We are aware that in recent weeks that particular issue has come to the fore with the moves by the Ukrainians to construct their own currency and the withholding of roubles by the Soviet Union to the point where wages have been delayed in many parts of the Ukraine. </PARA>
<PARA>  This motion advocates measures with regard to a consulate, to trade ties and to Australia's aid. We are not saying that we recognise independence; we are saying that that should stem from the decision of the Ukrainian people in December. We are talking in this case of a nation that is viable--as has been said, it is a nation of 52 million people. It is a major player in coal to the point where it is seen as the second largest coal area after the Appalachians. It is a major supplier of sugar beet, wheat, iron ore, et cetera. As has been said, some of its production levels have been compared with France and countries in western Europe. </PARA>
<PARA>  So we are talking about a viable country, a group of people which has obviously displayed cultural cohesiveness and which, from 1917 to 1920, had independence which was recognised by 40 countries. It had won historical interest. Typical of the Ukraine's importance at that stage was that it was on Europe's first passenger plane route, from Paris to Kiev. That is typical of the world's perception of it at that stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I have much pleasure this morning in speaking in favour of the motion of the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) advocating that the Government introduce a scheme modelled on the British tax exempt special savings account, or TESSA, in order to facilitate the growth of domestic savings and the encouragement of Australian investment in Australian domestic industry, research and development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  While there does not appear to be any great disagreement with the proposal that it would be desirable to have a high level of domestic savings, there has been much debate in  Australia--indeed, I would suggest much hysteria--about the supposed decline in Australia's national savings. An increase in Australia's national savings would mean that we could find more investment without the need to draw on the savings of other countries, whether by borrowing their money or selling their equity in Australia's assets. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australia's level of domestic saving compares poorly with that of other OECD countries. However, Australians are not as spendthrift as is often made out. Most OECD countries are experiencing a similar long term downward trend in savings. It is interesting to consider a number of trends in Australia's national saving rate and to compare them with those trends in the OECD. One popular measure of household saving--net saving as a proportion of household income--has halved, from 12 per cent in the mid-1970s to 6 per cent in 1990-91. Net household saving also similarly has fallen as a proportion of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are, of course, problems associated with the use of such savings ratios in getting a handle on just what is happening in this country. First, it often makes more sense to look at the overall private savings rate rather than the more volatile household and corporate rates, as savings in one sector are usually offset by changes in the other. Secondly, when we ignore the spurious savings peak in the mid-1970s--which was caused in part by an excess rate of inflation--we are left with a remarkably stable private savings rate over the past three decades. Gross national savings averaged 24 per cent in the 1960s, it rose to 26 per cent in the first half of the 1970s and has averaged around 20 per cent since the early 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government is currently advocating superannuation as a means of both increasing Australia's national saving and providing for the retirement of baby boomers early next century. The Opposition, on the other hand, advocates a consumption tax as the means of boosting national savings. Both the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), and the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), have made those sorts of claims. Interestingly, again, looking at the OECD shows that experience in most other countries gives no other evidence to support such a contention. </PARA>
<PARA>  Far from increased savings, many Australians may in fact find increased prices eating into their savings and reducing the value of the savings they have already accumulated--their house, their superannuation and other savings; their nest egg. One does not have to be too bright to realise that the result of that would be somewhat unfair. The evidence from the examination of trends in savings ratios in other OECD countries, many of which have consumption taxes, shows no correlation between tax mix and savings. </PARA>
<PARA>  Looking at most of those countries it is obvious that since the early 1970s there has been a downward trend in savings;  that is, falling savings are not confined to Australia. That is a trend which has been evident, as I have suggested, across the OECD. The fact is that there is no basis for the assertion that a consumption tax will improve this nation's savings effort, a point recognised only two years ago by the Leader of the Opposition when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I don't think a consumption tax is inevitable in the 90s. People overseas who have advocated it to boost savings have been disappointed when it hasn't . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I am surprised he has changed his tune now. The catalyst for the honourable member for Denison proposing this scheme is that a scheme was introduced in the United Kingdom in the financial statement and Budget report of 1990-91 by the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, John Major. That particular announcement saw a tax exempt special savings scheme introduced, and the British Government published information documents about it. The key points were explained by the honourable member for Denison when the plan was outlined in the House previously, but I will go through one or two of them briefly once again. </PARA>
<PARA>  The first is that taxpayers are limited to one account. Secondly, no person can open more than one account at a time. Thirdly, husbands and wives can each open separate accounts. Fourthly, one cannot retain tax exempt status if there is a withdrawal of capital, although there may be some access to interest in the account. Once capital is touched, the tax exempt status of the account is lost. Finally, accumulated funds are held tax free at the end of five years. The way in which the scheme has been developed minimises the risk that it will be rorted by individuals who have substantial capital to shift around without any resultant improvement in the overall rate of national savings. The scheme is also commendable on the basis that it would assist in addressing equity issues for small wealth holders. </PARA>
<PARA>  As honourable members would be aware, the way in which wealth is held has implications for its treatment by the taxation system. Australia's tax system today is far more equitable than the shambles the conservatives left us in 1983. I remind honourable members that under that system high rates of marginal tax acted to encourage the wealthiest sectors of the Australian community to shelter income as capital. Under the Liberal's disreputable taxation system, the wealthy who were able to invest in land or property were sheltered from tax liability. However, a distinction between capital gains and returns on other investments persists today. Under the capital gains tax regime, which this Government introduced, only real returns--that is, inflation adjusted returns--are taxed. </PARA>
<PARA>  The small wealth holder, on the other hand, does not have at his or her disposal the ability to shelter liquid assets from the taxation of that part of their return which compensates individuals for inflation. It should also be noted, as Australia gets on top of its inflation rate, which it is doing very well at the moment, that this anomaly will become much less significant. Addressing the question of adjusting all returns for the rate of inflation so that only real returns are taxed would result in an expensive and complex regime at odds with fundamental principles of tax law: it should be inexpensive to administer and simple to understand. The issue is one of horizontal equity--to ensure that all savings options are treated similarly. Of course, this will also address issues of vertical equity, since, as I have already noted, the savings options available to wealthy Australians are not available to all. </PARA>
<PARA>  The TESSA scheme, as proposed in the United Kingdom, is also commendable on the basis that it targets a savings cap. In the UK this cap, as I have indicated, is #9,000. That translates in Australian terms to about $30,000. In this way the scheme is structured to protect the interests of those with moderate amounts to invest. But will it assist in increasing national savings? Schemes to allow unlimited tax free returns on bank accounts are unlikely to address the totality of Australia's national savings. In Britain it appears that the scheme has worked in attracting investment funds into savings accounts. Rates in these accounts are very competitive. Vivien Goldsmith, the money editor of the Independent on Sunday, observed in an article of 20 January 1991:</PARA>
<PARA>The TESSA scramble for funds is sending the rates sky high. It has been very popular. </PARA>
<PARA>Lindsay Cook, of the Guardian, said at that time:</PARA>
<PARA>As Tessamania continues, several institutions have this week improved their tax-free accounts or introduced new ones. </PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Denison has suggested that any TESSA scheme incorporate measures to ensure that the funds raised be directed at least partially towards Australian industry and Australian development. I wholeheartedly support that statement. I am not arguing that institutions should not be left to invest as they see fit, but I think it proper that funds so raised be directed to targeted investments which will help Australia's industry infrastructure. While I reject the histrionic claim that Australians no longer save, I acknowledge that any increase in Australia's rate of savings would be a welcome development and, accordingly, this motion should be commended and supported. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is important to recognise that funds are available at present through superannuation funds but that this proposal's being supported, as it is by honourable members on this side of the House, would provide an additional source of revenue, hopefully to some degree targeted to improving industrial development in this country where investment and venture capital is lacking. I would hope that those honourable members on the other side give appropriate consideration to it. I call on the Government to give appropriate consideration to this, as I am sure it will in the passage of time. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am surprised that the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin), the Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, which is inquiring into the banking industry, has not been able to enlighten me a little more about the effects of this motion. He took some time to once again talk about the goods and services tax. I do not particularly want to get into that debate in detail this morning, except to say to him that there is no doubt in my mind, nor in the minds of most of the experts, that a consumption tax is pro-saving almost by definition to the extent that it discourages consumption. One does not need to be an economist to figure out that, if consumption diminishes, saving increases. We do not actually pretend that that is the No.1 reason for introducing a goods and services tax. There are a large number of very good reasons why Australia desperately needs a new tax system and why it needs as a part of that a broad based consumption tax. It is, nevertheless, pro-saving and there will be a positive saving effect from such a tax. To the extent that that is not evident--I take the point that perhaps there has not been great evidence in some other countries for it--then it is for other reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I want to make the point very clearly in refuting what the honourable member said that a consumption tax is by definition pro-saving and there will be a positive saving effect. It is interesting, if we talk about changing tunes, as he did, to look back to what happened in 1985 when both the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), and the current Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) were absolutely excited about the prospect of introducing a broad based consumption tax. They knew then--I suspect that if they were honest, they know now--that it was in the best interests of Australia for a lot of reasons. </PARA>
<PARA>  Having said that, I have no real problem with the sentiments expressed in this motion. We desperately need to encourage saving. There is no doubt that we have a major problem in this country that has been occasioned by a lack of saving. In effect, in recent years we have been a major dissaver. This is largely the explanation for the enormous net international debt of $130 billion which we now have and the prospect if we do not do something about it--in effect, to take measures to encourage people to save--of that debt continuing to grow. </PARA>
<PARA>  Some models, which are rather frightening, suggest that even by June 1996 that net debt could blow out to $240 billion and be almost 45 per cent of gross national product. In recent years we have lived off other people's savings. Perhaps it is fortunate that there are countries around where people do save. That is all very well. Perhaps to the extent that other people's savings have flowed into investment in this country--there was a great deal of investment going on through the middle 1980s--that is a good thing. But it cannot go on forever. We need investment in this country but to a large extent we have to provide for that ourselves. The only way we will do that is to save. </PARA>
<PARA>  I heard the honourable member for Macarthur speaking earlier about net household savings as a percentage of disposable household income. I assume that that is what he was referring to. No matter how we interpret these figures, it is a fact that the latest figure for the household savings ratio--4.3 per cent in the June quarter--is actually the lowest on record. Since 1974 there has been a consistent downward trend in household savings--from 15.6 per cent in 1974 to this figure of 4.3 per cent. This has to be lifted if we are to be serious. The way we will do that is to encourage people to save. </PARA>
<PARA>  The motion envisages a method of encouraging people to save. My concern about the motion in practice is that I believe there are already on the market a significant number of products along the same lines. I cannot see that the motion actually achieves anything that is not already in place. They are generally called open-ended savings plans and they already exist. My only real concern about the motion is whether it is necessary. (Time expired)</PARA>

Even today, the brokered peace by Mikhail Gorbachev between the Presidents of both Croatia and Serbia, the ninth such occasion on which such a cease-fire has been brokered, has been breached. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is not the time to add fuel to the fire of ancient animosities. It is a time for constructive and decisive diplomatic action to push for a negotiated peace and to provide much needed medical and humanitarian aid. It is time to look to the future. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is quite clear that Yugoslavia, as we know it, is falling apart. Reports indicate that Bosnia-Hercegovina has approved moves towards independence. This republic contains three major ethnic groups of which Muslims make up 44 per cent, almost a third are Serbian and nearly one-fifth are Croats. The Serbian deputies walked out before the vote was taken because they wanted to remain in the Yugoslav federation but this was not the case with the other two groups. </PARA>
<PARA>  Bosnia-Hercegovina borders both Croatia and Serbia. This development has only added to the heightened concerns of negotiators within the European Community that a full-blown civil war is imminent and that it will not be contained within the borders of old Yugoslavia. Clearly, if the dismantling of Yugoslavia is to be achieved in a peaceful and satisfactory way to all parties, the question of ethnic minorities must be settled, and the wish of all of us is that it will be settled without violence. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I said in my speech on the Gulf war earlier this year, international lawlessness remains a feature of international relations. Underlying acts of aggression is a belief that the rest of the world and its international agencies are impotent to act. I would like to believe that they are not. </PARA>
<PARA>  Part of this motion urges the Australian Government to support international efforts for a negotiated settlement. The Opposition has constructively led the debate and pushed the Government to take initiatives. It has urged the Government to protest in the strongest terms to the Yugoslav Government. It has called for international intervention, including the involvement of the United Nations. On the day of the Yugoslav invasion of Croatia, the Opposition condemned the use of military force and called for immediate dialogue. </PARA>
<PARA>  In August, I was acting as foreign affairs spokesman for the Opposition. I urged the Australian Government to support the mission by three European Community Foreign Ministers to try to negotiate a cease-fire. On 6 August, I condemned the Government's inactivity and urged it then to back a role for the United Nations in mediating what was by then an escalating conflict. On 16 August, Senator Hill urged the Australian Government to recall its Ambassador to Yugoslavia for talks on diplomatic recognition of Yugoslavia's evolving independent states. He also moved a motion in the Senate deploring the violence which had taken place in Slovenia and Croatia and called on the Government again to support international efforts for a negotiated settlement between the Yugoslav republics. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Australian Government had offered some platitudes but it had taken no real initiatives to support the peaceful transition to the establishment of new independent states. Regrettably, the Government opposed the motion--that is this motion--after changing its mind several times in the Senate. This clearly demonstrated a degree of indifference to the deep concern that the Opposition and the people of this country feel about the future for the peoples of Slovenia, Croatia and the other evolving independent states within the Yugoslav federation. The motion was finally passed with the support of the Australian Democrats and Senator Harradine. </PARA>
<PARA>  On 26 August, Senator Hill called upon the Government to press for action by the international community to negotiate a withdrawal of the Yugoslav army from Croatia and to urge the United Nations Security Council to step in to avert disaster. The Opposition also urged the Government to press for the International Committee of the Red Cross to be permitted to help the refugees from its headquarters in Geneva rather than through its office in Belgrade. Clearly, it is unlikely that Croatian refugees or asylum seekers would be able to travel with impunity to Belgrade to seek asylum. </PARA>
<PARA>  We also asked the Government to give action in the form of relief via the International Committee of the Red Cross. Of course, a week later, the Government did accede to that and announced $100,000 in relief. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) urged the Government to provide humanitarian support directly to Zagreb in the form of urgently needed medical requirements and the provision of consular support in Zagreb so that the Croatian people seeking visas to Australia would no longer have to apply through Belgrade. We urged the Government to support the European Community proposal for a peace conference. </PARA>
<PARA>  We noted the indifference of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Evans) on this issue. It forced the Opposition to approach the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and we urged him to actively support the European Community's proposal that the Government of Yugoslavia take part in a cease-fire and conference. We urged the Prime Minister to press the Yugoslav Government to ensure that all its forces were withdrawn from Croatia. </PARA>
<PARA>  When the cease-fire was breached in late August, the Opposition again approached the Government to end its inactivity on the crisis and to lodge an immediate protest with Belgrade. Still no action was taken, even after the Opposition's suggestion to back United Nation's involvement. The Prime Minister's indication on national television that he would pursue the matter regrettably did not lead to immediate action on the Government's part. While the Government has remained quiet, the crisis has deepened. There has been a tragic escalation in the loss of life and, increasingly, the possibility that the conflict could spread beyond Yugoslavia. In terms of loss of life, I read today that the number of people who have been killed in this conflict has reached 1,000. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have repeated our call for the Government to recall the Ambassador so that talks can be undertaken to determine the appropriate timing for Australia's recognition of both Croatia and Slovenia. However, this, and statements by the Chairman of the Yugoslav Presidency, Mr Stipe Mesic, which indicated that the Yugoslav forces were not under constitutional control, still failed to elicit a positive response from the Government. The Prime Minister's response to the clear and immediate concerns of the Opposition was that the Australian Ambassador to the United Nations was keeping abreast of developments. </PARA>
<PARA>  Throughout this entire crisis, the Opposition has been actively and, might I say, constructively involved in trying to find appropriate solutions to the complex and very difficult problems facing Yugoslavia. Last week, we again had to push the Government to consider taking action in the form of United Nations sanctions and an oil embargo on Yugoslavia. Regrettably, Senator Evans, to date, has refused to commit the Government to this action. In this regard, I would like to quote my colleague Senator Hill:</PARA>
<PARA>  At a time when all vestiges of constitutional authority have broken down and the Croatian capital of Zagreb is being pounded by Yugoslav forces, it is simply not good enough to say that Australia is still thinking about action in the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA>  For the sake of those suffering from the appalling violence being perpetrated in Croatia, Australia should move now. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a role for Australia. We cannot determine these matters, but we can play a constructive role. We have large communities here in Australia of people from the Balkans. In this context, I think it is appropriate that we should be seen to be brokers, using the best of goodwill to try to assist, and this motion is put forward in that context. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would like to say, as shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, that it is a very difficult time for the people from the Balkans--Serbs, Croats and others. It is a time for them to exercise freedom of speech, to participate in informed debate, to help us with advice and counselling, but to do so in a non-violent way and to demonstrate properly. In these matters, we have seen great caution exercised by the communities in Australia, but it is important that that continue and that people not be provoked in what is obviously a very difficult situation. </PARA>
<PARA>  I hope that the comments that I make and the comments that my colleagues make in seeking to assist in this matter are seen as constructive and sensible comments in what is a very difficult situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-At a time when democratisation and a rare sense of goodwill and hope are sweeping through the old Iron Curtain into central and eastern Europe, Yugoslavia stands as one black spot on an otherwise promising horizon. To be more precise, what is being done to the people and the historic and beautiful towns and cities of Croatia is a lot more than just a euphemistic black spot--it is a tragedy of unbelievable proportions which has the potential to escalate into a central European nightmare.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The tremendously sad part about the war in Croatia is that it is all so unnecessary. We hear much about the historical complexities which have led to the inevitable confrontation. We have also heard, although not from the protagonists themselves, that there are no easily quantified rights or wrongs, only understandable human differences which have developed through competing aspirations of a difficult past. I am sorry to say that I cannot accept such simplistic propaganda. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is true to say that Yugoslavia is something of a European ethnic melting pot, full of contradictions and paradoxes. Created as an expedient after World War I, it has been a land with highly questionable internal borders, a difficult history during World War II, a volatile religious mix, and economic and political systems which themselves have created mistrust and divisiveness. However, it would be a large mistake for people to believe the propagandists when they say that this dispute has evolved from the existence of ethnically based problems. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have personally been to Slovenia and Croatia three times in the last two years and I believe, contrary to what other people believe, that I am fairly well versed in the politics and personalities of the region. Make no mistake, this conflict was avoidable. It became a certainty only because of the existence of a Stalinist government in Serbia, which, in the fashion of communism, has dreamed only of conquest and expansion--dreams which have suited the self-interest agenda of the now disgraced generals in the Yugoslav People's Army who have done everything but act in the capacity that should have been their obligation as peacemakers. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the 10 minutes that I have to speak on this issue, I obviously cannot go into great detail about the reality of politics Serbian-style. The real issues themselves may not be complex, but the machinations of Serbian leader Milosevic and his puppets in Kosovo and Vojvodina would take some time to cover, and we have not got that time today. I can, however, offer something of an overview of my impression of developments in that sad region and indicate my support for the most worthwhile motion moved by the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing). </PARA>
<PARA>  Although all of the five points in the honourable member's motion are worthy of support, I preface my general comments by making two small observations. The first is the obvious reflection that the number of civilians killed has risen dramatically since the motion was moved. As the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) has already stated, it is somewhere in the region of 1,000--although it is hard to find some figures, because the deaths have obviously been played down by both sides. Secondly, I would have some reservations about the necessity of recalling the Australian Ambassador for consultations. In this day and age, with modern communication methods, such action is not required to facilitate debriefing. I also feel that taking the Ambassador out of the firing line might limit our ability to collect accurate information. We should subtly convey our desire to see peace initiatives stepped up. As I said before, however, those are minor points. Basically, the motion stands as a commonsense expression of Australia's commitment to democracy, peace, self-determination and negotiation. </PARA>
<PARA>  As honourable members would know, the current controversy has its roots in the decisions of Croatia and Slovenia to secede from the socialist republic of Yugoslavia. Those decisions, which originally came into effect on 25 June 1991, followed democratic plebiscites which voted for independence. The Croatian plebiscite was supported by 94.7 per cent of voters, and honourable members must admit that that is a tremendously decisive result. Quite frankly, it was my research into this result, my discussions with Croatian leaders and the wording of the new Croatian constitution which convinced me that the new Croatia deserved this chance to stand alone amongst the nations of the world. </PARA>
<PARA>  To those honourable members who have not read the Croatian constitution I recommend it as excellent reading. It is a document which has taken the best from a range of constitutions, including the Australian Constitution, and which is extremely difficult to criticise. I challenge anybody to find any criticism to offer. Quite frankly, a cursory reading of it quickly destroys much of the argument which has been used by Milosevic to justify his invasion of Croatia, that being that the Serbian minority in and around Krajina would suffer discrimination at the hands of the Croatian majority. It is a claim which has been backed up with all sorts of allegations, such as that the cyrillic alphabet is now banned in Croatia, that Orthodox Croatians are not allowed to occupy public service and other senior positions, and that Orthodox churches are subject to desecration and attack. </PARA>
<PARA>  If those things are happening, then the Orthodox Croatians I spoke to in Zagreb, Dubrovnik and other parts of Croatia must have been excellent liars. I took the trouble to visit the homes of ethnically mixed couples in cities such as Zadar to get a feel of the level of ethnic compatibility. I found no evidence whatsoever of any victimisation or any animosity towards any minority grouping; however, I did detect a general across-ethnic fear of Milosevic and his stooges. </PARA>
<PARA>  To be fair to the Orthodox Serbians living in the racially mixed Serbo-Croat towns in eastern Slovenia, such as Borovo, Sello and Vukovar, there exists a genuine belief that future Croatian governments will pursue policies of victimisation. Those people accept the bona fides of the constitution for now, but do not accept that it will hold good in the future. They cannot be blamed for this belief, particularly as Milosevic and his `greater Serbia' allies have played on old animosities and brought in propagandists to spread the message. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I said before, this dispute has nothing to do with any fears of a free Croatia, but everything to do with the Serbian leader's aspirations for a new Serbia, which in his opinion stretches from the Adriatic in the south-west, through to the heartlands of Bosnia-Herzegovina, into northern Macedonia and on to Kosovo, Vojvodina and into parts of Montenegro. That is the real problem. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is important for us to understand that the public of Serbia--this is the most important point of my speech--cannot be blamed for the excesses of their government and the Serbian dominated Army. In a sense, they are innocent victims, caught as the Croatian public in a senseless conflict, which at the end of the day can be resolved only by negotiation and compromise. The obvious first thing that needs to happen to end the conflict is for the Yugoslav People's Army to cease its murderous activities. I do not believe it is possible for the Army to supervise a cease-fire, as it is thoroughly disgraced and compromised. </PARA>
<PARA>  I cannot help feeling that Croatia has every reason to be disappointed that the West has not prized its fledgling democracy rather more highly. Perhaps Croatia was naive to hope for early recognition of its independence declaration, and perhaps it has been that naivety which has cost the republic so dearly. However, should all other means fail, that course of action might yet be the most sensible. After all, the West has a proud reputation of ensuring that bullies do not succeed. I commend the motion by the honourable member for Moore to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- I commend the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace) for his contribution to this debate this afternoon. I will read the fourth paragraph of the motion moved by my colleague the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) on behalf of the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock). It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  That the House:</PARA>
<PARA>    .  .  . </PARA>
<PARA>  (4)  calls on the Australian Government to support international efforts for a negotiated settlement between the Yugoslav republics which will avoid conflict, achieve the independence which the people of Croatia and Slovenia demand and protect the interests of ethnic and religious minorities;</PARA>
<PARA>It seems almost a lifetime since that motion was moved in this House. No-one in this place can obtain any joy from what has happened in Yugoslavia since that motion was moved. </PARA>
<PARA>  Mr Deputy Speaker, as you are well aware, the Serbians and the Croatians are well represented in this country. I congratulate them on their peaceful approach to this problem in their adopted country. They have not sought to extend the conflict from their homeland into Australia--into Australian streets or between themselves here--and we can all be extremely grateful for their attitude to date in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA>  They are however justifiably passionate about what is happening in their homeland. A large number of people from that area but not born there have quite justly taken up the cause with the passion of their parents and grandparents. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have been approached personally by members of the Croatian community in Ballarat, of which there are a large number. I was fortunate enough to have long and detailed discussions with Mr Ben Duka, who is the head of the Croatian community in Ballarat. He has a sensible approach to this; he is not looking to in any way incite Australia to what is happening in Yugoslavia. But he pleaded with me to ensure that, first, this Parliament is aware of the situation and, secondly, this Parliament does something about the atrocities being committed in Croatia against the relatives of a large number of the Croatian people living in Australia and against their culture. </PARA>
<PARA>  Effectively, thousands of years of cultural history are being destroyed, and that is to say nothing of the deplorable loss of life that the honourable member for Dundas and the honourable member for Fowler have referred to this morning. I very much doubt whether it is limited to a thousand civilians; I rather suspect that the figures may be far more horrific. </PARA>
<PARA>  Mr Duka, during our discussions, gave me a couple of videotapes which outlined some of the atrocities that have been committed during this war. I can assure honourable members that I felt physically sick when I saw those. I pray that this dispute will be resolved very quickly. </PARA>
<PARA>  The argument--it has been used in this House before--that the conflict is thousands of miles away is a total cop-out. In the past this House has shown an ability to appropriately and properly intervene in these sorts of disputes. It is appropriate for this House to address those concerns, as we are doing today. </PARA>
<PARA>  This dispute will be resolved only by recognising Croatia. The European Community has been very slack in its approach to the matter. I urge it to take a far more active role in addressing this conflict so that we can stop the wanton destruction of both people and heir property. This is a group that deserves protection. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In this debate I will take an Australian perspective to the attitude that should be adopted by Australia in dealing with the tragedy occurring in Yugoslavia. I and the Government do not have any trouble with the first, second, third and fourth parts of the notice of motion, but I oppose the fifth paragraph, which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Further calls upon the Australian Government to recall its Ambassador to Yugoslavia for consultations on how Australia might, consistent with a desire to preserve peace, support the newly evolving, independent states, including the most appropriate time to give diplomatic recognition. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government will also oppose it if the matter is brought to a vote. It should be opposed for good reasons. The first is that this Government does not recall its ambassadors simply at the invitation or the whim of any group in this country unless there are very strong grounds to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>  Our mission in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, provides this Government with a first-hand account of developments and assessments of the fighting and the political activities occurring in Yugoslavia. The people at our mission in Yugoslavia also assist Australians in Yugoslavia with consular and other needs that the mission may have the capacity to provide them with. Very importantly, our people in our mission in Yugoslavia maintain the lines of communication with local authorities, political leaders and other embassies that have an involvement in the situation. The mission does this to keep our Government informed as to the situation from day to day. Apart from the general issues in Yugoslavia and in that region of the world, this issue cannot--and Australia will not allow it to--be considered in isolation. </PARA>
<PARA>  In so far as the call to give diplomatic recognition to these states in Yugoslavia is concerned, let me say this: international law requires four principles to be satisfied prior to a government taking the step of recognising another country as an independent nation. First, it must decide whether there is a definable, independent population; secondly, it must have a definable independent territory; thirdly, it must have an independent government; and, finally, that particular government must have a capacity to deal with domestic affairs and to conduct an independent foreign policy and must be able to exercise the power that goes with the exercise of administering foreign relations. </PARA>
<PARA>  At present these internal republics in Yugoslavia do not satisfy all those criteria. Until such time as that occurs the Australian Government should not take any unilateral steps. It would be most inappropriate for it to give recognition to these constituent areas known as Croatia, Serbia and so forth, which currently exist in Yugoslavia. I am sure that Australia will be among the first to recognise the republics once they have satisfied those principles of international law. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Australian Government has repeatedly called on all the parties of the conflict to respect the cease-fire agreement arranged on 20 August between the presidents of the six Yugoslav republics and the federal collective presidency. That meeting on 20 August succeeded in agreeing to a four-point plan involving the recognition of the right of the people to self-determination. It included the cessation of hostilities, respect for the democratically expressed will of all the peoples, equal treatment of all political options without the use of force, and legal implementation of that accord, which was worked out as long ago as 20 August. But there has not been a peaceful resolution of this situation. </PARA>
<PARA>  I take this opportunity to call again for a concerted effort by the parties involved to reach a negotiated settlement so as to end the fighting which is threatening not only the people of Yugoslavia but also the security of the region. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-About 18 months ago one of the most costly, disruptive and disgraceful episodes ever to be recorded in the annals of Australian industrial relations drew to a long overdue, painful and, in some respects, most unsatisfactory conclusion. I refer, of course, to the so-called pilots dispute. It is not my intention today to rehash the pros and cons of the dispute. Instead, I want to examine some of its after-effects. Although most commentators regard 21 March 1990 as the date on which the dispute officially concluded, in reality for many it has never ended.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Accurate statistics are not readily available, so the following figures are approximate only, but they give a reasonable picture of the current situation. Only about 25 per cent of the pilots employed by the major domestic airlines prior to August 1989 are still working for their original employers. Of the remaining 75 per cent, a handful have retired; between 50 and 60 are now employed by Compass; about 650 have been forced to leave Australia to find work overseas; and almost 500 have taken other jobs or are still unemployed. A combined total of between 900 and 1,000 pilots are now employed by Australian, Ansett, East-West and IPEC--an overall reduction of approximately 40 per cent. Of the several hundred foreign pilots who entered Australia during the dispute, many have stayed and it is estimated that about 100, maybe more, are still working here. </PARA>
<PARA>  On 7 December 1989, at a Canberra press club luncheon, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), commenting on the pilots dispute, said:</PARA>
<PARA>At no point have I wanted to see the destruction of the AFAP. That would be anathema to my whole life, to talk about destroying a union. I think the airlines almost had to take the action they did and they had our support. But not, from my view, to exact retribution. </PARA>
<PARA>Apparently, the powers that be in the head offices of our domestic airlines did not share the Prime Minister's sentiments, at least in regard to exacting retribution, because it seems that that is what they have been doing ever since. As a result, hundreds of the very best, most experienced and most dedicated people in Australia's domestic aviation industry have been thrown on the scrap heap and left to rot. Some have been more fortunate and have managed to find alternative employment despite the discrimination they have suffered, and continue to suffer, at the hands of their former employers. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of my constituents comes within this relatively more fortunate category. For nine years before joining Ansett my constituent served as a pilot in the RAAF. He was awarded a special commendation for his flying skill and professionalism. During his 11 years with Ansett he served on F27, Boeing 727 and 767 aircraft. By August 1989 he had successfully completed pilot endorsement training on Boeing 737s and had just commenced command training when the simmering industrial unrest which had been plaguing the domestic air service for some months finally boiled over. And so began the most destructive and shameful period in the aviation history of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA>  When the pilot's dispute erupted, my constituent resigned from Ansett, having received legal advice that it was in his best interests to take this course of action. In doing so, he laid his unblemished record and very promising career on the line. Perhaps had he known then what he knows now he may not have chosen this particular option; but it is always very easy to be wise after the event. Suffice to say that his actions were consistent with those of the vast majority of his AFAP colleagues and were based on what he believed was the best advice and information available at the time. </PARA>
<PARA>  Early in the dispute he realised that his prospects of returning to resume his career with Ansett were, at least in the immediate future, not particularly rosy. He therefore thought it prudent to investigate other employment opportunities. He applied to, was interviewed and tested by and subsequently was offered employment with two of the leading international carriers. At least he had some choice in regard to his future employment. Despite the fact that my constituent was very pleased and grateful to be employed and was determined to make a success of his new career, he continued to maintain contact with Ansett in an endeavour to keep himself appraised of changing company attitudes. </PARA>
<PARA>  On 21 March 1990 he was informed by the AFAP that the recruitment ban had been lifted. First thing next morning he went to the Ansett office at Tullamarine and filled out the appropriate application forms and undertakings. Two weeks later he received a letter from Ansett advising that the company did not have an appointment suitable for him at that time. However, it was suggested that, should Ansett advertise publicly for pilots at some future time, he could submit another application. </PARA>
<PARA>  Over the next few months he wrote several more letters to Ansett emphasising his continuing interest in rejoining the company and updating them in regard to the qualifications and experience he was gaining as a result of his current employment. Each time the response from Ansett consisted of one short sentence:</PARA>
<PARA>We acknowledge receipt of your letter. . . and the contents are noted. </PARA>
<PARA>In October 1990, aware that Ansett was still recruiting small numbers of pilots, my constituent wrote to a senior Ansett executive whom he had known during his previous 11 years employment with the company, seeking further advice and information in regard to his future re-employment prospects. He included with this letter references from several current and former senior Ansett pilots, including the former Manager Flight Standards and several check and training captains. </PARA>
<PARA>  The executive concerned stated in his response that he had read the references and could see no reason why he should disagree with any of them; however, as the employment policy of the company had returned to that which applied before the dispute began, he advised my constituent to continue his career with the international carrier. In light of the continuing discouraging and non-committal responses from his previous employer, it was a totally unexpected development when, in November 1990, my constituent was contacted by a firm of consultant psychologists acting on behalf of Ansett. </PARA>
<PARA>  My constituent was invited, and agreed, to undergo a psychological assessment. These tests were followed by a thorough medical examination and a formal interview with representatives of the Ansett pilot recruitment committee. A couple of weeks later my constituent received a letter from Ansett informing him that it would not be proceeding further with his application for employment. </PARA>
<PARA>  Because he had been advised by the Ansett doctor that his physical health was excellent, and confident that his qualifications, experience and the references he had provided were beyond reproach, he concluded that his psychology test results must have been unsatisfactory. He contacted the consultants who had conducted the tests and whilst, for obvious reasons, they were not in a position to provide him with a copy of the report prepared for Ansett, he was advised that he had received `one of the highest recommendations to date', and that on the basis of his report there was absolutely no reason why Ansett should not have re-employed him. </PARA>
<PARA>  My constituent, whose second name could well be `persistence', then wrote to the Deputy General Manager of Ansett seeking some advice or explanation as to why he had been rejected. The Deputy General Manager in his response reiterated that it was not company policy to comment on employment interviews but that there had been a large number of good applicants for a limited number of positions. He concluded by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>I am sure you will fulfil the role of an airline pilot most successfully. </PARA>
<PARA>This was a strange statement, indeed, from a senior executive of a company which had just rejected my constituent's application. If he had believed what he said and was so confident about the flying abilities of my constituent, why did he not offer him a job? Surely Ansett's employment criteria are based on recruiting people who will be successful pilots? If not, what is the basis of its selection procedures?</PARA>
<PARA>  For the record, I would like to read just a few representative extracts from the references and reports relating to my constituent. They state:</PARA>
<PARA>He proved himself to be a professional and capable operator. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt in regard to his command abilities. </PARA>
<PARA>Any company having him in their employ will gain immeasurably. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . has accumulated an impressive range of aviation experience. . . his aircraft handling ability is at a high standard. </PARA>
<PARA>They are not bad recommendations from one's senior colleagues. In so far as his professional flying ability is concerned, the following comment is an extract from the last simulator flight test he completed with Ansett. The extract stated:</PARA>
<PARA>He produced a consistent high standard of flight management and manipulation throughout. He showed smooth consistency and excellent command ability which was most pleasing to watch. </PARA>
<PARA>The report of his last line check--a test of a pilot's general operational efficiency--which he completed with Ansett, stated:</PARA>
<PARA>All aspects of these flights were very well handled. A mature and professional pilot. </PARA>
<PARA>His current employers are equally impressed with his performance and have sent him several letters congratulating him on his professionalism, dedication and high personal standards. </PARA>
<PARA>  It seems very strange indeed that whilst my constituent is held in such high regard by his peers and is acceptable to two of the best--and, from a recruitment point of view, most competitive--international airlines, both of which require the highest standards, he is not considered suitable by Ansett. Why? He knows the answer; I know the answer; and Ansett knows the answer. It has nothing to do with his competence as a pilot, it is because two years ago he stood up for something which he believed at the time was right. That was his crime and Ansett is determined to punish him for it; not for some months, not even for a few years, but for the rest of his working life. </PARA>
<PARA>  My constituent took no part in the anti-company demonstrations or picket lines; he simply held firm to his beliefs and maintained his loyalty to his union. I know that some honourable members opposite and other people in the community will respond by saying, `The pilots knew what they were doing. They knew the likely consequences of their actions. They brought it all on themselves'. Such assertions may or may not be correct. It can be argued that, if the eventual outcome of the decisions they took had been known to them at the time, the pilots may have changed tack before things got out of hand. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would remind honourable members that changes of heart, when the unintended consequences of decisions or actions actually start to manifest themselves, are not simply the prerogative of pilots but of Prime Ministers, Treasurers and Ministers, too. The only difference is that sometimes some of them get away with it. But that is not the issue here. The real issue is: how much longer are our pilots going to have to pay for what they did? How much longer are their noses going to be rubbed in the dirt? The dispute is over. Let us get our Aussie pilots back where they belong--flying for Australian airline companies in Australian skies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I rise not only to grieve for a particular group of young people in our community but also to enlist their aid to ensure that they take notice of the grievance which I am about to pursue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  As many honourable members will know, currently within our community there is an enormous spate of weddings. They seem very popular and fashionable. The day should be a very memorable occasion for the individuals involved and their families. It is in this context of joy and happiness that I bring this grievance. </PARA>
<PARA>  A number of my constituents have raised an issue with me which goes to the very heart of what our society and our Government is about; that is, ensuring that consumers' rights are protected from those people who choose to practise in a manner which often is not fair and just. </PARA>
<PARA>  Many young people choose to hire wedding gowns and garments because they are unable to afford to pay for them. We all know that wedding gowns can cost in the region of a couple of thousand dollars. Such expenditure is beyond the poor and the disadvantaged in our community and so they choose the option of hiring. One would assume that to hire from one of the largest companies in Brisbane, a company called Deons, which has been trading for a very long time, would be a sensible thing to do and that such a firm would ensure that the very best business practices were pursued. </PARA>
<PARA>  Recently a young lady and her party went to choose some material; in fact, the company was even willing to make new gowns, which would seem to me to be a very sound business practice. The matter was pursued with the staff, and sizes, the cost and so on were all discussed and a deposit was asked for. The young people left feeling quite happy that they had made a reasonable choice in their financial circumstances. They were happy in the belief that another little task was completed and that their wedding would proceed. </PARA>
<PARA>  A return visit was made to check on fittings and materials. However, a number of problems arose. The bridesmaids' dresses were not the right size and the material was not quite the same as had been chosen and they were asked to come back in a week or two. Again, the wedding party spent more money on train fares and travel to town. They all thought that, this time, they would be able to try on the frocks, but this did not happen yet again. </PARA>
<PARA>  At this stage other members of the family became involved. Various people suggested that, having paid a deposit, it would be the requisite time to ask whether the dresses would ever eventuate and, if not, whether the deposit should be collected and the party should go to another establishment. </PARA>
<PARA>  There was at this stage enormous difficulty in getting a decision on whether the deposit was refundable or whether the garments were ever going to emerge. This matter caused enormous distress to members of the party. </PARA>
<PARA>  The staff member then informed the young people in question that the deposit was not refundable and advised them to read the bottom line in the small print where they would see that this was the case. The young people said, `This is quite extraordinary. Are you saying that you cannot give me exactly what I want in the right size and the right material?'. Usually the company then offers something which is considerably dearer. One of my constituents found that, two days before her wedding, she was charged hundreds of dollars extra for a dress she did not want because her requirements were unable to be met. </PARA>
<PARA>  The problem with the deposit ensued. Where does one go to in moments such as this? The company concerned is a member of the Small Business Association of Australia and these people decided that their consumer rights could best be addressed by pursuing the matter with that Association. Many associations ensure that their members act in the very best way, that they give business the best name they can and that their consumers are treated in the right way. Of this we have no doubt. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, there is a difficulty in this case because the President of the Small Business Association of Australia is also the proprietor of the shop. A staff member of the Small Business Association of Australia said, `A complaint can only be made to the proprietor'. A great battle ensued. There were discussions, a number of phone calls, and the people concerned came to my office in distress. The wedding was drawing nearer. I might say that this was not the first time that this had happened with this particular establishment. Matters eventually became quite heated. </PARA>
<PARA>  I was then written to, and was told that I am a dishonourable member and that the Labor Government needs the Small Business Association more than the Small Business Association needs me. That may well be true and that may be a practice, but the reality of the matter is that I had always been led to assume that small businesses were there to operate for their consumers and their clients. Indeed, I would have thought that there was an unlimited market for wedding clothes. People are happy to spend any amount of money they can afford to make the day a happy one. </PARA>
<PARA>  This matter did not have a happy ending, but there was a resolution in that the deposit was eventually returned to one of the fathers of the party and the clothes were hired from elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA>  This raises a whole series of questions. We hear a great deal of discussion about the role, demands and responses of small businesses in our community and of associations which serve the interests of small business. I suggest that the associations operate in the very best way, but we do need to ensure that their members, their consumer mechanisms and their complaint mechanisms operate in the very best of ways. This certainly does not seem to have been the case in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is also interesting to note that many of the complaints that I have had about this establishment have come from the lower socio-economic areas of our community. My own electorate office is situated in the Woodridge-Logan area, which is recognised as having a low socio-economic base. The other major area from which that establishment's clients come is Inala, which is in the electorate of the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall). He also received a letter about the difficulty being experienced by these people.</PARA>
<PARA>  I grieve about the fact that people are placed in this most invidious situation. I say to young people, `Beware of signing contracts and offering deposits. Please ensure that the small business which you go to belongs to an association to which you can complain'. </PARA>
<PARA>  It seems extraordinary that, if one wishes to make a complaint against a business, the only person in the relevant association to whom one can complain happens to be the person who owns the business. I would have thought that it was incumbent upon the Small Business Association of Australia to ensure that complaints could be dealt with by a number of people because of conflict of interest. Many honourable members on both sides of the House have at various times absented themselves from discussions on a whole range of matters because of what they consider to be conflicts of interest. We understand that. It has been an ethic in the community for a very long time and has been espoused by everybody in this House. </PARA>
<PARA>  I urge the Small Business Association of Australia to establish complaint mechanisms which enable people to make complaints against a whole range of establishments which are members of it. I urge the executive of that Association to understand the whole notion of conflict of interest and to understand that some people who may wish to complain against proprietors of certain establishments should not be precluded from doing so because the owner of that establishment happens to be the President of that Association. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I would like to address one of the matters that the honourable member for Forde (Mrs Crawford) raised. I think she obviously misunderstands the position of ASBA in relation to its ability to take any of its members to task. It is purely an organisational body, not one that can take any punitive measures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  What I wish to grieve about today is the gross hypocrisy of the Australian Labor Party. I think some members on the other side of the House believe that we get some sort of joy out of coming in here day in, day out and addressing our concerns about the way they are governing the country. The very reason we are doing that is because they are not prepared to accept the sort of policy rationale that they know is going to get the country out of its present state.</PARA>
<PARA>  I sometimes wonder exactly what motivates members of the Government. The classic example is the performance of the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) in the last 24 hours. His greatest hypocrisy is to tell the rest of the world--while he is out of the country--that we are in our worst recession for 60 years. He quite simply has not got the intestinal fortitude to come into this place and tell the Australian people and this Parliament what we all know; he had to go out of the country to do so. It is a gross example of a lack of intestinal fortitude. I do not believe the Minister for Science and Technology and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Free), who is at the table, could possibly support it and I do not for one minute believe that the members of the Labor Party back bench could support their Treasurer making this statement outside the country. </PARA>
<PARA>   That is just the start of it. The classic, which was raised this week by Glenn Milne from the Australian, was the perks debate in the last Caucus meeting. This is just unbelievable. I can promise the Minister at the table that every person in my electorate--including the 22 per cent who are unemployed--will know exactly what the concerns of the Caucus are when it comes to the crocodile tears about this so-called caring Government; absolute crocodile tears. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the gallery at the moment is Councillor Lea Senior and her niece, Melanie, from Ballarat. They know exactly what the plight of the Ballarat people is; they know exactly the extent of the unemployment problem in Ballarat; and they know the havoc the Labor Party has wreaked on the people of the Ballarat region. </PARA>
<PARA>  Do you know what the Labor Party Caucus members discussed for 45 minutes, Mr Deputy Speaker? They discussed how they were going to get to and from the House; whether they were going to keep their white cars. Do you know how many questions there were on the unemployment level? Two. There were two questions about the worst recession in 60 years. Only two backbenchers bothered raising the state of the country's plight and the number of unemployed in this country. I think that is an absolute disgrace and I can assure the Minister that his candidate in Ballarat, who was pre-selected recently, is going to know about it and is going to have to justify it, as is every one of the Labor Party back bench. </PARA>
<PARA>  Quite frankly, I find it very hard to understand how Government backbenchers can go home and honestly look their constituents in the eye and tell them that what this Government is doing is in their best interests, because it simply is not. I can assure the Minister who is at the table that he and his Government--and I appreciate that he is a relative newcomer to the front bench--will never be forgiven for this so-called recession we had to have. </PARA>
<PARA>  Who said we had to have this recession? Did the Australian people have a say in that? Did the 22 per cent of people in the Ballarat region who are unemployed have a say in that? No, they did not. This recession was caused by a government that took out the big wallet in the first three years when it came in--the populist Government--and threw money from one end of Australia to the other. The ultimate reality was that the chooks came home to roost and the Government had to pull in its horns because of its mismanagement. The only people who have suffered the outcome of that are the Australian people, not the Australian Labor Party parliamentary members. No, they are all right; they are still looking after themselves; they are still talking about their perks of getting to and from the House and whether they should have white cars. They are not suffering, but 22 per cent of the population are. </PARA>
<PARA>  They are never going to be forgiven for the lie that we would never enter into a recession. They will never be forgiven for their lies about what our unemployment levels were going to reach. They will never be forgiven for the lie about what caused the 1982-83 recession. They know very well that that was a drought induced recession; our worst recession in 60 years is totally related to the economic paralysis of the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA>  They will never be forgiven for the record number of bankruptcies in this country. They will never be forgiven for the destruction of the economic and social fabric of thousands upon thousands of Australian families. They will never be forgiven for the destruction of the Australian manufacturing sector as a result of tariff reductions that were not accompanied by appropriate micro-economic reform. I greet with great joy yesterday's news that the manufacturing sector's contribution to the Australian economy has increased. But imagine what it could do if a proper framework was put in place for it. Everyone in this House knows, or should know, that Australian manufacturing has always been competitive, but impediments are placed in front of manufacturers at every stage. If we can remove those impediments, we will see a very strong manufacturing sector. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think the gross hypocrisy goes even further. There is hypocrisy about the extent of micro-economic reform; hypocrisy in relation to what is being done on the waterfront; and hypocrisy in relation to industrial relations. The sad fact is that this Government is absolutely gutless when it comes to industrial relations. It has not got the intestinal fortitude to make the decisions that it knows must be made because lurking in the background ready to pounce on it wherever it turns is the trade union leadership. I am not referring to the rank and file members of the trade union movement; they have my support. As long as they are members because they want to be members--not because they have to be members; not because they are forced to be members--they have my support. If they want to be members of the trade union movement, I will support them 100 per cent. But I am not prepared to support a trade union leadership that is clinging onto the vestiges of its previous power base. </PARA>
<PARA>  Those who make up the trade union leadership are a very sad and sorry group of people who are apologists for true Australians. They have not made the decisions that they know are so dramatically affecting the future and the past of their members. Quite frankly, I think they could not give a tinker's curse about their members. That is the only thing that we can glean from their present attitude. They do not care about them. They want to cling to the last vestige of the power base they have left; they will not give it up. </PARA>
<PARA>  Tax reform is another part of the gross hypocrisy of this Government; total hypocrisy. I would like to go through a few of the quotes in relation to taxation reform. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) apparently has performed again with our press overseas and reduced himself to appalling levels. I would like to bring up some of the matters that he raised in relation to taxation reform.</PARA>
<PARA>  Before I get to that, I refer to Mr David Charles, a former member for Isaacs. I can say to the House that the Liberal Party member for Isaacs is doing a great job and he will be there for a long time. On 15 May 1985, David Charles said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . tax avoidance and evasion is running at intolerable levels within our community, levels which we are now coming to recognise as crippling to this country's development and the Government's ability to arrange taxation on the most equitable basis possible. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask the House to consider this exchange:</PARA>
<PARA>Q:  Aren't you taking a heck of a risk in advocating the adoption of a consumption tax and is it worth it?</PARA>
<PARA>A:  Yes, we are taking a risk. What this country has needed desperately for years now is a government which is prepared to face up to what has to be done to get this economy into proper shape. </PARA>
<PARA>Was the answer that of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson)? No. It was that of the Prime Minister in 1985. Where has the Prime Minister gone in the last six years?  He is running scared about this debate and he knows very well that the only possible way that we can get this country out of the atrocious mess that it presently finds itself in is through the sorts of taxation proposals that the coalition is talking about. </PARA>
<PARA>  I hark back to the 22 per cent of people in my electorate who have not got work, to those people who are working reduced hours, and those people who have simply given up looking for a job. What hope have they got? (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-As the Minister at the table says, we were there. The people in Caucus were concerned about Commonwealth cars, but they were concerned about Commonwealth car drivers and their conditions of work as well as the efficiency of the fleet. Those matters were discussed at the Caucus meeting, but certainly not for 45 minutes, as Glenn Milne said they were. I do not wish to persist with this particular argument because not only is it fallacious and wrongly based, it also does not serve anybody any good, let alone the people whom we are supposed to be serving in this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I wish to speak today on a matter of some import to people who have problems with mental health and an organisation which serves those people. In doing so, I refer the Parliament to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs report entitled You Have Your Moments, which reported on the funding of peak health and community organisations in February 1991. I am a member of that Committee, which is very ably chaired by the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins). </PARA>
<PARA>  As a consequence of the terms of reference given by the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe), the Committee came down with some recommendations relating to the funding formation for community groups that had a national peak body association. One of the Committee's recommendations reads:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recommends continued Commonwealth funding for national secretariats of non-government health, housing and community services organisations on the basis that public education, public debate and community consultation assist the development of appropriate policies and programs, especially where disadvantaged groups are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee further recommended that national secretariats with a primary focus on providing or coordinating direct services should not be eligible for funding under the particular program. It also recommended that the Department of Community Services and Health review any such national secretariats which are currently funded with a view to suggesting they change the balance of their activities, seek a more appropriate source of funding, or withdraw funding if they continue to concentrate on service provision. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the context of the group that I am speaking about today, GROW, I wish to draw the attention of the House to the fact that a couple of very good individuals are circulating within the House today--they were also here yesterday--to talk to individual members about GROW's funding situation. I totally support--and I am sure most members of this place would--the activities of GROW and its search for funding. Given that it is now not appropriate for it to be funded under the previous regime, it must find funding in an alternative fashion. I am also confident that the Minister and his people will be giving consideration to how GROW may be funded in the future, now that it does not qualify for peak organisation funding. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is important for people to be aware of the nature of GROW. One of its leaflets states:</PARA>
<PARA>GROW is a community mental health movement organised and led by people recovering or recovered from mental illness and from other serious personal inadequacies or maladjustments to life. </PARA>
<PARA>I point out to members of the House that a few leaflets on GROW are available. It does some excellent work. The leaflet continues:</PARA>
<PARA>GROW began in Sydney, Australia, in 1957 when a number of former mental patients came together after hospitalization for mental illness to find their way back to normal living and happiness. </PARA>
<PARA>So many people who attend GROW and are supported by GROW are able to resume a normal life after having fairly traumatic experiences through either the mental health system or other sorts of treatment for mental illness. </PARA>
<PARA>  GROW's school of life and leadership involves three essential features. They are stated in this document to be:</PARA>
<PARA>  -- A Program of Growth to Maturity based on natural rules for healthy living and proven steps of recovery and personal growth. </PARA>
<PARA>  -- A Group Method for problem solving and mutual education which enables ordinary people without professional training to run their own groups. </PARA>
<PARA>  -- A Caring and Sharing Community, amounting to a network of friendship and trustworthy helpers. </PARA>
<PARA>From Australia GROW has spread to New Zealand, Ireland, Great Britain, Canada and the United States of America. GROW came to Hawaii in 1971 and to Illinois in 1978. Of its over 600 groups, more than 100 are in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA>In Australia it is still an extremely important organisation for caring and sharing in the community. It is a very important organisation for the help of mental health patients and people who are suffering from mental health problems or who are trying to survive and recover from mental health problems.</PARA>
<PARA>  I certainly think that the Minister and the Department would be racking their brains to work out a way for groups like GROW, self-help organisations which do not qualify for funding under the peak organisation proposals, to continue to be supported, given that those groups save money for the community and the Government in dollar terms; more important are the costs that they save in terms of human life and the fulfilment of human expectations. </PARA>
<PARA>  GROW has also produced a document, which John Lizzio has circulated to quite a number of members of Parliament while he has been here in the precincts of the House. One of them is called GROW and its National Secretariat: Sources of Cost Savings to Government Finances Provided by GROW. It outlines a number of cost savings in summary, calculated at the end to total $16,853,902. It goes in more detail into proposals for reductions in government outlays, which I will also outline briefly for the House's information. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA>A  Reduced Government outlays are achieved through:</PARA>
<PARA>1.  reduction in hospitalization costs for both public and private patients by reducing the number of bed days per person each year;</PARA>
<PARA>                    $6,897,290</PARA>
<PARA>2.  reduction in use, and therefore costs of professional help sought by Medicare clients;</PARA>
<PARA>    (exact figure not able to be calculated)</PARA>
<PARA>3.  reduction in use of medication and consequent reduced costs of National Health Service;</PARA>
<PARA>    (exact figure not able to be calculated)</PARA>
<PARA>4.  reduction in benefits paid under Invalid Pensioner and other Social Security schemes when GROW members return to part time or full time employment;</PARA>
<PARA>                    $3,159,000</PARA>
<PARA>5.  saving in labour costs as a result of the thousands of unpaid hours contributed by Growers--</PARA>
<PARA>that is, of course, the name for people who are participants in the GROW groups--</PARA>
<PARA>    and voluntary staff including research and planning and reporting;</PARA>
<PARA>                  $2,660,000</PARA>
<PARA>It also calculates anticipated increases in Government revenues through tax contributions made by participants in GROW returning to the work force at $3,852,750 and by GROW salaried staff at $284,862. The amount for salaried staff is less because the organisation does not have many salaried staff. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is imperative that people understand that GROW and groups like GROW have a most crucial role to play in our community, especially in the area of self-help. Many people in our community have problems, not all of which are critical mental health problems. Some have problems of considerable stress; some may not be able to deal with a pharmaceutical drug that has been prescribed for them. They have consequential problems which could be seen to be mental problems or they have addiction problems, many of which are associated with some mental illness. I think that the excellent work that GROW and groups like GROW do cannot be ignored and will not be ignored by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  I know that GROW representatives here today will be going to see the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services and his office helpers to try to ensure that their case is being adequately put, but I thought it was imperative that its case also be put to the House, because it is a very worthy group. It has in fact a unique situation in our society, given that it is an Australian home-grown organisation which has spread worldwide. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-My grievance today is about the issue of overseas aid--overseas development assistance--and the nature of the debate in Australia and, indeed, in other parts of the world about how much aid should be provided to developing countries and in what form it should be given.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  For many years there has been a United Nations target of 0.7 per cent of GDP for aid from developed countries to the developing world. There are very few countries which have met that target and those that have are in Scandinavia. Australia falls at somewhere around half of that target and, consequently, it is said that Australia's performance in terms of providing overseas development assistance is, by the standards of the United Nations target, a very poor effort. </PARA>
<PARA>  The corollary of this is that countries such as Australia that spend about half of the United Nations target in terms of development assistance should substantially increase their spending. If they were to do so, that would, in the first place, raise living standards in developing countries very substantially and, in the second case, gain for that country--let us take Australia by way of example--a reputation for being a more compassionate and caring society than we might otherwise have. </PARA>
<PARA>  I must say that I regard the measure of compassion in terms of dollars provided for overseas aid as a false measure of compassion. Indeed, the whole debate about assistance to developing countries is, in my view, a debate which is growing increasingly unrealistic and, in a sense, increasingly unhelpful to those countries. </PARA>
<PARA>  We need to keep in mind that the world economy must operate in a way which benefits all countries, including developing countries. Their low levels of per capita income and the extensive poverty in many developing countries--not quite in all of them--are matters which we all have a responsibility to address. But, if we are going to work out how we will address those problems of developing countries, we first have to ask ourselves the question: why are those countries in economic difficulties? Why is there such widespread poverty in some parts of the world as distinct from other parts of the world?</PARA>
<PARA>  There are basically three reasons for that. In the first place, some countries through virtue of their location are unlucky. Their circumstances are such that it is very hard for them to achieve successful agricultural industries and manufacturing industries and to develop an internationally competitive economy. Those countries are often the victims of extensive droughts. They are sometimes destroyed or severely damaged by floods and other sorts of natural catastrophes. But that category of developing countries is very small. </PARA>
<PARA>  Most developing countries fall into the second category. The reason for their economic disadvantage lies in economic policies pursued both within those countries and internationally by the developed world. In many parts of Africa, for example, and certainly in Latin America as well, the overwhelming reason for the failure of those economies lies in domestic economic policies. </PARA>
<PARA>  For example, after independence was achieved in many African countries, the governments decided to institute, under the banner of socialism, extensive land reform programs. They took the privately owned agricultural sector, such as we have in Australia, in Europe, the United States and so on, and they carved it up. They often handed the land over to people who had little experience of modern forms of agriculture--one could say no experience of modern forms and methods of agriculture in many cases--and they socialised the land so that any earnings from that land were collectivised and socialised and they expected the country to maintain high levels of productivity in agriculture and high prosperity. The reality is that those countries failed to do it because the change in method of land ownership was simply an economic disaster. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I thought the Minister was going to say something profound. I suppose his point that the Soviet Union had 60 years of bad seasons is a very good way of illustrating the point that I am making. With a bit of luck, the Soviet Union's 60 years of bad seasons are coming to an end.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It is very important to understand this point, but it does not, of course, apply only to agriculture. Many developing countries, particularly after they achieved independence, picked up the banner of socialism--much beloved by those on the other side of this House--and rushed around their own countries saying that they would turn their capitalist countries, which had been victims of imperialist exploitation, into socialist nirvanas. Of course, we all know that what socialism actually did was to breed State-run monopolies, often highly protected in terms of tariff and non-tariff barriers. The lack of competition led to a lack of efficiency, monopoly profits and exploitation becoming the norm. Much of those monopoly profits were simply put into the pockets of the leadership of those countries and their economies collapsed. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think we need to emphasise that one of the reasons that many countries are defined as developing countries is their own domestic economic policies. So that begs the question: how should we assist these countries? The typical answer, as I have already said, is that we should provide development assistance--we should write out cheques in one form or another for those countries. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe that is true in the case of the first category of countries that I described--those countries that do suffer natural disasters and have enormous difficulty in trying to construct a modern economy or even a successful agricultural economy because of the unfortunate natural circumstances in which they find themselves. But I do not think that writing out cheques as a form of providing development assistance is the solution to the problems of the vast majority of developing countries. Those countries can be assisted much more by changes to their own domestic policy structure--and it is very encouraging to see that happening now in Latin America and in parts of Africa. But, also--and this is the burden of my remarks--by opening up the international marketplace for those countries, they can capitalise on the comparative advantages that they have, whether those advantages be cheap land, cheap labour or ones of just natural location where particular types of agricultural products or whatever may grow very successfully. </PARA>
<PARA>  Unfortunately though, this commitment to trade rather than aid is proving to be a very difficult one to achieve. Indeed, a growing proportion of development assistance is directed towards trade in quite a malicious sort of way, that is, in the form of export subsidies for those developed countries that pretend that they are giving assistance. Indeed, they provide what are described as mixed credits, which are just another form of export subsidy, so that German, British, French or American firms or whoever can gain greater access into the marketplace of Indonesia, Malaysia or wherever it may be. That type of aid is phoney aid. That is an export subsidy that in the long term will not benefit the country providing the subsidy and will not necessarily be to the benefit of a successful global economy. </PARA>
<PARA>  The final point I make is that the best way for those of us who are outside of those countries to help most developing countries is to open up the international trading system. The World Bank has estimated that, if all tariff barriers were dismantled by developed countries, that would add about 3 per cent per annum to the GDPs of developing countries. In fact, the benefit that developing countries can get from aid through reduction in tariff protection is massively greater than the amount of assistance developed countries will ever provide in the form of cheques under the heading of development assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>  The OECD provides 0.3 per cent of its GDP in terms of aid. If it abolished tariffs altogether and did what the coalition says it will do when it is in government, that is, reduce tariffs to negligible levels in any case by  the year  2000,  that  would  be  the equivalent of doubling the aid that the OECD currently gives to developing countries. In this country the $1 billion we spend on aid could be doubled, in terms of benefits to developing countries, by eliminating tariffs to negligible levels by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA>  That side of the compassionate debate on helping people in developing countries is the untold side of the debate by the churches, welfare groups and aid lobbies in this country and it is about time that the churches, in particular, thought about the way trade, not just handouts, can help the disadvantaged in the world.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Today in the grievance debate I take the opportunity to outline some of the fears that have concerned me for many years. Firstly, the gravest fear I hold is that of the current peace pact which has recently been evolving around us with the elimination of the Cold War between the superpowers. I fear that this will cause a depression throughout the world greater than that of the 1920s and 1930s, with crime, poverty, broken homes and all of the other problems that existed during that part of our history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In order to regain and remain the lucky country, as members of parliament we must reverse some of the stupid policies that have created the most serious recession since the 1920s and 1930s and caused the largest pool of unemployment in the past 60 or so years. Various figures have been stated on the present percentage of unemployment. A couple of days ago, the CES cited the number of unemployed at being nearly 13 per cent. If one takes into account males whose spouses have positions and are therefore not eligible to claim benefits, plus the thousands who are listed as being involved in training or retraining, I hope the percentage of unemployed does not rise above 13 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is very easy for a person to say, `I have the cure for Australia's unemployment problems'. Well, I am claiming to have part of the cure and I put forward the following proposals for the Government to consider. As a priority, we must build a level playing field. I am convinced that, unfortunately, the Ministers' advisers forgot to remove the covers from the theodolites and levels that they used when pegging out the playing field. We must now realise that the playing field which has been constructed by the Ministry is unlevel. In fact, many Australian producers, manufacturers and exporters are playing the game uphill and are continually finding that the departments, who are really referees, blow their whistles and give the importers or overseas companies another free kick, to the disadvantage of our own companies. </PARA>
<PARA>  This situation must be stopped and the policies must be revamped to ensure that all Australian companies and manufacturers, and particularly our work force, are protected to the extent that we are, in actual fact, on a level playing field. We demand no more and no less. The playing field, that is the policies of government, must ensure that we have similar conditions to those of our overseas competitors, and must include all countries. Assistance to developing countries should be by way of grants of equipment, material, food products, and in some case cash payments--but should never be at the cost our own labour force. </PARA>
<PARA>  The most important single item the Government must take action on is lowering interest rates to at least those of our trading partners, which I understand have enjoyed rates between 10 and 12 per cent lower than interest rates charged in this country. This now appears to have been a most stupid policy and must be changed so as to make us truly competitive in all avenues of finance. </PARA>
<PARA>  We must, as a future priority, endeavour to have all export industries work towards having value added to their exports; move away from overseas companies owning large shareholdings in Australian companies; and rescind the current legislation dealing with reduction of tariffs and retain the 1990 tariff rates. The funds raised from tariffs must go to the industries affected by the imports until such time as these industries are fully equipped with the latest state of the art plant and machinery. Naturally, we are very concerned about the plight of other countries but there is an almost forgotten saying: charity begins at home. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Government was given the responsibility of making this nation a nation that all of us would be proud of. I personally have difficulties in being proud of this Government or this nation until we again create full employment.</PARA>
<PARA>  As one employment starter for New South Wales, the Government should undertake the fast track construction of Sydney's second airport at Badgerys Creek, lift the curfew on Kingsford-Smith Airport until the construction at Badgerys Creek is completed and functioning, then replace the curfew on Kingsford-Smith Airport. </PARA>
<PARA>  Unfortunately for this nation, Ministers and their advisers seem to believe that all knowledge and ability is confined to them; this is very far from the truth. One could go on and on about ways to improve this nation, but enough said. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another matter I wish to raise today is the future disaster of industrial relations in New South Wales. The State Government's legislation has brought on the astounding industrial and political situation in New South Wales at present. Some of the things happening in that State indicate what the entire nation can expect if the Federal Liberal and National parties were ever elected to power. In New South Wales, Premier Greiner's era will cost every New South Wales citizen very dearly and will far outlive the short fuse that is rapidly burning underneath Mr Greiner. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Greiner Government has abused its political responsibility in the most cynical fashion. The Public Service has been destroyed and the public have cried,`Enough, enough'. We had not seen a general strike by the nursing profession in 203 years since the first white settlement, yet the Greiner Government has managed to cause one in just 3 1/2 years. The nurses were not engaged in any selfish pursuit of personal gain; they were striking because the Greiner Government has so smashed the New South Wales hospital system that no more can be tolerated. Their strike will be followed by a general strike in New South Wales on 23 October, which will be led by the public sector unions, including the professional classifications under the leadership of their associations and unions. </PARA>
<PARA>  What has brought about this incredible situation? The answer is simple: it lies in the failed ideology of the Greiner New Right--a failure that is propped up by an obstinate desire to continue the experiment he started early in 1988. Worse than that, as stated by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) in this Parliament, the Greiner Government will not only persist in this ridiculous pursuit of the impossible, but also even continue to knowingly implement the failed policies of the Thatcher era which are the real base of its inept attempts at government. </PARA>
<PARA>  Mr Greiner's repeated failures are lauded by the Opposition in this Parliament. The Federal shadow Minister for industrial relations, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), openly stated that he will implement identical policies within eight weeks of taking office, should such a sorry day ever be inflicted on the Australian public. Can one really imagine the chaos that Mr Greiner has created in New South Wales being repeated in the Federal system?</PARA>
<PARA>  When the New South Wales general strike occurs next week, it will signify the utter failure of Mr Greiner to earn any confidence from the people of New South Wales. The general public has had enough of him. Even his own senior MPs have had enough of the experiment. Loyal public servants have maintained the Westminster tradition over the last 3 1/2 years but it has taken this final massive assault on the Westminster system in New South Wales to bring them to this desperate point. They have no choice. They have no alternative under the Westminster system because that system only ever envisaged men of principle in government. That system did not foresee the day when hospitals would be closed by economic rationalists; when Harvard Business School theorists would replace statesmen; when the blatant politicisation of the public service would be not only allowed but legislated for. </PARA>
<PARA>  Not satisfied with political appointments in the overloaded Senior Executive Service, Mr Greiner now wants total political direction on a day-to-day basis of every public sector employee. He knows their only protection is via unionism and he is seeking to destroy them by destroying their unions. In that way, he destroys the last chance for the public of New South Wales to learn the truth about what is happening in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am proud to say that I grew up in the Glebe, which is an inner suburb of Sydney. As a youth I knew it was well worth the effort to try to work in the New South Wales Public Service, where service to the public was the key and men of stature led both the political and administrative areas. It was truly a career to be had and, if one could rise to the upper echelons by dint of hard work in the service of the public, great worth attached to the position. </PARA>
<PARA>  There will be none of the checks and balances that keep the Westminster system in operation. The twist is that Mr Greiner will accomplish this by using a veneer of industrial legislation to mask the real outcomes he needs to maintain the true secret of New South Wales incorporated. There will never again be a chance to undercover the types of dealings that led to the Eastern Creek raceway affair. </PARA>
<PARA>  Service to the public has been replaced by contracted collectors of revenue under a user pays system, borrowed from the Thatcher era. Mr Greiner's great industrial experiment is not wanted by the private sector employers nor anybody else. That is why he is hell bent on introducing it to the public sector, where the captive guinea pig can be put into the economic rationalist test program. </PARA>
<PARA>  God help the public service and the trade unions of New South Wales. When New South Wales is in turmoil over the next week or so, we should look to the real causes of that turmoil. We should be objective. Nurses who have struck for the first time in 200 years are not industrial troublemakers. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;- Over the course of the year, the Parliament has received conflicting advice from the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) regarding the extent of the collapse of the rural research effort flowing from the impact on commodity downturns, the drought and the like. This issue raises larger concerns about the long term stability of the nation's agricultural research effort. Consequently, I wish to direct my comments today during the grievance debate to the need for an innovation strategy for Australian agriculture.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Regardless of Australia's primary industries' continuing important contribution to the national economy, they possess no defined view of their future, let alone a grasp of how that future might be realised. Largely, the agricultural sector has been prepared to trust its hand and hope that it will all turn out for the better. There has been little systematic effort to forge a genuine community of interest across the agricultural sector. Nor has there been a sustained effort to coordinate the sector's various resources and capabilities to enhance its long term advantages. If nothing else, events continue to demonstrate that the fate of the industry cannot be pinned on periodic surges in international price for raw product alone. </PARA>
<PARA>  The rural sector must work harder on the domestic front to hone its resources and to develop its capacities. Australia's agricultural capacity, however, is more than just a measure of raw commodity production values. It is a reflection of the chain of influences which effect the efficiency and quality of production and determines the ability of the private sector to expand its share of the global market. Importantly, such influences include the resources which make for innovation in agriculture--particularly the educational base to the rural industry--the levels of activity within the organisational structure of the State and Commonwealth rural research effort, and the orientation of the major funding bodies such as the rural research corporations. It is in the effective coordination of these influences that the innovative capacity of the agricultural sector largely lies. </PARA>
<PARA>  Presently, each of these influences lives independent of the other and overlooks its role within a larger process which could make for improved prospects for agriculture. For example, the debate over the rural sector's levels of educational achievement and access to educational resources has even wider implication than first appears. </PARA>
<PARA>  This issue bears directly on the receptiveness of the next generation of farmers to the increasing opportunities provided by developments in technology and business management strategies. Until such time as innovation in agriculture is driven by community demand and is more widely appreciated for the long term advantages it yields, rural research and development resources will remain underutilised. Importantly, changes of this order are critical to the approach of the rural research corporations to their research funding strategies. This, in turn, has a profound impact on the type and quality of research pursued in the longer term interest of the rural sector. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the absence of the rural community's demand for longer term and strategic research, the rural corporations are shunted into accountability practices that can be tested only against short term goals. That is to say that research grants are increasingly evaluated against their capacity to realise immediate returns. This is not a function of corporatisation or conservative risk management strategies. It is a function of a body which largely reflects the interests and climate of opinion in the community it serves. This process has inevitably distanced rural research corporations from the research agencies which undertake research and on whose expertise agriculture heavily depends. As a consequence, there is little effective coordination between grants and research agencies despite their interdependence. </PARA>
<PARA>  There has been no effort by commodity-based rural research corporations to fund cooperatively research with widespread application. There are no universally accepted guidelines as to the balance between longer and shorter term grants funded research that corporations feel obliged to undertake, despite the importance of such a balance to the continuing access to high quality research. Moreover, research agencies are not regularly taken into the confidence of the corporation as to their business plans and are unable to structure their research programs in regard to projected demand. </PARA>
<PARA>  What degree of consultation and planning, for instance, has been undertaken in respect of present and pending falls in research funding flowing from the decline in commodity prices?  External funding for grains, meat and wool research has all been wound back, but no attention has been given to its effect on core research capabilities. In circumstances such as these, it is imperative that funding and research agencies jointly formulate priorities and work pro-actively to shield vital resources which have been built up over many years. But, if communication and coordination are absent in these respects, they are even more absent in respect of the area of Commonwealth and State support for rural research. </PARA>
<PARA>  While aggregate Federal funding has at least reached some stability, State-based support for research is threatened. As State governments are the key sources of funding, cuts by them to research and research infrastructure threaten the nation's agricultural capacity more directly than any other concerns. Yet here too there is a vacuum in respect of initiatives to ensure core regional and national rural research needs are maintained. Cuts might be unavoidable, but they must be managed and coordinated in the longer term interests of the rural sector. To be sure, such a blueprint might well contain the risk of some States freeloading on others or on the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is necessary to hope that some maturity of understanding might prevail when the longer term interests of a key industry sector is at stake. In view of these and other problems it is difficult to contend Australia's agricultural industries are at all well placed to build their competitiveness beyond keeping their fingers crossed for sustained falls in exchange rates, interest rates and inflation. Governments, nevertheless, can help in filling the policy vacuum and driving change. The matter of the coordination of the rural research effort ought to rightly take precedence at forthcoming Premiers Conferences and should be subject to closer analysis by the Prime Minister's Science Council. While the Premiers Conference might lay down some working principles for cooperation, the Science Council alone provides the forum for building constructive relationships across the rural research effort. If the existing science and technology administrative machinery is to prove its mettle, here is its chance. </PARA>
<PARA>  Importantly, there must also be a stronger emphasis placed on rural research skills and education. Given the nature of the problems, the cooperative research centre's program must be reviewed in respect of its capacity to provide for a powerful focus to agricultural science related research and training. There is little purpose in robbing resources from pockets of the rural research sector when the overall research and training capability is, at best, unsteady. </PARA>
<PARA>  The key function of government is to provide for skills development and research training opportunities. This should be pursued on the basis of providing even more extensive opportunities for industry involvement. Currently, the agricultural sector lacks a beacon for training and research. It lacks an institutional vehicle for expressing its capabilities and communicating its future to the secondary school network. </PARA>
<PARA>  In an important way, the agricultural sector is still to take its own future in hand. Creative administrative solutions to the problem, as outlined, might yield some returns, but substantive change will not grip until there is a community of views across the agricultural sector as to the role of innovation and change. Though it shoulders unfair burdens relative to other industries in the economy, the agricultural sector cannot afford to fall into despair or to neglect the struggle to consolidate its future. That is a struggle which will be won or lost not by bureaucrats or administrators but by those who are now at work within Australia's primary industries. </PARA>

<PARA>  Only recently, the Liberal Party tourism spokesman, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), has hinted at exemptions from consumption tax for inbound tourists, that is to say, international tourists coming to Australia such as Japanese and other Asian tourists and tourists from the United Kingdom and so forth. The importance of overseas tourists to Australia cannot be denied. But they still make up only 20 per cent of the market while home-grown Australians comprise 80 per cent or the major bulk of the market trade. </PARA>
<PARA>  The tourism industry in north Queensland could be one of the chief victims of a Liberal-National consumption tax. Steep rises in the cost of fares, accommodation and associated requirements for Australians would undoubtedly mean a severe cutback in domestic travel, particularly where travel over longer distances is involved. Many people from south-east Australia contemplating holidays in north Queensland would almost certainly be forced to think again in favour of cheaper alternatives as a result of the Liberal-National consumption tax. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Today I rise to bring to the notice of the House the 008 number and the recent experience we had this morning. As many honourable members here will know, my electorate covers three telephone zones--part of 051, 056 and 059. We took up the offer from the Government to put in a 008 number. We received a letter from Telecom Australia asking us to contact them to get into the yellow pages. The letter was dated 11 October, we received it on 17 October--and it said to reply within seven days. Very  helpful! On the top of that letter was a 008 number to ring. When we rang it from Canberra, six times, we got the message: `This number is disconnected'. So we asked our electorate office to ring it and, lo and behold, there was a reply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  So, if one rings from here a 008 number in another zone, one will be told that the number is disconnected. That is such great efficiency. I then asked people to start ringing my electorate office on the 008 number. Of the six times that we tried to ring it, we got through once. The service is so inefficient that the rest of the time it gave the engaged signal, yet there was nobody in my office on the phones at those particular times. We have been offered a service which cannot be delivered. It is typical of this Government and typical of their inefficiency. (Time expired)</PARA>

To cut off at the knees such a terrific organisation as group training schemes would be inappropriate. In my view we need to expand the number of group training schemes and expand this opportunity.

This particular creche has been operating in the public sector for over a decade. Recently, because of maladministration and lack of cost control, broadly in areas which ought to have been the Council's direct responsibility, the Council has decided, rather than to maintain the creche in the public sector, that it will transfer it into the private sector. This has disturbed those parents whose children are in receipt of the benefits of the creche. It has also been responsible for what I believe to be an appalling treatment of the staff who were dismissed from the centre as a response to the crisis that flowed from the poor administration of the centre. All in all, the Hobart City Council has demonstrated an appalling lack of respect for the principles that ought to underlie provision of services for the women in the community that it services. All other community groups, such as the Glenorchy City Council and the Clarence City Council in Hobart, accept and respect their responsibility in providing for working parents with children by providing creche services.

As the Minister for Transport and Communications said in this place yesterday, the question of ownership is essentially a question of control, and the Broadcasting Act is clear on this. If the Tourang bid were to establish a control or influence over the operations of the Fairfax group by Mr Packer, he would be in breach of the Broadcasting Act and would be obliged to divest. The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal is currently investigating the circumstances of the Tourang bid to establish whether there is any possibility for an extension of control.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2161" SPEAKER="Willis The Hon R." NAMEID="ZJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="GELLIBRAND" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZJ4">Mr WILLIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am aware of calls from various quarters for the Government to take further stimulatory action, stemming apparently from a belief that recovery will otherwise be too slow. I think that involves a number of apparent misconceptions about the forecast rate of economic activity, about the degree of action already taken to produce recovery, and about the ability of other policies to produce more effective results.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I will refer briefly to those three points. In relation to the forecast rate of economic recovery, some critics have argued that the rate of growth of GDP this year of 1 1/2 per cent is unacceptably low, especially because it is not high enough to increase employment. I think there is confusion here between growth year on year and growth through the year, because growth through this year, from the June quarter of 1991 to the June quarter of 1992, is forecast to be not 1 1/2 per cent but 3 3/4 per cent, a rate of growth which will certainly mean that in the second half of the year we will be into employment growth--and the Budget forecast is for 1 1/4 per cent growth in employment in the second half of the year, giving an increase in employment of 100,000 in that time. Of course, if that were continued through the whole of 1992, we would have growth in employment of about 200,000. So certainly the Budget and Government policy is posited around a return to economic and employment growth in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA>  In relation to the action already taken to produce recovery, we have had a substantial budgetary turnaround; an $8 billion surplus in 1989-90 has now become a deficit of $4.7 billion this year. Most of that turnaround, of course, is due to cyclical factors. However, it still represents a budgetary stimulus, much of which has yet to impact on the economy. It will impact on the economy only as we go through the year. We have also had a considerable reduction in interest rates. Since January 1990, cash rates have been cut nine times, and by 8 1/2 per cent. The prime rate has come down from 20 1/2 per cent to 13 1/4 or 13 1/2 per cent. Mortgage rates have come down from 17 1/2 per cent to 12 1/2 per cent, and about half of that interest rate reduction has happened within the last 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA>  So, with the lags that operate in regard to monetary policy, we are still to have the stimulatory impact on the economy of about half of that action in relation to interest rates. Both budgetary and monetary policy settings have changed considerably, and they are both acting to promote economic recovery with considerable impact yet to come.</PARA>
<PARA>  Thirdly, there seems to be a belief in some quarters that we can easily accelerate economic and employment growth by adopting more stimulatory budgetary and/or monetary policies. In regard to budgetary policy, let me say that moving to pump priming could produce more economic and employment growth in the short term, but it would only be most likely in the short term, and we would risk aborting the now attainable sustainable long term growth. Adverse reactions in domestic and overseas financial markets to policies that they saw as inflationary and diminishing our national savings effort would be likely to produce countervailing results that could arrest the recovery.</PARA>
<PARA>  In regard to monetary policy, as the Governor of the Reserve Bank has explained over and over again, interest rate reductions that are not based on reduced inflationary expectations--not just reduced inflation but reduced inflationary expectations--will be very difficult to retain and may well prove counterproductive. So, if we want sustainable lower interest rates, both nominal and real, we have to ensure that inflationary expectations are continuing to trend downwards, and any further interest rate reductions, of course, will have their impact in 1992-93, not in this financial year.</PARA>
<PARA>  Nevertheless, within that budgetary and monetary strategy the Government is not inflexible; it is prepared to take whatever further action is necessary to accentuate recovery. Of course in that respect I have already referred this week to the review of business tax competitiveness and the review of impediments to major projects.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Mr Acting Speaker, I was referring to the fact that one can see, as one saw in the recession of 1982-83, a situation in which the level of payments for those who are most disadvantaged is cut; one can see a situation in which the failure to develop wages policy means that a recession would continue for a number of years afterwards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  This Government, in its response to the recession, has sought to continue with a process of micro-economic reform. We have sought to put into place those policies which will ensure sustainable recovery. There has never been a year comparable to 1991 in terms of putting in place sustainable reform. This is a year in which we have seen major changes to tariff policy. That contrasts with the period in which the Opposition was in government, in which it failed to make any of those hard decisions in that industry area. It is a period in which, in terms of cooperation with the States, we are putting into place a number of significant reforms--whether they be in respect of national freight, the National Road Transport Commission or the power grid--that ultimately will improve the efficiency and competitiveness of Australian industry. At the same time, in the course of the last year we have seen, in terms of the Government's concern for those who are unemployed, a commitment to much greater increases in unemployment benefit payments and payments for training programs.</PARA>
<PARA>  Of course one can make comparisons but the fact is that there is not a great deal of value to doing so. It is a question of what are one's policies and what policies ought to be pursued as one deals with the current circumstances. As the Acting Treasurer pointed out a moment ago, we have seen the impact of the Government's policies translated into a more optimistic approach to business. As I indicated yesterday, we have seen it in the housing industry, with the prospects of revision upwards of the level of growth. And we can see it in terms of some improvement in the area of retail sales. What we can see emerging is a sense of recovery.</PARA>
<PARA>  For that recovery to be sustainable, the Government is required to adopt overall consistent policies. The coalition Government lost its nerve during the last recession and failed in its capacity to develop coherent policies. This led to the severity that occurred over a period of time and impacted on people. By contrast, our Government has been able to take the hard and the difficult decisions. We have not baulked at them. Indeed, those decisions represent a coherent policy which will ensure that recovery, as it becomes stronger, is sustainable and that employment growth returns in the first half of next year to provide a basis for building a much stronger economy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The question referred in part to a package announced in this year's Budget which will benefit 200,000 families, particularly primary earners. The family allowance supplement threshold will be increased from $18,000 to $19,000. An assets test of $600,000 will be introduced for family allowances to better target the payment. These reforms were included in legislation that passed through the House last night. I referred in a previous answer to the fact that an assets test at a very high level apparently proved to be extraordinarily contentious in the Opposition party room.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Family assistance is especially important during a time of recession and high unemployment. The fact that unemployment assistance for the unemployed, particularly for families, has been increased in this Budget is very important. Our families policy has very broad support. It has won this support because it is seen as a very well targeted policy.</PARA>
<PARA>  During a time of recession, people are particularly sensitive about the treatment of those who are unemployed, particularly families. It is interesting that whereas the Opposition can have the degree of contention that we saw yesterday about the family allowance assets test, the Leader of the Opposition, when speaking to the ACOSS general congress only a couple of weeks ago, made it very clear that he felt that the unemployment benefit, which protects the families of the unemployed--and he quoted the extent of increases that had occurred over the life of this Government--was in fact unwarranted expenditure; that it reflected a preoccupation, as he put it to ACOSS, with welfare, rather than with the situation of people in the work force.</PARA>
<PARA>  This is where we have a contrast. On the one hand we have members of the Opposition seriously suggesting that the threshold for the assets test should be of the order of $2m; on the other hand, when it comes to those who are unemployed, those who are most disadvantaged, the Leader of the Opposition wanders off to ACOSS and makes it clear that the unemployed are on his hit list.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Government is committed to preserving and improving family assistance as an area of some priority. That is in contrast to the Opposition, particularly in terms of its lack of concern for the most disadvantaged families, and its willingness to go to a consumption tax without being able to provide any guarantee that those most in need will be protected.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I think one of the characteristics of this Opposition is that when it comes to fundamental strategies, to saying what must be done, that question rarely can find an answer without dividing the party room. As an Opposition, those opposite have failed to come into this Parliament with any set of coherent policies. They come into the Parliament day in and day out and they are not interested in debating underlying policy approaches or in debating alternative strategies; they are not interested, for example, in justifying how the massive effort that is going into the consumption tax might have some benefit to the Australian people, particularly at a time of recession. They come into the Parliament to make some slick debating point, with no interest at all in the fundamental economic issues which need to be addressed. That might be their approach but it will not get a response from us. We are interested in the economic fundamentals that will govern the recovery. On this basis it is clear that Australia is now well positioned for a sustained recovery in investment, employment and activity.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Leader of the Opposition is trying to indicate that somehow that is not true. I would have thought that it was now becoming clear from a number of economic fundamentals that we are beginning to see a recovery. I referred yesterday at some length--and I am prepared to go into it at some length again--to the housing industry. That fundamental is very important in terms of employment in this country. Unlike in the 1982-83 recession, when housing got down to less than 100,000 starts, we are now looking at 137,000 starts this year and 155,000 next year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It is not simply those particular areas of the economy. Because we are seeing for the first time in a very long time the possibility of low inflation being sustainable in this country, inflation at its lowest level in 20 years, that then becomes one of the building blocks on which one can build in terms of being able to sustain a recovery. The gross profit share remains close to the historical highs recorded under this Government. It is well above the levels recorded in any year under the previous Government.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I thank the honourable member for his question. I indicate to the House that I had occasion to visit his electorate some two months ago and the cattle producers in that region raised with me their concern about the form and the amount of the transaction levy. Since that time I have had numerous pieces of correspondence from other producers. I see honourable members from the National Party nodding in agreement about that. It is as a result of those discussions--and, indeed, I commend the role that the honourable member for Page has played in bringing it not just to my attention, but to the industry's attention--that I am in a position to make some comments about this today. There are, in fact, two associated problems that have been raised. One goes to the form of the levy; the other goes to the amount.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In relation to the form of the levy, the reality is that the levy falls on producers at each transaction. The allegation that is made--and I think with some justification in relation to some aspects of the industry, particularly the small producers and the traders--is that that is inequitable because some people will pay it only once and others will pay it more than once.</PARA>
<PARA>  Against that background, given that the form of the levy as well as the component amounts were recommended to us by the industry through the Cattle Council and the Meat Industry Policy Council, I have asked those two bodies to conduct a review, which they are currently undertaking and which will be with me in November. That goes to the question of form.</PARA>
<PARA>  In relation to the amount, which, as the honourable member indicated, is currently $6.25, I am in a position to inform the House today that from 1 January that rate will fall from $6.25 to $5.00, a 20 per cent reduction. This comes about because of the significant success that has been had with the brucellosis and tuberculosis eradication campaign. We have reached the stage where those diseases are effectively eradicated. The scheme simply now has to move to a monitoring role and agreement has been reached between the States, industry and the Commonwealth as to the future funding. That therefore enables us to give some immediate relief, quite apart from the review that is currently being undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA>  I simply conclude on this point: this is another demonstration of where this Government is prepared to listen to genuine concerns and come forward with constructive outcomes. I believe it is good news for the beef producers and I hope that that is recognised by all sides of the House.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Leader of the Opposition wants to reduce politics down to the sharp debating point. He does not want to get down to, he does not reflect on, he is not interested in and he has no concern for a recovery in the Australian economy, for building that recovery on sure foundations or for debating serious policy issues. All he is interested in is debating points, `yes' or `no' answers--not in the substance of the issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  As I have been pointing out and will continue to point out, in terms of the recession, which the Government regrets, particularly the impact of the recession on unemployment, we are now beginning to see quite solid signs of recovery. I have indicated those signs of recovery in the very important area of the housing industry, but I could also have pointed to positive signs of recovery in other sectors. For example, the Westpac Melbourne University index of leading indicators, a widely based barometer of early signs of change, suggests that general recovery is imminent. Consumer confidence is now well above the lows experienced in late 1990. The latest statistics for retail trade show promising signs of recovery.</PARA>
<PARA>  The foundations, then, for a stronger economy have been laid. We have the right policy settings in place. Official interest rates have been cut by 8 1/2 percentage points since early 1990. Wages growth is being held in check by the accord framework. We are maintaining the structural integrity of the Budget. We are, in fact, on top of inflation, and the current account deficit fell by around 30 per cent in 1991 and will fall further in 1991-92. While the September labour force figures were disappointing, we are confident that the large falls in employment are behind us.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am going to some length and I am emphasising the recovery essentially because we have a situation which could well be unique. It could well be unique in this sense: in the history of the Australian economy it has often been marked by cyclical booms and busts, by periods of downturn and upturn, and by a lack of long term stability. When I referred to the housing industry a few minutes ago, I was referring to an example of an industry which, for as long as it has been in existence, has always been subject to cyclical movements. What is true there is generally true of the Australian economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  What is required--certainly the Government understands this, and one would hope that the Opposition understands it--is fundamental structural change. It is micro-economic reform in a whole range of different areas. It is a comprehensive process of reform. I believe that the recovery is strong and well based, and could well be the strongest recovery certainly in the postwar period, because it is based on a recognition of the international character of the Australian economy--something that Opposition members resisted in their time in government, even with the advice of a learned professor such as the Leader of the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA>  This is a government which, like no other government, has been prepared to tackle tariff reform, a government which has been able to reverse the situation with respect to inflation, and a government which has been able to set in place a number of fundamental reforms that will ensure that recovery is sustainable in the longer term. That is what is important: that recovery is sustainable. That is why I have given the answer to the question so much emphasis.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-And SBS. The position that we adopt here is that we wish to maintain a strong and effective national broadcaster. One of the things that the ABC does insist on is that its position ought to be such that Ministers, governments and anyone else cannot interfere with the way in which it chooses to do its programming or, for that matter, the way in which it chooses to organise its finances. As a result of that sort of reorganisation, there has been a substantial impact, I think, on ABC sport. I understand that in the case of Western Australia four people were involved in it. That has been cut down to two, and there are a couple going over to news.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The ABC, of course, has built up a very substantial phalanx of well-known sports broadcasters in this country, and a diminution of their presence on the airwaves would be a worry to a lot of people. However, as I said, the ABC does have control over the way in which it does things. When I have raised this before with the ABC at the behest of other members of parliament, it has pointed out that Western Australia probably has more local programming in sports than just about any other State. Whether that is sufficient, of course, is another matter, but that is, nevertheless, a fact. As far as the ABC is concerned, Western Australia has more access to local sports. Therefore, I suppose we would notice in Western Australia a cut if that were occurring.</PARA>
<PARA>  I recognise that the ABC has control over its financial affairs. I note that the Government has been generous to the ABC in its funding arrangements this year. But in the final analysis, the ABC will take decisions about its programming as it sees fit. I am constantly assured by the ABC that it takes note of the views of its valued listeners; that, if people do feel as the honourable member feels about the situation related to sport, they will do some good in persistently writing to the ABC and approaching the ABC about it.</PARA>

So I approached the Leader of the National Party and sought to find out whether there were any specifics to the allegations he had made so that I might take whatever action was appropriate. I regret to say that the Leader of the National Party said that he did not know of any specific case in which Australian aid money had been so treated. In so far as I grasped his explanation, he had simply been referring to general gossip that Western aid money was being used in this way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In a program so complex and diverse as the Australian aid program, there is almost certainly going to be some misuse of funds, no matter how good our preventive mechanisms are. If any member of the House has a substantial piece of evidence to bring to bear on any aspect of the program, it is my duty to deal with it. I can assure honourable members that if they present me with that hard evidence it will certainly be followed up. But the unsubstantiated claims made by the Leader of the National Party are simply not worth following up. They are simply an irresponsible attack not only on the integrity of the aid program but also on the integrity of our recipients. Moreover, they show an appalling lack of appreciation of how the program works.</PARA>
<PARA>  With the exception of PNG, which is a country not ruled by a dictator, Australian bilateral aid is very rarely given in cash, it is usually given in the form of goods and services purchased by AIDAB in Australia. It is impossible to bank those goods and services, even in Switzerland. On occasions where cash grants are used, they are invariably accountable grants for specific purposes. We all know why the Leader of the National Party made these absurd allegations. He made them in order to support the claim by the Leader of the Opposition that aid must be cut back.

First, there have been something in the order of 135,000 bales sold from the stockpile, 82,000 of them which, in rough figures, were sold in non-selling weeks. All of the bales have been sold at a premium--a premium above the market, in essence because people are prepared to pay for wool out of the stockpiles held overseas for more speedy delivery.</PARA></TALK.START>

The objectives of the program include the following: to support long term, high quality scientific and technological research which contributes to national objectives, including economic and social development, the maintenance of a strong capability in basic research and the development of internationally competitive industry; to capture the benefits of research; and to strengthen the links between research and its commercial and other applications.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It was always intended that there would be three selection rounds for CRCs. The first round saw the selection of 15 centres. These were announced by my predecessor in May of this year. Honourable members may be aware that today I have released a statement indicating funding arrangements for those 15 centres. Those details indicate that the Commonwealth has committed nearly $30m per year to fund those centres. Participants in the centres are providing resources totalling $345m over the contract period. Industry's commitment is almost $60m, with expectations of at least an additional $15m over the contract period. The second round is currently under way and an announcement of the successful second round applicants will be made by the Government in December. The third round will be conducted in 1992.</PARA>
<PARA>  The program to date has achieved much and is soundly based. Honourable members, however, may be aware of my recent speech at the ANZAAS congress when I said in part that I was not currently persuaded that the program had to date successfully focused on achieving a commercial outcome from research. I am, however, confident that that will occur. The CRC program as a whole must have appropriate and real industry participation and a clear focus on the commercialisation of research, although in some centres the most relevant research users may be Commonwealth and State agencies. I will be meeting tomorrow with the CRC committee as part of the second round process. That process is not a static operation; refinements on the way will ensure the program's success in achieving its objectives.</PARA>
<PARA>  In addition, consideration is currently being given to the guidelines for applicants for the third and final round of CRCs. These guidelines will be a clear signal to industry that the Government's focus for the program is on industry participation and on the commercialisation of research. That is a signal which industry must pick up. Industry participation in CRCs is a two-way street. So far as the Government is concerned, the signpost is quite clear from our perspective. I trust that industry will proceed accordingly and will take up the initiative. The program is an exciting one in which industry must participate and maximise the national benefits which flow from it. The CRC program is a great initiative of this Government. It has not been easy to implement but constant attention is being given to ensure that it successfully meets its objectives.</PARA>
<PARA>  I note in closing that, as is quite often the case, the Opposition spokesman, the honourable member for Gippsland, is behind the pace on this issue. I refer to the September issue of the respected science journal Search, where the honourable member is reported as saying that his main concern was with the heavy emphasis on commercialisation of science, possibly at the expense of basic research in universities. His view is less commercialisation, not more. I trust that in this, as in other areas, the honourable member for Gippsland will continue his tradition of getting on the correct policy line some two or three months after everyone else.</PARA>

In addition to the measures already in train, what other action could be taken to further reform those areas?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I have seen references made by the Leader of the Opposition to the area of micro-economic reform. Yet again last night he stood up in this place and gave his usual litany. He said, `We will reform aviation, we will reform the waterfront and we will reform telecommunications'. We have never heard how he proposes to do it. We have some sort of indication on this. We got the notion that he will introduce troops on the waterfront. That is one of his great schemes that he intends to bat on with. That is the sole indication thus far of what changes he expects to see there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Under the reforms that we have introduced on the waterfront, we are now getting very good productivity gains--far better than we anticipated, so much so that virtually by the end of this year the performance on our waterfront will be up to the standards that are being experienced now in some European and Japanese ports because the reforms have produced 70 per cent improvements in productivity. Of course, that has been accompanied by a large number of people--1,800 to this point--leaving the waterfront.</PARA>
<PARA>  There are substantial changes taking place there on the only basis on which changes can effectively take place; that is, they are jawboned--somebody sits down and does the solid, hard yakka of talking his way through with the waterside workers and with the union movement generally. The Opposition has absolutely no view about how that ought to be done. Then we go into the area of telecommunications. All that we have actually heard from the Opposition on reform in the area of telecommunications is a notion of privatising Telecom. Anybody who has studied any of the areas where privatisation of the main carrier has been made the principal focus of reform will know that that principal focus of reform and privatisation inevitably means that decisions are taken persistently over time to favour the main carrier in order to ensure that a proper price is achieved on behalf of the taxpayers' investment.

If that is the motive for the way in which those opposite intend to deal with Telecom, we know that they will constantly and persistently--because the whole of their policy will hang on it--seek to augment the value of Telecom as they sell it to the detriment of competition. It will not be competition and there will not be the efficiencies for business that come with that. And, of course, that is only a piece of what their intentions are. Not only will they defend the value of Telecom in order to pay at one level for their consumption tax and the income tax cuts associated with it but also they will be loading onto the system overall their 12.5 per cent, 10 per cent, 15 per cent, or whatever, consumption tax, diminishing what gains there are for business and for the ordinary citizen that come from competition in the telecommunications area.

<PARA>  Mr Fife--Mr Acting Speaker, before I move that the debate be adjourned, I seek your indulgence to ascertain from the Leader of the House whether there will be an early opportunity for that particular paper to be debated in this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA>  Mr Beazley--In answer to the question from the honourable member for Hume, the most likely opportunity would arise after the restriction of the Macklin motion, for want of a better term, is imposed by the Senate on us for legislation to be considered this year. It certainly would not be debated before then. However, we will have some days of subsequent sittings and an opportunity may well arise. As I recollect, last session we did bring on one or two matters that the Opposition wanted debated when we were in a similar period. Perhaps the best thing to do, in case such a time emerges, would be for members of the Opposition to prioritise the various matters that they have sought to adjourn debate on and give us some idea of what they want to do.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-For the information of honourable members, I present a report by the Australian Science and Technology Council, ASTEC, entitled Research and Technology:  Future Directions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I seek leave to make a statement on the report. </PARA>
<PARA>  Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HG4">Mr FREE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In May 1989 a Government statement, Science and Technology for Australia, set out in a comprehensive manner the Government's approach to science and technology.  Following on from this, ASTEC's 1990 report, Setting Directions for Australian Research, recommended that the Government's approach to science and technology policy formulation be continually refined and developed by way of a rolling four year review process through which broad national directions for science and technology policy could be set.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Subsequently, the Government asked ASTEC to prepare an issues and options report which would prepare the way for the first White Paper on Science and Technology, due to be tabled in May of next year. Research and Technology: Future Directions is ASTEC's response to this request. </PARA>
<PARA>  While providing the foundation on which the White Paper will be built, this report will not be the sole contributor. Others will include:</PARA>
<PARA>    ASTEC's current review of the need for major national research facilities;</PARA>
<PARA>    the continuing work of the Coordination Committee on Science and Technology;</PARA>
<PARA>    discussions at the Prime Minister's Science Council; and</PARA>
<PARA>    consideration of the conclusions of the two task forces which are examining the commercialisation of research. </PARA>
<PARA>  I expect to receive the report of the group chaired by Mr Ray Block by the end of the month. </PARA>
<PARA>  ASTEC's production of Research and Technology: Future Directions has required an unprecedented level of consultation with those who have an interest in the direction of research and technology policy in Australia. This included the review of nearly 200 submissions, meetings in all major capital cities, and an intensive interview program with over 100 top level managers in industry and government. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to ASTEC and its secretariat for their dedication and persistence in carrying through this task. In many ways the consultative process has been as important as the report itself, by involving so many across the nation in considering future directions for science and technology. </PARA>
<PARA>  Following release of the report, ASTEC has arranged for the consultation process to continue through discussion sessions being held across the nation. The contents of ASTEC's report range widely across all national areas where research and technology can be brought to bear. The principal issues and options fall under five main headings:</PARA>
<PARA>    research, technology and international competitiveness;</PARA>
<PARA>    energy and environment;</PARA>
<PARA>    the quality of Australian life;</PARA>
<PARA>    managing Australia's research resources; and</PARA>
<PARA>    the role of the Commonwealth and States in research and technology policy.</PARA>
<PARA>  This report, and the debate which it will stimulate, will be a major input to the White Paper process of shaping the future directions of research, science and technology policy in Australia. It will have a substantial impact on the future development of science and technology in Australia and at the same time will contribute to lifting the level of awareness of the important role that science and technology can play in meeting national goals. </PARA>
<PARA>  I urge all honourable members to give consideration to the report and to the White Paper process which will culminate in its tabling in this House in May next year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-by leave--This report, Research and Technology: Future Directions, represents an enormous investment in time and resources, not just by ASTEC, but by the scientific and technological community, which so generously contributed to the processes which have culminated in the report. A cursory glance at appendix B of the report in fact provides an appreciation of the scope of that participation. It also affords a useful insight into the enormous range of activity across the science and technology related research effort. The report has considerable value. It has distilled a wide variety of concerns across the community in respect of the capacity and condition of the research base.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  There are some who would no doubt say ASTEC's report, as tabled today, has daringly rediscovered the wheel, though only in generalised terms. But there is considerably more to the report than this. The report does confirm some longstanding and continuing concerns on the coalition's part with the structure and balance of the nation's research effort. This is particularly so in regard to the necessity, as outlined in the report, for governments to ensure there is appropriate balance within the research effort between market and knowledge or curiosity driven research, which the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free) touched on in Question Time; to provide greater opportunities for coordinating more research programs and resources at the State and Federal levels; to guarantee the research effort has the capacity and the flexibility to respond to changing national needs; and to provide a national economic environment conducive to longer term investment by the private sector in research and development. </PARA>
<PARA>  The report has also called for closer attention to priority setting processes at the national level. Whether or not ASTEC has been successful in articulating its intentions and designs in this regard will be left for later judgment. Notwithstanding this, the issues of priority setting and balance are important to the scientific and technological community. Unlike small business or the agricultural community, whose role in the life of the nation is relatively easily mapped out, there are a range of expectations about the role of scientific researchers and the like. </PARA>
<PARA>  In this regard it is necessary that the research effort retain a high degree of flexibility, diversity and autonomy in the nation's research effort. The themes of autonomy, diversity and flexibility are far from simple slogans. They are very tangible characteristics of an effective national research effort. </PARA>
<PARA>  In times of economic difficulty, when the competition for resources is at fever pitch, there are temptations to reach for simple solutions. In such periods, politicians and bureaucrats suddenly find courage to drag into the main game ideas which once sat listlessly on the boundary of their thinking. For example, channelling resources into pre-specified or administratively predetermined industries for value adding or, in particular, so-called emerging technologies, are cases in point. The capacity of a government driven administrative process for achieving meaningful industry or technology development outcomes is questionable to say the least. Issues such as this finally turn on much deeper structural issues. ASTEC is not unaware of this. </PARA>
<PARA>  The ASTEC report has conceded that the economic environment in which the private sector seeks to build its competitiveness is critical in determining its rate of adoption of technological inputs. To illustrate the point, I refer the House to page 5 of the report, which states:</PARA>
<PARA>The private sector must continue to be encouraged to fund and perform more of the nation's research and technology effort if we are to derive maximum economic and social benefits from our resources in these areas. At present, higher levels of investment by the business sector in research in Australia are being inhibited by the financial environment within which firms operate. Long-term, higher risk investments are discouraged by the structure of the tax system, high interest rates and a poorly developed venture capital market. Removing these and other impediments to achieving a better integrated and more effective research and technology system should be a priority for governments in the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA>I also remind the House that predetermined priority setting processes at the national level do have longer term ramifications for the way in which scientific and technological resources are distributed to objectives. Once the issue of targeting available resources to predetermined industry sectors or emerging technologies is let loose, the larger, traditional roles of science and technology in the community are threatened. </PARA>
<PARA>  Drawing to a conclusion, the report will also provide an important point of reference within which policy debates will take place in the future. The report is also accessible and structured in such a way as to allow it to infiltrate popular discussions about the role of science and technology in regard to wider economic, social, educational and environmental issues. In this respect, the report will also hopefully serve to raise the awareness across the community, including the business sector, of the very significant and real advantages which Australia's scientists and engineers return to the nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-by leave--The Uruguay Round is now in its fifth year. It was, and remains, a bold and ambitious endeavour--a unique opportunity to build a fairer and more durable international trading system for the 1990s and beyond. These are difficult negotiations, but to those who say that it is too hard and to those who suggest we should settle for some cosmetic quick fix, let me offer another perspective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In the five years that the Uruguay Round has been under way, eastern Europe and Latin America have undergone radical political and economic restructuring. The Soviet Union is set to join them. There have been massive advances in general disarmament, and nuclear disarmament is no longer just a hope but an emerging reality. The environmental protection of the Antarctic has been addressed, with an ambitious outcome, by the international community. Peace is imminent in Cambodia, and the United Nations has again become a force to be reckoned with in world affairs. All of those things have taken place since the commencement of the Uruguay Round. </PARA>
<PARA>  Some of the most intractable problems of the twentieth century have been resolved with political courage and commitment. Against such a background, no-one can claim with any credibility that reform of world trade is beyond us.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Uruguay Round now needs its share of political courage and commitment as the negotiations enter a final and decisive stage in the weeks ahead. If the political decisions are not made by mid-November, the Round cannot be completed by March 1992. It would simply drift into 1993, and then the chances of resuscitation would be at best doubtful. </PARA>
<PARA>  If I may recap for a moment, honourable members will be aware that the Uruguay Round broke down in Brussels in December last year when the European Community failed to seriously engage across the negotiating table. Agriculture became the pivotal issue as the Cairns Group and others declared, `No agriculture, no deal'. After a fragile re-start to the negotiations in February and the extension of the United States' fast track negotiating mandate in May, leaders of the Group of Seven leading industrialised nations took an important stand in July. The Cairns Group had called on the G7 to rise above the rhetoric and ambiguity of its past involvement and make a constructive contribution to the negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA>  The G7, which includes four key members of the European Community, did so, signalling a clear advance in its attitude to the Uruguay Round. The G7 leaders also pledged to intervene in the process again if necessary, putting their authority and credibility on the line--and their intervention may yet be required. In recent days there has been another encouraging development. The German Government has declared that it will seek to secure much needed elbow room for the European Commission negotiators to achieve an outcome on agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA>  These important developments must lead to serious and constructive negotiations, particularly those dealing with agriculture. It is time to break out of the `dialogue of the deaf', as GATT Director-General, Arthur Dunkel, has previously described the negotiations. Arthur Dunkel is providing that opportunity. He has laid down a program of intensive negotiations this month which it is intended will culminate in the tabling next month of a paper covering all aspects of the negotiations. In the weeks ahead all participants must look at their negotiating positions and show the flexibility required for Mr Dunkel and his colleagues to fashion credible compromises across all aspects of the Uruguay Round. </PARA>
<PARA>  If we are to achieve a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round, this paper must contain the essence of an outcome to the Uruguay Round--it must reflect the tough political decisions which are now required. And if the major powers are not capable of making those decisions, the Director-General will have no alternative, if the Round is to have any hope of success, but to table this paper on his own authority on a `take it or leave it' basis. It is now make or break time in the Uruguay Round. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australia has put much effort into achieving progress in the negotiations and will continue to do so. As honourable members will be aware, I have just returned from leading a delegation to Europe which included colleagues from the other side of the House and the National Farmers Federation. We left no-one in any doubt as to the serious need for a substantial outcome to the Uruguay Round. </PARA>
<PARA>  I might add that the Government greatly appreciates the bipartisan commitment which exists on this issue. Similarly, our role in the Uruguay Round has been greatly enhanced by the support and involvement of the Australian farm and business communities. My colleague the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) has this week told the world's finance Ministers meeting at the International Monetary Fund in Bangkok that there is no more pressing need on the international agenda than a substantial result from the Uruguay Round. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Treasurer correctly asserted that reconstruction of the economies of eastern Europe and the Soviet Union will be greatly assisted by the reform of world agricultural trade and reductions in protectionism. A failure to achieve this would be a repudiation of their courageous moves towards democracy and more open economies. </PARA>
<PARA>  Last week the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) discussed the Uruguay Round at length with German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, and at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Harare this week impressed upon UK Prime Minister, John Major, and his Canadian counterpart, Brian Mulroney, the importance of heads of government taking a leading role in moving the negotiations forward. The Prime Minister stressed to these key leaders the necessity for heads of government to give the Round the necessary impetus required for a successful conclusion. In particular, Arthur Dunkel must have the authority to produce a paper which delivers the major breakthroughs that we are all looking for. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Prime Minister has informed me that the level of commitment of Chancellor Kohl and Prime Ministers Major and Mulroney to the Round is most encouraging. Indeed, since the discussion with Chancellor Kohl, the German Government has indicated that it will seek to ensure a successful outcome to the Uruguay Round by urging the European Commission negotiators to show the flexibility required to achieve such a result. There is a growing awareness of what is at stake. The Prime Minister will continue to be actively engaged in the Round at heads of government level in the coming crucial weeks. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is a different atmosphere surrounding the Uruguay Round this year from that which prevailed pre-Brussels. But I must say that while we welcome the signs of flexibility which are slowly emerging, we must also reiterate that only a substantial result right across the Uruguay Round will ensure success. The European Community must move beyond its position at the Brussels meeting last year on agriculture. The Japanese, who have benefited so much from the growth in trade in industrial goods under the GATT, must accept the need for comprehensive reform of agricultural trade. The United States must reconsider its position on services. The developing world must be assured of tangible benefits from reform of textiles trade, agricultural trade and trade in tropical products in order for it to make the commitments required to protect intellectual property rights and secure a services framework. </PARA>
<PARA>  With our Cairns Group colleagues in the agriculture negotiations, we stand ready with the flexibility we have shown throughout these negotiations to strike a deal which will deliver long term gains to the nation's farmers. But that deal must include some fundamental elements. The corruption of world agricultural markets caused by export subsidies must be turned back. Those markets and products which have escaped this iniquitous trade distortion must remain free of export subsidisation. </PARA>
<PARA>  Border protection must only be delivered through tariffs and be subject to firm reduction commitments. Market access must increase over time. The link between internal support and production must be broken and support delivered in a way which will not encourage the production of surpluses which are then subsidised into international markets. Such a fundamental restructuring of agricultural support and protection should ensure that, over time, world market prices start to influence production decisions, and efficient and competitive farmers like those in Australia have a fair go in the international marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA>  Lest there be any illusions that Australia is a single issue country preoccupied with agriculture, I would like to comment on several other aspects of the Uruguay Round negotiations. An agreement on trade in services will provide some much needed ground rules by which this growing area of economic activity, both for Australia and for the world, can be conducted with certainty and an equality of opportunity. As such, the integrity of a services agreement must not be undermined by a weak application of the `most favoured nation' principle, and we look to the United States to take a more forthcoming and forward looking stance on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA>  Most favoured nation treatment is a fundamental principle of the GATT which ensures that access granted to one country, in this case to provide services, is granted to all countries. Australia was amongst the first countries to table an offer in the services negotiations. We agreed to maintain existing access to, and not introduce further regulations in, those service industries covered by our offer. After much consultation with industry and State governments, we are now preparing a revised offer which will be among the best on the table in Geneva. </PARA>
<PARA>  But this offer on services will only remain on the table if other countries are forthcoming with offers of value to Australia. We have made requests on 21 of our key trading partners for the lifting of impediments to the growth of Australian service industries overseas. These cover such activities as financial services, tourism, telecommunications and professional services. </PARA>
<PARA>  As Australia becomes more of a clever country it will benefit from the stronger protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights being negotiated in the Uruguay Round. Breaches of copyright on sound recordings, for example, are already costing Australians millions of dollars annually in export income. The protection of patents to retain the benefit of Australian design ingenuity is also dependent on a good outcome in the TRIPS negotiations. Patent applications lodged in foreign countries by Australia have grown from 5,000 in 1983 to 17,000 in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the more traditional GATT activity of market access negotiations, Australia is also strongly placed. In an effort to stimulate much needed industry restructuring in Australia, the Government has dramatically cut tariffs on two occasions during the course of the Uruguay Round. While these tariff cuts benefit foreign suppliers, the ultimate value to our trading partners is the extent to which Australia is prepared to give a commitment that tariffs will not rise again in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>  Put another way, Australia has accumulated significant `negotiating coin' in being able to decide at what levels it will bind its tariffs in the GATT--and that decision will only be taken when our trading partners have shown their hand. Australia has far exceeded the Uruguay Round target for a bound one-third cut in tariffs but to date only about 10 countries have reached that mark. Many countries are waiting for advances in the agriculture negotiations before exposing their manufacturing industries to greater import competition. </PARA>
<PARA>  Achievement of that one-third tariff cut goal would save Australian exporters about $750m in import duties alone--even before taking account of the improved market access which would flow from such an outcome. Australia's requests for tariff cuts range from zinc alloy into the United States, car parts and breakfast cereals into Asia-Pacific markets and toothbrushes into Thailand, to mention just a few. </PARA>
<PARA>  Elsewhere in the Uruguay Round, Australia continues to resist efforts to prohibit certain industry policy measures which have a local content criteria or are linked to export performance. Australia has argued that such policies can complement industry restructuring and that only the trade distorting effects of trade related investment measures--or TRIMS as they are known--should be addressed in the GATT. The likely outcome of those negotiations is as yet unclear. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australia is also active in negotiations dealing with GATT rules and institutions, arguing for further improvement to the GATT dispute settlement procedures. Our objective is to reduce the capacity of countries to impose their own solutions to trade problems to the detriment of the multilateral trading system. </PARA>
<PARA>  Mr Deputy Speaker, I have highlighted several aspects of the Uruguay Round negotiations to indicate that Australia has interests which extend well beyond agriculture. But the key to a satisfactory outcome to the Uruguay Round remains agriculture. It is vital in the weeks ahead that our negotiating partners take the initiative in this area in order to bring this most important round of negotiations to a successful conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have come a long way in the Uruguay Round but there is much difficult terrain yet to be negotiated. The Round will not be a panacea for all our trade problems but it is a rare opportunity to take a big step towards a more open trading world. It offers opportunities and benefits not only for countries like ourselves but also for those which have taken the bold steps towards political and economic reform. And to the extent that some industrialised nations might be inclined to stand in the way of reform, they should be put on notice that their credibility and integrity is on the line. The reform of world trade, particularly agricultural trade, must not be put in the too hard basket. It is now time to get on with the job. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-by leave--The coalition welcomes the statement on the Uruguay Round that has been made by the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Dr Blewett). As the Minister pointed out in his statement, we have given our strong support to Australia's role in pursuit of a successful outcome of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I want the Government to remember that it should not underestimate the value of bipartisan support on an issue such as this. When one goes out into the Australian community, one finds that people are profoundly sceptical, one could say cynical, about the Uruguay Round. We could have made cheap political capital by criticising the emphasis of the Government's trade policy on the Uruguay Round. </PARA>
<PARA>  Nevertheless, the truth is that the Uruguay Round is the main game in international trade. Our resources must overwhelmingly be devoted to ensuring a successful outcome. It would have been very much to our discredit if we had done anything but what we have done, that is, given our strong support to the efforts of the Government in this area. When the Government may not have thought of initiatives, we have tried to produce creative ideas and proposals. For example, we put forward the proposal for bipartisan delegations--one to the United States in the context of the export enhancement program and another recent one to the European Community.   Last December we asked whether we could participate in the Australian delegation to the Brussels final conference and, after careful consideration, the Minister decided that it would not be appropriate. We were disappointed at that, given the strong support we had given to the Government's position. We hope that the Government will change its position if a ministerial delegation is to participate, as inevitably it will, in the final throes of the Uruguay Round. </PARA>
<PARA>  On this side of the House, as is the case with the Government, we well and truly recognise that the Uruguay Round is the most important single issue on the international agenda. I might say very briefly that it disappoints me that there are only four members in the House--and three or four people and a school group in the gallery--to take note of a discussion on an issue as fundamental as this to the future of our country and the global trading system. The fact is that this is the most important single issue on the international agenda. I acknowledge the presence in the chamber of the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew). He is one of the members who have taken a particular interest in this issue. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let me say that we should not underestimate the enormous cost to the international community of failure in the Uruguay Round. It could be the trigger that will lead to the creation of hostile trading blocs. It could lead to substantial increases in protection tariff and non-tariff protection. It could lead, and almost certainly would lead, to the exacerbation of the already very damaging trade wars through the process of using export subsidies. It could even lead to the collapse of the GATT system. There is no doubt that if the Uruguay Round does collapse--and there is a danger that that could happen--it will be an economic catastrophe for the whole world, in particular for developing countries, the countries which in my view have the most to gain from a successful outcome from the Uruguay Round. </PARA>
<PARA>  As the Minister pointed out, from Australia's point of view at the heart of the Uruguay Round is agriculture. When one looks at the state of international agriculture and its impact on Australia, it is clear why that is the case. The OECD's annual report on international farm policies for 1991 said that farm subsidies rose by 12 per cent in 1990 because a number of industrialised countries, in particular the European Community countries and the United States, had failed to adopt meaningful reforms. </PARA>
<PARA>  The report argued that the downward trend in farm subsidies during 1988-89 had been only temporary. The previous year's OECD report found that farmers in the world's 24 richest countries received $2 in every $5 they earned by way of aid in one form or another. Farmers in Australia and New Zealand, however, received less than 10 per cent of their income in assistance, compared with 75 per cent in Japan, 38 per cent in the European Community and 27 per cent in the United States. But the European Community's farm assistance is more insidious than Japan's, because the European Community's assistance to farmers affects third markets in a way that the Japanese assistance does not.  A 1988 study by the European Commission found that agricultural subsidies cost the equivalent of over $US14 billion in national payments alone, while EC-wide payments cost a further $US36 billion. Indeed, EC export subsidies for wheat are now higher than the underlying value of the product. </PARA>
<PARA>  These farm subsidies distort international trade and make it essential for countries like Australia, New Zealand and other Cairns Group countries to continue to seek multilateral solutions to the levels of agricultural protection existing in other countries. For that reason, Australia and other Cairns Group countries have had to push very hard on the issue of agriculture in the context of the Cairns Group. Estimates vary as to the gains that could be made from a worldwide liberalisation of trade in agriculture, but it is said that the liberalisation could bring price rises of between 27 and 61 per cent for dairy products and 15 to 27 per cent for beef. It has also been said that there would be a higher level of production in response to higher prices--which I think is fairly obvious--but that higher levels of production would take place where the comparative advantage lay, in efficient agricultural producing countries such as our own, and not in such countries as those in the European Community, where high levels of production are maintained through trade distortion. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is, then, very unfortunate that the European Community has not readily recognised the obvious advantages to the international trading system of making meaningful concessions in the area of agriculture. Nevertheless, Australia must retain the position that it has taken since last year, and which the United States and the Cairns Group have taken, that without a deal on agriculture which is meaningful and of substance, there can be no successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round. That is a message that the Europeans in particular must well and truly understand. </PARA>
<PARA>  I actually believe that the Australian Government and the Cairns Group have tried very hard in almost every way imaginable to achieve that result. The Government produced a booklet which was distributed around the European Community recently. It antagonised some of the European governments, but I thought it was a good small step to take in trying to highlight the damage that the Europeans were doing to their own consumers and to Europe's position in the world. I have already mentioned the bipartisan delegation, and I would add to what I have said on that, that we were disappointed that the Government would not agree to heads-of-government level delegations but instead took lower-level delegations. </PARA>
<PARA>  I welcome the comments the Minister has made about the goodwill that has been expressed by the British Government. Indeed, Britain's record has always been good through the Uruguay Round on the issue of agriculture. But goodwill is now also being expressed by the Germans, and such goodwill has traditionally been expressed by the Dutch. The moment of hard decision on agriculture, however, is imminent. When the European Community finally does come back with its offer, it will put all of us in the very difficult position of having to assess whether we can accept that offer or say that the European Community clearly is not serious about concluding the Uruguay Round. The fact is that it will be a hard moment of decision, and I hope that the Government will consult the Opposition very closely on the nature of the offer from the Europeans, because clearly it would be preferable if the response to that offer could be of a bipartisan nature; otherwise, it may indeed place Australia's position in some difficulty. But, of course, the responsibility for that rests ultimately with the Government. That is an advantage of being in government, no doubt. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister referred to other areas of importance in the Uruguay Round, and there is no doubt that Australia has been right to take the position that it was not a single issue country. We have worked hard in the area of mineral resources trade to try to get better access for our coal into the German, British and Japanese markets. I think the Government has done a credible job in the field of services, recognising the importance of the service industries to our own country and the potential that we have there. It has given high priority to intellectual property. As the Minister said, we have great gains to make with a successful agreement on intellectual property in areas such as sound recordings, literature and computer software. </PARA>
<PARA>  The issue of market access has always been an important one to us. We may argue that the Government has not given a strong enough commitment to reducing tariffs between now and the year 2000 and that those tariffs should be reduced to negligible levels across the board, but one cannot complain about the fact that the Government is heading at least in the right direction. In the context of the Uruguay Round, our offer is amongst the most intelligent and the best. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is one of the areas where we believe that the Government--I almost choke on the words--has done a good job. It was certainly a success to play its part in bringing together the Cairns Group some years ago. That Group has certainly taken up the bipartisan hand that we have extended to it in the context of bipartisan missions, and I think it has had some limited success. It has helped to make Australia's point. I think that the way we have been able to address the Uruguay Round as a national effort rather than as a partisan effort has been very helpful to our country and to the cause that we have been pursuing in the Uruguay Round. </PARA>
<PARA>  I approach the last few months of the Uruguay Round--I believe that they are the last few months--with some optimism. I think there is a good chance that the Europeans will recognise the challenges that lie ahead of them and the benefits that could accrue to Europe from a successful outcome of the Uruguay Round. It is important for the whole world that the Uruguay Round succeeds, and I wish the Government well in its endeavours over the next few months to ensure that we play our part as a middle ranking power in obtaining a successful resolution to those problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Ever since the last election this Labor Government has subjected the people of Australia to a farrago of lies and deception in its vain attempts to deny the existence of the recession that it created as a deliberate act of government policy. It has taken only 3 1/2 months for the new Treasurer (Mr Kerin) to put himself into his predecessor's league. While the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) will be long remembered by the Australian people as the Treasurer who had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the precipice of honesty in relation to the recession that he had engineered, the present Treasurer will be remembered as the man who did not have the courage to stand in the Australian Parliament to address the Australian people and tell them honestly about the state of the Australian economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Treasurer has branded himself a coward by his own act. What he said last night is of great significance to the future of this country. In one simple sentence, without equivocation, the Treasurer admitted for the first time that we are in the worst recession that this country has faced for 60 years. That is an important statement. It is important because we will not have the change that we need in this country unless people have a sense of the gravity of our circumstances. As long as this Government continues to deceive people about what is wrong with this country, it will delay the changes that so obviously are necessary. As the Government delays the changes for its own political ends, it simply ensures that the damage caused to the Australian economy will be very great indeed. </PARA>
<PARA>  Mark my words, the Government will scar this generation and the next generation of Australians for decades to come unless it wakes up to itself about the gravity of the crisis that it has inflicted upon this country. This country is literally drifting, as the demand and need for change passes this Government by and as the Government, in an introspective way, concerns itself with one thing: the job of the Prime Minister instead of the jobs of nearly one million unemployed--one million unemployed as a result of the Government's policy. </PARA>
<PARA>  This country is going to have to make some changes. We either make them now ourselves and minimise the costs or we wait until a greater adjustment is literally forced upon us as a result of our circumstances deteriorating further. This country has a chance to consider its circumstances, realistically assess where it is and then drive on for the changes that will the Australian people some glimmer for the future. </PARA>
<PARA>  Our problem today is that this country's leadership is gripped by complacency. We have two sectors in the Australian economy. The government sector, and all the apparatus that surrounds government, is controlling and making the policy and living off the second sector, the free enterprise sector, upon which the great majority of Australian men and women and families depend for their living standards. The Government, as a deliberate result of its policy, which it has admitted publicly, has set out to crush the private sector to the great disadvantage of those very families. </PARA>
<PARA>  So this admission by the Treasurer last night is critical. It is an admission that the reality of our circumstances is that there is the chance to build up a consensus, a gathering, a momentum for change in this country, which it so desperately needs. It is a chance to inject a sense of urgency about what has to be done in this country in the future. Does it not rather remind honourable members of the banana republic statement of 1986? That was one of the few good things the last Treasurer did. In one frank moment--one crack, as it were, in the facade--we got an honest statement about what needed to be done. Since then, we have had nothing but a litany of lies about where this country has been going. </PARA>
<PARA>  First we were told that there would be a soft landing. The Minister for Finance and Acting Treasurer (Mr Willis), who is at the table, was in the business of peddling that untruth to the Australian public. Then the Government had the gall to say, `There will be no recession'. It constantly pounded away with the words, `There will be no recession'. </PARA>
<PARA>  When we got to the election in 1990, the Prime Minister said, `There is no reason to fear a recession'. Do honourable members remember those words, along with the untruth about there being no deal with the ex-Treasurer about the leadership of this country? The Government went from, `There is no need to fear a recession' to the arrogance of the former Treasurer, who said that he would not let there be a recession. That was a classic. That one, of course, disappeared into history. </PARA>
<PARA>  When the figures had proven beyond doubt that the country was in a recession, the former Treasurer had the gall to say, `This is the recession we had to have'. For heaven's sake, what gullibility does the Government ascribe to the Australian people? What a cheek. What an impertinence to imply that the Government had some sense of control over the Australian economy. Now we have, `Not as bad as 1982-83'--another one of the Government's favourite lines. Have we not had that one rammed down our throats?</PARA>
<PARA>  The former Treasurer, not one to mince his words--when he was standing shoulder to shoulder with the Prime Minister, honourable members might remember--on 30 May 1991, said:</PARA>
<PARA>So it is not true to say that this is the worst recession in 60 years, because the worst recession in 60 years was in 1982-83. There it was, and there are the statisticians' figures to prove it. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not true. He ought to be in here as the second speaker in this debate to defend the allegation made against him that he in fact deceived the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Prime Minister is not too bad on hyperbole as well. He has been running the line for months and months that the recovery is coming. In December last year he was talking about the recovery and the pick-up in the housing sector. He was saying the same thing nearly 12 months ago that he was saying just last week before he went off to CHOGM. In December 1990 he said:</PARA>
<PARA>All those statistical facts show that the recessed condition of the Australian economy at this time is nothing like what it was in 1982-83. </PARA>
<PARA>That is not true. That is clearly untrue. That is a falsehood.That is clearly deceiving the Australian public about the state of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA>  I must say that I was taken aback by the Acting Prime Minister today. We asked him a very simple question--`Do you agree or don't you agree with the Treasurer that Australia is in the worst recession for 60 years?. Are we or aren't we?'. Do honourable members know what he said in his answer? He said, `When I think of recession, I think of recovery'. It is a classic. When someone confronts him with the problem, his natural thought, coincidently, is to start talking about the recovery; to deny the existence of that which the Government itself has created. </PARA>
<PARA>  By all means, let us look to see whether there is a recovery. It is true that housing has picked up a bit. The other one the Acting Prime Minister mentioned was retail figures. They have picked up a bit. I think it was the Managing Director of David Jones who said the other day that the reason they had picked up was that people had been selling at low prices just to keep themselves in business. Do honourable members notice how the Government avoids the fundamental things in our economy?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Investment--as the honourable member for Bennelong rightly says. The Government itself is pretending that it is going drop by 10 1/2 per cent. Private sector forecasters say that it is going to drop by 17 or 18 per cent. The propensity of Australians to save is at an all-time record low. I say to the Minister that one does not need an economics degree to know that unless we have investment for the future in this country there will be no sustained recovery. It is as simple as that. The ANZ Bank's figures show that job ads are down 3 per cent. The latest bankruptcy figures are up 55.4 per cent. The latest unemployment figures are 10.2 per cent and rising, even on the Government's own figures. And it is not just 872,000 who are unemployed; nearly 1.4 million Australians are unemployed or underemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Treasurer himself said that there is a depression in parts of rural Australia--and there is. Only today and last night the second message came from afar. Mr Chambers, of Standard and Poor's, talks about one of the fundamentals which we have to get right in this country. He is quoted in the Australian Financial Review this morning as saying that he termed Australia as one of the greediest consumers of foreign capital and one of the highest indebted countries in the world. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>This is clearly not a sustainable position. . . Australia must simply undergo a significant transformation to reduce its exposure to the whims of the international capital market". </PARA>
<PARA>What is the Minister's line? His line is that we fixed the problem. That is patently untrue. It is just another deception--one deception after another. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are in a rolling recession. This country has to realise that things are tough and they are going to get tougher unless we start to make the changes that will give people higher living standards in the future. We critically need a set of national objectives. We need a clear, realistic assessment of the problems. We need a clear set of solutions. We need the people to implement those solutions. We need a strategy for implementation. </PARA>
<PARA>  When the Treasurer gets back to this shore, the first thing he ought to do is call a press conference and have the decency and honesty to say frankly to the Australian people what he was prepared to tell some foreigners but was not prepared to say here in Australia. The second thing that ought to happen is that the Prime Minister ought to make clear whether or not he endorses the view of his Treasurer, because unless we have the leadership which has been so sadly lacking in recent years, there is little hope for the major change that this country seeks and desperately needs. </PARA>
<PARA>  This country has faced difficult times--the worst recession for 60 years. It is clearly worse than 1982-83, by any reasonably objective criteria. Taking out of the calculation one of the seasonal factors that affect the rural industry--the drought in 1982, during the last Government--and looking at gross non-farm product for 1982-83 and 1990-91, we see that in 1982-83 GDP fell by 1.2 per cent. In 1990-91, from the September quarter 1990 to the June quarter 1991--and this recession is not yet over--that non-farm GDP fell by 2.7 per cent. It fell by 1.2 per cent in 1982, and that was the end of that recession. This time it has fallen 2.7 per cent, and the recession is not yet over. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is no good talking about recovery, it is no good talking about better times, when things still remain to be done. The trouble with Labor people is that they have long prided themselves about creating jobs. The embarrassment for them, of course, was sharpened when the unemployment figure went through the 10 per cent barrier, because they promised that the figure would never go above 10 per cent. What afflicts these people is that they have been stunned by that. There is a psychological barrier that they have difficulty facing. They have difficulty facing the honesty of the fact that they have created this recession and they now sit there paralysed, unable to make the changes that this country needs. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are many things to be done. We in the Opposition expect to win the next election, and the Government's factional infighting will, I suppose, cement those prospects for us, but quite frankly a lot of people are going to go broke in the meantime. So it is that I say to the Minister for Finance that there are changes that the Government could make. If the Government gets the changes right, we will support it. It should not be running a scare campaign on tax reform when we know that the abolition of one tax system, the wholesale sales tax system, is going to provide a tremendous boost for business, which is going to mean jobs for people. The Government should not run a scare campaign; it ought to support something which five years ago it was prepared to support and which it then backed off. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government ought to change the industrial relations system, because one in three young people basically cannot get a job today. There could be jobs for young people but for the fact that the Government is not prepared to confront its mates in the trade union movement. That is a disgrace which the Government will live with throughout its political life. </PARA>
<PARA>  It ought to go ahead with privatisation. The Russians will have privatised Aeroflot before these guys gets on with a decent privatisation program in this country. It is time for change--time for change now. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-We have just listened for a quarter of an hour to a speech about how we need to have change in this country. Of course, if nothing was happening and if there had been no change in recent years, I suppose that that would be a fair enough plea. There are two remarkable aspects about that general theme: firstly, of course, there has never been a time in the history of this country in which there has been so much structural change; and, secondly, the reason we need this structural change is that for the 33 years before we came into office those opposite were in government and there was created in this country a structure of economic development which was patently wrong and which, the conservatives now agree, should have been way over the other side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The conservative parties of this country developed this country in the post-war period. They governed the country from 1949 to 1972 and from 1975 to the beginning of 1983--for 30 of the 33 years before we came into office. The structure of the economy that needs the change which it is now getting is one which the conservatives developed, an economic structure which, like eastern Europe, is now quite clearly and patently unsuited to the future of the nation. </PARA>
<PARA>  We see--as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) crawls out of the place, unable to face his Party's responsibility for the fact that this country needs so much structural change--that the conservatives in this country are in an extraordinarily hypocritical position: they are condemning this Government for not undertaking enough structural change, whereas it is undertaking a vast array of structural change and needs to do so because it was the conservatives who developed a highly protected economy, one which was patently non-internationally competitive, one which had a totally uncompetitive economy compared to those of our trading partners, and one which gave us a Third World pattern of exports. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Deputy Leader of the Opposition made reference to the comments of the gentleman from Standard and Poor's. Of course, what that gentleman said was that the most important concern he had about Australia was the structure of its exports because it was so patently dependent on commodities. Why is that the case? That is the case because the whole development of this country in the post-war period was such that the only things that we could export were the things that we grew or dug up. We had a manufacturing industry, nurtured behind exceedingly high tariff walls and import restrictions, which was patently incapable of developing markets overseas and needed enormous protection against imports. Of course, the conservatives gave us this highly difficult economic structure and put us in peril in respect of our balance of payments. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, all that became obvious by the time the Fraser Government was going out of office. Despite the fact that we had all these mineral developments through the 1960s and 1970s which put off the evil day when we had to confront the realities of our economy and its limitations, by 1980-81 we had a balance of payments current account deficit of 6 per cent. So the problem was starkly obvious then. It went down with the recession, of course, but it came back to be a problem which this Government has had to deal with. This Government has been dealing with that in a way that no previous Government has ever done, undertaking a vast array of structural change which is making this country a much more competitive country. </PARA>
<PARA>  That is quite clear in a host of industries where competition is being developed, making it a lower wage cost country in respect of its competitors; producing a lower rate of inflation; making us much more internationally competitive--our international competitiveness is about 18 per cent higher now than it was when we came into office; and giving us the capacity to develop manufacturing exports and to get that highly imbalanced pattern of exports put onto something which is much more respectable and much more akin to a developed industrialised country. That is what we see being achieved by what is happening to manufactured exports. Manufactured exports, as the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Dr Blewett) explained to the House at Question Time yesterday, have been growing to a startling degree. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-If the honourable member finds the word offensive, I withdraw it. What a stupid comment. The fact is that manufactured exports have increased very rapidly and are now giving us something like a 40 per cent higher proportion of exports than they were when we came into office. Of course, that is building from a low base; we all know that. That is the low base that those opposite left us. But what we are certainly doing is getting a much more developed structure of exports than we have ever had in our history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  This will, as time goes on, give this country a much greater capacity to withstand the swings of commodity prices and to deal with the problems of vulnerable countries, as we have been, in a way in which other industrialised countries do; that is, it will give us the ability to maintain exports at times of downward swings of commodities because of the importance of manufactured exports. </PARA>
<PARA>   Of course, the Opposition, having moved from extreme protectionism to the other side, is now saying that we should deregulate everything and that we should completely abandon tariffs, and do it sooner rather than later, despite the fact that there is a clear pattern of reduced protection in place which is at, I think, the bearable rate for industry, giving those companies within the industries affected that are capable of becoming efficient a chance to do so and to withstand foreign competition. But the policies pursued by the Opposition, which say, `Let us abandon the graduated approach, let us go hell for leather', would, of course, mean that those industries would just fall over. </PARA>
<PARA>  Generally, our industry accepts that the policies being pursued by this Government are such that our manufactured exports are likely to be developed and our manufacturing industries are likely to be much more competitive. We will shift resources from those areas which do not have the capacity to face imports and develop exports to those areas that do. We will, therefore, develop higher levels of productivity and real income and get away from the pattern of low income growth which the conservative governments gave us all through the 1950s, 1960s and their period in office in the 1970s and early 1980s, which led us to the point where we were faced with extraordinary adjustment difficulties, as we are today. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Government has not shirked the issue. The allegation from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and others that we have shirked the issue on change is a complete and utter falsehood. I ask honourable members opposite to tell me of any other time in our history when there has been anything remotely like the degree of structural change which is now taking place in this country. There has been nothing like it. Look at telecommunications, which is a monopoly industry that has been put on a much more efficient basis even before competition is being brought in. It has a CPI-minus-X regime which means that prices are falling by 5 1/2 per cent less than the consumer price index each year. As well, competition is being brought in by the sale of Aussat and by the development of a competitor to Telecom at every level of its activities. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the domestic aviation industry, we deregulated the previous government's highly regulated industry and since deregulation, of course, we have seen considerable falls in prices and increased competition. In the shipping industry, there has been a remarkable change in work practices, resulting in greatly increased productivity and a fall in the average number of crew per ship from 33, as it was when we came into office, to 21 by the end of this year. That is a fantastic change and one clearly indicating very large increases in productivity in the shipping industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  As the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) was saying at Question Time, we are seeing the waterfront industry develop now enterprise based arrangements in the major ports. Sydney and Melbourne already have those arrangements concluded and most of the other major ports have them almost concluded. A total of 1,800 waterside workers are out of the industry ahead of schedule and another 400 are to go shortly. All of that is leading to considerably increased productivity on the waterfront. Already we have been seen a 70 per cent improvement in productivity in grain handling and, with the enterprise arrangements now in place, we have the likelihood of 70-plus per cent increases in productivity in the non-bulk area of the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA>  In those important areas we are seeing major changes taking place. Of course, across all industries, we are seeing the major changes coming from the industrial relations system--an industrial relations system which has worked infinitely better under this Government than any other in terms of wage outcomes. It is giving us wage outcomes of about 7 1/2 per cent at the maximum, which has been the highest level of any year and which was the lowest of any year under the Fraser Government. They are wage outcomes which altogether are almost half those that occurred under the previous government. So we are seeing a much better capacity to handle wages. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are also seeing increased flexibility in the way in which wages are set and, as a result of the case which is now before the Industrial Relations Commission, we expect that we will move more rapidly into enterprise bargaining for wage increases from November on. That will mean, of course, that there will be greater flexibility in wage setting, which is generally agreed to be a good thing--so long as, of course, it is within the context of a containment of the overall wages outcome. With the accord, we have the assurance that we will continue to contain the overall wages outcome and not have enterprise bargaining leading to wages blow-outs, as occurred under the previous Government when it had an 18 per cent wage increase in 1982. Of course, if honourable members opposite had enterprise bargaining without the accord, they would certainly find that, as soon as the economy got some movement going, they would have considerable wage blow-outs again. They would not have the accord, no assurance, no wages policy in an agreement with the unions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-We have the assurance from the ACTU and the accord that they will work with us to achieve wage outcomes which are comparable with those of our major trading partners. That is something that the trade union movement has never given any previous government as an assurance on wages policy. Of course, the important point in the context of the recession is that the Opposition, whilst criticising us for there being a recession, advocates policies which would make the recession worse, because its policy, as explained by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Budget debate, is to reduce the deficit to have at least a balanced Budget, thereby contracting budgetary policy, thereby creating less stimulus to the economy from the Budget, thereby pushing us into higher levels of unemployment in the short run. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition says, `But we would balance that with interest rate reductions'. Of course, we all know that there are great lags on interest rate policy. That has been shown quite clearly in recent times, and that would mean that the stimulus that came from any interest rate cuts would be further out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Of course, in the policies being pursued by this Government, there is a responsible stimulus from the Budget. In other words, we are not pump priming. We have allowed the automatic stabilisers to operate--that is, for the loss of revenue and the increased expenditure which comes automatically with increased unemployment to take place--and for the stimulus that comes from that to have its impact, and through that the provision of some assurance that the economy will shortly start on a clear recovery path, as the Budget forecasts show. So, in respect of budgetary policy, we are clearly in a position where our policies are much more suited to employment growth than the Opposition's. In respect of monetary policy, we have shown our preparedness to cut interest rates responsibly over the last year and a half, in which there have been 8 1/2 per cent reductions in official rates. In the future, as we are able responsibly to do so, we will certainly bear in mind the need to take advantage of the opportunity to do so. Finally, of course, in relation to tax reform, we have Opposition members pursuing a course which would put inflation back into double digit figures, and they would give us double digit inflation and double digit unemployment, as they did when in government in 1982-83.

Certainly not! When those opposite complain about high rates of tariffs, the beauty of their complaints is that the Labor Party in its very first election in 1901 came in on four different platforms, and one of them was an increase in tariff protection.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Yes, the sales tax. That consumption tax had only six exemptions. I know it is 650 now, but it was only six when the Labor Party introduced it. So where is the Labor Party? The Minister claims that manufacturing exports are suddenly booming. This is a great Labor boast. I was in Whyalla two weeks ago. I went to the BHP steelworks there. They told me their exports had increased. I thought, `Gosh, that is good. That is really encouraging'. I asked, `Why?', and they said, `So we can keep the blast furnace going. We can't sell at a profit. We are just dumping the steel into the international marketplace, not at a profit but to keep the blast furnace going'. If those opposite think that is successful manufacturing export, they are wrong. BHP is in the export market because the Government throttled the domestic market to death.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The point is that the policies that have been introduced by this Government have been ones which have deliberately hurt people. There is no better example than its tax policies. I mentioned earlier the oldest living consumption tax in the world--the Labor Party's wholesale sales tax. What has the effect of that been during Labor's years in office? Low income earners pay, in relative terms, 1 1/2 times as much of their income in wholesale sales tax as the rich do on all goods. For example, the 10 per cent of people on the lowest incomes, the lowest decile, pay 5.3 per cent of their income in wholesale sales tax while those in the highest decile pay 3.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us have a look at how those opposite have gone over the years since 1984-85. Those opposite go on and on about the terrible consumption taxes. Let us see what those opposite have done. Not only did their party introduce Australia's consumption tax and not only is it regressive, as I have just explained, but it has become more regressive since they have been in office. They have no shame. They go around saying that the Liberals and the Nationals are going to introduce this terrible consumption tax, but all the time bearing one awful secret--that in 1984-85 the lowest decile paid 4 per cent of their income in wholesale sales tax and the highest decile paid 2.8 per cent. That is regressive. But remember that the lowest decile now pays 5.3 per cent. That is even more regressive. When we have a look at the Government's income tax system, the regression is still there. </PARA>
<PARA>  Remember those men in the boat off the Western Australian coast? Laurie Connell, Alan Bond, Bob Hawke--was that them? Was there anyone else in that boat? There was somebody rowing it, I suppose. The person rowing it was probably on average weekly earnings. I do not doubt he was squirming at the thought that those people, who were at least then on very high earnings, were people who had received--if we take taxation in terms of average taxation--substantial tax cuts during the life of the Hawke Government. Their average tax was 42.5 per cent when the Hawke Government came to power; it is 39.2 per cent now. So they have got tax cuts. But the bloke rowing the boat, the bloke on average weekly earnings, was paying 17.9 per cent average tax when the Fraser Government went out of office. He is now paying 20.4 per cent. Funny, isn't it? For the bloke on average weekly earnings tax has gone up, and the rich guy's tax has come down. The bloke on average weekly earnings has been slugged even further by the Government's consumption tax while the rich guys have got away scot-free. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is funny that the party that boasts that it cares about low income people is the party that has put nearly a million people out of work and which has a regressive taxation system which is contributing to lower living standards. The pain of the recession being felt by low income earners is so much greater than it is for higher income Australians. So the Government's old-fashioned industrial relations system, its great-grandfather of all consumption taxes, its much beloved wholesale sales tax, makes this country a laughing stock around the world. </PARA>
<PARA>  Everybody else is modernising. Even the Congo and Mali are introducing goods and services taxes. Even Indonesia is. I suppose those opposite think Indonesia is imposing a wicked impost. Even Thailand is introducing one, as are all the countries of the European Community. There is Fiji, and the list goes on and on. They are introducing goods and services taxes, but those opposite will not modernise. We are sticking with the old 80- or 90-year-old industrial relations system and the great-grandfather of all consumption taxes, the one introduced during the last depression that the Labor Party plunged this country into. What a great record the Labor Party has. Whenever it has been in power it has stuffed up the economy of this country--every single time. There was the Watson Government, the Scullin Government, which was thrown out when it destroyed the economy, and the Whitlam Government--and the Hawke Government is the worst of them all.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) confirms for us yet again that the Liberal and National parties put theatrics, noise and mock indignation ahead of policy, substance and fabric on every single occasion. That is exactly what the honourable member for Mayo did in his speech on this matter of public importance today. It was the same with the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith). When it comes to the actual task of selling the consumption tax, the first thing the Liberal and National parties will have to do is to get a couple of different advocates. Based on what we have heard today, clearly the backbench of the Liberal and National parties would have every reason to be anxious about the selling of the consumption tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  If we look at the economy and look at what the needs of Australia are today and compare that with what the two Opposition speakers in this MPI have said, it shows that they have no sense of purpose and no sense of direction. They seek to gloat about the needs of the unemployed and those in need in Australia but offer no solutions or alternative policies. Indeed, they have no understanding of the needs of ordinary Australians. It is very clear, if we analyse their policies--or as much as we know about what their policies stand for--that, as the Acting Treasurer said in his contribution, they would make conditions worse for the vast majority of Australians than the difficulties they have had to endure in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA>  All of that proves that the legacy that we got in 1983 of Fraser, Howard and Hewson and the legacy of double digit inflation and double digit unemployment would be the same strategy that the Opposition would pursue, although it would pursue it with greater gusto this time around than it did in 1982-83. The people of Australia realise that the alternative strategies that are being talked about by the Liberals offer no solutions, no leadership and no direction. </PARA>
<PARA>  In contrast, the position adopted in this year's Budget, and the strategy of the Government over recent times, has been to ensure that we expose the Australian economy to the winds of international competition and change that is so vital and so long overdue. Much of the problem we have today, as the Acting Treasurer said, is because of all those years when there was no thought given to how we could make Australia internationally competitive. There was no thought given to how we would develop industries that involve more than the extraction of raw materials or the selling of commodities. </PARA>
<PARA>  We know from experience that change can occur because of either climatic conditions here or international prices in those particular areas. What we need to do--this Government has been doing this--is create the structure so that we can create long term sustainable jobs and long term industries that benefit all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>  When we discuss an MPI such as this it is realistic to talk about what has been achieved in areas such as micro-economic reform. Those on the other side would say that they are the only ones who have any answers as far as micro-economic reform is concerned. As the Acting Treasurer said in this debate, we have only to look at the area of aviation to see what has been achieved by this Government. It has introduced reform in the key area of domestic aviation. We saw deregulation after so many years of members of the Opposition sitting on their hands when they controlled the Treasury bench. </PARA>
<PARA>  Deregulation has produced real results, real achievement and real benefits for the people of Australia. Those benefits will be ongoing because they flow across a lot of industries. The tourism industry is one of the key beneficiaries of that. It is an industry created by this Government. It is a major export earner, a major generator of foreign exchange, and offers even greater potential for Australia. This year it is projected that something like 2.4 million tourists will come to Australia, with the potential for that to grow to five million over the next five years. It is a great opportunity for Australians, for small business and for industries across the nation. That has been achieved through a lot of different initiatives. One of the areas has been the deregulation of aviation. Another key area is where we have taken the steps to promote Australia overseas through investment in tourism promotion around the world. </PARA>
<PARA>  What is the Opposition's response when it is asked whether it would maintain that sort of funding commitment to promote Australia? The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has said several times that he does not see that as an area where governments should necessarily be spending taxpayers' money, anyway. The support, the interest and the export income that it brings to Australia is completely forgotten in the mad ideology that the Liberals pursue. It is an industry that has developed and has achieved real sustained improvement for Australia over the life of this Government. It highlights what can be done in terms of industry policy. </PARA>
<PARA>  Telecommunications is another key area where there is so much opportunity for Australia because of changes introduced by this Government to create advances in telecommunications technology that we can then export to the Asian region, in particular. The most savage indictment of the Liberal and National parties is that, during all those years when we should have been harnessing our strategic advantage into Asia, they did not bother about Asia. All they were concerned about was dealing with the colonial relics. They were never interested in opening up the telecommunications opportunities that we have had to develop in Asia. </PARA>
<PARA>  As a result of the changes that this Government has introduced in telecommunications--the competitive environment we are creating for telecommunications in this country and the industry opportunities that offers to us, both to develop industry here in technology and, more importantly I would suggest, to export that technology to the growing demand areas of Asia--we will ensure that that whole area of industry development is generated in a way that would have been unheard of under the Liberal and National parties because clearly they do not see those sorts of objectives as ones that should be pursued by a national government. </PARA>
<PARA>  Then we come to the question of tariffs. Some of the Liberals that we hear talking about these issues around Australia are not nearly as convinced about this New Right ideology. The Leader of the Opposition in Victoria seems to have a bit of difficulty coming to grips with the line of the shadow Treasurer--to the extent that we can develop a line from what the shadow Treasurer says--</PARA>

To the extent that we can, it is clear that many people in the manufacturing States, such as Victoria, have real difficulty appreciating the need to develop a strategy that makes us competitive but at the same time recognises the human aspect of that restructuring process. The people who sit on the Opposition benches in this place seem to be incapable of understanding the human face of what they talk about when they refer to restructuring Australia. That is something that we should be concerned about. It is all very well to say that we are concerned about the level of unemployment. I dare say that everybody would share our concern and real commitment to ensuring that the level of unemployment is reduced as part of sustained economic recovery as quickly as is humanly possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  At the same time, it is important to ensure that we have policies that have a human and compassionate face, and that if people are out of work or lacking in means we have the social infrastructure to cope with that. This Government has that social policy in place. The Liberal alternative is to suggest that those sorts of things do not matter. It wants to take the dole off those who have been out of work for nine months. Some in the Liberal Party say that that is all right because they will introduce a discretionary payment that does not give any protection and does not give any underlying income security or family security to people at all. </PARA>

What will mark the recovery from this recession as being  different from what occurred in 1982-83 is the fact that so much of the skills base was lost in the 1982-83 recession. </PARA>
<PARA>  No-one wishes to have economic hardship imposed on anybody in this country. One of the important things is to ensure that as we move out of that period of economic difficulty, Australians have opportunities to attain employment and have the skills to actively move into that employment. This Government has ensured that that skills base is retained. It has ensured that there is also a process that ensures sustainable long term recovery, both in terms of lower inflationary expectations and because we have been committed to ensure that the level of interest rates can be sustainably lowered over time. </PARA>
<PARA>  All of those measures will ensure that this country is more competitive, more international looking, more internationally resilient and has the broad range of industry and infrastructure that ensures that Australia as a whole comes out of the economic problems we have which, in my view, are not as difficult as they were in 1982-83 simply because there has been an underlying policy fabric and strategy on the part of the Government to ensure that we deal with those problems and that we understand the needs of Australians. We are committed to ensuring that the policies we develop as a government are designed to ensure the well-being of Australians through the 1990s and beyond with a great, forward-looking Australian economy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Higher Education Funding Act 1988, which provides for Commonwealth grants of financial assistance to the States, the Northern Territory and higher education institutions for higher education purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill provides funds for higher education amounting to some $3.6 billion in 1994, that is, the third year of the new funding triennium, 1992-94. This amount takes into account the Government's decisions to provide, in 1994, some $44m for 2,845 additional student intakes, some $277m for capital works and additional funds amounting to just under $75m for a new funding program to maintain and enhance the quality of higher education. These decisions were announced subsequent to those on higher education which formed part of the Government's 1991-92 Budget. Before addressing the Budget decisions I would like to elaborate on the Government's initiatives concerning quality assurance in higher education. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government's new funding program to maintain and enhance the quality of higher education is one of a number of initiatives to promote quality and diversity in the development of higher education through the 1990s. The focus of the Government's new policies is a comprehensive set of measures to maintain and enhance the quality of higher education teaching and provision. The extra funds will be used to reward institutions for making the best use of all their available resources. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Higher Education Council has been asked to explore the characteristics of quality in higher education. After the Council reports on this reference, and following wider consultation with the higher education sector, a national structure, independent of government, will be established to report on the application and effectiveness of quality enhancement measures developed by institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>  A National Centre for Teaching Excellence in higher education is to be set up next year to examine and disseminate information about good teaching practices. Funding will also be made available for a pilot credit transfer project, under the aegis of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, which the Government hopes will lead to the establishment of a national credit transfer agency. In addition, a comprehensive review of modes of delivery in higher education will be conducted to look at how technology can best be harnessed to improve access to, and the quality and efficiency of, higher education. With these measures, the Government is taking the lead internationally in providing a funding incentive to institutions, over and above funding for student load, to promote the highest possible level of quality in higher education. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would like to stress that institutional participation in the new quality assurance arrangements will be voluntary and the allocation of normal operating grants will be unaffected. It is certainly not the Government's intention to use the new arrangements to redistribute operating grants to institutions on the basis of comparative quantitative performance indicators. These quality assurance initiatives will be developed hand in hand with all of the main interest groups within the higher education system. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is worth emphasising also that the Government's approach to quality assurance balances institutional autonomy with public accountability. It is based primarily on self-assessment by institutions rather than relying on external assessments of quality. It relates the monitoring of quality to the goals of individual institutions. It involves assessments which include both qualitative and quantitative indicators. It allows for comparisons to be made against the different circumstances of institutions, including the composition of their student population, and their performance over time. It should therefore encourage diversity and innovation while confirming public confidence in the higher education system and reinforcing its international reputation. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill also includes provisions to widen the definition of higher education capital projects to encompass other than simply building projects. This will enable the Government to support major investments in course material and equipment which are genuine capital substitutes. The wider definition recognises the potential for new technologies and alternative delivery modes to improve delivery of, and access to, higher education. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill provides for the Government's Budget decisions aimed at addressing enrolment and overcrowding pressures being felt in higher education institutions. To this end, just under $10m has been allocated for additional student intakes next year with additional funds to take account of the pipeline effect of these intakes. As well, an additional $54m is being provided for capital projects next year to alleviate pressures of overcrowding, of which some $24m is funding originally earmarked for 1994. About half of these funds will be used to assist institutions to refurbish and renovate existing space. These funds will be provided on a matching basis with institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>  A pilot scheme will begin next year which will see the Government and employers sharing the costs of providing a number of additional student intakes, with the Commonwealth's share at 60 per cent. The Government has allocated just under $3.5m for up to 600 new student intakes in 1992 and some $4m for 700 intakes in both 1993 and 1994, with additional funds for the pipeline effect of these intakes. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill provides funds for a Commonwealth program to establish three advanced engineering centres in partnership with host institutions and industry. The focus of the centres will be on advanced undergraduate and postgraduate education and training. However, the centres will also provide courses for industry and technical and further education teachers. They will also provide professional retraining for experienced engineers and applied research and design services for industry. The Commonwealth is providing just under $10m over the triennium for the establishment and ongoing costs associated with this initiative. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill provides extra financial assistance amounting to some $31m over the triennium for additional Australian Research Council grants and provides over $10m in additional funds for support programs for Aboriginal students. Increased funding amounting to some $350m over the period 1991-93 is also provided in accordance with the Government's arrangements for cost supplementation of institutions' operating grants. A major component of this is funding to fully supplement pay rises awarded to academics by the Industrial Relations Commission in its decision of 23 July 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>  To enable Victoria's share of the responsibility for funding the higher education program at the Victorian College of Agriculture and Horticulture to be transferred to the Commonwealth, the Bill includes a financial adjustment to the maximum grants for higher education institutions. This will mean that the college's program is funded fully through the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 as from 1 January of next year. </PARA>
<PARA>  A complementary amendment to the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill 1991 has been introduced by the Minister for Science and Technology and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Free) which will have the effect of reducing the financial assistance grants in the case of the State of Victoria. Taken together, these amendments will have no net effect on total Commonwealth outlays and are being introduced at the request of the Victorian State Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  As announced in the Budget, the Bill also provides for an increase in the annual course contribution under the higher education contribution scheme. From next year, the annual course contribution for a full time student undertaking a standard program of study will increase to $2,250--an increase of $144 above the normal indexation increase--to help fund further expansion of the higher education system. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government has committed itself to spending some $12.9 billion on higher education over the 1992-94 triennium. Continued growth in the system will provide expanding opportunities for Australians to participate in higher education and, with the Government's new measures to further enhance the quality of higher education teaching and provision, Australian students can expect to receive a higher education the standard of which continues to be the equal of any in the world. </PARA>

<PARA>  That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is an omnibus Bill amending seven Acts administered, either wholly or partly, within the transport and communications portfolio. While none of the proposed amendments are highly significant, they are important for the functions of the transport and communications portfolio. Details of the major amendments follow. </PARA>
<PARA>Australian National Railways Commission Act 1983</PARA>
<PARA>  Part 2 of this Bill amends the Australian National Railways Commission Act to ensure that the Commission has the power to enter into a number of financial management risk or hedging transactions. Many government business enterprises routinely make use of such transactions, as do many private business organisations, to minimise their exposure to adverse interest rate variations. </PARA>
<PARA>  The need for such an amendment was highlighted by a recent decision of the United Kingdom Court of Appeal, which raised doubts about the power of similar government enterprises in the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA>Civil Aviation Act 1988</PARA>
<PARA>  Part 3 of the Bill makes a number of amendments to the Civil Aviation Act. In the first place, the Act is amended in the same way as the Australian National Railways Commission Act mentioned above. Secondly, the Bill gives effect to certain recommendations contained in the second report of the Air Safety Regulation Review Task Force. The Task Force highlighted a number of serious offences currently within the regulations and recommended that they be elevated to the Act in order to highlight their significance to air safety. In particular, the task force noted that flying an aircraft without registration or a certificate of airworthiness attracted a maximum penalty of $5,000. Such a breach constitutes a fundamental risk to air safety and the Task Force recommended its inclusion in the Act with a much more substantial penalty. The Task Force recommended that other more serious offences should be identified in the Act and maximum penalties be prescribed for each offence. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Task Force also expressed concern about the courts' powers in relation to a breach of the Act or the regulations. At present, courts may only impose a fine or a term of imprisonment. Often this is not a sufficient deterrent. The Task Force recommended that the court be empowered to suspend or cancel any licence, authority or certificate issued to the person under the regulations as a punitive alternative to the usual sanctions in serious cases. The Bill introduces a procedure whereby persons convicted of offences against the Act or the regulations may be excluded from any previously authorised activity. </PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, the Bill makes a number of minor amendments which clarify the Authority's liability to pay income tax and its powers in relation to statutory liens, and remove any legal doubt about the Authority's power to delegate certain air safety functions under the regulations to industry bodies. </PARA>
<PARA>Federal Airports Corporation Act 1986</PARA>
<PARA>  The principal purpose of this amendment is to enable the Commonwealth to transfer undeveloped sites which have been acquired for airport development to the Federal Airports Corporation and to empower the corporation to construct airports at those sites. This is achieved by introducing into the Act the concept of a `Federal airport development site' which may be declared prior to its establishment as a Federal airport. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is a technical amendment which in no way derogates from the Commonwealth's primary responsibility for the national planning of airports, including the investigation of and the need for additional Federal airports and their location. The Bill also clarifies an earlier amendment that the Authority is liable to pay income tax. </PARA>
<PARA>Navigation Act 1912</PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill proposes a number of amendments to this Act. The most significant amendment places fishing fleet support vessels outside the ambit of the Act when not on an overseas voyage. Fishing fleet support vessels are presently trading vessels for the purposes of the Navigation Act, although the fishing vessels they serve are not. The Bill will correct this anomaly. </PARA>
<PARA>  An agreement was recently reached that in certain parts of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park area, certain types of ships must carry a pilot. The Bill makes provision for the issue of appropriate pilot qualifications for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, there are a number of other amendments of the Navigation Act of a general `housekeeping' nature. In particular, the limits of the Australian jurisdiction in marine casualty inquiries are clarified; certain offence provisions are brought up to date; and some drafting errors are corrected. </PARA>
<PARA>Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Act 1946</PARA>
<PARA>  The purpose of the amendments to this Act is to extend the privileges and protections afforded to radio broadcasts of parliamentary proceedings, firstly, to television broadcasts of proceedings and, secondly, to radio and television broadcasting of proceedings of parliamentary committees. </PARA>
<PARA>  The amendments give effect to recommendations contained in the recent report of the select committee of the House of Representatives on televising titled The Eyes Have It. The select committee recommended that the Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Act 1946 be amended to provide for televising the proceedings of the Senate, the House of Representatives and their committees. </PARA>
<PARA>  The amendments will also have the effect of exempting television broadcasters of proceedings of the House of  Representatives and the Senate, and radio and television broadcasters of the proceedings of parliamentary committees, from the operation of section 117 of the Broadcasting Act 1942, which requires broadcasters to announce particulars of who authorised the broadcasting of political matter. This extends the existing exemption which applies to radio broadcasts of proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA>Trade Practices Act 1974</PARA>
<PARA>  Part X of the Trade Practices Act 1974 provides shipping conferences with some limited exemptions from the competition provisions of part IV of the Act. Among the various obligations imposed on conferences in exchange for these exemptions is the requirement to publicly register their anti-competitive agreements. Fees are charged to recover the administrative costs associated with processing such registration applications. </PARA>
<PARA>  It has recently come to the Government's attention that the agreement registration provisions of part X extend to the freight rates charged by the conferences. This means that every time conference members change even one of their many hundreds of freight rates, they would have to register a varying conference agreement. The imposition of such an administrative and financial burden serves no useful purpose, as conference freight rate schedules are already publicly available. This Bill will remove the need for conference members to register their freight rates and their subsequent variation. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I have already mentioned, fees are charged for administrative services provided under part X. These fees are set by regulation. The fees currently charged are at or near the maximum levels stipulated in section 10.90 of the Act. This Bill will increase those maximum levels to enable appropriate regulations to be made to fully recover the costs incurred in providing the part X services. </PARA>
<PARA>  In addition, the new maximum fee levels provide scope for future cost increases to be recovered, which will make it unnecessary to amend section 10.90 again for some years to come. The Bill also provides for a fee to be charged for the registration of a change to the particulars of an ocean carrier agent. </PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, the Bill repeals sections 150 to 153 of the Act, which relate to transitional provisions following the replacement of earlier legislation by the previous part X of the Trade Practices Act 1974. With the repeal of the previous part X in 1990, sections 150-153 became redundant. I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill and commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill amends the Civil Aviation (Carriers' Liability) Act 1959. The main purpose of the amendments are: to enable ratification of Additional Protocol No. 3--Montreal Protocol No. 3--and Montreal Protocol No 4; to ensure that the Montreal Protocol No. 3 passenger limit applies immediately to Australian international air carriers engaged in carriage to which the Warsaw Convention and Hague Protocol apply; and, to convert the Poincare gold franc limits of the Warsaw Convention and the Hague Protocol to Australian dollars through the medium of the International Monetary Fund's Special Drawing Right, SDR. </PARA>
<PARA>  The major reasons for amending the Act are twofold. Firstly, it is considered that the carriers' liability limits currently applying to the international carriage of passengers by air are insufficient. These are currently around $14,000 to $28,000 depending on whether carriage is covered by the Warsaw Convention or the Hague Protocol. The proposal to ratify Montreal Protocol No. 3 and immediately apply its 100,000 SDR passenger limit to Australia's international airlines will go some way to redress this situation. One hundred thousand SDRs, when converted to Australian dollars, is consistent with the domestic carriers' liability limit of $180,000. Australia has international obligations under the Warsaw Convention and is only able to increase passenger liability limits, without dissociating itself from the international aviation community, that is, by denouncing the Warsaw Convention, by ratifying Montreal Protocol No. 3. </PARA>
<PARA>  Secondly, since the abandonment of the internationally set price of gold in 1973 and the introduction of a fluctuating market price, there has been no agreed means of determining the Australian dollar equivalent of the Poincare gold franc and the courts have often called on the Government to resolve the problem. The conversion of the gold franc limits to SDR equivalents resolves this problem. </PARA>
<PARA>  Given that the amount of passenger compensation encompassed by the 100,000 SDR limit may be considered insufficient, the Government is examining other options to provide equitable compensation to international airline passengers which will not affect the carriers' liability limits fixed by international instrument. This includes examination of the feasibility of a supplemental compensation scheme, perhaps similar to one under consideration in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA>  Montreal Protocol No. 4 is specifically cargo oriented  and introduces more modern cargo handling terminology and procedures, including the use of electronic data interchange, EDI. While the passenger limit of Montreal Protocol No. 3 will be applicable immediately to Australian international carriers, the Protocols will only become generally applicable to airlines engaged in carriage to which they apply when they enter into force internationally. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is my understanding that should the United States Senate accept the supplemental compensation scheme--called the S-Plan--referred to earlier, then it will support United States ratification of Montreal Protocols No. 3 and No. 4 by the President. It is also my understanding that this ratification may be accompanied by a denunciation of the Warsaw Convention. Unless Australia also ratifies the Montreal Protocols, this action could expose Australian carriers, particularly Qantas, to unlimited liability in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA>  Since it is our firm belief that US ratification of the two Protocols will lead to their early entry into force, they will in the not too distant future apply to carriage between Australia and the majority of countries. I understand that the US Senate may be voting on the Protocols in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA>  I turn now to a brief description of the Bill. Since the Warsaw Convention and Hague Protocol will no doubt continue to apply to certain international carriage even after entry into force of the two Protocols, the Bill fixes their Poincare gold franc liability limits in SDRs. The Reserve Bank provides a SDR/Australian dollar conversion rate on a daily basis so enabling the courts to easily convert the limits at the time of judgment. The gold franc limits will have the following SDR equivalents:</PARA>
<PARA>Warsaw Convention</PARA>
<PARA>Passenger death/injury:</PARA>
<PARA>    125,000 francs = 8300 SDR</PARA>
<PARA>Registered baggage/cargo:</PARA>
<PARA>    250 francs/kg = 17 SDR/kg</PARA>
<PARA>Personal cabin baggage:</PARA>
<PARA>    5000 francs = 330 SDR</PARA>
<PARA>Hague Protocol</PARA>
<PARA>Passenger death/injury:</PARA>
<PARA>    250,000 francs = 16,600 SDR</PARA>
<PARA>  The registered baggage and cargo and personal cabin baggage limits were not changed by the Hague Protocol. The limits as fixed by the Bill in SDRs are consistent with the move to ratify Montreal Protocols No. 3 and No. 4 with their SDR limits. The SDR equivalents of the Warsaw Convention and the Hague Protocol liability limits will apply to actions involving international carriers which occur on or after the date the Bill receives royal assent. Actions pre-dating this will still be covered by the current Warsaw Convention and Hague Protocol gold franc limits, irrespective of the date of judgment. </PARA>
<PARA>  Next, the Bill specifies that for Australian carriers engaged in carriage to which the Warsaw Convention and the Hague Protocol apply, the Montreal Protocol No. 3 passenger liability limit of 100,000 SDR will apply. This is consistent with Article 22 of the Warsaw Convention which permits the voluntary increase of liability limits. </PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, the Bill inserts two new parts IIIB and IIIC into the Act covering carriage to which Montreal Protocol No. 3 and Montreal Protocol No. 4 respectively apply. These parts will become law on dates no earlier than the entry into force of the Protocols. For ease of reading, consolidations of the convention as amended by successive protocols have been prepared and included as schedules.

<PARA>  That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister and Cabinet Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 contains amendments to a number of Acts administered within the portfolio of the Prime Minister and to Acts containing provisions which relate to Public Service matters. </PARA>
<PARA>Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981</PARA>
<PARA>  An amendment to the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981 will make it possible, where the Ombudsman or the Internal Investigation Division of the Australian Federal Police are investigating a complaint, for the Ombudsman to refer a question to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for an advisory opinion. The Ombudsman is already able to recommend to the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police that such a question be referred. </PARA>
<PARA>Governor-General Act 1974</PARA>
<PARA>  This Bill also amends the Governor-General Act 1974 to remove a limitation on the entitlement of the surviving spouse of a retired Governor-General to an allowance. The surviving spouse currently loses the entitlement to an allowance on remarriage. The Attorney-General's Department has advised that a similar limitation in the Judges' Pensions Act 1968 is inconsistent with the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 as it discriminates on the basis of marital status. </PARA>
<PARA>Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986</PARA>
<PARA>  Three amendments are proposed to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986. Two of these are administrative in nature, and are intended to bring the Office of the Inspector-General into line with other statutory bodies. Provision is now made for the appointment of an acting Inspector-General in the event of the absence of the Inspector-General or of a temporary vacancy in that office. A second amendment ensures that should a person appointed to act as Inspector-General also hold a judicial office that person may continue to enjoy the rights and privileges of that judicial office while acting as Inspector-General. </PARA>
<PARA>  The final amendment provides the Inspector-General with right of access to the annual or periodic reports of the intelligence and security agencies, and to ministerial directions or guidelines given to the Australian Secret Intelligence Service and the Defence Signals Directorate of the Department of Defence. Although the agencies have voluntarily provided the Inspector-General with copies of such documents in the past, it is considered expedient to formalise access in legislation. This will further enhance the Inspector-General's ability to monitor the activities of the intelligence agencies, to ensure that they act within the law, with propriety and with regard for human rights. The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 already provides the Inspector-General with the right of access to directions or guidelines given to ASIO by the Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA>Maternity Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1973</PARA>
<PARA>  This amendment to the Maternity Leave (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1973 is intended to implement an interim decision of the Public Service Board in 1987 that a woman on maternity leave without pay should not become an unattached officer without her consent. </PARA>
<PARA>Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act 1984</PARA>
<PARA>  Three substantive amendments are proposed to the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act 1984. The first of these is designed to give the agency flexibility in the manner in which it conducts meetings. It is often inconvenient, or unnecessary, for agency members to meet in person to conduct the agency's business. The amendment will enable meetings of the agency to be conducted by electronic means--for example by conference telephone. </PARA>
<PARA>  The other amendments are proposed in consequence of findings of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances in April 1988. The amendments will enable a pecuniary penalty to be imposed for breach of an order of a Disciplinary Appeal Committee or of a Retirement and Redeployment Appeal Committee prohibiting or restricting the publication of evidence. The merit protection regulations enable the Committees to make such orders. </PARA>
<PARA>Ombudsman Act 1976</PARA>
<PARA>  A number of minor amendments are made to the Ombudsman Act 1976 by the Bill for the purpose of clarifying the Ombudsman's powers. One of these amendments will mirror the amendment made to the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act previously referred to, empowering the Ombudsman to refer questions to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for an advisory opinion. </PARA>
<PARA>  Other amendments to the Ombudsman Act will clarify the powers of the Ombudsman by specifying that a claim of legal professional privilege cannot be used to deny the Ombudsman access to information, and ensuring that the Ombudsman's role is not exhausted by the presentation of a report to Parliament about an investigation, by providing that the Ombudsman may discuss any matter to which the report relates with the principal officer of the department or authority concerned in order to resolve the matter. </PARA>
<PARA>Public Service Act 1922</PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill makes a number of substantive amendments to the Public Service Act 1922. The amendments are being made ahead of action being taken to bring forward in due course a Bill for a modernised Act aimed at simplifying and integrating procedures and practices. The major amendments reflect the Government's agreement under the structural efficiency principle to restructure the senior executive service (SES) into three bands and introduce the SES (specialist) category. Other amendments relate to the role of the Public Service Commissioner in the termination of SES officers on probation and the extension of fixed term appointments. </PARA>
<PARA>  A new three band structure for the SES came into effect on 4 January 1990. One of the aims of the structure was to enhance the optimum use of resources by providing secretaries and heads of agencies with flexibility in the allocation of SES resources and budget to meet changing priorities and issues at a particular time. The amendments proposed will enable secretaries and heads of agencies to transfer SES staff across positions within the same band irrespective of the salary points involved. Under current provisions, it is necessary for such filling action to be subject to a full selection process, as the movement to a higher salary point in such circumstances is currently regarded as a promotion. </PARA>
<PARA>  During 1990 a separate SES (specialist) category was established within the senior executive service. Movement to the broad SES group from SES (specialist) positions by promotion or transfer is on the basis of merit competition. The amendments proposed reflect the establishment of the new category and the role of the Public Service Commissioner in filling related positions. </PARA>
<PARA>  An amendment is also included to enable the Public Service Commissioner rather than a secretary to terminate probation of SES officers. This is consistent with the Commissioner's existing powers in relation to appointment, promotion and retirement for SES officers. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another proposed amendment will enable the Commissioner, on the recommendation of a secretary or head of agency, to extend the term of a fixed term SES appointee to a maximum period of 5 years. Currently, it is not possible to extend an initial engagement where the period concerned is of lesser duration. In addition to the amendments relating to the SES, the Bill makes a number of other technical and procedural amendments to the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Public Service Reform Act 1984</PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill also repeals a provision of the Public Service Reform Act 1984 which is unproclaimed and is no longer required. This repeal is in accordance with the view expressed by the Senate Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills that unproclaimed provisions should be repealed. </PARA>
<PARA>Statutory Authority Legislation</PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill also provides for the removal of the requirement for a number of government agencies and authorities to obtain approval from the Public Service Commissioner for terms and conditions of employment for staff--or, in some instances, certain categories of staff only. Under the Administrative Arrangements Act 1987, the Public Service Board's statutory approval role became a role of the Public Service Commissioner. In accordance with the proposed administrative arrangements following abolition of the Board, officers of the Department of Industrial Relations are currently performing the function under delegation from the Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA>  This amendment is consistent with initiatives throughout Australian Government employment to devolve to agency management greater autonomy, and to make managers more accountable for their actions. Nonetheless, all statutory authorities will still remain covered by the Government's general industrial relations coordination arrangements, which ensure the consistent application of the Government's wages and industrial relations policies. </PARA>
<PARA>Resource Assessment Commission Act 1989</PARA>
<PARA>  The Resource Assessment Commission Act 1989 is to be amended to remove the Administration of Norfolk Island from the definition of `Commonwealth authority'. The Norfolk Island Government is deemed to be a `Commonwealth authority' by reason of its status as an incorporated body. As a result, a decision by the Norfolk Island Government on a resource matter can be referred to the Resource Assessment Commission. However, it was not intended that the Resource Assessment Commission be able to inquire into decisions of the Norfolk Island Government. I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill, and commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  That the amendments be agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA>The Senate has agreed to three amendments to this Bill which the Government feels are unnecessary. The first provides that the ABT may seek Federal Court orders if a person fails to comply with a notice under section 89X of the Broadcasting Act 1942 to provide information. Section 92P, which is proposed to be amended, already gives that power to the ABT since failure to comply with the notice would be a contravention of section 89X and therefore within the scope of section 92P(1)(a). Unnecessary amendments of this nature simply increase the complexity of an already labyrinthine Act and confuse its interpretation. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, I accept the statements by Senator Powell in the other place that the amendment is intended to be in addition to existing powers. On the basis that the amendment is not intended in any way to diminish the operation of section 92P, the Government is willing to accept it. Were it to be interpreted in any other way, it would in fact limit the scope of the ABT in approaching the Federal Court on matters related to its investigatory requirements in this area. So we are prepared to accept that the mover of the amendment had no intention of doing that and to agree with that interpretation for the purposes of the passage of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>  The second and third amendments increase the minimum period for prior notification of acquisition of prescribed interests from 10 to 28 days. The Government is mindful of the fact that the vast majority of acquisitions notified to the Tribunal will be perfectly legitimate and we have no wish to hamper those acquisitions beyond the extent necessary to examine their bona fides. We feel that 10 days would give the Tribunal adequate time to determine whether a contravention is likely to arise from an acquisition. </PARA>
<PARA>  We must not forget that we are dealing with the right of individuals to dispose of their own property, and that the public interest in an issue must justify an intrusion on those rights. I have to say that we have a rather spectacular case on these matters before the Tribunal at the moment, and this has perhaps inspired people to move these sorts of amendments. But I must say that, under the changes that we have made, many propositions will be obliged to be reported to the ABT, virtually none of which will have quite the same degree of spectacular attention as this one has. We are a little concerned that we may be unnecessarily jeopardising people's business arrangements. We thought that 10 days struck an appropriate balance, and the ABT agreed that it could perform its functions in that time. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, this sitting concludes tonight and these matters are of immediate interest to the ABT. Given the urgency, we are not prepared to oppose the amendments. When we come to the Broadcasting and Services Bill later on in the year, we may choose to revisit this issue, but now is not the time and these are not the circumstances for us to do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-When this Bill came through the chamber some weeks ago, I indicated that the Opposition's view was that it should be allowed to pass. We took the view that there would be some value in having the complexities of this Bill subject to scrutiny by the Senate under normal procedures. There was some toing and froing about when that might be done, but it has been done expeditiously, as I outlined in my speech and also in my press release, in recognition of the fact that this Bill does have an impact on a substantial commercial matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  To pick up the points made by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), the timing period is always a matter of balance. But, of course, we do not have to go out to the 21 days if it can be done before then, and the ABT has indicated--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Beazley" NAMEID="PE4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr Beazley</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am sorry, I should have said 21 days, not 28.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GJ4">Mr SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Yes, 21 days. The Minister will be aware that in the Senate we joined with the Government on the 21 days, rather than agreeing to the 28 days, to try to find that balance between the necessity to meet commercial requirements and giving the ABT adequate time to gather the information that is necessary to underpin any application to the Federal Court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Minister made the point that this is a very complicated piece of legislation, and most certainly it is. I and the Opposition share with him the hope that the Broadcasting Services Bill, which he will bring in in due course, can be dealt with in a somewhat more sober climate than the current one with all the toing and froing that is going on. That will give an opportunity for a revisit to this whole area. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister also made a point about proposed subsection 92P. I have had detailed discussion with the Australian Democrats on these matters, and their intention is not in any way to hinder the operation of 92P. Of course, that is our understanding as well. I am sure that if, at some future time, people look back to the Hansard to try to get some guidance as to what is meant by this particular Bill, the comments that we make now will have a material impact, and I think it is important that I echo that view now. Certainly this particular proposed subsection is trying to provide that, where information is sought by the ABT and the people from whom it is sought do not provide it, there is a mechanism by which the ABT can pursue its requirement under its Act to determine actual control. That is its primary test: how does it get the information? This measure provides the opportunity to seek that information and to seek enforcement of its right to get that information from the Federal Court. I think that, without that provision, it could be put in the position where it knows that there is a problem but cannot get the information. </PARA>
<PARA>  So this measure is intended to put into the hands of the ABT a rather inexact power. It is not the most desirable of powers, but it is one which is very limited in scope and which is designed to make sure that the Tribunal can deal with the matters that it is charged to deal with in that broader function of determining actual control. In that sense, we thought it appropriate to allow this particular amendment to pass. </PARA>
<PARA>  I might also say that, during the Senate committee discussions last evening with the Department and also the Chairman of the ABT, other matters were canvassed, and we are happy with the answers that we received from the ABT. I might say also, as I did during the second reading debate, that this piece of legislation does have an impact on the current Fairfax matters. In our view, it is unfortunate that it has all come together at the one time. There are other reasons for that, I am sure, but it did mean from our point of view that it should be dealt with under normal circumstances wherever that was possible. We had the opportunity to have the Committee look at it. It did deal with it expeditiously. It was unavailable to deal with it on the Friday because apparently it had a hearing in Brisbane about Cape York. So all parties finally were able to agree on a time. </PARA>
<PARA>  We feel satisfied that the opportunity for the Senate to look at the matter in an independent way and to receive that additional advice has meant that these particular amendments will make this very difficult Act a slightly better one. But, in the broad, it is still a very imperfect piece of legislation which, I am sure, will give the Government more headaches. This is probably not the appropriate time to enter into more debate about the Fairfax matter. We have had a good go this week. In any event, this is certainly a matter of some moment. It will be interesting to see how the print media inquiry impacts on this matter and what questions arise as witnesses come before it and as the matter develops further. The Opposition will allow this measure to pass. Following negotiations with the Government and the Democrats, these two amendments are supported. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Opposition does not oppose the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill 1991. This is a traditional machinery Bill which implements the decisions agreed at the Premiers Conference and Loan Council meeting held on 31 May 1991. The Bill provides for general purposes assistance to the States and the Northern Territory in 1991-92 totalling $13,743m. The amount of funds paid by the Commonwealth to the States and the Northern Territory is based on a formula set out in the Bill. The formula is recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission and is based mainly on a weighting for population. Payments to the ACT are presently covered by the Appropriation Bill (No. 2), because the ACT, which has only recently moved to self-government--and some government that is!--has not yet generated the statistical base for funding on the Grants Commission formula.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Budget estimate for general purpose funding for the States and the Northern Territory under this Bill is, as I have said, $13,743m, about 13 per cent of estimated Commonwealth outlays in 1991-92. The amount may be adjusted if the consumer price index in March 1992 is different from the estimate made at the time of the Premiers Conference. Total net payments from the Commonwealth to and through the States in 1991-92 are expected to be $26,965m, including $12,129m of current specific purpose payments, as distinct from general purpose payments; that is, the payments under this Bill amount to about half of the total payments to the States and the Northern Territory. This Bill reflects the agreement at the Premiers Conference that the real level of general revenue assistance would be maintained for the three years from 1991-92 to 1993-94. The Bill makes provision for a special revenue assistance grant of $40m to the Northern Territory. This payment is funded by reducing the amount otherwise available to the States. </PARA>
<PARA>  This legislation raises the very important issue of the relationship between the Commonwealth Government and the State governments. That relationship has become a very important national issue since the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) decided that it would be put on the national agenda and called a series of Special Premiers Conferences to consider that relationship. </PARA>
<PARA>  There has been support on both sides of the House for an improvement in the relationship between the Commonwealth and the States because of a range of problems that have emerged in that relationship. I will go into those a bit later. Suffice it to say at this stage that there are problems of duplication between the two levels of government. There is a lack of responsibility in many cases by one department or agency, and there is a clear lack of policy coordination in many areas where that may be a concern. It is not true that the policies always need to be coordinated. Sometimes, as I will point out later, it is a good thing to have a degree of competition between the different States. </PARA>
<PARA>  Above all, we now have a system in Australia of increasing fiscal centralism. In 1990-91 the States received more than 50 per cent of their revenue from the Commonwealth Government, if one takes into account the tied grants. The Commonwealth Government raised 80 per cent of all government revenue raised in Australia and spent just 54 per cent of all outlays of all levels of government. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is clear from those figures that there is a substantial degree of imbalance in the way our federation works. It is true to say that the way our federation works today is a very distant cry from the intention of how it would work by the founding fathers of the Australian Constitution nearly 100 years ago. The problems now with our federation are such that accountability in particular has been taken away from a range of different policy areas which, whilst administered by the States, are in many cases funded by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>  I can think of areas in my own electorate, as all honourable members can, of Federal funding where the details of the allocation of those funds are determined by the States. When constituents complain about the way those funds are allocated, it is very hard to identify who is ultimately responsible for the way in which those policies operate. For example, the grants for local government funding come from the Commonwealth and are distributed by States grants commissions to the different local councils. When local councils are unhappy about the distribution of those grants, or when there is perceived to be an inequity in the distribution of those grants--as there has been in the Stirling Council in my electorate--it is never entirely clear who is ultimately responsible for that apparent or alleged maldistribution in the grants. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-As the honourable member for Sturt points out, it is a fiery issue--in more ways than one. That is the problem of accountability that we have in the way our federation works today. From the point of view of constituents of mine living in the Stirling Council area, it is a matter of inconvenience and irritation--perhaps more than that: it is a system that is not working terribly well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The other aspect of this is that State governments are inevitably less responsive to community concerns and demands than they might otherwise be, because they are not responsible for raising the money that they spend. It is easy for them to be inefficient, it is easy for them at times to be unresponsive, and it is often very easy for them to avoid responsibility altogether. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Commonwealth also imposes priorities from time to time, particularly through tied grants, which do not reflect regional priorities. There are different concerns in different regions. Different policies do not necessarily suit different regions equally well. All honourable members will have seen illustrations of that in their own electorates; for example, a particular Commonwealth policy which is implemented through the tied grants scheme--and, therefore, in practice on a day to day basis--carried out by the States. But it does not work as well in our own local areas as it might in some other local areas and, consequently, the national interest is not best served. </PARA>
<PARA>  I mentioned earlier the problems of duplication. This is a much debated issue in the context of Commonwealth-State relations. It is remarkable, despite the fact that it is continually debated, that so little has been done to eliminate the duplication between the different levels of government. </PARA>
<PARA>  The other aspect of the imperfection of our federation at the moment is the way our taxation system works. We all talk a lot about taxation in this House nowadays, and this is another aspect of our taxation system that needs to be given a great deal more thought. I suppose it is being given more thought through the process of the Special Premiers Conferences, although we are not seeing very much coming out of it yet. </PARA>
<PARA>  What we have, effectively, in Australia is a revenue cartel. The Commonwealth raises the bulk of the revenue--as I said earlier, about 80 per cent of all government revenue raised in Australia. That does take away the alternative, which is to provide competition in revenue raising between the States. Where competition exists, there obviously is pressure on the States to keep taxes low. Where there is a cartel or a monopoly--there is in the case of the Commonwealth and, when it comes to competition, it needs to think of other countries--the pressures of competition are not as great as they are between the States. There was a very good illustration of that when the Bjelke-Petersen Government initially abolished death duties. There was much outrage on the part of the Labor Party. It opposed the abolition of death duties in Queensland by the Bjelke-Petersen Government. I am sure honourable members would remember that. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The honourable member for Forde remembers that. The Wran Government, I recall, thought this was an awful and terrible thing. I do not know whether there were any other Labor governments in Australia then, but certainly the Labor Party generally thought this was terrible. But the pressure of competition eventually made Labor follow suit, regardless of the fact that it did not like it. So the Bjelke-Petersen Government--and this must really pain the Labor Party--led the way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Not everything the Bjelke-Petersen Government did was necessarily good--you, Mr Deputy Speaker, must be pleased to hear this little yarn--but the fact is that it led the way. The point I am making is that the competition did lead to what we on this side of the House would regard as an extraordinarily beneficial outcome: even the Wran Government was not able to keep in place one of the totems of Labor policy--death duties. Finally, at the Federal level, the Fraser Government abolished the Federal death duties, something it does not get enough credit for these days. That is one important aspect of the problem that exists by creating a monopoly of revenue raising through the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>  The States, therefore, are left with a very narrow range of taxes that they can impose. It is interesting to reflect on those taxes in the context of the current national tax debate, which to some extent is a debate about whether taxes are regressive or progressive. I think there is broad agreement in the Parliament that a taxation system should be a fair system and should be seen to be a fair system. We on this side of the House argue that our total tax reform package, as people will soon see, is fair; it contains significant benefits for lower and middle income people, not just great hand-outs for the super-rich. It is a general view, on the part of the Labor Party as well, that we should have that sort of tax system. </PARA>
<PARA>  When one looks at the way the Federation has affected State tax systems, one sees that those systems are, in fact, extraordinarily unfair and regressive tax systems. It is curious that there is not a debate in State parliaments about the regressive nature of their tax systems. Take my own State of South Australia: about one-third of all the tax revenue raised by the South Australian Government is raised through the payroll tax. Everyone here must agree that the payroll tax has to be one of the most regressive of all taxes, particularly at a time when nearly one million of our people are out of work. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is a tax which effectively discriminates against the unemployed, because it is a tax on employment which gives employers less capacity to employ than would otherwise be the case. It is also a tax that reduces the competitiveness of our economy, because it is passed on in higher prices for export products or higher prices for products which have to compete with imports. In any case, it is regressive in the sense that the group in the community it discriminates against the most harshly is the group that we all ought to be worrying about the most, that is, the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA>   The South Australian Government is very dependent on taxes such as stamp duties, motor vehicle registration taxes, and the like. Those types of taxes are, of course, regressive. The petrol tax and taxes on liquor are big revenue raisers for the South Australian Government. Again, they are very regressive. As a matter of fact, they are consumption taxes which are levied on individuals, as is the Government's wholesale sales tax, regardless of their prosperity, regardless of their income. </PARA>
<PARA>  As the Government knows, we on this side of the House believe in a goods and services tax and the Government believes in the wholesale sales tax. So the Parliament does actually agree that we should have consumption taxes of some sort. I think the Federal Parliament also basically agrees that the income tax system should provide the progressive elements of our taxation system. </PARA>
<PARA>  The interesting thing about State taxes is that there is, of course, no income tax system--and has not been since the 1940s--so there is no progressive element in the South Australian Government's taxation system. The richest irony of all is that Mr Bannon, the Premier of South Australia, loves to run around the State saying that he is opposed to a consumption tax, whereas the only taxes he himself administers are consumption taxes. The payroll tax is a possible exception; I suppose that one would not describe it as a consumption tax. All the other taxes he administers are effectively consumption taxes. </PARA>
<PARA>  To add irony to irony, John Bannon, unlike a lot of the Premiers, who have been much more circumspect in their public comments on this issue, says that he is opposed to any income taxing powers being passed back to the States. The one opportunity Mr Bannon has to make his taxation system in South Australia a progressive taxation system is spurned by him in hysterical public statements, such as his statements to the Sunday Mail newspaper on 7 September. The implication of what he said is, `Please do not give me, John Bannon, a progressive tax system. Give me the regressive system that I have at present. Please leave me with my payroll taxes, my stamp duties, my liquor, tobacco and petrol taxes and so on. Please leave me with consumption taxes of that kind with no offsetting benefits from a progressive income tax system. Leave me with those consumption taxes'. Then he hopes that the cameras will change to another scene, and when they flick back to him again he says, `And, by the way, I am opposed to the Liberal Party's consumption tax'. History will judge this argument and it will see that people like that are not fair dinkum. People like that are just not telling it as it is. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is a great shame, I think, that leaders of some of our governments in this country cannot face up to the problems of our tax system and talk about them in a constructive and mature way rather than descending into hysterical rhetoric. There we have it: a taxation system in South Australia which is extraordinarily regressive and which discriminates against low income and unemployed South Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will just add one other thing. I think it is important that organisations like SACOSS, the South Australian Council of Social Service, the churches and other welfare organisations in South Australia examine in much more detail the regressive nature of the State tax system and perhaps look with a great deal more sympathy and with more interest--I believe they have not really looked at it at all--at the possibility of introducing some more progressive elements into that State tax system. They really ought to be leading the debate there, but they tend to be extraordinarily conservative in continually batting for the status quo. </PARA>
<PARA>   What are the solutions to these problems? There are solutions which are supposed to be subject to discussion at the Special Premiers Conference. A range of propositions has been put forward. Working groups have been established where the Commonwealth and the States are looking at the sorts of issues that I have been talking about. But I am actually very doubtful that anything of any real meaning, of any real importance, will come out of this Special Premiers Conference process, which the Prime Minister describes as historic, visionary and so on. There are a couple of reasons why I think that: first of all, the Labor Party here in Canberra, the Federal Labor Party, the Caucus, is becoming very nervous about the Special Premiers Conference process. I read with a lot of interest the article on the front page of the Australian Financial Review yesterday which described a meeting of 25 mainly left wing members of the Caucus who had met the previous day, on Tuesday, to consider the Special Premiers Conference process. They expressed concern about two things: first of all, that they were not being kept informed as to the progress taking place and that the only information they had came from newspapers; and, secondly, they expressed very real concern at the loss of centralised control of a range of policy areas. The two identified were Aboriginal affairs and what the Labor Party loves to call social justice. I suppose that a wholesale sales tax is social justice! The Labor Party is absolutely terrified of losing control of this social justice agenda which, if one takes the words `social justice' literally, must include a gigantic range of policy areas. </PARA>
<PARA>  The implication of the views of the group of 25 is that they believe that the new federalism process that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is supposed to be undertaking is one that should not proceed any further. That point is actually as good as proven by the fact that one of the 25 people at the meeting was none other than the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating). They were not all from the Left of the Party, although some of them were rather obviously sucking up to the Left of the Party. I see that the honourable member for Blaxland said not a word at this meeting. He sat at the back of the room with his pencil, taking notes of all that was said. </PARA>
<PARA>  That is quite interesting, because the Australian Financial Review article went on to say that the whole issue of the new federalism--or the `new new federalism', since the Fraser Government had new federalism--is, `fertile ground for the Keating leadership push'. Why else would he have been there at the group of 25 meeting on Tuesday?</PARA>
<PARA>  So, it is clear that the issue of leadership in the Labor Party is now intervening in what I think was, in fact, a very responsible process of trying to get our federal system working more smoothly and more efficiently. The fact that the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland, is now taking the view that he must do everything he can to try to stop this new federalism process, presumably on the grounds that the Prime Minister is a supporter of it and the Left of the Labor Party does not like it, leads us to the obvious conclusion that the process will ultimately be scuttled on the grounds that the Prime Minister simply will not have the numbers or the courage to go ahead with it. </PARA>
<PARA>   The second area of concern comes from the Premiers themselves. Some Premiers, such as Mr Greiner, are very positive about this process and are making a very valuable contribution to it. Interestingly enough, some Premiers are not. No Premier is making a smaller contribution than the Premier of my own State, Mr Bannon. Again, I refer to the article in the Sunday Mail of 7 September. In that article he attacked the proposition that the States may get income tax powers offered back to them. That was strange, considering that he had agreed in October 1990 to the establishment of a working group of officials to look at that whole proposition. It was strange, bearing in mind that on 30 July at the Special Premiers Conference there was agreement that income tax powers being passed back to the States was at least a possibility. They did not make a decision, of course, to do it, but they agreed that it was something that mechanically could be done and should be subject to further examination. </PARA>
<PARA>  By all accounts, Mr Bannon, his advisers and staff are working very harmoniously in these working groups and, behind the scenes, are very comfortable with the idea of looking at the possibility of providing the States with a more progressive tax system than they currently have. But when it comes to public pronouncements, he is taking a completely different view--I guess out of political expediency, really. A man whose popularity is now plunging in his own home State has every good reason to look at some politically expedient stunts, and this may be just one of them. But he is claiming that, if income tax powers were passed back to the States at least in some form or another, this would lead to a flight from South Australia; that South Australia would somehow become a basket case as a result of it. That is a self-confession, if ever I have heard one. </PARA>
<PARA>  Mr Bannon admits that, without massive subsidies, a State under his administration is simply completely uncompetitive. But of course he also omits to tell the public of South Australia that the principle of fiscal equalisation is not a principle that anybody has at this stage proposed to disband. I am sure, given the pathetic and crippling state of the South Australian economy, South Australians would be unwilling to see the principle of fiscal equalisation disbanded. So it is a pity that somebody like Premier Bannon is taking what we might call a `little Australia approach' to this extremely important view. </PARA>
<PARA>  My heart here, unusually, goes out to the Prime Minister, who has quite rightly identified the need to do something in this area. The last thing we want is State Premiers, for reasons of domestic political expediency, torpedoing something which should be an important national effort. We do not want people here in this Parliament doing the same thing. We do not want the honourable member for Blaxland suddenly pretending to be a member of the Left of the Labor Party or trying to ingratiate himself with the left of the Labor Party, going to the group of 25 meeting and sabotaging also this process. That is a matter of understandable concern for all Australians when this process is important. </PARA>
<PARA>  So, in conclusion, we on this side of the House do take seriously the Special Premiers Conference process. We do think all these types of issues that I have been discussing should be closely examined. We are not prescriptive about it, but they should be closely examined. There should be cooperation between the Commonwealth and the States in putting together a much better Federation. We are really at the point where our federal system, as a system, is grinding pretty much to a halt. We have to decide what we are going to do. Will we simply try to disband our federal system altogether in all but technical terms and effectively end up with one all powerful central government? If we do not think that is either desirable or practical, the onus is on this Parliament and the other parliaments of Australia to make sure that that federal system operates more efficiently and effectively. </PARA>
<PARA>  The reality is that, whatever our views, whether we are centralists or decentralists--and members of this House have different views on that issue--the written Constitution is unlikely to be changed by the Australian people in favour of the centralists, so we may as well work a lot harder than we have done over the last few years to try to make sure that that federal system we do have works a lot more efficiently than it does currently. I am very sorry that some people--and this is not pertinent to all people in the Labor Party; there are plenty of people of goodwill on this issue--who are using it for malicious internal and external purposes, and that is threatening to sabotage the whole process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I rise to support the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), has raised a number of interesting points, in particular the whole notion of federalism and the current state of play as to the role between the Commonwealth and the States. Indeed, Government members are pleased to hear, as will be many of our colleagues, that there is an amount of goodwill for the whole process. Perhaps one should alleviate his concerns about those being expressed by some people as to the delivery of services which are currently overseen by the Commonwealth and as to whether the States will continue to be responsible for some of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  This Bill puts in place one of the very interesting changes that are brought about by the Special Premiers Conference, that is, the transfer of moneys and, indeed, the transfer of the Victorian College of Agriculture and Horticulture to the Commonwealth, with the agreement of Victoria. Yesterday we also heard the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) discuss the proposal that he will place before the Premiers tomorrow, which is that the whole TAFE infrastructure be funded by the Federal Government, with the result that an extra 100,000 places will be created within our TAFE sector for young Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think many of us who were around in 1974 saw the move of the universities to the Commonwealth as something which was worth while and good, and something that enabled whole universities to develop in their own way and style. Many people opposed that move, wanting to keep universities very closely behind confined State borders, as they saw terrible consequences arising from that dreaded States rights issue. </PARA>
<PARA>  All of us now would understand that Australia is very much more a national country. State borders, over which people move for jobs and which separate areas that recognise or do not recognise educational qualifications, really become meaningless in that context. This Bill gives us a very practical and real example of the way in which the Special Premiers Conference and the kinds of moves which are currently being made by the education Minister in the area of TAFE can apply. This means that a student studying at a college of agriculture in Victoria will be able, perhaps at the end of the first or second year when his or her family moves to north Queensland or Western Australia, to have acknowledgment for the work that he or she has done and, with national accreditation standards that are being pursued through the Special Premiers Conference, have his or her qualifications recognised. </PARA>
<PARA>  Many of us have taught in places where there are children who have come from all round Australia or who have been moving to all parts of Australia. So in terms of education the State boundaries become very artificial. One nonsense that has grown up within Australia is different State handwriting systems. We can all tell the House of the nonsense of children being forced to change their handwriting and so on simply because they happened to cross what is a recognised State boundary. Fortuitously, over a long period we have seen a movement away from that and we now have--good heavens!--an Australian standard of handwriting, which has alleviated enormous problems and pressure for numbers of young students. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have also seen the emergence of the national schools document from Hobart--the Hobart Declaration on Schooling--in which our education Minister has acknowledged that there was a need to look at what is being taught throughout Australia and to attempt to take the very best of that and develop national curricula. Instead of seven or eight resources being duplicated throughout six States, those resources would be put to the very best use and certain States would take control of areas of the curriculum in which they were the best and other States would look at the other areas. In this way, we would be able to pool the very best of our resources and develop a program of national curricula which could, in fact, be emulated throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Special Premiers Conference also looks at a whole range of duplication and the different ways in which we have service delivery. We already have the development of the National Rail Freight Corporation, which will enable freight to be shifted throughout Australia without having to be moved from gauge to gauge to gauge with the associated costs that ensue from extra handling. That is very real and tangible and will, in effect, bring about an enormous amount of reform as well as save the Australian taxpayers an enormous amount of money. We acknowledge that to establish a National Rail Freight Corporation, there is a requirement to develop infrastructure, and that will require money. However, in the medium and long term that will enable us to save enormous amounts of money, to bring about efficiency and, indeed, to move further down the path of acknowledging that we are all Australians and not simply members of States. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the other things which has emerged from the Special Premiers Conferences is the creation of a national power grid. It seems quite extraordinary that some of our States can produce excess energy while others have difficulty in doing so. It seems absolutely and eminently sensible that we should work towards ensuring that energy which we as Australians use is looked at in a national way and addressed as a national issue. That has developed out of these Special Premiers Conferences. </PARA>
<PARA>  A whole range of agreements are currently being pursued by Ministers in areas such as child-care, the development of refuges, and aged care and in a whole range of services, including the Commonwealth-State agreement on housing. All of us want to ensure that money is spent in the best way and that, no matter where we live in Australia, we can be assured that a service will be delivered to us. Under the national child-care scheme the Federal Government has attempted to ensure that people are entitled to a child-care place, irrespective of whether they live in Perth or Mackay. In fact, the Government has worked very hard, through developing its centres in regional areas, to provide, hopefully by 1995, child-care places for 250,000 Australian children. That is a national program which has a national thrust and which sets national standards. </PARA>
<PARA>  While the States per se set regulations that govern the kinds of health requirements and space in child-care centres, they have never been largely involved in the total process of child-care. So that is something which needs to be worked out and controlled because the States have traditionally had a role to play in children's services--be they wards of the state or foster children. They provide a range of services. In particular, they provide education through the compulsory years. So the States have a role to play there. It is incumbent upon us all to ensure that these services are not depleted through our quest to dispel fears over duplication. </PARA>
<PARA>  The same I guess can also be said in respect of any of the services in which the Commonwealth has played a reformist role. In the aged care area, the Commonwealth has been involved with the development of hostels, nursing homes, a charter of rights and nursing home standards. It is important that we continue to ensure that standards do not fall but that any duplications are cut out. The Federal Government and the States have a role to play in these issues. </PARA>
<PARA>  Housing is something which has been at the forefront of discussions within Special Premiers Conferences. Housing is also an important indicator of economic reform. We have already heard today the Acting Treasurer (Mr Willis) and the Acting Prime Minister (Mr Howe) talk about housing starts being a key indicator. The Burdekin inquiry has looked at youth homelessness and the demands on our community to provide youths with a roof over their heads. Indeed, much of what the Burdekin inquiry threw up on youth homelessness could be directly attributed to the States. Over a half of the young people in our refuges have been wards of the state. As soon as they turn 16 the state throws them out and the Federal Government needs to pick them up. Surely this is not in the best interests of anybody. </PARA>
<PARA>  A coordinated and integrated program would deliver a service. It would ensure that young people who have, through no fault of their own, become wards of the state, would be given an opportunity to live a much better life than simply being thrown out on the street as soon as the state decides that it has finished with them. We are very hopeful that the Special Premiers Conference will come to grips with some of those coordinating problems so that a better delivery of service can be made available to many of our people. </PARA>
<PARA>  As well as that, special purpose grants and general purpose grants are part of the whole issue of funding and financing. As an Opposition spokesperson has said, we need to look at the whole notion of the supposedly fiscal imbalance which some of our State Premiers are talking about. As people would know, the Queensland Premier is also one of those who do not want changes in that area. But it is also important to look at the way in which Commonwealth moneys--that is, Australian taxpayers' moneys--are spent by our State colleagues and the way in which they are used. We need to determine whether they are used in the very best ways; whether they are used for the purpose for which they were given and targeted. This leads us to the whole argument of tied grants, whether we are quite certain that Australian taxpayers' money is being spent in the best possible way and whether we should maintain that process. </PARA>
<PARA>  Accountability has always been a keynote of this Government. The Government has established many procedures through many of its funding proposals to ensure that public funds must always, and are always, accounted for in the very best of ways. So it is not unreasonable to expect that Australian taxpayers' money which is handed over to the States should not also be accounted for and attested to in that kind of way. </PARA>
<PARA>  Indeed, we have had a wide-ranging debate on the issues which the Special Premiers Conferences have thrown up. Throughout the community there has been a great deal of support for an end to duplication in services and the costs that go with that. However, we have to ensure that the community is provided with the best services by the best service providers. I guess in some areas we would argue that that is the national government. If we are going to set national goals and national standards, it is our Federal Parliament and our national Government that should be pursuing them. That, of course, is a matter for debate. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Bill addresses a particular example of that in the field of education. I can only wish the Minister For Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) well in his discussions tomorrow as he moves TAFE into the Federal arena. I am also pleased to hear those opposite talk about the crucial and central issue of balancing the demands of States against the rights of the nation and the rights of people within the nation to be treated equally. That is a tension which emerges in any federal system. It is something which needs to be addressed carefully by the Special Premiers Conferences. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have already seen the establishment of the National Rail Freight Authority, a national grid and the movement to a national system for TAFE, which we hope will come about tomorrow. We need to look at the creation of national standards in a whole range of services which we hope will continue to develop. The States will maintain a defined role in the kinds of things which they do well. But it will be the role of the Federal Government to ensure that those things which are important to all of us as of right, and as Australians, are maintained. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I wish to support the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) and, in particular, the Victorian College of Agriculture and Horticulture. I was delighted that the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) referred to that very eminent college in Victoria. Whilst I do not quite agree with her sentiments about national standards and national curriculum, I appreciate her sentiments about that very good college. I declare my interest in the college in that I have been associated with it for a number of years. I am presently on the council of the VCAH and have been associated with agricultural education for the last 15 or 20 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I compliment the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) and his Department for solving this problem which has been around with Victorian and Federal governments since about 1978 or 1979. Historically, Victorian agricultural colleges were funded by way of a tortuous and strange path. Funds made available to the Department of Agriculture flowed on to the various colleges. Back in 1979-80, a number of us approached the then government in order to try to solve this problem, but to no avail. It was always too hard; it was always too difficult; and nobody made any real progress. </PARA>
<PARA>  As Victorians would be aware, in March 1983 the Victorian College of Agriculture and Horticulture came into existence, forming an independent educational institution away from the Department of Agriculture and relating to the Education Department in that State. Even though this independent institution was formed, this funding problem remained. Successive submissions to the Federal Department came to no avail. I compliment the Minister and the Department for actually solving the problem by allowing the Federal funding to flow direct from the Commonwealth to the college and for removing the State from the funding program. </PARA>
<PARA>  The formation of the VCAH, as it is known in Victoria, combined a multicampus institution at Glenormiston in the western part of Victoria; Gilbert Chandler in the Werribee region, which looked after the dairy farmers and the technology of dairy factories; Longeranong in the northern north-west part of the State; Burnley, which was particularly interested in the horticultural area; Dookie, which is in the north-east part of Victoria; and McMillan rural studies, which is in Gippsland. All of those campuses make up the VCAH as a multicampus operation providing advanced courses of education and TAFE programs. </PARA>
<PARA>  The college is unique throughout Australia because there is only one other college that I am aware of--the Darwin college--which provides advanced programs and TAFE programs under the one umbrella. The key feature of the VCAH is that the staff and the students are very close to the industry they serve. The staff who are employed in the advanced education area work in very well with those staff who teach TAFE programs. There is a very good utilisation of resources in terms of the capital structures and in terms of the way in which the teaching staff operate in the multiprogram, multicampus operation. The TAFE people have different approaches to the training of skills compared with those in the advanced area who provide the normal teaching operations. </PARA>
<PARA>  The simple figures are that at the higher education level we have 765 students. At the TAFE level about 10,000 participants take part in programs over the 12-month period, varying from one to two days to 40 half-day programs in the sheep and wool industry and in the dairy industry. Often these are off-campus programs. The programs themselves are often taken to the farmers or members of the community in their own location. Those 10,000 participants in the TAFE programs make up 1,300 EFTs, to put it in the technical jargon. We think the college is doing a very good job and acts as a total institution. </PARA>
<PARA>  Because of the Federal Government's program under the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), in which the amalgamation should take place, the Victorian Government has now agreed that the VCAH should amalgamate with the Melbourne University. In broad terms, the VCAH has agreed to this proposal and there has been a very good cooperative arrangement between the Melbourne University and the VCAH in bringing about a happy marriage. While some of us are concerned about the philosophy and thesis that amalgamations are a good thing, we have to go along with the guidelines that the Government has produced from its White Paper. We do not agree that big is better, but in this particular case the amalgamation will allow the VCAH to remain as a single entity, with its six campuses providing a variety of programs. As I said, the Victorian Government has agreed to this proposal, provided that the Federal Government agreed to the changes in the funding programs which this Bill will allow to take place. </PARA>
<PARA>  The key element is that the funding arrangements now make the VCAH compatible with other tertiary institutions around Australia. As the honourable member for Forde quite rightly indicated, the qualifications and the comparisons between the other tertiary institutions will be of similar vein. Those qualifications that the VCAH offers in Victoria will be acceptable throughout Australia. This will just tidy up some of the loose ends in the relationship between the college and the Commonwealth in terms of funding. </PARA>
<PARA>  In very simple terms, without going into too much detail--the Minister at the table, the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Free) has been good enough to apprise me of the details--the total funding for the higher education component is $8.4m, but there has been a transfer of approximately $4.4m from the Commonwealth to the college, which will take over a similar amount of money that the State historically paid to the college. I note in the transfer that there was an allowance for superannuation at 14 per cent--a fairly high figure compared with that in the private sector. There is a contribution from the HECS program which is fairly significant from the student body. That has been taken into account in the calculations. </PARA>
<PARA>  I and the college are pleased that these arrangements will be coming into place on 1 January 1992 so that the college can proceed with full confidence that in the second half of the financial year funding will become available and in the following years that funding will proceed within the normal guidelines. It is a wonderful breakthrough and a great triumph for the Department and for those of us who have been advocating this change for a number of years. </PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, primary industry is suffering particularly difficult times in the wheat and wool industries, the cattle industry is not looking so bright, and the dairy industry is holding its own. The VCAH is providing qualified and trained people in the industry, although at this stage there is a major downturn in one or two of our major industries. It is very important that the college continue to provide these trained personnel in the farming, pastoral, agricultural and horticultural industries. The horticultural industries are providing a number of trained people who are working in the urban sector. A number of people tend to overlook the contribution of horticulturalists in parks and gardens, racecourses and a number of urban areas where there is certainly a demand from people in the cities to beautify them. These trained people are finding a number of jobs in this area out of the traditional agricultural-horticultural arena. </PARA>
<PARA>  In my view, the college has done a very good job in providing these trained people at the higher education level and at the TAFE level. It has provided skills, experience and some further on-the-job training so that the farmers of the future can provide the necessary skills to handle the next upturn, whenever it might come. Hopefully, by the year 2000 there will be trained personnel in Victoria and around Australia to guide the farming community through better times than we are now presently enjoying, so that Australia can feed and clothe the world population of 5.5 billion. </PARA>
<PARA>  I finish on that note: with the proper funding, attitudes and curriculum, these trained people will come to a new era of prosperity with some skills and abilities that will make Australia a contributor to both the food and the fibre of the world with its ever-increasing population. I am sure that with the contribution of the VCAH, Victorian farmers and horticulturalists, in turn, will be able to make their contribution. The funding arrangements that have been put in place by the present Government are much appreciated. The changes that have been brought about are the end of a long saga going over many years. I thank the Government and appreciate the changes that have taken place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I would like to take the opportunity afforded by the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill to make some comments on the question of federalism and the way in which government is organised in our Commonwealth. Australia has a three-level system of government, with Commonwealth, State and local government all sharing the responsibility of administering the various services and facilities and governing the various aspects of our way of life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Federal Constitution really refers to only two levels of government, Federal and State, and this Bill deals fundamentally with the distribution of funds between the Federal Government and the States. At the time of our Federation, though, it was the Commonwealth that was added to our system of government and not the other tiers. Local and State government had existed for quite some time. So every power that was granted to the new Commonwealth Government was in fact a power that had been ceded by one of the other levels of government. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think this provides something of the history of our federalism over the years. It seems that there has been a continuing debate, probably ever since 1901 and certainly prior to then, over what is an appropriate mix of powers between the various levels of government and then, perhaps also importantly, how those powers are to be matched with the taxing system that our country has available to it. That has always, I guess, been a matter of some controversy and, of course, in the context of Premiers Conferences the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the various State Premiers, with a representative of local government, are again looking at the whole question of the distribution of powers, discussing the interchange of powers between the various tiers. They are also looking at future taxing arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>  Many of those changes are likely to require some amendments to our Federal Constitution by way of referendum. I guess the history of referendums is such that no-one can be filled with any confidence that any change, even if it is agreed at the Premiers Conference, will be finally approved by the Australian people. I think it is somewhat unfortunate that our system of referendums has fallen into some degree of disrepute or suspicion as a result perhaps of past events. It seems there is a degree of suspicion about every referendum. They are always perceived as being yet another Commonwealth grab for power, that there is a secret agenda that is going to deliver things that the Australian people did not expect at the time that the question was being considered. </PARA>
<PARA>  A lot of that suspicion goes back to the referendum in relation to counting Aboriginals in the census. The vast majority of Australians supported it as a very innocent question that nobody could possibly oppose. Subsequently they learnt that, as a result of voting to count Aboriginals in the census, the Commonwealth perceived this as giving it a right to take powers in a whole new area and to make decisions and to introduce legislation in a way in which the Australian people were not really thinking about at the time that referendum was supported. So every new constitutional question faces that difficulty, a suspicion that there is a secret agenda. </PARA>
<PARA>  With this particular proposed set of Premiers Conferences, there is always going to be the overriding suspicion that by the year 2000 a new Constitution which involves republicanism and all sorts of other things that many Australians--perhaps most Australians--are unlikely to support will be on the ALP secret agenda. I think that is disadvantaging the whole process that is currently under way. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am not one of those who believe that the Constitution was given on Mount Sinai and should never be changed. As the years pass, we need to recognise that the circumstances envisaged by the founding fathers at the time will have changed and that history leaves those sorts of events behind. If there is an overwhelming need to change the circumstances, to change the way in which we have been behaving, the way in which we have administered and shared power in the past, then we should take that opportunity if the need is demonstrated. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think it has been clearly demonstrated that there is needless duplication between the three tiers of government. There are some exercises of power which are shared between all three tiers. There are many instances of duplication of departments between Federal and State. Any effort that we can make to rationalise power sharing ought to be supported. In viewing all of those sorts of exercises, primary consideration should be given to the cheapest and most efficient way to deliver services. No-one can tell me that duplicating bureaucracies at the Federal and State levels is efficient and the cheapest possible way of operating. We clearly need to be looking at ways of rationalising that kind of activity. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the most important aspects as we look at the future of our federalism will be considering the mechanisms of taxing. Vertical fiscal imbalance is obviously one of the ways in which inefficiency grows and our bureaucracy becomes more costly. I have been told that, currently, the Commonwealth raises approximately double what it spends, the States about half of what they spend and local government about three-quarters of their budgets. Victoria said in a recent submission that the States raise 17 per cent of taxes but spend 50 per cent of outlays. </PARA>
<PARA>  When there are transfers of this nature, there are always disputes about the formulas. We have the charade of the Premiers Conference; a comic opera in three acts with all of the Premiers arriving in Canberra telling us what strong cases they have, on the second day listening to the Commonwealth telling them that this is what they are going to get whether they like it or not, and then the Premiers going home complaining about being bitterly disappointed but usually with an increased share of the overall revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are naturally going to be disputes over the formulas.  There are various systems of administering the funds. Some funds are administered and distributed on a per capita basis;  others through systems of fiscal equalisation;  others by specific applications for particular grants; and then, of course, there are special purpose grants for particular purposes. I think it has perhaps been a bit disappointing that, particularly at the Federal level over recent times, there seems to have been a particular emphasis on the development of programs where there are special purpose grants--specific grants for specific purposes. I sometimes think that many of these grants are more designed to provide photo opportunities for the Ministers and to provide handouts to particular favoured groups, rather than to do anything constructive towards achieving specific objectives. They are designed more for the publicity that they can generate rather than the good they can do in the community. Hundreds of millions of dollars of the Federal Budget are now allocated in this way. </PARA>
<PARA>  Specific purpose grants really guarantee that there are going to be inefficiencies. The Commonwealth bureaucracy, or the government of the day, decides that it will spend money on a particular area. Then the States fight hard to get the maximum share of it, or local government looks to get as much as it can, irrespective of the merits of whether that particular task should be undertaken at all. They all fight to get their share so that they can spend the maximum amount of money. In many instances, it is not a priority of theirs and, in fact, if they had the ignominy of actually having to raise the taxes for that purpose, they would not do it at all. So we have these programs, and very rarely do we consider the merits of them and what they are able to do constructively to assist our society. </PARA>
<PARA>  If we were to move strictly to fiscal responsibility, where we all raise what we spend, this would also create difficulties. Some States, naturally by way of their environment, have a more costly job in carrying out their business of government. Some are large in area;  some have climatic difficulties;  and the various population spreads certainly affect the cost of administering and providing services. That applies equally to local government. If we were to have a strict system where each tier of government raised what it spent, where each State and each local government raised only what it spent, then those who have the most would continue to get more and those who have the least would continue to do poorly. We would end up with a lack of equality amongst Australians which we would find intolerable. So there will always need to be some degree of vertical fiscal imbalance and that is going to occur regardless of what kind of system we have, if we are determined to be fair and provide equal services, or close to equal services, for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Federal Government itself has a great power to influence what amount of revenue the States are able to raise and which States prosper. It locates its departments in particular locations. It provides grants in specific ways. It supports industry with contracts and the like. All of those things will influence which States have a greater revenue raising capacity than others. Traditionally it has been Victoria and New South Wales, the most populous States, that have done best in that regard. Victoria and New South Wales receive most of the arts and sports funding;  they get most of the departmental allocations, way in excess of their proportion of the population. I guess a lot of that happens because of the political power which rests in the most populous States. New South Wales and Victoria have provided most of the Prime Ministers and Cabinet Ministers and they have therefore exercised considerable influence when any of those decisions have been made. There is therefore a natural tendency for those States to do particularly well in that regard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Mr Acting Speaker, my concern was to know whether it was the status of the Parliamentary Secretaries that was involved in the resolution and, because the resolution specifically referred to the Standing Orders, I suspected that the answer you gave would be the way it would be presented. But I would put to you that there are some aspects of the responsibilities of a member who is not a Minister which would presumably mean that it is not just whether or not one is presumed to have the authority of the Government behind one to determine the outcome. It was for that reason that I was not sure, based on the form of the resolution, whether or not it would still be necessary when moving motions for a seconder to be presented.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  However, I accept the ruling and, as I did yesterday, just express to you, Sir, my concern that this more than anything demonstrates that you are putting the Parliamentary Secretaries in locus standi; in other words, in the same position as a Minister. It would obviously have been easier for the Government to have expanded the Ministry, which was one of the concerns that was expressed more vocally in the House during debate yesterday. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I think the reason for the statement by the Leader of the House was to clarify the issues the right honourable member addresses. I guess the outcome is that in substance what he is saying is the case, that they are to be understood as performing the role of Ministers, with the exception that they are not to be involved in taking questions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I should also add that in a sense the fact that the Chair does not call for a seconder has been a convention rather than a rule within the Standing Orders of the House. Did the right honourable member wish to rise again?  I am happy to try to clarify it. </PARA>

The point I would query about your advice when you say it is a matter of convention--and I am seeking your indulgence to speak on this--is that it should not just be section 44 of the Constitution that distinguishes somebody who is not a Minister from somebody who is. I can see the progressive encroachment on the status of a Minister in a way that I do not think the House necessarily foreshadowed in the debate yesterday. When the Standing Orders prescribe that something should happen, then that should be so, and I suggest it is not just a matter for the Speaker to say, `Well, because you presume that somebody has the authority, you do not need a seconder'. That is really why I raised the question yesterday, because that is not specifically in the Standing Orders and I therefore felt it was a matter that should be clarified.</PARA></TALK.START>

The House is indebted to the right honourable member for New England for raising this question following the debate when the resolution was being considered to lift the status of Parliamentary Secretaries almost to the level of Ministers. As I indicated at the time, the House and the Australian public should be outraged at what the Government is doing in relation to this matter, continually whittling down the authority of Parliament.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Prior to dinner I was commenting on the distribution of powers between the Federal and State governments and, in particular, the fiscal equalisation principles which might apply in relation to the distribution of grants between the various States. I pointed out that the great bulk of political power in Australia has perhaps naturally been generated and exercised by the two most populous States and that has benefited them significantly and, I would submit, to an extent greater than their population would justify. I was going through some of the particular areas where those benefits had accrued. One obvious additional area was in relation to the tariff policies that have applied over recent times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The manufacturing States of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, but probably particularly Victoria, have been the major beneficiaries of that policy. EPAC, when putting forward the case for reductions in tariffs, made the point that the total output for every State in Australia would increase as a result of tariff reductions, except for Victoria. That is obviously an illustration of the fact that Victorians have benefited over the years from the existing tariff policy. Other Australians have paid dearly for cars, whitegoods, clothing, footwear and the like as a result of these particular policies. </PARA>
<PARA>  The NFF in a study some time ago put the cost of tariffs to farmers at around $6,000 each. In other words, there has been a significant transfer through that manufacturing policy towards the State of Victoria while, on the other hand, export earnings are shared amongst the States. There are no subsidies for mining, farming and the like, so those profits are taxed and then distributed to the various States. Once more, the head offices for most of the export and mining industries, even though the industries are generally located in Western Australia and Queensland, tend to be in Sydney and Melbourne, which has boosted industry in those States, created jobs and profits, and raised their taxing base. So New South Wales and Victoria have been able to tax other States' profitability. </PARA>
<PARA>  Just recently the Victorian Government issued a paper Fiscal Equalisation Issues for Review. In that paper the Victorian Government claims that it is subsidising other Australians to the tune of $175.16 per head. To come to that figure, the Victorian Government has had to exercise remarkable dexterity with figures. It compares the grants that would come from the Commonwealth on a per capita basis with fiscal equalisation. The paper complains that before much longer Queensland will get greater grants than Victoria. It is inevitable that, as the populations of Queensland and Western Australia continue to grow, those States will receive a greater share of the funding. </PARA>
<PARA>  Perhaps one of the faults with the current system is that funding tends to follow the shifts of population; it comes after people have moved. It is not there in advance to provide the facilities and services that the increasing population will require; instead, we allocate it to States where the population is declining and, in a sense, waste it on buildings that will not be used. </PARA>
<PARA>  Victoria also argued that the formula should be changed to eliminate location specific difficulties. Victoria, a tiny State with a comparatively dense population, has many cost advantages over the other States. In putting forward this philosophy, I am sure that Victoria is more interested in self-interest than in genuine equity. Its services are naturally cheaper and roads, schools and hospitals can all be provided much more efficiently and cheaply in such a compact environment. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think that Victoria does make one valid point; that is, there is no obligation on the States to spend the extra money provided for this disability on the disability itself. That is particularly apparent at present in Queensland, which receives an allocation for location disabilities--I would argue, rightly so--while at the same time the new Goss Labor Government is viciously cutting back services to country areas. So in a sense it is receiving money from the Commonwealth to do a particular function but is choosing to spend that money in other areas. </PARA>
<PARA>  In general, I do not think there can be any argument that the Victorian Government has prepared this paper as an attempt to smokescreen its own incompetence. Victoria's financial position is disastrous. That is clearly the fault of its Labor Government. Victorians have had to bail out failed financial institutions and their statutory authorities while their welfare bureaucracy has grown out of all proportion; and even the Melbourne public transport system requires $3m a day in subsidies. I feel sorry for ordinary Victorians. All they did was vote for Labor and now their State is in ruins. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, Victoria is not all that far ahead of South Australia, for instance. The long suffering South Australian taxpayers are having to bail out their State Bank to the tune of $1 billion a year to keep it solvent. In Western Australia, Labor has delivered Western Australia Inc. and a bill for future generations to pick up. In Tasmania, Labor has crippled industry and commerce. It is, indeed, a tragic story. </PARA>
<PARA>  The only difference between Queensland and the other States is 10 years of Labor Government. Sadly, Premier Goss has learnt nothing from the experiences of his Labor colleagues. He is behaving just like Cain, Burke, Bannon and Kirner; in fact, Premier Goss will live to regret the day that he made the public boast that he would do for Queensland what Cain did for Victoria. Sadly, he is delivering that promise, if few others. He inherited the best economy, balanced Budgets, an exciting development agenda and the lowest taxes. In less than two years he has put Queensland on the road to Victoria. His Public Service is burgeoning beyond belief. There have been massive tax hikes--up to 200 per cent and 300 per cent in some instances--and hidden Budget deficits already. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is interesting to note that 50 per cent of all the new Public Service positions created by all tiers of government right around Australia over the past 12 months have been created by the Goss Government in Queensland--what an extraordinary record--despite vicious and heavy cutbacks in rural areas. The staff increases are in strange places: Premier Goss's staff has increased from 12 to 29; the staff of the Cabinet Office has gone from three to 66; and there are another 19 positions provided for in this year's State Budget. That is where the increases are occurring. Queensland is developing the same kind of Public Service bureaucracy that has been the tradition of Labor governments in other places and that has put them on the road to destruction. </PARA>
<PARA>  If that is not bad enough, we have now heard that Premier Goss is to spend $10m refurbishing his own office. In these times of critical economic crisis the Premier of Queensland can find $10m to refurbish his own office--just one floor of the building--with marble lifts, oak panelling and the like. What a tragedy it is that last night in the Federal Parliament we were debating whether our country can afford family allowances while the Commonwealth continues to make grants to a State such as Queensland which turns around and spends $10m on oak panels and marble lifts for the Premier's office. That is one of the problems we have when it comes to distributing funds to the States. While we may have noble objectives, there is very little incentive and discipline placed on the States to ensure that those funds are spent wisely and in accordance with national objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think it is very important that we debate all of these issues associated with the distribution of powers between Federal and State. We need to look at these issues constructively and to recognise their importance to the future of Australia. (Time expired)</PARA>

The Bill is not being opposed by the Opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  There are perhaps a few comments that have been made in the course of the debate to which I should respond. I acknowledge the frustration expressed by the honourable member for Mayo in dealing with the complexities of Australia's three tiered system of government. I also acknowledge the support that he has expressed for the Special Premiers Conference process, which is designed to remove much of the duplication that exists in our system. I also acknowledge the special interest he has in problems which local government is experiencing in his area. It is a pity that the honourable member for Mayo and some of his colleagues did not support the constitutional referendum held in 1988 which would have recognised local government under the Constitution. So perhaps his concern is a little belated. </PARA>
<PARA>  I also acknowledge his concern for the ratepayers of Stirling within his electorate. I hope that they receive good attention from him, particularly when he will have the task in the near future of explaining to them why the impact of a goods and services tax on the operations of the Stirling local government authority will lead to a rate increase. I found his comment that the Bjelke-Petersen Government had led the way in taxation reform by removing death duties rather intriguing. I would not have thought that any honourable member on either side of this House would have been holding up the late, unlamented Bjelke-Petersen Government of Queensland as any kind of example for anybody to follow in any shape or form. I simply note that, apart from death duties, the Bjelke-Petersen Government broke ground in a number of areas; but, I would suggest, opened paths along which few would choose to follow. </PARA>
<PARA>  I note also the fascinated interest expressed by the honourable member for Mayo in the democratic processes of the Caucus. We on this side of the chamber certainly believe in discussing important questions facing Australia and discussing them in an open and democratic way. I make no apology for that. </PARA>
<PARA>  I thank the honourable member for Corangamite for his contribution to the debate. The Victorian College of Agriculture and Horticulture clearly is an institution dear to his heart. He has devoted a great deal of his time to the welfare of that institution, particularly as a member of its council. If he is pleased that the amendment which I will be moving shortly on behalf of the Government will solve the problems of the Victorian College of Agriculture and Horticulture, then I am certainly also pleased.

<PARA>I will not deal with the details of the amendment except to point out that it solves the problem of the Victorian College of Agriculture and Horticulture, to which I have referred. Its effect is to reduce the financial assistance grants in the case of the State of Victoria by an amount of $2.428m. That will transfer from the State to the Commonwealth the full responsibility for funding the higher education program at the college.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Carriage of Goods by Sea Bill has had an interesting passage through the House over the last 18 months. The Bill was originally introduced into the House last year. The Bill we debate tonight supersedes the Bill of 1990.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It has been an interesting passage for the Bill because when the Bill was first introduced I recall the Minister sitting at the table tonight, the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), making a fairly brief second reading speech introducing the Bill into the House. The second reading speech was so brief that I thought that it must have been a very simple and uncomplicated piece of legislation that we would be able to deal with very easily indeed. However, it rapidly became obvious to us, and to a host of other people who had an interest in this area, that the Bill was considerably more complex, considerably more difficult and more legalistic than the Government had first indicated to us. </PARA>
<PARA>  As a result of that, the Opposition, along with members of the maritime industry, members of the insurance industry and the Law Council of Australia, expressed concern about the make-up of this Bill. Whilst appreciating, as I think all of us did at the time, the basis of the intent behind the introduction of the Bill, we all expressed considerable concern about the detail of it. We discovered that there were considerable flaws in the Bill and considerable concerns were being raised by industry. As a result, we expressed our view that this was a Bill that we would have a great deal of difficulty in supporting, and so did members of the industry. As a result, the Bill was withdrawn by the Government and the Bill that we debate today replaces it. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill relates primarily to the way in which goods at sea are insured. It shifts the onus of responsibility for the insurance of goods at sea from the shipper, that is, the owner of the cargo, to the shipowner, that is, the mover of the cargo. This is a welcome piece of news for shippers throughout Australia, our exporters and our importers, because at first blush this legislation would save them the cost of the insurance component of transporting their goods from Australia to other parts of the world, or from other parts of the world to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, as we delve further into the legislation it is not quite as simple as that. Indeed, I believe that shippers have a somewhat misguided view as to the benefits of this legislation. Later in my speech I will draw upon the advice of people who are far more experienced and wiser than I am. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe that, as with the previous legislation, the Bill as introduced into the House is not adequate to cover the needs of Australian shipowners and shippers and that it requires amendment. I foreshadow that I will be moving an amendment following the conclusion of the second reading debate. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Carriage of Goods by Sea Bill deals with two aspects of regulation of the carriage of goods by sea, one commonly known as the Hague Rules and the other the Hamburg Rules. The point of the legislation concerning the liability for cargoes carried by sea is that the regime should, firstly, allocate responsibility and liability for damage to cargo as simply as possible and, secondly, reduce legal disputes and the costs of those legal disputes. Therefore, the legislation should reflect current international practices. It should be equitable and it should be efficient. It should also conform with practices of our trading partners and rivals. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Visby and SDR protocols, which amend the original Hague Convention--which I think dates back to 1924--bring the Hague Rules into line with generally accepted modern practice. Indeed, the amendments to the Hague Rules are generally well regarded in terms of bringing the language to a more modern standard and also bringing some of the measurements, such as the special drawing rights--that is, the IMF monetary unit--into more modern terms. They do not address what shippers argue is a deficiency in the Hague Rules, and that is the imbalance of the major burden of risk which is currently borne by the shipper, even though the shipowner has care of the cargo. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition is sensitive to these deficiencies in the Hague Rules and it supports in principle the fairer division of liability that the Hamburg Rules offer. It seems fair that the shipowner should be liable for the well-being of the cargo for the time that it is in his care. Shippers, that is, owners of the cargo, exporters and importers, are a very second-rate cousin when it comes to the whole transport network. It seems that the shipper is the one who ends up paying for all the costs of the inefficiencies and irresponsibilities of the other persons involved in the transport chain, whether it is on the waterfront, in the shipping industry, in the trucking industry, in the railway industry or whatever. It is always the poor old shipper who ends up meeting the cost of all the inefficiencies and irresponsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have seen many examples in the past of owners of cargo, having deposited it in the hands of the stevedore and then the shipowner, having to foot the bill for any damage done by the shipowner in the course of transporting that cargo, even though the owner of the cargo had absolutely no direct responsibility for or care of that cargo while it was in the hands of the shipowner. That is the principle behind the amendments that we are considering tonight. The principle is to try to ensure that the person who is in possession of the cargo carries responsibility for any damage or cost, in addition to the normal cost, that may be incurred as a result of the transport of that cargo. Of course, from the point of view of the shipper, the owner of the cargo, that would be a welcome relief. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, as the Government as admitted, the Hamburg Rules are not generally accepted and will not come into force internationally until 1 November 1992. The Hamburg Rules have only just attracted the 20 accessions required to bring the Rules into force internationally. I think Zambia was the twentieth and last country to accede to the Hamburg Rules, thus triggering their implementation 12 months later. If we have time later on I might deal with some of the countries that have signed their concurrence with the Hamburg Rules. The list sheds an interesting light on our concern. </PARA>
<PARA>  Very few of the countries that have agreed to the Hamburg Rules could be considered our major trading partners. That is why we are concerned about the Rules. It seems rather odd that so many of the countries in the 20 accessions so far are not our major trading partners. It draws the questions: why on earth are our major trading partners not party to the Hamburg Rules? Will our being party to them put us at some trading disadvantage in the future? Indeed, of the 20 nations that have signed, very few are significant maritime nations.</PARA>
<PARA>  If the Rules were to attract general international acceptance by our trading partners, there may be benefits to shippers. The Hamburg Rules favour shippers in the divisions of liability and therefore, if generally accepted, would be in our interests. But until they are generally accepted, Australian shippers would be placed at a disadvantage if Australia adopted rules that were in legal conflict with those applying to our trading partners and rivals. Many complexities would result from disputed claims and legal uncertainties. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition supports the principles underlying the Hamburg Rules, and it supports their adoption when an appropriate number of our trading partners and rivals have also adopted them or are prepared to adopt them. But there are already suggestions in the international shipping, insurance and legal fraternities that the Hamburg Rules are in the process of being overtaken by further developments and may not, in any event, deliver the savings that shippers are assuming they will deliver. Shippers may not have taken into account added insurance costs to carriers, which will inevitably be passed back in increased freight rates. If the onus of insuring goods at sea is to be carried by shipowners, it is somewhat naive to expect that at some stage down the track the increased cost of that insurance to them will not be reflected in the form of increased freight rates for the cargo carried. So it stands to reason that, one way or another, shippers will end up paying for the costs of insurance, no matter which way the issue goes. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Insurance Council has predicted that a flight of insurance business from the country of consignment is likely as the onus of insurance passes from the shipper to the carrier, who is more likely to insure with international brokers or in the flag country. I am reliably informed that it is estimated that the value of the business that could be lost as a result of this legislation is of the order of $60m per annum. That is not an insignificant amount. Certainly that estimate draws concern from the insurance fraternity in Australia. However, the Government has been quick to emphasise the benefits that flow to shippers from this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government may be exaggerating these benefits, as it does with so many of its so-called reforms. The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) is not backward in coming forward when it comes to espousing the benefits of the Government's legislation or reforms. He certainly has been caught on many occasions in the past for exaggerating the benefits of reforms. Indeed, in another area in which I have an interest, the waterfront--an area of considerable interest for the Government and the Opposition--the Minister has on a number of occasions exaggerated the benefits, the pace and the extent of reform. We need go back only a couple of weeks to when the Minister was speaking to a port authorities conference in Brisbane. He claimed that the number of waterside workers had been reduced to the extent that there were now only 5,000 left. In fact, at the time there were 6,212 waterside workers, not the 5,000 that the Minister claimed. </PARA>
<PARA>  In May of last year, in an adjournment debate Senator Collins claimed that some 1,100 to 1,200 waterside workers had left the waterfront as a result of the Government's waterfront reform program. Indeed, that figure was not achieved until nearly the end of September. But that did not stop the Minister making that claim on several other occasions during the year. That highlights just how easy the honourable senator finds it to exaggerate the benefits of reform--as he has done, I think, in respect of this legislation we are debating tonight. He is exaggerating to shippers--that is, the owners of cargo--the benefits of this reform. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, Senator Collins is not the only one. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), also in exaggerating waterfront reform, claimed a 70 per cent gain in productivity on the waterfront in November of last year when he made the world's greatest micro-economic reform statement. That claim of 70 per cent productivity gain on the waterfront was made even before one wharfie had left the waterfront. So we are aware of the exaggerations that are taking place. I think this legislation is a victim of the exaggerations of the Minister and the Government, and I just hope that shippers are aware of that and do not fall into the trap of believing everything that the Government and Minister tell them. </PARA>
<PARA>  The chairman of the international conference that agreed to the Hamburg Rules back in 1978, Professor Rolf Herber, said at the Attorney-Generals' Eleventh International Trade Law Seminar in Canberra in 1984:</PARA>
<PARA>The expectation of a possible decrease in overall transportation in costs for shippers all over the world, however, does not seem to be justified. On the other hand, fears of an increase in these costs seem to be exaggerated as well. . . it is--and I would be the last to deny this--a good convention. The best one could obtain in view of the divergent views and interests of all the countries of the world. Their--</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Hamburg Rules--</PARA>
<PARA>coming into force would improve the legal situation considerably. But it would certainly not meet expectations as to a decrease in overall costs. </PARA>
<PARA>Those are the words of the gentleman who was responsible for the establishment of the Hamburg Rules, which the Minister claims will decrease the costs of insurance to shippers. The man who created the Hamburg Rules is saying that this is not necessarily so. He concluded that, in view of the background of a long maritime tradition and practice and the importance attached to the legal changes, the implementation of the Hamburg Rules may still require considerable time. Not only is this uncertainty expressed by the gentleman responsible for introducing the Hamburg Rules; it is also being reflected by others involved in the Australian shipping industry. I quote from a letter written to me only this week by the Australian Chamber of Shipping. It said:</PARA>
<PARA>During the debate on this Bill in the Senate, a key issue was not raised viz, that unless the Hamburg Rules become acceptable internationally by a large number of trading nations, the different liability arrangements applying will result in increased insurance premiums for shippers and shipowners. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Australian Chamber of Shipping has to say about the Hamburg Rules. Its comment is precisely in line with the Opposition's concerns, which are reflected in the amendment that we will move later tonight. </PARA>
<PARA>  Shipping Conferences Services Ltd, another major player in shipping services to and from Australia, also wrote a letter to me this week expressing a similar degree of concern about the nature of this legislation. I shall read the following couple of paragraphs from this letter:</PARA>
<PARA>The main issue which was not raised during that debate--</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the debate on the Hamburg Rules in the Senate--</PARA>
<PARA>was that unless the Hamburg Rules become acceptable internationally by a considerable number of major trading nations, then the different liability regimes applying will result in increased insurance premiums for shippers, both large and small, and shipowners. </PARA>
<PARA>The major reason is that the insurance interests will need to respond by recovering the costs of possible claims under different liability regimes applying which under the Hamburg Rules will be for the choice of the shipper. Compounding the problem will be the uncertainty of new rules compared to the old rules, and the difficulty of interpreting new rules without clear legal precedent. This interpretation problem will obviously be made worse if only a few countries are applying the Hamburg Rules. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on to highlight a number of things. It also included an article from the Daily Commercial News, which is the daily newspaper that specialises in transport news. It referred to an article by David Roylance, a partner in Middletons solicitors who practises transport and trade law. I think this is the key comment about these Hamburg Rules in David Roylance's article:</PARA>
<PARA>There would seem no compelling reason for the Australian government to move to a Hamburg regime . . . The 20 nations which have accepted the Hamburg Rules are thought to represent only three per cent of world trade (and a lesser proportion of Australian trade) and to account for the same percentage of the world's tonnage. Accordingly, the coming into force of the Hamburg Rules in the near future is unlikely to have the impact its proponents sought. </PARA>
<PARA>On the issue of insurance, it is clearly the case that cargo owners will still require adequate insurance. If cargo owners do not carry insurance but rely on the carrier to meet liabilities there are significant risks to the cargo owner. </PARA>
<PARA>There is no guarantee that sea carriers will settle claims promptly, or at all for that matter, as there is no effective mechanism for cargo owners to pursue the sea carrier's P&amp; association. </PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore, cargo insurance is likely to still be necessary for sale and letter of credit purposes and to cover "gaps" in any liabilities the sea carrier may have or to provide cover above any limit of liability that the sea carrier may establish. </PARA>
<PARA>It follows that any savings on insurance which result from shifting the balance to the sea carrier may be illusory. Such savings would only mean increased costs for sea carriers and would quickly work their way through to increased freight rates. </PARA>
<PARA>They are the views of another expert in the area. He quite obviously indicates to the readers of the Daily Commercial News that he does not think the Government is taking the right course of action in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>  This uncertainty about the Hamburg Rules prompted the Opposition to move an amendment in the Senate which would have enabled the updating of the Hague Rules without prejudice, pending the wider acceptance of the Hamburg Rules. It would have forced the reconsideration of the provisions in the Bill relating to the Hamburg Rules after three years if nothing had been done in the meantime. I thank my colleague Senator Macdonald for his efforts in moving the amendments and leading the debate on this legislation in the Senate. He did an excellent job in proposing some of the concerns that the Opposition has. Our proposal would not have allowed the introduction of the rules without further examination of the situation and consultation with the interested parties. </PARA>
<PARA>  So, despite attempts to reach an agreed position on this with the Government--whose broad intentions and those of the Opposition are not at odds--the Government opposed the amendment that was moved by the Opposition and introduced its own amendment, which was very disappointing because we believed that we had reached an understanding in a Senate committee which would have enabled us to move the amendment that we were proposing and that the amendment would have been supported by the Government. Even the Australian Democrats indicated that they would support our amendment. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government's legislation leaves it possible for the Hamburg Rules to come into effect through oversight or under circumstances in which the situation has not been properly assessed. The Government's amendment in the Senate put into the Bill a provision where the Hamburg Rules would come into effect automatically if nothing further were done or if no agreement were reached regarding the appropriateness of their introduction, which is to say that they can enter into force for Australia by accident, by default or by stealth. The Opposition will introduce an amendment in committee to correct this, to ensure that entry into force is the result of a considered decision that the time is right. </PARA>

It could mean, for example, that the Parliament has been prorogued and an election has been called and there is no opportunity for the Parliament to consider the matter before the three-year trigger occurs, when it is automatically implemented.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  These are all consequences of the Government's amendment. However, the Opposition notes that the Government has included a requirement for consultation with shippers, cargo owners, carriers and shipowners before proclamation of the Hamburg Rules. It welcomes this adoption of the Opposition's initial proposal in this regard but also notes that the reference to `and given due consideration' is a rather non-specific prescription. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition certainly claims that before this legislation is implemented there needs to be very comprehensive and broad consultation with industry to ensure that our other major trading partners have also agreed to the Hamburg Rules so that this does not put us at a trading disadvantage and does not incur a multitude of complexities in insurance matters. It must ensure that Australian exporters and importers, the owners of those cargoes, are not put at any trading disadvantage. We believe that the contribution that has been made by the Opposition, be it in the House or in the Senate, has added to the strength of this legislation. It still needs further strengthening. That is why we moved our amendment and that is why we have expressed our concerns. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-As the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) has said, the Carriage of Goods by Sea Bill has had an interesting passage. I remember putting my name down to speak on this Bill about 18 months ago. It stayed on our noticeboard, but I thought everything had gone to seed; nevertheless, we are debating it tonight. I listened with interest to what the honourable member for Gilmore said. He quoted some of the experts. I suppose we all select our experts to get the quote we want. It seemed to me that he was doing a bit of that this evening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  As has been said, the purpose of the Bill is to reform Australia's marine cargo liability legislation which is concerned with legal responsibility for loss or damage occurring to seaborne cargo. The new Bill replaces the Carriage of Goods by Sea Bill 1990, which was introduced into the House of Representatives on 12 September 1990 following a review of Australia's marine cargo liability regime. The earlier Bill resulted in a number of representations being received from shippers, ocean carriers and the legal profession expressing concern about certain technical aspects of the proposed legislation. These concerns, as I understand it, focused on the use of modern language instead of the original text of international conventions, the need to clarify the Bill's application to contracts of carriage other than those evidenced by documents of title such as bills of lading, and the scope of coverage of Australian law. </PARA>
<PARA>  I did think it was a bit ripe for the honourable member for Gilmore to claim that it was some great initiative of the Opposition that had led to this change. As I understand it, there was a lot of representation made about it and I suppose, as always happens, some of these people may have contacted the Opposition as well as contacting the Government and others. </PARA>
<PARA>  There have been extensive consultations between the Commonwealth and the parties concerned. This has been necessary because of the complex legal nature raised. There is broad industry support for the reforms proposed in this Bill. I must say that, while one welcomes the fact that conventions have been developed by the international community to determine liability when seaborne cargo is lost or damaged, it is a great pity that the same concern is not expressed for the loss of life. The international community is concerned about the legal responsibility for loss or damage occurring to seaborne cargo, but who cares about the loss of life? Over 200 seamen were drowned, killed or are missing from bulk carriers alone in 1990. Twelve ships were lost. These ships were lost in the main through structural faults. In the first four months of 1991, a further six of these ships have gone missing with an additional loss of life, the numbers unknown. All the ships were carrying iron ore, and some of them sailed from Australian ports after loading ironstone in north-west Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  The mining industry has always been most vocal about the need for the cheapest ships possible, and says that the OECD standard is not one for valid comparison with Australian shipping. The seaworthiness of international vessels should be an issue of growing international concern. As I have said, over recent years we have seen the disappearance of increasing numbers of ships at sea and the sinking of vessels crewed in the main by seafarers from Third World countries. It is a matter that demands much greater attention by the world's trading nations. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have spoken in this House before about the condition of some of the ships, especially flag of convenience ships visiting Australia. I have inspected ships at Port Kembla on which bans have been placed. In many cases, these ships are nothing more than rust buckets. All the insurance legislation in the world will not save these rust buckets. I have listened to the wails of members of the Opposition as they rail against the Waterside Workers Federation and the Seamen's Union. Time and time again, I have challenged members of the Opposition to visit Port Kembla with me the next time bans are placed on a ship there to inspect that ship with me. So far none of them has accepted my invitation. </PARA>
<PARA>   Cargo is important and so, I would suggest, are human lives. The proliferation of flag of convenience ships in countries which do not apply proper standards, shows a disdain for seamen's lives. Maybe the owners and users of these ships do not care, but seafarers and the world organisations certainly do and will continue the fight to expose and reject flag of convenience registrations and substandard ships. </PARA>
<PARA>  Under the plans that the Opposition has for shipping, flag of convenience crews and flag of convenience ships infesting the Australian coast spell low wages, lack of maintenance, under or untrained personnel, disregard for safety, a hazard to other ships, and a danger to the environment. </PARA>
<PARA>  An exceptional number of bulk carriers have disappeared in the past 18 months. An examination of their registers show either flag of convenience or countries with notorious safety records being the country of registry. Poorly trained crews, inadequate certification of officers and seamen and low safety standards all mean higher insurance premiums as countries become more responsible about the type of ships which visit their ports. The effect on passenger ships sinking and civilian lives lost will also engender greater control. Exposure of shippers who use substandard ships will go a long way to help eliminating them. There are substandard ships visiting the Australian coast and Australian ports. This legislation will not do a lot about them. </PARA>
<PARA>   At this stage it is not clear because of the lack of information just how many of the sunk vessels were lost due to the unseaworthiness of the vessels alone, as a result of inadequately trained crews and poor seamanship or as a result of a combination of both. Vessels in bad seas need well-qualified, expert crews and attendants to handle them. We have a situation where on many of the flag of convenience vessels there may be only one or two certified or qualified officers on board, and there is often a language difficulty as well--a language difficulty between the officers and between the crew. The rest of the crew who are being paid poverty wages are effectively seagoing labourers. No tears are being shed by the trading nations of the world for those hundreds of Third World seamen who have disappeared without trace or who have lost their lives at sea. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is clear that in recent years we have seen a re-emergence of the coffin ships of past centuries when ships were sent to sea in an unseaworthy condition or in a condition that was likely to result in the loss of these vessels or their crews. The development of international maritime conventions and of proper standards for the construction and maintenance of vessels, crewing and training of crews developed out of these malpractices of centuries gone by. For years, seafarers of the world have been pointing to the deplorable condition of many of the vessels that operate as flag of convenience ships. For their efforts, they have generally been portrayed as people crying wolf, people who did not want to work, people who were drawing undue attention to the safety aspects of ship operation. We are now seeing the results of the continued neglect of this major safety issue by the shipping nations of the world. </PARA>
<PARA>  The irony is that attention has now been drawn to this practice of using coffin ships, not because of concern about the loss of lives at sea, but because of concern about the marine and global environment. That environment is a matter of major concern. However, I should have thought that priority would have been given to the needless loss of lives of sailors at sea. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have a concern in this nation about the risk posed to our coastal marine environment by oil spillages from poorly crewed vessels and from unseaworthy vessels in the event of their being wrecked. Recently, the near sinking of a Greek owned tanker off the Western Australian coast focused our attention on the risk to Australia's fishing grounds and to our coastal environment. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the past 18 months, 39 large overseas bulk carrying vessels suffered serious structural damage, were lost at sea or just went missing. We know that 21 of these ships sunk. Six of them were loaded in north-western Australian ports. They were loaded in Australian ports by Australian persons, sailed, and were never to be seen again--ships that disappeared, ships that sank without trace. </PARA>
<PARA>  I commend the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) for recognising the seriousness of this situation and for his determination to initiate an international campaign to address this problem. But I repeat, all members of parliament should take the opportunity to visit some of these ships on which bans are placed at Australian ports. I doubt whether members of the Opposition would continue with some of their comments if they, like me, had the opportunity to inspect these rust buckets. </PARA>
<PARA>   Naturally, I do not object to this legislation as in areas it streamlines aspects of the shipping industry, especially in relation to documentation. The coverage of the Bill also extends on a voluntary basis to contracts of carriage evidenced by non-negotiable transport documents. These non-negotiable transport documents fulfil a similar function to bills of lading, that is, they are evidence of the contract of carriage of the goods between the carrier and the shipper, with the exception that they do not carry title to the cargo.</PARA>
<PARA>  The extension of the Bill's coverage in this regard recognises the increasing use of non-negotiable transport documents in Australia's interstate and international sea trades, and also resolves the question as to whether the Hague-Visby-SDR regime can be applied where such documents are used. </PARA>
<PARA>  There has been much discussion over recent months about waterfront reform and I note that the honourable member for Gilmore could not resist having another go at it again this evening. One area that is rarely mentioned is the need for reform in regard to the paper chase that is so much of importation in Australia today. I hope that this legislation can do something about this. </PARA>
<PARA>   There is a chaotic system of paperwork. For example, the steaming time for a ship from, say, Singapore to Fremantle is often only four days. Time and time again, the ship will arrive at Fremantle before the paperwork because of the antiquated paperwork system that we have. When the paperwork arrives, an endless paper chain then has to be gone through before the goods can be cleared. Of course, this delays the ship and delays the unloading of the cargo or its removal from the port. When honourable members opposite and others criticise, they never mention this endless paper chase. It is always the poor old wharfie who gets the blame and, time and time again, it has absolutely nothing to do with the Waterside Workers Federation. </PARA>
<PARA>  I noted that the honourable member for Gilmore said that Senator Collins had been exaggerating in his claims about reform on the waterfront. He said that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) had exaggerated a bit as well. They have no monopoly on exaggeration. Many on this side would claim that the honourable member for Gilmore has been known to exaggerate a little in his claims about what has not happened on the waterfront. </PARA>

If one wanted an example of this exaggeration, as I mentioned in the chamber the other night, one need only look at a disgraceful article in the October issue of the Reader's Digest. There was a similar article, I think in the Canberra Times, on Tuesday or Wednesday of this week. Again, as with our experts, we are very selective when we blame people for exaggeration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  We should not overlook that good old industrial relations term `the deliberately engendered dispute'. I have received a lot of evidence about deliberate delays on the wharf--not caused by the wharfies, but by businesses. I relate this to what the honourable member for Gilmore said about costs when there are delays on the waterfront. We all know that there are costs when there are delays on the waterfront. But businesses often delay for their own reasons. Again, who inevitably gets the blame but the wharfies?</PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Gilmore spoke about costs imposed on shippers. We hear a lot about this and we hear a lot about, say, the subject of demurrage. It is quite evident that at times consignors or consignees will choose to leave their containers at a terminal or depot because it suits their business requirements. Commercial interests, we are told, are supreme, irrespective of the demurrage charge applying. </PARA>
<PARA>  One example I was recently given in Adelaide was that of a refrigerated container with cargo that had come in from Europe. The shipping line wanted to turn that refrigerated container around because it needed it--and we always have a problem in Australia with getting empty containers. The shipping line wanted to use this container rather than have to ship an empty box across from some other part of Australia. The demurrage for that container started off at $25 a day. This was after the third day because, as we know, the first three days are free. It was then escalated to $75 a day because the shipping line wanted it moved. The cargo remained there in that refrigerated container, not because the documentation was lost but because a particular client, a particular business, had a need to leave it there and it was cheaper for it to pay $75 a day demurrage to leave it at the waterfront. But again, who gets the blame?  Again, it is the wharfie. This incident had absolutely nothing to do with the wharfies, and this sort of nonsense is repeated time and time again. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another interesting point about the changes relating to demurrage is that, for example, it is a common practice, as I have said, for a depot to apply a daily charge to the shipping line for boxes that are held after a three-day period. When these charges are then passed on to the shipper, the consignor or consignee, they are considerably increased. This does not show in the invoice that the shipper receives for the goods, so profits can be significantly increased by delays. If, rather than a dollar value, we use a unit ranging from one to 25, a shipping line can be charged one to leave the cargo there but it may be recovering, say, 25. This is passed on and, of course, again, the waterside workers always get the blame. </PARA>
<PARA>  The legislation before the House gives effect to major changes to Australia's marine cargo liability regime. It will update Australia's maritime cargo liability regime to take account of international developments since 1924. Now that we have taken care of the cargo, perhaps we can turn our attention to saving the lives of seafarers who go to sea in some of the rust buckets that too often visit our shores. I commend the legislation to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Mr Deputy Speaker, you might be surprised that, before my speech is over, I will have some words of agreement with the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), but I wish to take this opportunity to make some remarks of a broader nature relative to the carriage of goods by sea. In opening, I would like to draw people's attention to some of the comments made by the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp), which seem to be infinitely sensible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Goods are carried by various means. For many years, I had substantial amounts of goods carried by road transport, sometimes in other persons' vehicles and often in my own. But I always preferred to have the right to insure my own goods for the simple reason that, firstly, I knew they were insured and, secondly, I had the choice. Today, I run a substantial breeding stud of racehorses and, except for the valuable stallion with the unusual name of O'Connor, I do not insure any of those animals. In fact, I have come to the conclusion I either insure the lot or I insure none--and I insure none. But the point I make is that that is my choice. If one of those horses dies, I do not have anybody to claim on. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would imagine that, were I shipping containers of goods from Europe or somewhere else, I would be much happier about having insured the contents of one of those shipments myself and I would deal with a reputable firm whose financial credentials I would have established rather than have some owner of a rust bucket, as the honourable member for Throsby called it, act on my behalf, because, unfortunately, if his rust bucket sinks, it might be his only asset and, if he has forgotten to make the appropriate arrangements with Lloyds or someone of repute, I am going to have difficulty resurrecting his rust bucket. </PARA>
<PARA>  So, in simple terms, it appears the old fashioned way is the best, and I would be concerned if we had this piece of legislation visited upon us in three years time because someone forgot we had it. I remind the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) that these sorts of things happen. In Victoria some years ago, it was decided to put sunset clauses on all regulations. There was due notice given to all the government departments and a process was put in place of writing out of the statute books all the old regulations so that on a certain day they literally expired and, consequently, all government departments in Victoria had to come up with new ones or reinstate the old. It was singularly successful, with only one group forgetting to get its regulations in place--and that was the Supreme Court of Victoria. But, hopefully, in three years time the Minister will not have forgotten that we have this bit of legislation, as the honourable member for Gilmore has suggested he might, and that it is visited upon us when in fact we may not want it. </PARA>
<PARA>  The reason for my entering the debate is to talk about rust buckets and to talk about the marine environment and the massive resources of our marine environment and how they may be particularly affected by the activities of larger ships at sea. You, Mr Deputy Speaker, in your speech of a moment ago, mentioned the oil tanker that broke apart off the Western Australian coast. It was a ship called the Kirki. It lost its bow. It had a very large cargo of light crude aboard and, at the time of its losing its bow, as I recollect, it was some 60 kilometres of the Western Australian coast and almost within the lobster province of Western Australia--all of which I happen to represent. </PARA>
<PARA>  At that time, there was gigantic concern as to the long term dangers that were being presented to that industry--an industry of substantial economic value to Australia, particularly in times when demand for many of our commodities is very low. For days, the people in my office were on the phone contacting the fishing people and the local authorities in that area--for what reason I am not really sure, because we were desperately hoping everything, as it turned out, would be okay. As members of parliament we were powerless, and all the fishing folk and others felt powerless too. A disaster sat there and little by little we got around it. Admittedly, during the process, there were times when one wondered who was in control of the situation, but eventually it was all right. </PARA>
<PARA>  During those conversations, I spoke with a very responsible crayfisherman of the area, Gary Snook, who is also the Shire President of the Dandaragan Shire, and we talked about the condition of this ship. He said that certain fishermen had managed to get on board at one stage and had got hold of a piece of deck plate which was one-eighth of an inch thick. He informs me--and I believe he would know--that when that ship was constructed, the plate would have been in excess of half an inch thick. As with our modern motor cars, large ships today have integral construction. They are not built as the old wooden ships were with ribs and a framework to which planks were attached. Every part of a modern ship is part of its integral strength. Once the deck plates had rusted down to that thickness, clearly the ship was not viable to operate in anything other than a millpond. On this particular journey it had confronted some very rough seas. </PARA>
<PARA>  The other matter of concern to me is that when one considers the straight line from its port of loading to Fremantle, one wonders what it was doing a couple of hundred kilometres north of Perth and within 60 kilometres of the coast. It certainly was not travelling in a straight line. There are arguments that there are some tidal movements in those areas which ships masters try to utilise; in other words, they come in and try to pick up the tide. They do not take a direct line course, but they gain some speed and fuel economies by picking up those tides. I do not know whether that is significant to warrant that particular course. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are other suggestions that some use those particular courses and go down into those crayfishing areas so they can drop off contraband to be picked up by some of the smaller ships--the fishing boats. I do not know whether that is true, but I know that it is not worth the risk having them--rust buckets or better--that close to such a hugh resource of export income for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  Amongst other things, I ask the Government to consider whether it is time, considering the massive damage we know can be done, to have proscribed areas where, unless there is good economic reason, very large ships carrying environmentally unfriendly cargoes do not operate. There is another aspect to all this because my fishermen in these areas tell me of the massive hazards many of these ships represent to their lives. They say that these ships are not crewed as they travel; they bung them on auto pilot, and away they go--20,000, 30,000, 50,000 or 100,000 tonnes of ship steaming through the night with everybody on board asleep. </PARA>
<PARA>  My crayfishermen, who operate to distances sometimes 100 kilometres off shore--they do not commute backwards and forwards each day--tell me that while they are out there they cannot sleep. They would not dare anchor for fear of being run over because these ships operate in these areas without anybody on watch, putting the crayfishermen in extreme danger. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is interesting to note that, just outside my electorate, the Sanko Harvest also ran onto a reef in recent times. Maybe it was not a rust bucket. It was very poorly crewed because the master apparently took a channel which he was ill-advised to be sailing in. He ended up putting his shipload of fertiliser on a reef. Eventually the bunker crude on that ship became a major environmental hazard. On this occasion, the activities of those charged with cleaning up the mess and protecting the beaches around the Esperance area also came under some criticism from locals. It is worth putting that on record. </PARA>
<PARA>  For a start, this happens to be a bit endemic. If there is a problem of this nature and there is public exposure, then the people involved make sure that they get the best. So they had a helicopter flying around at hundreds of dollars an hour trying to spread dispersant on the water, which I understand it did very ineffectively. Yet in that area there are literally dozens of fishing boats, and literally thousands of spraying rigs on the properties of farmers which would have done the job better and cheaper. It is a great pity that on so many of these occasions these facilities are not used. </PARA>
<PARA>  I argued about this many years ago on the far north-west coast of Western Australia. When we put together some of these various civil defence organisations, they started sending us four-wheel drives and aluminium dinghies with two outboards on the back--when the north-west was full of four-wheel drives, and of course we had a substantial fishing industry with boats large and small. I might add that the original boat came up with only one outboard and the local civil defence officer immediately lodged an argument for a second one because it was unsafe to go fishing in the damn thing with only one engine on it. </PARA>
<PARA>  The point is that, amongst our responsibilities to civil defence and environmental defence, we should have a list of what is locally available. Why should we not know whether there are plenty of four-wheel drives in the district and plenty of small boats? Before we had all this Government assistance, I experienced a major flood in Carnarvon--in the north-west. I became part of the local civil defence organisation because there were only about 50 of us left in the town; the rest had been evacuated. Our first job was to steal a dinghy and an old, tiny, black outboard--a Penguin. We found that we could not drive that against the tide in the river, so we had four blokes paddling. We managed to get out--I do not know whether `rescued' is the proper word--and supplied food to the people who were stranded on their properties. We all did that and thought it was a lot of fun. Later on, we were able to get beer for the town to about three or four miles away, and we used the same boat to get a bit into town because we were out of that as well. The point I am making is that we used the local resources. </PARA>
<PARA>  When the Sanko Harvest was creating environmental problems on the south coast close to my electorate, before someone went to the expense of hiring a reasonably ineffective helicopter, he should have looked at some of the more local facilities available, which I think would have done a better job. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are a couple of things I want to talk about, but let us get back to the rust buckets. Mr Deputy Speaker, you said that you have inspected them. I have not, but I rely on the advice of the people who I represent and their skills as fishermen, et cetera. I am also reminded--one does not read about it much in the papers these days--that in years gone by we had an adequate inspection service of seagoing ships in Australia. We always seem to read about how they have gone on board and managed to knock a couple of holes in a lifeboat. I do not say that should not be done and, Mr Deputy Speaker, you have made the point, quite properly, that protection of lives at sea is as important as anything else. </PARA>
<PARA>  On the other hand, surely it is time that Australia inspected the ships that visit our country. It is pretty easy to establish their age. I would imagine that with an ordinary battery drill we could soon find out whether the deck plate was only one-eighth of an inch thick. My recollection of the old inspection service--Mr Deputy Speaker, no doubt you would spring to its defence--is that it was seen more as a means of gaining work for the painters and dockers than the proper protection of the public and, if you like, the environment. That is a pity. I think that brings discredit upon a necessary service. </PARA>
<PARA>  Consequently, I would suggest that if boats come to this shore and are demonstrated to be structurally unsound, they should be unloaded and not tied up. They should not be allowed to reload and should be told to leave our country. It should be made clear that if they ever come again they will not be unloaded. I guess that this happened a lot before we stopped the inspection service. Over time I think the message would get out amongst shipowners that it is unwise to send this type of ship to Australia. Added to that, there should be some proscribed sensitive areas. That is a point that we should consider. </PARA>
<PARA>  Generally, we should make it clear to the international shipping community that Australia is not going to be the recipient of rust buckets for all the reasons I have given. I guess that might be reflected in the freight rates we are charged and we would have to do something about that. I reject the argument, nevertheless, that the removal of cabotage should be associated with the treatment of these boats. I believe that we can have highly competitive international ships sailing around Australia that are not rust buckets. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have to look at the industry overall. The Minister wanted to mount a case for the waterfront and the waterside workers. I think that they do contribute to the problems we have in shipping from Australia. I think that the principal problem is not that they are particularly nasty but that they have a monopoly over the labour component of the wharf. I think we should be mature enough to know that no monopoly gives good service. The simple solution to the waterfront is to tell the wharfies to stay around, start a few more companies, as they have in Queensland, and get into business themselves--I would welcome it--and compete with other people who want to give service on the wharf. </PARA>
<PARA>  Recently in my electorate we had a very large mobile container crane; I think it would lift 250 tonnes. It could be driven up and down the wharf. Why cannot some group own one of those cranes and offer a service anywhere along the waterfront where it can operate competitively? Why does it need to have a member of the waterfront union to do the job? I cannot see why. It does not make any sense to me, and I am not sure that it is in the financial interests of the wharfies. Although there would be fewer of them, they could do what those who have incorporated themselves up in northern Queensland are doing. They are doing famously. Probably the first thing they did was sack a few of their mates. I do not know, but I bet they are efficient if they are paying the wages. That is human nature at work. I am a big believer in that. </PARA>
<PARA>  We also have to recognise something else. The new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean)--I worry a little bit about him--has a background in the labour movement. His solution for primary industry is value added. All that primary industry is interested in is a little bit of value. We are told that the harvesting and distribution costs for a bale of wool today are $320 and it is selling for $500. That does not leave much for the wool grower. We, as legislators, have a substantial responsibility to see that those are costs reduced, if only to keep one of our major export products competitive. </PARA>
<PARA>  Every time I think about value added, I think the simplest form of value added is to ship goods from Australia--be they bulk cargo or containers--in our own ships. That is value added. What is the invisible cost to our current account of freight paid to foreign countries? Why are we not in the business? Okay, we would have to compete with rust buckets. But we are also very silly about the way we try to run shipping. We have this rather stupid belief that because we go to sea in a ship, we only work six weeks on and six weeks off. If, however, we are sent to some remote area of Australia working for the Government, we do not get that sort of privilege. But we are equally remote, and we never get the chance to visit foreign destinations. </PARA>
<PARA>  I used to sit next to these seamen when they also had the right to travel first class. They would tell me about their couple of cray boats and how they were anxious to get back into business. I used to see them in Carnarvon working on prawn trawlers. They were not home cuddling up to mum in their spare time; they were out with a second job, probably taking it off some poor unemployed person who needed it. Why can we not design Australian ships that have accommodation that is like a flat? Why can we not take mum and the kids to sea, but work 11 months a year consequently?  It makes a lot of sense to me. As the kids start to grow up and go to school, we would make the sort of judgments that other people in remote areas do. Maybe they would be sent to boarding school; maybe mum would get a job on the boat as well, so that the family would be a two-income family. Why do we not think about these things?</PARA>
<PARA>  We surely should have a very large shipping industry in Australia. We are an island continent. We ship huge quantities of goods, and we throw that away as a form of value added. We have to do it competitively. We will not do it while we stick to a lot of the stupid rules we have. </PARA>
<PARA>  Nevertheless, I welcome this legislation. I hope that it is not forgotten in three years. I support the honourable member for Gilmore and his amendment. I trust that over time some of my remarks might sink in. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I welcome a number of the remarks made by the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey). This is a rare occasion, because I will try to help him support some of the arguments that are before us. Some of them I will reject, but others have considerable substance, and it is very welcome to hear them coming from the other side of the chamber after this long time. It is true that the standard of some ships arriving in Australia is low. The reality is that we inspect only 25 per cent of all foreign-flag ships that visit Australian ports. When I as Minister introduced that system, it was objected to strongly by shippers, their argument being that it would add to costs, it would deter ships from coming to Australia and it would increase freight costs. Therefore, the comments of the honourable member for O'Connor, coming from the constituents he represents, are very welcome. At least he now understands the overall picture.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Of the 25 per cent of foreign ships that were inspected in the past 12 months, 60 per cent had serious structural difficulties or deficiencies in lifesaving equipment. When there is a ship on which the lifeboat davits do not work or on which the crew does not know how to launch the lifeboat, or on which the lifeboat has no provisions or is itself not seaworthy, the lives of the crew are put at risk. Those on the other side of the chamber might grin and smile about it. But when the crew are out there in a force 7 gale and their ship is breaking up, it is a matter of some pertinence that they  know that their lifesaving equipment does work and that they have a chance to survive. </PARA>
<PARA>  The point made by the honourable member for O'Connor is absolutely right: we are a shipper nation, not a shipowning nation. Some 4 per cent of our cargo is carried in Australian-flag ships. The argument just put by the honourable member for O'Connor is an argument that I have put on many occasions, as have other supporters of Australian-flag shipping--that is, that use of competitive and efficient Australian-flag shipping is value adding; it is a legitimate downstream activity of the development and extraction of our primary resources. Every other country in the world takes a longer and a broader view. If we look at it from the purchaser's point of view, we should ask ourselves: why is it that 95 per cent of the iron ore purchased by Japan travels to Japan in ships controlled by the Japanese?  Those ships are not always cheaper; in many cases they carry cargoes at more expensive freight rates than Australian-flag ships do. When it comes to negotiation time, the buyer, with the control of the shipping, exerts a great degree of market muscle over the poor seller of primary resources in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  History shows that in the past, particularly in the north west of Australia, as the time came around for negotiation of iron ore prices, by some quirk of fate ships were late arriving, iron ore stockpiles built up, the cash flow of the iron ore companies slowed down, but miraculously, once the iron ore rates were negotiated, the ships all speeded up again and the stockpiles were cleared. That is because the buyers are smarter, more clever and look further down the line than do Australian exporters. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to hear more from the Opposition and more speeches like that from the honourable member for O'Connor, extolling the use of efficient and competitive Australian ships. He is not in the chamber now, but I mention to him that enormous progress has been made in improving the training, equipping and crewing of Australian vessels. We are now down to crewing levels--at this stage they are not a major factor in ship operation--comparable with those in the OECD countries. We are one of the first countries in the world with general purpose crewing, and we have abolished the class society on ships. We have done away with the white tablecloths, saloon and silver service--the class structure of the old ships. The suggestion that mums and dads go to sea is a very welcome one. We have several certificated female officers, such as female captains, on the Australian-flag ships. The idea of husbands and wives going to sea is already implemented fairly extensively around the world and ought to be encouraged all the more in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  I refer now to the Kirki. We have to go back to the source of the issue. It is not just about a ship arriving here in poor or almost unseaworthy condition. We have to look further back and ask:  why is this happening? It is because there are tax regimes or financial incentives in the countries of origin of those ships--not the country in which they are registered, but the country in which they are owned, where there are tax regimes that encourage the use of old ships. If we look at what has happened off the Australian coast in recent times, we are in the main looking at old ships--ships over 15 years of age. </PARA>
<PARA>  Whilst the plate on the Kirki might have been more than half an inch thick at the time of manufacture, there was plate in the bow of that vessel that was one millimetre thick--not an eighth of an inch. There was one millimetre of steel on the bow of that vessel crashing into the seas in the heavy weather at the time that the bow fell off. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another point made by the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) concerned ships being on autopilot. Of course! In opposition we made that point repeatedly to members of the Fraser Government. We made the point time and time again that largely the flag of convenience vessels coming into this country--with the poverty freight rates that were available, and called for by the Opposition and by many exporters--were ships that could have one certificated officer on board, maybe two, with the rest of the crew being seagoing labourers. </PARA>
<PARA>  It was common practice at that time, and it probably still occurs now, that ships sail the night off the Australian coast with everybody on board sound asleep, the engine room on automatic and the bridge on autopilot. Sure, there should be someone up on the bridge, awake, but that does not always happen. It does happen that they are asleep. So the points made by the honourable member for O'Connor are valid ones. They are extremely important. But the irony of all of this is that we are not talking about this now because lives are being lost, but because of possible damage to the fishing grounds and our marine environment. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let me say something to the families of the seafarers who go down on those coffin ships. We are going back to the seventeenth, eighteenth or nineteenth century practices when vessels were sent to sea in an unseaworthy condition and the insurance collected. What do honourable members think Lloyds surveys all developed from? They developed from those malpractices and abuses, that effective murder of seafarers in centuries gone by. We are not far short of a return to those circumstances today. </PARA>
<PARA>  I might mention that, even though the Bill that is before the House picks up new provisions with regard to the liability of cargo damaged in sea transit, there is no requirement upon the ship operator to ensure that the vessel is in a seaworthy condition when it departs port. We are looking at who bears the liability and the level of liability, and under what circumstances, but there is no requirement that the ship's operator have a seaworthy ship. </PARA>
<PARA>  A lot of hypocrisy has been spoken around this country about the plight of seafarers and obtaining the best international freight rate we can. As the honourable member for O'Connor said, he does not want to see the use of those freight rates. He is prepared to see people pay more, have seaworthy vessels and not endanger lives or our marine environment. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Carriage of Goods by Sea Act is based on an international convention, as has been mentioned in earlier contributions, known as the Hague Rules. They came into effect in 1924. But the Act does not incorporate the two more recent international protocols which update the original Hague Rules. A carrier's liability under the original Hague Rules was limited to $A200 per package or unit, which could have been interpreted as meaning a total container. The 1968 Visby Protocol makes it clear that the term `package or unit' applies separately to each of the packages in the container. So we are increasing the level of liability. In addition, the liability limits incorporated in the original Hague Rules are based on the gold standard, which no longer exists. So we have updated that to SDRs, or special drawing rights, which are equivalent to about $A1.72 at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA>  The amended Hague Rules will cover the contracts of carriage evidenced by a bill of lading or similar document of title, including bills of lading issued pursuant to a charter party as provided for in the Hague Convention and its two protocols. In addition, parties to contracts evidenced by non-negotiable transport documents such as sea waybills can, on a voluntary basis, agree to apply the amended Hague Rules to their contracts. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Hamburg Rules apply to contracts of carriage by sea evidenced by documents, including bills of lading, issued pursuant to a charter party. I want to make a very important point. Mr Deputy Speaker, you are a member of this House's Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure and a member of the subcommittee inquiring into the efficiency and performance of the interface between seaports and land transport. You know, as do our colleagues on the Committee, that bills of lading--the paperwork, the paper trail--are, in many cases, a serious impediment to more efficient operation of the waterfront and to a lower cost delivery of goods from destination land-side to ship-side. </PARA>
<PARA>  Neither the amended Hague nor Hamburg rules will apply to electronic data interchange contracts--EDI contracts--as both regimes were designed to apply to paper based transactions. There are international problems and there are international discussions going on now. How does one deal with electronic bills of lading? This is fundamental. If we are going to move away from the paper based bill of lading, document of title or rendering of ownership of that cargo, we have to make provision for EDIs. I have said many times that what we are really dealing with is a system that derives from sailing ships, but it almost goes back further than sailing ships. </PARA>
<PARA>  The requirements for writing, especially in common law countries such as the United Kingdom and Australia, have their basis in legislation from the United Kingdom dating back to 1677 which was designed to guard against the peril of perjury. It should also be noted that the statutes prescribing writing did so for the purpose of defining the type of evidence a court would accept rather than prescribing a form for legal agreements. In other words, it was about having evidence of ownership and of title to the cargo in a form that the court would accept. Here we are today, 314 years later, sticking still to hard copy pieces of paper for passing ownership in an electronic age when we transmit information by satellite. We are sticking to that, and we are talking about progress. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would have welcomed from the Opposition greater reference to and support for the Hamburg Rules, and I will come to that in a moment. But what we are dealing with tonight does not recognise EDI. All members of the Committee know, and the industry knows, that we are not going to get the best out of the total journey from factory gate or farm gate to ultimate destination, or from ultimate origin to destination, unless we move with the times. Provision needs to be developed internationally and within this country for acceptance of electronic data interchange--or EDI--bills of lading. There are ways of doing that. The discussions are going on. I will not belabour that now; it is for another occasion. However, I make the important point that we think we are catching up. In the legislation that is before us, we are making a couple of short steps along the way. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I said, the amended Hague Rules or Hamburg Rules do not cover EDI. They deal only with paper based transactions. The process of updating Australia's marine cargo liability regime included consideration of both the amended Hague Rules and the Hamburg Rules. For a number of reasons it was decided that the most appropriate regime to meet Australia's need at this time is the amended Hague Rules. They have been in force for a considerable period of time and they are included in the legislation of many maritime trading nations. </PARA>
<PARA>  In comparison, the Hamburg regime is relatively new. It will come into force in 12 months. Up until a couple of weeks ago, it had only 19 countries. The twentieth country, Zambia, has now acceded to the Hamburg Rules and to the Hamburg Convention. That means that the Hamburg regime will come into operation 12 months from the date of accession. </PARA>
<PARA>  The point has been made that our major trading nations are not parties to the Hamburg convention. We understand that. The Government's position in respect of the Hamburg Rules has been made very clear. The Bill leaves consideration of the implementation of the Hamburg Rules to some future time by providing for the future proclamation of those parts of the Bill dealing with the Hamburg Rules which cannot be made before the Hamburg convention enters into force in respect of Australia--in other words, until the government of the day in Australia so decides. I like the remarks of the member for O'Connor, because he assumes that we will be the government in three years. I welcome that comment. It is great, and he is right. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-He is right. That act of accession, that decision of the Australian Government at that time, has to take place. There has to be recognition by the Australian Government of that decision before it will happen. The inclusion of the Hamburg Rules in the Bill is a recognition of the interests of Australian exporters. The Hamburg Rules benefit exporters to the detriment of shippers, but it will work itself out. It fascinates me that the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp), a member of the National Party, speaking on behalf of the Opposition, took the case of foreign shipping companies. He was arguing against the Hamburg Rules, raising a number of phoney excuses. What is he doing? He is grovelling to the foreign shipping companies who have fed off this country for centuries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The honourable member is turning his back on the exporters who will benefit from the Hamburg Rules when they come into operation in the major trading nations. To cut it right down, that is what it is about. The Hamburg Rules favour exporters to the detriment of shipping companies. I have no doubt that in time that will sort itself out. I simply make that point. It amazes me that we can have a member of the National Party arguing for foreign shipping companies against the interests of Australian exporters. </PARA>
<PARA>  We mentioned how such a small amount of our goods goes out in Australian flag ships. I want to say something about cost, insurance and freight and f.o.b. The work that has been done on what cargoes go out on a c.i.f. or f.o.b. basis is meagre; it is hard to find. But back as far as 1984, 25 per cent of Australian exports were being sold on a cost, insurance and freight basis; in other words, the exporter included in his price the cost of freight and insurance and had control. He selected the ships to carry it. He had control of the cargo from its origin to the ultimate destination. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I said in respect of iron ore: whoever has control of the cargo has a bit more muscle. Not nearly enough has been done in this country to pursue the c.i.f. basis of selling. It provides greater muscle to the seller, a profit can be made from managing the shipping requirements, quality control is generally directly in the hands of the exporter and there is greater ability to take advantage of spot markets. </PARA>

Other countries in the world do it, or are we saying that Australian exporters just are not good enough--it is all too complicated and it involves overseas organisation. That is really what is being said and that is really what we have hidden behind in this country. Here is an opportunity to get a better deal for Australia and to add to our invisibles.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The honourable member for O'Connor asks: what does it cost us? Shipping freight payable on exports in 1987-88 cost $4.4 billion; shipping freight payable on imports in 1987-88 cost $2.096 billion. The invisible credits for shipping freight in 1990-91 were $593m; the invisible debits for shipping freight in 1990-91 were $3,024m--a deficit of $2,431m. That is the cost of neglect and the cost of inaction, and that indicates the opportunities that are there. We do not want to get all of it, but we should be looking, as Australians and as competent Australian business people and exporters, to get a share of that business. </PARA>
<PARA>  I welcome this legislation; it is a step in the right direction. I hope that the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins), as I have mentioned in a notice of motion before this chamber to be debated on 14 November, will do something about stepping up the inspection rate of foreign vessels in this country and I hope we are going to see a great deal of support from the Opposition, as suggested by the honourable member for O'Connor, to achieve greater use of Australian ships. </PARA>
<PARA>  In my concluding seconds, I also want to mention the closure of the BHP shipping office in Newcastle, which was transferred to Melbourne. I want to recognise the wonderful work of BHP staff members over 70 years, from a peak fleet of 58 vessels to a current fleet of 19 vessels. Times and circumstances have changed, but Captain Iain Steverson and all his colleagues--men and women--at the BHP shipping office in Newcastle have done a wonderful job over those 70 years. They have been a great credit to the Australian shipping industry and to Australian industry generally. I wish them well in their careers. (Time expired)</PARA>

It is nice to hear him getting some praise--I do not know whether it is a good thing or not--from the Government side. The honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) also had some interesting things to say. The Minister at the table, the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), is a person I have known for many years and he also spends quite a bit of time by the sea; I know he has a deep interest in anything to do with the sea, but in this particular case it is the legislation before us.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>  The Carriage of Goods by Sea Bill 1991 provides an updated set of rules for the shipping industry regarding the responsibilities and liabilities of those who carry goods by sea and those who consign them. Each year approximately 70 million tonnes of cargo are discharged onto Australian wharves and approximately 300 million tonnes of cargo are loaded. With the advent of containerisation and other technological advances, defining legal responsibility and liability for goods damaged or lost in transit has become increasingly difficult, and the shippers of goods are finding it increasingly expensive to insure cargo for that area of responsibility and liability that is not clearly defined. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Bill seeks to overcome these insurance difficulties by incorporating the Hamburg Rules, a recent convention which will assist shippers in clarifying areas of liability. Such clarification is welcomed by shippers, as the carriage of goods by sea has some very real risks--risks which are not always recognised by the general public. </PARA>
<PARA>  Under the old convention, that is, the Hague-Visby Protocol, there was a small area of responsibility that clearly lay with the shipper, a small area of responsibility that lay with the carrier and a large area that had become very grey in its legal interpretation. Unlike the Hague-Visby convention, the Hamburg Rules apply to intrastate trade and liability and that is also extended to include time that the cargo is on the wharf. </PARA>
<PARA>  When the Hamburg Rules were originally drafted, all areas of difficultly appeared to be eliminated. However, as time goes on, their effectiveness does seem to be diminishing. This diminishing effect comes as a result of further, more recent technological advances in shipping methods--although there is no doubt they still represent an improvement over the older Hague-Visby Protocol. In addition to clarifying areas of responsibility, the Hamburg Rules represent a shift of responsibility. With the incorporation of the Hamburg Rules into this Bill, the shipper now has a smaller area of responsibility, the middle, grey area is slightly smaller and the carrier has a slightly larger area of responsibility. The increase in carrier responsibility comes largely as a result of legal clarification of some of that previously grey area and, of course, by virtue of increased responsibility for cargo held by the carrier on the wharf. </PARA>
<PARA>  Although the Hamburg Rules provide some distinct advantages over the Hague-Visby Protocol, a major weakness in this Bill is that the international acceptance of the Hamburg Rules is still very limited and, until support increases, shippers may see little in the way of benefit from reduced insurance costs. At present, only 19 of the requisite 20 signatories have accepted it. There are few significant maritime nations represented among that 19 signatories. I believe the twentieth has signed?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WJ4">Mr WEBSTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-That is pleasing to hear. The Minister, in his second reading speech, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the inclusion of the Hamburg Rules in the Bill is a signal that Australia intends to accept this convention when its international standing is such that it can demonstrably provide a viable basis for new cargo liability arrangements for international seaborne trade between Australia and its trading partners. As long as the Hamburg Rules have not come into force internationally, it is inappropriate to seek a proclamation. </PARA>
<PARA>It is indeed wise to withhold proclamation. However, the open-ended nature of this future proclamation did concern me, so I am pleased that recent amendments to the legislation lock us into reviewing the situation in three years. Without this provision the legislation could have ended up lying in the bottom of a drawer indefinitely. </PARA>
<PARA>  Such a review will afford us the opportunity of, firstly, reassessing the international acceptance of the Hamburg Rules; secondly, assessing the effectiveness of the Hamburg Rules in the light of technological changes; and, thirdly, consulting with a broad range of industry representatives. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am delighted with the lead Australia appears to be taking in improving international shipping standards. This Bill is certainly a move in the right direction. I am also delighted with the lead that Australia is taking in maritime environmental responsibility and safety standards. An article that appeared in the Sunday Age on 28 July 1991 highlighted the work presently being carried out by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority in its inspection of shipping in Australian waters for seaworthy defects. According to the article, approximately 2,500 foreign ships use Australian ports each year. In the first six months of this year 178 of 315 foreign ships inspected were found to have defects. This is very interesting, especially in the light of the environmental tragedy caused by the Greek oil tanker Kirki when 15,000 tonnes of its 85,000-tonne cargo spilt into the sea. </PARA>
<PARA>  I was pleased to read in the Senate Hansard of the debate on this Bill that there was considerable recognition by honourable senators of the tragic loss of human life through shipping accidents. The most alarming aspect in this regard is that ships are putting to sea without adequate lifesaving equipment. Senator Collins, in his contribution to the debate, drew senators' attention to the fact that hundreds of seamen have lost their lives in shipping accidents in the past two years--a fact that can be so easily overlooked. Largely, the loss of life has been due to inadequate safety precautions. I was pleased also that the senator indicated that, once the report on the Kirki incident is finalised, the matter of shipping safety will be brought before the Parliament for further consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>  Should future Treasury finances permit, I would like to see Australia's efforts in policing the safety requirements of ships in Australian waters stepped up. It would be very encouraging if, on relative scale, we could match the efforts of the United States authorities. Although I realise that this is not possible at the moment, I do want to place on record my appreciation of the work currently undertaken by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. </PARA>
<PARA>  As the Deputy Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, I am also interested in Australia's lead in maritime environmental issues. In many ways this is tied in with the effects of this Bill. It is staggering to note that during 1989 there was a total of 177 oil pollution incidents in Australian waters--although it is encouraging to see that worldwide the incidence of oil spillage is decreasing. No doubt this decrease is as a result of a combination of a greater awareness of environmental issues by the international community and the good work of the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, known as MARPOL. </PARA>
<PARA>  MARPOL deals with a number of different pollutants including oil, noxious liquid substances, harmful substances carried in package form, sewage and garbage. However, in our case one of the greatest threats to the Australian coastal environment comes by way of the discharge of ballast water. Some 58 million tonnes of ballast water discharged into Australian waters has its origin in other parts of the world. Most of this water is discharged from bulk carriers. When ballast water is pumped into the ships, any sediment it contains is also pumped in, together with organisms present in the water and sediment. </PARA>
<PARA>  Organisms found in ballast water include live fish, crustaceans, molluscs, polychaete worms, arrowworms, coelenterates, toxic and non-toxic dinoflagellates, bacteria and a host of micro-organisms, to name just a few. There are at least 14 established species known, with reasonable certainty, to have arrived in Australia in ballast water. The impact of exotic species upon human health, commercial fishing--including marine aquaculture--and the natural environment cannot be underestimated. Unfortunately, large quantities of ballast water are discharged close to marine aquaculture areas; therefore, the risks associated with the discharge of ballast water in Australia are significant and the scientific task of controlling introductions is quite daunting. The coastal areas most under threat from discharge are those areas around Abbot Point, Gladstone, Newcastle, Sydney, Port Kembla, Fremantle, Dampier and Port Headland. </PARA>
<PARA>  In view of these facts, I was greatly encouraged to read a press release by the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) concerning moves by the International Maritime Organisation to introduce a system of voluntary guidelines over the discharge of ships' ballast water, based largely on the system introduced in Australia in February last year. These guidelines were introduced by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service as voluntary measures in response to investigations undertaken in Tasmanian waters. </PARA>
<PARA>  The guidelines give shipping companies a range of options to avoid the uptake and discharge of ballast water and sediment that may contain exotic organisms. These guidelines include reballasting at sea, not discharging ballast in Australian waters and taking on ballast in agreed clean ports. Australia, along with Canada, is leading the world in this area and, as I mentioned before, it is through the Australian guidelines that the international maritime community is now taking a greater responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have spent some time drawing honourable members' attention to these areas to highlight the most positive contribution Australia can make in developing internationally acceptable attitudes and procedures. Although the Hamburg Rules are not widely accepted in the international community, it is important that Australia promote those conventions that it believes will ultimately benefit the international community. </PARA>
<PARA>  Our task, once this Bill is passed, is to keep abreast of trends and developments that take place in maritime shipping--changes that will have a bearing on the effectiveness or otherwise of the Hamburg Rules. Therefore, as I mentioned earlier in this speech, it is important that the legislation be reviewed regularly to enable it to remain flexible enough to accommodate changing circumstances. I have much pleasure in supporting the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-in reply--I do not want to take a lot of time in responding to the debate, except to indicate our appreciation for the contributions that have been made by the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp), who led for the Opposition in responding to this legislation, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) and the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  As the honourable member for Gilmore observed to me a short time ago, the debate has been wide-ranging and clearly honourable members have taken the opportunity to raise a number of issues of concern to them. I was interested, and pleased, to see the tendency of members to concentrate on the importance of safe shipping and safe ships for the crews. Whilst the ships are of enormous importance in moving freight around the world, particularly for major commercial nations like Australia, the bottom line, of course, is the safety with which those men and women who serve on ships are able to carry out their responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of particular concern to the Government is the amendment which will be moved by the Opposition. I am sure it does not come as any surprise to the Opposition that the Government will not be endorsing or supporting the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The honourable member would have been more disappointed, I know, because of his interest and concern regarding these matters, had the Government supported the Opposition. I am absolutely convinced that the honourable member sitting at the table would not personally support this proposition. If he has been locked into supporting it as a result of an Opposition decision, that is perfectly appropriate, but I will emphasise the reason that proposal is not appropriate. This point was taken up, of course, by the honourable member for Shortland, who has an enormous depth of understanding of transport issues.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr ROBERT BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-No. The honourable member for Shortland, as we all know, is fulfilling an extremely important function as Chairman of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. He emphasised that the amendment being moved by the Opposition quite clearly has been inspired by overseas shipping companies because it is really the shipping companies which would support that proposition. The honourable member for Shortland indicated that only 4 per cent of our exports are carried on Australian flagged vessels, so any legislation which is supportive of shipping companies necessarily is supportive of overseas shipping companies. I do not say that by way of any prejudice against overseas shipping companies. They are perfectly legitimate, of course, and they are extremely important so far as Australia is concerned. But it does benefit them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Why, then, would the Opposition seek to ingratiate itself with overseas shipping companies at the expense of our shippers?  It is at the expense of our shippers because our shippers have clearly indicated their support for this legislation and for the proposal that we have that if, at the end of that three-year period, the legislation has not been proclaimed it will automatically come into effect. With its amendment the Opposition seeks to ensure that, at the end of that three-year period, if it is not proclaimed it will be repealed. </PARA>
<PARA>  But the Opposition says that it supports the legislation. That is incongruous. It is contradictory. The honourable member for Gilmore knows it is really quite an absurd position for the Opposition to adopt. We do not support that view; I do not believe honourable members opposite support it. They are simply seeking, for whatever reasons, to ingratiate themselves with overseas shipping companies and at the same time--and this is the danger that they run--to indicate some lack of adequate concern for Australian shippers. </PARA>
<PARA>  There was a suggestion made that few of Australia's trading partners at this stage have indicated their accession to the Hamburg Rules. But the number increases all the time. The last one mentioned, the twentieth country, was Zambia. It provided the trigger for the Hamburg Rules to come into effect 12 months hence--in November 1992. But there are other countries as well. Some of the most recent countries which have indicated that they are considering acceding to the Hamburg Rules once they are in force in November 1992 include Italy, Switzerland, France and Czechoslovakia. This legislation clearly indicates Australia's willingness to accede to those rules as soon as it has been indicated to us that a sufficient number of Australia's trading partners have done so. There is no question that that will occur. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are a couple of other points that I want to make mention of. The Opposition, as I say, has suggested that somehow the Government itself has convinced the shippers--and, of course, the shippers principally are our exporters--of the benefits of the Hamburg Rules. On the contrary: during the review of the cargo liability legislation, and ever since, shippers have strongly pressed the Government for early adoption of the Hamburg Rules. In many ways this legislation now responds to the needs of shippers as perceived and argued by the shippers themselves. Our contact with shippers indicates that they are even more committed to the Hamburg Rules than they have ever been. </PARA>
<PARA>  I emphasise to the honourable member for Gilmore that that does indicate an incongruity between the position adopted by the Opposition and the declared position, the preferred position, of our shippers--not the overseas shipping companies but of our shippers, our exporters. Consultations have been held between Commonwealth officers and organisations representing shippers, carriers and the legal profession. Carriers and the legal profession raised concerns about the 1990 Bill. Those concerns have now been resolved in the 1991 revised Bill and there is broad industry support for the way in which the replacement Bill has been drafted. </PARA>
<PARA>  I also want to emphasise that shippers argue that the Hamburg Rules are more equitable than the amended Hague Rules. They transfer the burden of liability from the shipper to the shipowner while the shipowner has care of the cargo, and they increase the liability limits. Quite clearly, then, shippers would find it in their interests to support this legislation, and they have done so. In fact, to a very large extent, the legislation responds to the concerns of Australian shippers. </PARA>
<PARA>  If this Government has to make a judgment about whether or not our preference will lie with overseas shipping companies or with Australian shippers, with Australian exporters--and that means Australian industries, Australian employees, Australian income earners, Australian business men and women; the interests of Australia as a nation--there is no doubt about which side we will come down on. That is the side we have come down on, at the same time recognising and respecting the legitimate rights of overseas shipping companies which, in so many different ways and with some reservations, have served Australia's overseas trade so well. But we come down on the side of Australia and Australians. I would appeal to the Opposition to do the same. </PARA>

<PARA>I wish to commence, as did the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) in his response just a few moments ago, by thanking honourable members who participated in the debate. They were, from our side, the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) and the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) and, on the other side, the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) and, of course, the Minister for Land Transport, who is at the table. </PARA>
<PARA>  Most of the speakers on this Bill tonight have taken the opportunity to speak on a wide range of issues relating to the maritime industries and, in particular, the issue of safety. It is a very important issue--one which I have spoken on and made statements about on previous occasions. I think all of us in this House--and it is evident from the speeches that we have had tonight--agree that there is a need for us to improve the safety standards on board ships that sail within Australian waters and into and from Australian ports. It is an issue involving human lives, the safety of our environment and the safety of the very precious cargoes that are transported at sea. So I think there is a universal feeling within this House of the need to upgrade the safety standards. The Opposition has stated on past occasions that, whenever reasonable proposals to achieve this end are put forward by the Government, we will give them wholehearted support. </PARA>
<PARA>  In response to the points made by the honourable member for Throsby, looking back over the years there have been initiatives taken by the Liberal and National parties when in Government. In fact, it was Ralph Hunt who, as Minister, introduced the inquiry chaired by Sir John Crawford in 1982 which represented, I think, one of the most important changes of direction for the Australian shipping industry. It has led to other inquiries, such as the MIDC, which has brought newer and safer ships onto Australian waters. I think we need to recognise the history, fairly recent though it may be, of attempts undertaken by the coalition Government back in 1982 and subsequently in 1985 by this Government to try to improve the age and safety standards of Australian ships. </PARA>
<PARA>  I also make the point that we have on past occasions drawn attention to the delays that occur on Australian wharves. It is not just the responsibility of the Waterside Workers Federation or the Seamen's Union. It is quite well known that for various reasons shippers use the wharves as a convenient warehouse or storage place. As the honourable member for Throsby has suggested, we do not blame the Waterside Workers Federation or the Seamen's Union for that. In fact, there will be very little criticism from me about the Seamen's Union. I have a tremendous amount of time and respect for its senior officers, people who I think are outstanding Australians. </PARA>
<PARA>  When talking about the issue of safety, we need to recognise that safety will not necessarily be enhanced by the maintenance of cabotage. Safety on Australia's waters and on international waters will be enhanced by multilateral negotiations between maritime nations around the world. I urge the Government to enter into more negotiation with other maritime nations to ensure that we can have safer shipping around the world, because over the last few years we have seen an extraordinary increase in the number of vessels disappearing and the number of lives lost at sea. This can really be solved only by getting all the maritime nations of the world together to have those multilateral negotiations to enforce proper standards. </PARA>
<PARA>  Even though Australia is a very small maritime nation, I think we are leading the way in professionalism. I am sure that the honourable member for Shortland, who has taken a great deal of interest in some of these areas, will agree that the Australian Maritime College is something that we can be proud of. It is probably the leading maritime college in the world. I think that professionalism manifests itself in the fact that Australian ships--which I have taken the opportunity to travel on--are some of the most professional sailing ships in the world today. </PARA>
<PARA>  I also wish to address the point that the honourable member for Shortland, and indeed the Minister, tried to make. The Opposition, in moving this amendment, is not kowtowing to the shipowners of the world; we are indeed expressing the very reasonable concerns held by no less an authority than the gentleman who was responsible for the creation of the Hamburg Rules. I quoted from his comments earlier tonight. That gentleman was Professor Rolf Herber. He was the chairman of the diplomatic conference at Hamburg which agreed to the conventions in 1978. Professor Herber highlights to us that the implementation of the Hamburg Rules is no guarantee that there will be cheaper insurance rates. He also draws to our attention the fact that, as a result of the Hamburg Rules being implemented in the way that it appears they may well be under this Government's proposals, the increased complexities that will occur in international shipping may indeed add to the cost of insurance for shippers and shipowners. In moving this amendment we are highlighting the concerns of no less an authority than the gentleman responsible for the creation of the Hamburg Rules himself. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are not kowtowing to the shipowners. I totally reject the statements made by the honourable member for Shortland and the Minister. Many of those shipowners are foreigners. The people that we believe we are representing in this House are the shippers. Australia is a shippers' nation, not a shipowners' nation. Whilst we are representing their best interests and taking into account the advice of the good Professor and of David Roylance--I referred to his article from the Daily Commercial News of just a few days ago--we believe that shippers may well be misled into believing that this legislation, when implemented, will provide them with large savings when they transport their goods on sea. It would appear that that is not going to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government has tried to suggest that we are opposing this legislation. Let me make it very clear what we are proposing to do. The Opposition supports the basic thrust of this legislation. We all recognise the benefits that should accrue from this legislation if our like-minded trading nations were to agree to it and implement the Hamburg Rules at a similar time. We recognise the merits of that. However, we are concerned that after the Government's changes we will see the legislation automatically implemented at the conclusion of three years, no matter what happens. We believe that that is wrong. We believe that the appropriate way to handle this is to have the legislation available to be implemented for three years and, if at the end of three years it has not been implemented, it should come back to the Parliament for reconsideration; if the Parliament wants to renew the legislation it can do so. If the Parliament chooses not to renew the legislation then it can choose not to renew it and allow it to lapse. </PARA>
<PARA>  That is the basic difference between the Opposition's position and the Government's position. It would seem to some that this is not a huge difference. In fact, it is not. But it is an important principle. We believe that if this amendment is not carried there is a risk involved that in three years time the legislation will automatically be implemented even if events have changed in such a way that its implementation disadvantages Australian shippers and, indeed, Australian shipowners. We believe that the Parliament should have priority consideration in these matters. It is for this reason that I have moved this amendment. If this legislation is not implemented in three years time, we want to see it come back to the Parliament for reconsideration, and the Parliament may then choose to do with it as it wishes. But we believe that the Parliament should have the right to make the decision in three years time. It is for that reason that I have moved the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I would like to pick up a few of the points made by the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp). When in opposition we had a bipartisan approach to the implementation of the Crawford recommendations when they were tabled in the chamber in February 1982. At that time we sought the cooperation of the then Government to establish port coordinating committees to improve the flow of cargo through Australian ports. Those representations went to the then Prime Minister and to the then Minister for Transport, Mr Hunt. Both rejected them; they wiped their hands of it. So we had bipartisan support for the Crawford recommendations. We built upon them and expanded them. That was the work of this Government. We would have welcomed a bipartisan approach to reform of the waterfront and the improvements there. That has not been forthcoming, but I will not dwell on that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I want to mention the comments of the honourable member for Gilmore about Australian credentials and the Australian Maritime College. Yes, Australian marine credentials are good credentials across the world. We give considerable assistance to our Pacific neighbours. Those credentials and skills that we train in are a product that we should be doing more to market elsewhere in the world. </PARA>
<PARA>  Turning to insurance rates, in 1985-86 the Australian insurance industry said that it was handling about $140m a year in insurance of cargoes. The reality is that the Australian insurance industry ought to have a much larger share of the business of insuring Australian cargoes, both inbound and outbound. There has not been sufficient effort by the Australian insurance industry. That also is a market that I sometimes think is too complex and difficult for Australian business people, or it is one in which the global insurance companies operating in this country are more comfortable; it suits their global objectives to have that insurance going offshore rather than developing the market here. That is something that this Parliament needs to look at. </PARA>
<PARA>  I reject the so-called complexity of the Hamburg Rules. No matter how my friend the honourable member for Gilmore might like to squirm about supporting foreign shipowners in preference to Australian shippers and Australian exporters, that is the fact. The effect of this amendment is to prefer foreign shipowners' interests to those of Australian exporters. Going back to some of the real complexities that are involved in handling Australian cargo supports--ancient bills of lading, and complex and intricate paperwork--would be far more effective than posturing through this amendment this evening and, in a way, betraying the interests of Australian exporters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-in reply--I make two observations. The first is in response to the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp), who  suggested that at the end of the three years it would be better that the legislation lapse rather than be proclaimed, as is provided for under the Government's legislation. It is a test of not only the Government's vigilance about legislation and provisions of this kind but the whole Parliament's. To imagine that the legislation would come into effect against the interests of the Parliament or the Government, I think, is stretching the imagination too far.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Let us assume that, as a result of whatever may be the circumstances, that were to happen. The Parliament and the Government are in charge of the business of government and it would be simple to introduce legislation to repeal the legislation which had come into effect. There is no question about that. The point that we emphasise again is that the purpose of the legislation is to ensure, at the end of the three years--in the absence of any deliberate decision by the Government to proclaim it--that the proclamation will take place automatically. In the Senate the Opposition was arguing that one of the reasons for its amendment was to encourage the proclamation of the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Yesterday the augmented Electoral Commission for South Australia reported on the objections that were put to it by the Electoral Committee for South Australia. As a result of that, changes are made to the River area and to an area concerning the electorate of Sturt, but no changes were proposed in response to the very significant objections and submissions that were made in relation to Boothby, Adelaide and Hindmarsh. Personally, as a result of that, I look forward to representing the now very different seat of Boothby which will be presented at the next Federal election for the electors to decide their representative. I must say that I welcome the op-portunity, if I am the preselected member for the Liberal Party at the next election, of representing the coastline which is a most attractive addition to the remnants of the old seat of Boothby.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Having said that I am personally looking forward to that representation, I must say to the House that the proposal endorsed by the augmented Electoral Commission is a deeply flawed proposal. I say that on the basis that the result of the objection and the Commission's response to it makes no difference to the electoral position I might look forward to in Boothby. The result in that regard is altered by no more than 0.2 per cent at the next election. I want to make that clear. </PARA>
<PARA>   However, I would like to read briefly to the House the record of inequality and the failure and defamation of democracy in relation to the results for the Liberal Party in South Australia over the last number of years. On the last seven occasions on which my Party has received a majority of votes in South Australia, it has received a majority of seats but once. In 1955, the two-party preferred result for my Party was 51 per cent of the votes and we received five out of the 11 seats. In 1958, we received 50.2 per cent of the votes and we got five out of 11 seats. In 1966, with the enormous vote for the Liberal and National Party coalition, we received 57.6 per cent of the votes and we got eight out of 11 of the seats. That was the last time we saw a majority of seats. In 1975, we got 55 per cent of the votes and we got half the seats. In 1977, we got 51.3 per cent of the votes and we got five out of 11 seats. In 1980, we got 50.4 per cent of the votes and we got five out of 11 seats. In 1990, we got 50.5 per cent of the votes and we got six out of 13 seats. The presentation of this report and its endorsement means, on the results of the last election of 50.5 per cent of the votes, that we will get 42 per cent of the seats. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is a miscarriage of justice in that, once again, in South Australia my Party will have to get far beyond half the votes to get half of the seats. The Commission has produced a flawed report which perpetuates a disgraceful situation. The report is very unprofessional. It has thrust aside the lengthy evidence put to it by my Party without any refutation. It has ignored the criteria and raced to one particular criterion--to reject evidence which was put before it which was rebutted by no other party, particularly the Labor Party. It was lengthy evidence, unrebutted, and the Committee thrust it aside. In Hindmarsh and part of Boothby, it has totally ignored the continuing community of interest on the coast. Yet it has gone to the river districts and made a large change to the detail of the Committee on the basis of community of interest. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Commission has produced a report which will make this Government very happy. Whether or not the Commission has been biased politically, it certainly appears to be biased politically. My district and the voters who have been thrust aside by this Commission's unfair report--(Time expired)</PARA>

<TITLE>Proposed Badgerys Creek Airport</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The cost of access to airports will have a major impact on the level of growth of air travel in this country. I want to draw attention to the massive misinformation campaign against development of Badgerys Creek by what in effect are vested commercial interests at Mascot. Badgerys Creek was always intended to be a supplementary domestic airport with the capacity to be developed as an international airport if and when that should be needed. In my view, that `if it were to be needed', based on current technology, would be some time in the twenty-first century.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  But Badgerys Creek would be to Mascot what Gatwick has been to Heathrow in the United Kingdom. Gatwick, in its role as a supplementary international airport, was pooh-hooed when it was built and when it was opened. But Gatwick developed and is now choked with traffic because it provides a low cost alternative to Heathrow. Badgerys Creek was to be to Mascot what Gatwick is to Heathrow in the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA>  The future growth in air travel will come from leisure and recreational travel. Where are the origins of those travellers?  They are in suburbia, in metropolitan Sydney. It is not traffic that will be originating from five star international hotels in downtown Sydney. It is not traffic that will be originating from the CBD of Sydney or traffic that is destined for the CBD of Sydney. To put an accurate dimension on projections, we need to carry out accurate origin and destination studies. </PARA>
<PARA>  If the American deregulation experience shows anything, the one thing that is indisputable is that people will accept a lower quality of air travel if the price is right. They will put up with inconvenience if the price is right. If there is a greater distance to travel, if people have to unpack their bags or be checked in on the footpath, they will put up with all of that. But we have to give them the choice, and we have never done that in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  Badgerys Creek is relatively cheap and curfew free. It is designed to serve the Sydney region--not, as the misinformation campaign suggests, solely the city of Sydney. The important factor in the growth of air travel that is occurring now and will continue to occur for the next four to five years is the centroid of demand. Where is the centre of demand of travel for those people? It is not in downtown Sydney. Again, we see the misinformation that surrounds the proposed development and expansion of Badgerys Creek. Badgerys Creek will open up a new market, and Mascot's commercial interests, with their high cost investments, obviously do not want a lower cost, accessible, curfew free airport less than one hour's drive away. Badgerys Creek will create jobs where they are needed--out in the western suburbs. It will generate industry and growth in that area, and it is where more and more people are going to be residing. </PARA>
<PARA>  For all the right reasons, Badgerys Creek is the last remaining suitable site for a domestic and international airport location. It will service the residential areas of Sydney. It is a supplementary airport for the Sydney region. The sooner Badgerys Creek is in service, the better. As I said, it will provide jobs where jobs are needed. Anybody who gets in on the ground floor in Badgerys Creek will make a killing further down the track. If honourable members doubt my word, I ask them to recall what happened with Tullamarine. I repeat that Badgerys Creek was intended to be a supplementary domestic airport, with the capacity to go international if and when needed, and to service the Sydney region. </PARA>
<PARA>  The deregulation of the airline system has brought air travel within the reach of millions of Australians--and so it should. Air travel is public transport; it is not glamour transport. There have been record numbers of air travellers in the past year, some 8 per cent increase on the previous record of 1988, which was boosted by being the year of Expo and the Bicentenary. We had an inflated record level of traffic in 1988, but we are 8 per cent up on that and we have not really started yet. As air travel is public transport, it ought to be available to as many Australians as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition's two-airline agreement denied 90 per cent of Australians the ability to travel and it produced for Australians a high quality service at a relatively high price. This Government will provide people with a choice of a less convenient form of travel, safe but at a lower price. As I said, the American experience has shown one thing: people will put up with inconvenience if the price is right. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It may come as a surprise to honourable members to note that the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), would be refused registration as a tax agent under the present interpretation of the Income Tax Assessment Act by the Tax Agents Board. No doubt many ordinary Australians, including the almost one million unemployed, would cheer if equal restraint had been shown about public finances. After all, it was the honourable member for Blaxland who showed such fiscal rectitude that only in one year of his treasurership was the total public sector account in the black. Overall, he presided over a total deficit of close to $70 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  But many people would be surprised to learn that the Commissioner of Taxation, the man responsible for the administration of our complex and archaic tax system, probably would not qualify as a tax agent either. Why? Because section 58CA of the Act, as interpreted by the Federal Court and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, requires a person to have been engaged in relevant employment on a full time basis for not less than a total of 12 months in the preceding five years in order to be registered. </PARA>
<PARA>  Consider the case of Chenouda v. Tax Agents Board of New South Wales, which was decided on 13 May this year. Mr Chenouda sought registration as a tax agent. The Board refused to register him because it was not satisfied that he had the prescribed academic and practical qualifications. He had the relevant academic qualifications--a Bachelor of Business degree from the New South Wales Institute of Technology. However, the Board formed the view that he did not have the prescribed practical experience. He would have had that experience only if he had been engaged in relevant employment on a full time basis for not less than a total of 12 months in the preceding five years. So far as he was concerned, this meant that he would have had to have been employed by a person or a partnership and must have had a substantial involvement in income tax matters, including the preparation of a broad range of income tax returns. His employment would have had to have been supervised employment. He did not have this experience. </PARA>
<PARA>  It did not matter that he had had over eight years experience in the Australian Tax Office and five years of employment as a tax manager in private industry. More recently, he had been employed as taxation manager of the Caltex Oil Australia Ltd group. Since Caltex is part of an international group, Chenouda had experience in a wide range of income tax matters. Although he had been responsible for the preparation of only one income tax return, the preparation of that return involved consideration of some 13 businesses on an international scale. </PARA>
<PARA>  He sought registration to allow his employer to benefit from the tax return lodgment extension arrangements available to tax agents. He said that many people also wanted him to prepare their personal income tax returns and he would do that on the weekends and in his spare time if he was registered. But the Board refused to register him. He sought a review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and it upheld the Board's decision. The Tribunal said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Board does not purport to examine general competence. It merely administers the Income Tax Act and Regulations. </PARA>
<PARA>A similar interpretation of the Act was given by Justice Pincus in the earlier case of the Tax Agents Board of Queensland v. Seymour. </PARA>
<PARA>  As one of my constituents has pointed out, even though he has been a qualified accountant for 32 years, the holder of an authorised dealer's licence approved by the Australian Securities Commission allowing him to advise people on how and where to invest their moneys, to advise on retirement benefit limits and how to structure their finances in accordance with taxation regulations, he could not be registered as a tax agent. As this effect of the legislation does not appear to have been contemplated when it was passed by Parliament, I ask the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) whether he would examine this matter. After all, either the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) or the current Treasurer (Mr Kerin) may well be in need of a job soon. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In 1950, just five years after the Allied victory in World War II, Australia suddenly became engaged in another great struggle for freedom. On 25 June of that year communist forces of North Korea launched a brutal attack against the free Republic of Korea. The invasion was condemned by the United Nations, and a United Nations command was formed to repel the aggressor. Soldiers, sailors and airmen of Australia, many of whom had seen active service during World War II, joined with those of 17 other nations in the conflict which would become known as the Korean War.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Australian forces saw active services in the United Nations operations in Korea from 1950 until 1953. The total number of Australian participants in the Korean War was as follows: Army, 5,087; Royal Australian Navy, 3,320; and Royal Australian Air Force, 1,241. As a result of the Korean War, 340 Australians died and 1,230 Australians were wounded. </PARA>
<PARA>  The actions of Australian service personnel serving in the Korean War were marked by many conspicuous acts of heroism. I place on record tonight the heroism of one Australian soldier in particular. Many years ago I served in the Citizen Military Forces, as it was then known, with Major Kevin Thomas, a former member of the 3rd Battalion, the Royal Australian Regiment. Corporal Thomas, as he then was, was a rifle section commander in A Company, 3rd Battalion. He was awarded a Military Medal for bravery during fierce action in the Songgok area east of Samichon River during early September 1952. His citation reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>  Corporal Thomas has been a rifle section commander in A Company, 3rd Battalion, The Royal Australian Regiment, for the past six months. Throughout this period he has demonstrated the highest qualities of a junior non-commissioned officer, both in command of his section as a leader of fighting and reconnaissance patrols. </PARA>
<PARA>  In particular he distinguished himself on the night of 3rd September 1952, as second in command of a fighting patrol of one officer and 15 men which successfully ambushed an enemy patrol about 40 strong. During this action, Corporal Thomas personally killed three of the enemy and his section a further nine. When the Officer Commanding the patrol was severely wounded, he took command and judging the object of the patrol to have been achieved, ordered its withdrawal to the patrol firm base positioned to the rear. </PARA>
<PARA>  He himself, having first organised the evacuation of the wounded, stayed behind with a small group to cover the move back. Shortly afterwards a determined attack on this rear guard was made by about 20 enemy, but under Corporal Thomas's leadership they were successfully fought off, at least two being killed. Under heavy enemy fire the rear guard then rejoined the firm base, Corporal Thomas carrying a member who had been severely wounded. </PARA>
<PARA>  Later when a further patrol was organised to go out and sweep the scene of action, Corporal Thomas volunteered and went out as its guide. </PARA>
<PARA>  His courage and determination during this action were an inspiration to the patrol and his outstanding leadership was a deciding factor in the success it achieved. The constant example of fearlessness and devotion to duty set by this non-commissioned officer has been responsible for the maintenance of the very high standard of morale and efficiency among his men. </PARA>
<PARA>Kevin Thomas and his wife, Margaret, now living in Townsville, returned to Korea in April 1991 and visited Pusan Cemetery, where Australian soldiers are buried. Kevin's recollections of the visit are particularly poignant. He had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>My wife Margaret and I visited the cemetery where I took a photograph of her standing next to the grave of her brother Keith Gardner. </PARA>
<PARA>He was killed during the action for which Kevin received his citation. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA>We were astounded by the young ages of the soldiers buried there. </PARA>
<PARA>  Keith was 19 years old. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are 43 other names of men who were my friends and comrades in arms from A Company, 3rd Battalion, The Royal Australian Regiment located in this cemetery. </PARA>
<PARA>  I remember their names but not their faces. </PARA>
<PARA>  I still ask myself the question "Why them and not me?</PARA>
<PARA>Kevin Thomas and his comrades in arms who served in Korea have left behind them an enduring legacy of selfless devotion to the highest ideals of mankind. I recall President Truman's words of salute to American troops in Korea; they apply no less to Australians who served there. His words were as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>You will go down in history as the first army to fight under a flag of a world organisation in the defence of human freedom. . .</PARA>
<PARA>Victory may be in your hands, but you are winning a greater thing than military victory, for you are vindicating the idea of freedom under international law. </PARA>
<PARA>I record the gratitude of this House to  Australian Korean War heroes and their fallen comrades. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Tonight I rise to bring to the notice of the House a press release put out by the NAFI expressing its disappointment in the resource security proposal. The thrust of the press release says quite clearly that this proposal relates to two propositions only, the pulp and paper industry in Tasmania and perhaps one in East Gippsland. The general thrust of its arguments says quite clearly that this proposal is nothing more than Clayton's security for the industry; it just will not happen and it is probably illegal, anyway. When we read part of this draft legislation, we see:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The agreement is legally binding, but the Commonwealth is not liable to pay damages for any breach. </PARA>
<PARA>What sort of security is that for the industry? None whatsoever. The answer is quite clear: the Government ought to take a serious look at how the industry works. We do not want security legislation that is project driven; it needs to be process driven and looking at the existing families and people who are working in that industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  Quite frankly, the answer is simple. We do not have to go through a nonsense of gobbledegook and another several years of overlooking and reviewing the industry. Quite clearly, the Heritage Act should stop being misused for land care and used for what it was intended. The Commonwealth could quite easily have had legislation which supports the 1986 Victorian timber industry strategy, which gave 15-years licences to the industry on a sustainable yield basis, thereby giving the industry security already. If the Commonwealth had gone down that path, the problem would have been resolved today instead of having the distrust in the industry that we have got right now. </PARA>
<PARA>  It seems to me that even in what the Government is proposing, it does not understand the term `integrated harvesting', whereby a section of timber is used for its best value. The high quality timber goes into veneers, furnishings and what have you. One step down from that we get housing, scantling and framing timber. We go one step further down and we get into pulp and paper industry, firewood and fencing posts. This is an integrated harvesting system which is saw log driven. To give security to a major project would not work in my part of the world and it is completely a nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA>  But when we look at this process one step further, we find that the Victorian National Parks Association has had a change of heart. It cannot be trusted to keep its own word. These intellectually barren greens have gone right back on their terminology. Let me quote what Mr Morley of the pulp and paper workers' division of the Australian Timber and Allied Industries Union had to say recently in the paper:</PARA>
<PARA>  Mr Morley described the move by the VNPA to change its Central Highlands policy as "a cynical exercise in bastardry given that the conservation movement's submissions on the creation of enlarged national parks in East Gippsland resulted in over 500 jobs being lost". </PARA>
<PARA>  "The greenies justified the draconian curtailment of the timber industry in East Gippsland and the `locking away' of forest resource resulting from the creation of the new alpine park by claiming that it supported the harvesting of the 1926 and 1939 ash regrowth forests in the Central Highlands. . . </PARA>
<PARA>The fact of the matter is that 66 per cent of the eucalyptus hardwood which is used in the pulp and paper industry in my electorate comes from this particular area. So I would say to those opposite right now: quite clearly the proposed security legislation is a nonsense. What security do the families that live in and rely on the timber industry in my elecorate have? None whatsoever. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G4">Mr Duffy</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) The Insurance and Superannuation Commission has advised that the total amount of premium income (ie total premium income minus reinsurance premiums and Government charges) reported by private and public general insurance companies balancing between 1 July 1989 and 30 June 1990 was $11.9 billion.</PARA>
<PARA>  Life insurance companies balancing in the same period reported total premium revenue of $18.5 billion.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) Some insurance consumers may face difficulties when involved in disputes with their insurers.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) Court action in respect of insurance disputes may be precluded for some consumers because of the expense involved, and substantial delays can be experienced with the court process in some states. However, the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs strongly refutes the suggestion that the courts lack independence from the industry. Disputes concerning general or life insurance may also be brought before Small Claims Courts or Tribunals in certain States and Territories, subject to monetary limits. The Minister is not aware of any specific criticism of the operations of the Small Claims Courts or Tribunals in respect of handling of insurance disputes.</PARA>
<PARA>  (4) The UK Insurance Ombudsman Bureau was established in 1981 by the UK insurance industry and is funded by the industry.</PARA>
<PARA>  (5) Yes, the banking industry has established an office of the Australian Banking Industry Ombudsman.</PARA>
<PARA>  (6) (a) The schemes were established by the insurance industry after extensive consultation with government bodies and consumer organisations, and are funded by the industry. However, the dispute resolution panels--the Complaints Review Committee in the case of life insurance complaints and the Claims Review Panel in the case of general insurance--are able to make independent judgements and their decision is binding on participating life insurance companies for amounts up to $250 000, and on participating general insurance companies for amounts up to $100 000, but not on the consumer, who retains the right to pursue other avenues of redress if he or she considers the Committee or Panel's decision to be unacceptable. The Committee and Panel each comprise a consumer representative, an industry representative and an independent chairperson. Their operation is oversighted by an independent Insurance Industry Complaints Council which comprises two insurance industry members, two members with experience in consumer affairs, and an independent chairperson appointed by the Federal Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs after consultation with the Insurance Council of Australia (ICA) and the Life Insurance Federation of Australia (LIFA).</PARA>
<PARA>  (b) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA>  (c) The effectiveness of the schemes will be assessed after twelve months of operation. The review of the schemes will be conducted by the Insurance Industry Complaints Council in consultation with the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs and the Treasurer, and will consider the views of the States and Territories. For the purposes of the initial twelve month trial period, the powers and jurisdiction are considered to be adequate.</PARA>
<PARA>  (d) Appointments to the Chairs of the Committee and Panel have only recently been made. It is too early to assess whether the dispute resolution procedures will prove to be too slow. The procedures contain provisions dealing with delays in the handling of complaints.</PARA>
<PARA>  (e) In general, the technical rules of natural justice only apply where the rights of a person are affected. Under the insurance schemes, consumers always have the option of having the dispute heard before a court. However, the schemes incorporate a number of features, including the consumer's right to present his or her case in writing and have it determined by a panel, designed to ensure procedural fairness in resolving disputes.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs does not believe that there is a need to change the insurance dispute resolution arrangements at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA>  (7) The Government does not believe it appropriate to consider establishment of a statutory office of Australian insurance ombudsman at this time. It believes there should be an opportunity to assess the effectiveness of operation of the dispute resolution schemes recently put in place by the insurance industry after consultation with government bodies and other interested parties.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) Yes, the appointment of the Plant Variety Rights Advisory Committee was announced by the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy on 21 September 1987. The appointment of the Advisory Committee was one of the first steps taken to implement the plant variety rights legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) Paragraph 45 (1)(d) of the PVR Act 1987 states:</PARA>
<PARA>  `one member who, in the opinion of the Minister, is an appropriate person to represent the interests of consumers, and likely consumers, of new plant varieties or of the products of new plant varieties'.</PARA>
<PARA>  The person who has represented consumer interests on the Plant Variety Rights Advisory Committee was a nominee of the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations.</PARA>
<PARA>  Consumers of new plant varieties or their products are organised into diverse interest groups. For example, consumers of grain from a new wheat variety are as diverse as animal feed manufacturers, feedlots, flour millers, bakers or the bread-consuming public. Each interest group that adds value to the product of a new variety is represented by its own (consumer) organisation with different interests in the new variety.</PARA>
<PARA>  The diversity of consumer groups and the need for equity has prompted me to review representation on the Plant Variety Rights Advisory Committee specified under paragraph 45 (1)(d) of the Act referred to by the honourable member.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) The current membership of the Plant Advisory Rights Advisory Committee is:</PARA>

<PARA>  The consumer representative, Mr Richard Arthur, resigned from the Advisory Committee and a new representative was nominated by the Federation of Australian Consumer Organisations. This organisation was advised by me to withhold their nomination until I called for nominations for a new Advisory Committee which was to be appointed shortly.</PARA>
<PARA>  All members of the PVRAC have been advised that nominations are to be called for membership of the Plant Variety Rights Advisory Committee under a new set of appointment guidelines.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee, including the consumer representative, last met on 13 February, 1991. All members were present except Dr John Leslie.</PARA>
<PARA>  I have developed a set of equitable appointment procedures for the PVR Advisory Committee since the Act does not make provision for this.

<PARA>  What is the comparison between (a) road and (b) rail freight rates for wheat in (i) New South Wales, (ii) Victoria, (iii) South Australia, (iv) Western Australia and (v) Queensland on (A) a basis of net tonne per kilometre, (B) average and (C) indicator rates.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr Crean</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Use of road freight for wheat is only significant in Western Australia and South Australia. The distance that wheat is transported varies considerably between these two States, with the longest freight distance in Western Australia some 300 percent longer than in South Australia. As a result, I consider the figures for road freight charges would not be suitable as the basis for a comparison of wheat freight rates across the States as sought by Mr Hawker.</PARA>
<PARA>  The charge on a net tonne per kilometre basis for rail freight varies according to the distance, generally decreasing as the distance increase. As well, the distance that wheat must be transported varies considerably between the States. I have therefore taken specific distances common across the States in order to illustrate the rail freight charges applicable.</PARA>
<PARA>  In 1990-91, rail freight charges, on a cents per net tonne per kilometre basis, were:</PARA>
<PARA>                                       250km          450km</PARA>
<PARA>New South Wales                         8.15           5.99</PARA>
<PARA>Victoria                                6.91           5.34</PARA>
<PARA>South Australia                         6.95           not applicable</PARA>
<PARA>Western Australia                       6.44           4.60</PARA>
<PARA>Queensland                              6.11           4.43</PARA>
<PARA>  The lowest rail freight charges in each State, on a cents per net tonne per kilometre basis, and the relevant transport distance, in 1990-91 were:</PARA>
<PARA>New South Wales      4.72 at 650km</PARA>
<PARA>Victoria             3.43 at 550km</PARA>
<PARA>South Australia      6.11 at 300km</PARA>
<PARA>Western Australia    4.60 at 450km</PARA>
<PARA>Queensland           4.43 at 450km</PARA>
<PARA>  The Australian Wheat Board deducts freight costs from growers based on the rate applicable to the silo at which the wheat is delivered. Estimated average freight deductions by State for the 1990-91 season are:</PARA>
<PARA>New South Wales           $27.68/t</PARA>
<PARA>Victoria                  $19.61/t</PARA>
<PARA>South Australia            $9.91/t</PARA>
<PARA>Western Australia         $14.34/t</PARA>
<PARA>Queensland                $17.94/t</PARA>
<PARA>  These freight deductions represent the average of all freight costs, whether road or rail, from delivery silo to export terminal (or domestic end user) for Australian Wheat Board pool wheat.</PARA>
<PARA>  In New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland these deductions are almost totally based on rail freight.</PARA>
<PARA>  However, a small proportion of Western Australian wheat, and a significant proportion of South Australian wheat, is moved by road from delivery silos. In these States, the average deduction therefore incorporates a component of road freight costs. These are not accounted for separately by the Australian Wheat Board and so individual average freight deductions for either road or rail cannot be readily determined.</PARA>
<PARA>  The average freight deduction of $9.91 per tonne in South Australia applies only to the tonnage delivered to country silos. However, in South Australia, because of the relatively short distances involved, a significant proportion of wheat is delivered direct to the terminals by growers rather than to country silos as occurs in other States. If calculated over the entire tonnage of wheat delivered, the average freight deduction would be $6.51 per tonne. In other States, direct grower deliveries to terminals are relatively low and so they do not significantly affect the calculated State average freight deductions.</PARA>
<PARA>  `Indicator rates' for wheat freight are either not applicable or not widely used in the wheat industry. Because of this, the Australian Wheat Board has developed distance interval comparisons which I have drawn upon to illustrate comparative  freight rates on the net tonne per kilometre basis.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr Crean</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) Yes. The letter referred to various forecasts of nuclear generating capacity in WOCA (world outside centrally planned economies areas) by the year 2000. These included forecasts by my Department (320 GWe), the OECD's Nuclear Energy Agency (327-337 GWe), NUKEM (329.3 GWe), the Uranium Institute (323 GWe), Greenpeace (310 GWe) and Friends of the Earth's own forecast (302-304 GWe).</PARA>
<PARA>  The forecast by Friends of the Earth was derived by excluding from NUKEM's forecast the nuclear capacity estimates for all reactors ordered or planned but not currently under construction, on the assumption that none of these reactors will be completed within the forecast period. While it is reasonable to expect that there could be approval problems and construction delays in a number of cases, the fact that approval and construction processes are currently continuing suggests that the validity of the Friends of the Earth forecast is questionable.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) No. If I required estimates of future uranium demand I would have regard to the full range of available estimates.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) The International Energy Agency (IEA) has forecast that nuclear energy's share of primary energy supply in OECD countries will increase from 10.1 per cent in 1989 to 10.3 per cent in 1995, and then decline to 10.2 per cent in 2000 and 10 per cent in 2005. The IEA expects primary energy supply in OECD countries to grow by an average of 1.3 per cent per annum during this period, including an expansion in the supply of nuclear power by an average of 1.2 per cent per annum. The IEA forecasts represent an expected increase in the supply of nuclear power from 410 million metric tons of oil equivalent in 1989 to a projected 495 million metric tons of oil equivalent in 2005. This underlines the fact that, while nuclear power's relative share of the total energy market is expected to remain fairly constant, the supply of energy from this source, in absolute terms, is expected to continue to grow.</PARA>
<PARA>  My Department has made no estimates with which to compare the IEA's forecasts of nuclear power's share of total primary energy supply in the OECD.</PARA>
<PARA>  (4) According to the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO), there are, world-wide, 5 reactors currently on order and not yet under construction. There are a further 58 reactors under construction (of which 44 are scheduled to commence operation before 1996) and there are 74 reactors in the planning stage but not yet ordered.</PARA>
<PARA>  Of the 5 reactors now on order, 2 are in Japan and 3 are in the Republic of Korea. All of these ordered reactors are scheduled to come on-line after 1995. The 2 in Japan are scheduled to enter into commercial operation in 1996 and 1997 and the 3 in the Republic of Korea in 1997, 1998 and 1999. The successful history of these countries' nuclear construction programs suggests that this timetable will largely be met.</PARA>
<PARA>  (5) ANSTO reports that there are currently 41 operating reactors in Japan, 11 reactors are under construction, 2 have been ordered and a further 13 are in the firm planning stage.</PARA>
<PARA>  (6) I assume that this question has been prompted by an article in Nucleonics Week of 9 May 1991 which reported the view of Moody's Investment Services Inc that `the antinuclear movement will continue to present a significant obstacle to MITI and the industry's ambitious plan to add 40 new nuclear power plants in Japan by 2010'.</PARA>
<PARA>  The same article noted that 66 per cent of the Japanese public think that nuclear power is necessary.</PARA>
<PARA>  A principal objective of Japanese energy planners is to meet Japan's projected increases in electricity demand without undue reliance on fossil fuels. The Japanese public's support for nuclear power is certainly not unqualified and public acceptance problems do exist. Nevertheless, there appears to be a sound appreciation by a majority of the Japanese public of the substantial role nuclear power plays in meeting Japan's growing energy requirements. On this basis, the likelihood that Japan will meet, or largely meet, its nuclear industry objectives over the next two decades cannot be dismissed.</PARA>
<PARA>  (7) To the extent that estimated uranium production costs for Koongarra and Jabiluka are available to the Government, these are provided on a commercial in confidence basis and cannot be disclosed.</PARA>
<PARA>  (8) The current spot price for uranium is approximately US$9.00 per pound. It should be noted, however, that all of Australia's uranium exports are currently being made under long term contracts and realise an average return substantially above the spot price level.</PARA>
<PARA>  (9) US$14.00 per pound (expressed in 1991 US dollars) is the forecast uranium (U(3)O(8)) spot price for 1996 published by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics in its December 1990 edition of Agriculture and Resource Quarterly. As with any forecast, this estimate will be revised, up or down as warranted, in line with any changes in expectations of future market conditions.</PARA>

<PARA>  (12) In 1990-91 the ABC television transmitted 2,725 hours of first run ABC produced programming. It transmitted 74 hours of other first run Australian produced programming (programs that had no ABC staff involvement at all in the program, except for the purchasing of it). The ABC's aim is to maintain these figures for 1991-92 and 1992-93.</PARA>
<PARA>  (13) No. The ABC will still produce approximately 40-50 per cent of its television programs in-house. A proportion of these will be co-production. While the people involved in the production of these programs are not confined to ABC staff, editorial control will remain in the hands of the ABC.</PARA>

<PARA>  In addition to the information provided in annual reports, my Department collected service utilisation data for family mediation from 1987-88 to 1990-91. However, it has proved to be prohibitively expensive to process the data into a useable form, and much of the information sought was subject to recorder bias.

<PARA>  (4) Organisations providing marriage counselling services are required to include statistics on service utilisation in their annual reports. However, there is no uniform method of recording this data and I am therefore unable to refer to this source to present a total and accurate account on marriage counselling services for the period in question.</PARA>
<PARA>  In addition to the information provided in annual reports, my Department collected service utilisation data for marriage counselling from 1987-88 to 1990-91. However, it has proved to be prohibitively expensive to process the data into a useable form, and much of the information sought was subject to recorder bias. During a review of this process, the level of error was discovered to be so great as to render the processed data completely unreliable.</PARA>
<PARA>  In an attempt to overcome these difficulties, my Department has recently introduced a statistical return form which collects information of this type from approved family services organisations. The collected information will be available in the Annual Report of my Department for 1991-92.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6G4">Mr Duffy</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In 1990-91, 9434 couples attended marriage education programs conducted by organisations who receive funding for these programs under the Marriage Act 1961 and the Family Law Act 1975. Statistics on couples attending marriage education programs in 1989-90 were provided to my Department in the annual reports of individual organisations. However, there was no uniform method of recording this data during the 1989-90 financial year or in previous years. Therefore I am unable to refer to this source to provide a total and accurate account on marriage education services for that year.</PARA>
<PARA>Statistics on the utilisation of marriage counselling and family mediation services were also provided in the annual reports of individual organisations. For the reason previously stated, I am unable to refer to this source to answer your question.</PARA>
<PARA>Additionally, from 1987-88 to 1990-91, service utilisation data for marriage counselling and family mediation was collected by my Department. However,  it has  proved  prohibitively  expensive  to</PARA>
<PARA>process the data into a useable form, and much of the information sought was subject to recorder bias. During a review of this process the level of error was discovered to be so great as to render the processed data completely unreliable.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Department has not pursued this method and has now developed a more reliable process. Agencies are now required to complete a statistical return on a quarterly basis which provides numbers of persons using services  funded under  the Family Services Program. The collected information will be available in the Annual Report of my Department for 1991-92.</PARA>
