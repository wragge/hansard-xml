<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over a period there have been concerns, particularly since the establishment of a comprehensive committee system in the House of Representatives and as a result of the fact that joint committees do not come under the scope of the Procedure Committee, about the inability of committees to take evidence in private, other than under the rules which have previously applied. The rules for in private&mdash;generally called in camera&mdash;evidence do not provide protection under circumstances where maximum protection is thought to be desirable. A problem arises because the rules, although they allow the House to authorise a committee to take evidence in camera, do not provide a mechanism whereby the House can prevent a member of the Committee from disclosing that material; there is no provision for penalising a member for disclosing material under privilege.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Committee has considered the whole matter and has found that it is not possible to adjust the existing in-privacy provisions to cover both the normal operations of a committee which may wish to take evidence in private without putting major sanctions on that evidence and a situation where a committee&mdash;and many of our committees now deal with commercial confidences and other matters of very serious consequence&mdash;wishes to take evidence and protect that evidence to the degree which is desirable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendations which have been brought forward leave the existing provisions for taking evidence intact: written submissions that the Committee can publish or otherwise according to its own decision; the taking of oral evidence in public, which is the normal way of taking evidence; and taking evidence in private where a witness is informed that the evidence may, on the decision of the Committee, be published or released by the House without prior notification. The Committee recommends that those three existing provisions be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has recommended the introduction of a new category of evidence. For the purposes of differentiating I will call it in camera evidence because it more appropriately fits the term `in camera' than the private evidence provisions we have. That provision would allow the Committee, by resolution, to take evidence in a manner whereby the disclosure of that evidence would be prohibited without first obtaining the permission of the person who has given evidence or, in the case of the House determining, without the prior approval of the Speaker, the Leader of the Opposition, the Prime Minister and other officers. The purpose of that is that the House cannot be denied the right to release evidence. But if one gives an undertaking to a witness that evidence will be treated confidentially, the witness is entitled to accept that undertaking. I would expect that committees would only go into those circumstances after due consideration and when it was considered absolutely necessary for evidence vital to their deliberations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also provides fairly severe penalties for members of the House of Representatives who breach those undertakings. Those penalties are clearly set out in the report. This proposal does not, as I have already said, apply to the existing arrangements and this House cannot apply it to joint committees. But one would hope that the joint committee rules and those which are covered by statutory prohibitions could be amended in order to bring in such a procedure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also provides that if there is a criminal offence, or something of a very serious nature, the chairman, with the permission of the committee, can notify the Speaker who would then have to make judgments on what to do. I believe that this provides committees with another means of taking evidence; it does not change its procedures unless the committee wishes to change its procedures; and it offers people who may wish to give evidence under these circumstances the opportunity to do so with some confidence that their evidence will not be disclosed and possibly that their lives or their commercial operations placed in jeopardy. Mr Speaker, I commend the report to the House, and I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the House take note of the report. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Ireland and the European Institutions, September 1991. May I particularly acknowledge the presence in the gallery today of the Irish Ambassador, His Excellency Mr Martin Burke, and officers of the Embassy. I would also acknowledge Senator Jim McKiernan's presence in the gallery today. Senator McKiernan was part of our delegation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go to some specifics in terms of the issues. We were very pleased that the delegation had the opportunity to visit Ireland and the European institutions. First of all I would like to mention the people whom I think we ought to acknowledge. We ought to acknowledge the deputy leader of the delegation, Senator Baden Teague who, along with his colleagues in the other Parties, made a point of having this as a bipartisan delegation. From the point of Australia being represented overseas, in my view that is very important and I would like to acknowledge it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to acknowledge my colleagues Ted Grace, Neil Andrew, Stewart McArthur, Gordon Scholes, Senator Brian Harradine and, of course, Senator McKiernan, the Cavan lad, who is here with us today. I would like to acknowledge their spouses who accompanied us and also particularly our Committee secretaries Richard Gilbert and Albertha Williamson who provided excellent support to the delegation. I particularly thank Richard for having this report ready so quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should also acknowledge the officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mark Pierce and his group; parliamentary relations officer Richard Coventry, for his support; and our Ambassador in Ireland, Mr Terry McCarthy, and his wife Margaret, who accompanied us on the delegation. I thought that was very valuable. I also acknowledge the help of the Ceann Comhairle, Sean Treacy, who welcomed us at the airport and saw us off there much healthier and happier as a result of our experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to return to the support given by Martin Burke. We are very grateful for his support, and I think the relationship between Australia and Ireland has been strengthened by his work and, hopefully, by our work in this report. I acknowledge and thank his officer, Ray Bassett, as well. I also thank Mr Jorgensen, EC Ambassador, and Mr Roderick Skinner. For their work in Strasbourg and Brussels, I particularly want to thank Mr Hugh Borrowman; Mr Peter Gallagher, the Charge d'Affaires; Mr Tony Rottier from the OECD; and Mr Bombeek, who provided our transport. All of those people deserve acknowledgment and I thank them for their support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To get to the substance of the matter, I should begin with the International Fund for Ireland. The delegation is quite unambiguous in its attitude towards the Ireland fund. There was some misrepresentation on one occasion in Australia about the Ireland fund. Delegates went there with an open mind and, as a consequence, I am happy to recommend that, having regard to the beneficial work of the fund in supporting projects such as the canal scheme, and keeping in mind the cultural links which exist between Australia and Ireland, the delegation is of a view that the Australian Government should join its British, Irish, United States, New Zealand and European counterparts in supporting the fund and its projects. The delegation therefore recommends that the Government commence negotiations with both the UK and Irish governments with a view to making a contribution to the International Fund for Ireland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That view is supported unanimously by the delegation. We came to that view after having seen the value and importance of the work that is undertaken in the north, where there are high levels of unemployment and where people can be offered some future. Australia can provide, in a moral sense and a political sense, support for what we regard as a very important development. I say this for people who would make the observation, `Oh, well, Ireland is one of these rich west European countries'. The response to that is that Ireland, like many countries, is rich in certain respects, but is also bedevilled by high unemployment and by long term historical problems. It is up to people in the Irish diaspora&mdash;such as Australia&mdash;to be supporting those in Ireland. The delegation is quite unanimous in that view and I believe that our visit there certainly clarified in our minds that that ought to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were delighted to have meetings with the Taoiseach, Mr Haughey, and with the President, Mary Robinson. We also had a very valuable visit to the Waterford factory, which enabled us to see a value added product. The original material for crystal is often very cheap but, when the value is added in terms of production, we end up with very high value products; and that was clearly the case. While in Ireland we also visited Biocycle. A briefing given by Biocycle suggested:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . had the Irish principals not proactively pursued the Australian innovation, it would have been some time before the technology reached Europe.</PARA>
<PARA>Accordingly, the delegation recommends:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that the government including Austrade, as well as Australian business, take special note of this and pursue market opportunities in Europe in a more proactive and strategic way.</PARA>
<PARA>This is not the first time that I have actually had evidence that Austrade is not without blemish. I have to say&mdash;and it is a bit sad to say it&mdash;that in some areas of the world Austrade does not seem to be doing its job. I do not know why it is and I do not know what the answer to that is. Perhaps the answer is to have people who are more market oriented. Certainly we found both in Europe and Ireland that there were business opportunities for Australia that were not being pursued adequately enough by Austrade. That is obviously not an across the board statement, but it certainly applies to some particular instances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I make about the Irish visit is that I think what we saw was a wide range of the fabric and quality of Irish life. We came away convinced that the relationship between ourselves and Ireland needs to be further strengthened. I return to my comments about the Ireland fund. That fund is a substantial way that we can strengthen our relationship with Ireland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move to the European scene. Seventy-three countries were represented at the Strasbourg Conference on Democracy. One country had had representatives for only one week&mdash;the Estonians had literally gained their freedom in one week and were represented at the Strasbourg Conference. It was a very worthwhile discussion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The International Institute for Democracy in Strasbourg asked the Australian Parliament whether it would host a regional colloquy on democracy in 1992. We have recommended to the Presiding Officers that it be actively considered. I believe that was well worth while. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The exchange between ourselves and the European Parliament was very worth while. We covered a wide range of topics, particularly in relation to international relations, relations in the region and GATT negotiations. Mr Lambrias and the President of the European Parliament, Mr Baron Crespo, deserve our thanks. We are delighted to see the Secretary-General of the OECD, Mr Paye, is visiting Australia. That will provide a very good focus for this ongoing discussion. Mr Andrew and I met with Mr McSharry and we had a very good interchange. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe one of the outcomes of the attempted coup in the Soviet Union is that there is now a real awareness in Western Europe that it has to do something substantial about trade reform. One of the recommendations we make, incidentally, is that we ought to mount a trade products display in Europe in cities of high unemployment such as Manchester, Liverpool, and Newcastle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should be showing the Europeans just how cheaply Australian farmers can provide their products. As the Australian booklet identified, Australian farmers can provide products much more cheaply than the Europeans. We ought not mince words about that. We ought to get on the front foot and show the Europeans that we can actively market unprocessed food in a very active way. I believe that is one of the things we ought to be doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that there seems to be a lack of understanding about Australia. In another context, I referred to the fact that I believe Radio Australia needs to play a greater role in pursuing our interests in Europe. I think there is a regional focus in this part of the world, but I think it underestimates the importance of the relationship that we have with Europe. Europe is our second largest market, yet our presence there, aside from such things as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Neighbours</EMPHASIS> television program and so on, is somewhat reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation pursued a bipartisan approach on our agricultural concerns in Europe. My colleagues opposite will certainly be adding to that because they did so well when we were away. We must pursue this single view about agriculture in Europe in light of its importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summing up, I believe it was a visit well worth while. I thank those people for their support. I thank particularly my colleagues for their support during the visit and our families for their support, because these visits are not taken without some pressure on families. It is nice to see some families present here today. I think the people who participated in the visit would feel that it was a job well done and worth doing. I certainly look forward to hearing the comments of my colleagues in this debate. I believe that we have made an impact in Europe. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) in saying how proud I was as a member of this Parliament to be a part of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Ireland and the European Institutions. I place on record the delegation's thanks to Mr Richard Gilbert for his prompt report, which was tabled today, a short time after the five weeks that the delegation spent in Europe.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also remark on the bipartisan approach of the delegation. The leader of the delegation, the honourable member for Stirling, made the observation that the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) and I were particularly interested in agricultural matters. I note the very strong support of Government members on this issue. I think we represented the Parliament in a very unified manner on most of the issues that came before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In passing, I acknowledge the helpful support of Mr Bombeek, our bus driver, who added a certain element of friendliness to our visits to both Strasbourg and Brussels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also acknowledge the presence of the Ambassador from Ireland here in the gallery and thank him for his hospitality prior to our leaving and again last night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable members would know, there are very close links between Ireland and Australia. I think the delegation enhanced those longstanding links of Irish ancestry, both to honourable members of this House and to parts of the Australian population. I do acknowledge, like the leader, the contribution of our Ambassador, Mr Terry McCarthy, and Mrs McCarthy. They accompanied the delegation throughout Ireland and were most helpful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are 3 1/2 million people in Ireland and, as I say, we do have long associations with Irish history and Irish background. Half of the population lives in Dublin, and we spent some time there becoming familiar with Dublin and its particular approaches. The politics of Ireland are dominated by history and it is very difficult for somebody who is not familiar with the historical background to come to some understanding as to where the political parties stand. It is quite clear that families' historical attitudes are the dominant feature of Irish politics, although there may be some changes now taking place. Obviously, the Anglo-Irish conflict, which has gone on for hundreds of years, still plays a dominant role in the attitudes of the senior politicians and personnel that we met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, the entry of Ireland to the European common market has made a tremendous difference to the attitude of the Irish. They are now more outward looking in terms of selling their product overseas rather than being dependent on the English market for their products. I support the observations of the leader of the delegation that Australia should contribute to the international fund for Ireland and give tangible support to our longstanding links. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During our visit to Ireland we made some observations about agriculture. From the farm visit we made it was very clear that the housing of stock for 4 1/2 months is a very important feature of Irish agriculture and, of course, the support of the CAP to farmers in Ireland is fairly important. If that is withdrawn, there will be a considerable reduction in living standards for Irish farmers. I acknowledge the great hospitality of all those people we met in Ireland and thank them for the genuine way in which their Ministers and their personnel looked after us on every occasion. We appreciate it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moving to Europe&mdash;in my view, the attitudes in Europe are dominated by the fact that under no circumstances do those in Europe want another war. Even in 1991, the recollections of the First World War and the Second World War loom large amongst the population and those people we spoke to. Also, the recollections and memories of hunger are still very much a part of those people in Europe&mdash;both the older and younger generations&mdash;who can recall that food was scarce during the war years. I think that has dominated the attitudes towards the common agricultural policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The European Community, consisting of 12 member states, encompasses 340 million people. The attitude is to try to keep the European Community together and to have a free flow of people, goods and services. The attitude is, as I say, dominated by this background that I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just refer to the common agricultural policy, with which this Parliament has been concerned. There is a subsidy of about $US60 billion to farmers in Europe. Eight million farmers are looked after by the common agriculture policy. There used to be some 30 million farmers in the 1960s, so there has been a considerable reduction in the numbers of farmers involved. Eighty per cent of the subsidy moves to 20 per cent of the farmers, as always is the case, so that the better farmers receive most of the subsidy. However, the European might in manufacturing and commerce is able to support this sort of subsidy operation, much to the upset of Australian farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Americans have two million farmers and they are involved in subsidisation of grain in their wheat enhancement programs. Coupled with the CAP, that impacts very poorly upon the Australian farmers and causes them considerable difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the observation that the environmental issues&mdash;which are No. 3 in public perceptions, after inflation and unemployment&mdash;will be a major factor in the debate about the common agricultural policy. We had evidence that pollution by nitrogenous fertilisers and by pesticides was becoming a very important political factor in the debate. So the pollution of water streams and land would be important in this whole argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Intensive livestock production under the CAP policy means a build-up of manure and livestock waste products, another environmental difficulty. There are 83 million head of beef cattle and 23 million head of dairy cattle in Europe. That gives us some indication of the environmental difficulties, especially when the cattle are housed for 4 1/2 months during the winter period. I think there will be public concern about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the Council of Europe, as our leader has mentioned, we attended important discussions. In the OECD debate, on behalf of the delegation I was able to raise with the Secretary-General, Mr John Claude Paye, our attitude to the CAP. I raised the issue of what would happen if the CAP continued discriminating against Third World countries, Australian efficient agricultural producers and other agricultural producers around the world. His answer was&mdash;and it is very interesting, because he is a very important person in terms of attitude and opinion forming&mdash;that there was a sea change in attitude towards the CAP by the Europeans, that there was a movement to some greater economic rationality, and that, inevitably, these sorts of subsidy arrangements could not continue. His final comment, of course, was that there were more consumers than there were farmers. Inevitably, some more sensible approach might come about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We visited the European Parliament. We were able to observe the 518 members in action with their five-year election program. I make the interesting comparison that the European Parliament has nine languages to deal with. We have a bit of trouble dealing with just the English language in this Parliament. It was interesting to see the way in which debate took place in nine languages and the interpreters that were required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The year 1992 looms large as a key date in European thinking. Every objective is close to that date in bringing Europe closer together. The proportional representation approach of the democracies in Europe and the European Parliament, in my view, does not enhance strong government; it moves towards the lowest common denominator, and there is a lot of consensus politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a split in Europe between Strasbourg, where the European Parliament is, and Brussels, where the Council of Ministers operates and where the real power is. Debate on that will be ongoing. There still remains a conflict in Yugoslavia. The Europeans are moving together, yet Yugoslavia is the centre of a major argument. We had a wonderful briefing from Manfred Woerner at NATO. Some of the issues raised about Russia were certainly enlightening in this era of dramatic change with the Berlin wall going, the collapse of the communist regime and a changed role for NATO. The collapse of the Berlin wall and the quite dramatic change that the whole of eastern Europe is undergoing were reflected in the conversations and briefings we had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a most valuable delegation in terms of the cultural and trade exchanges. It is worthy of note that Australia still maintains very strong trade links with Europe and with Ireland. Whilst we are developing stronger trade with Asia, European capital investment and our relationship with Europe are very strong&mdash;by way of both history and our current arrangements. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that impressed me about Ireland this time was the new Ambassador to Ireland, Terry McCarthy. I congratulate the people who instigated his installation in Ireland. I am sure that Terry and his wife, Margaret, will go from strength to strength. It was a pleasure to meet them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other highlight when we landed in Ireland, something about which we had to educate our Liberal friends on the other side of the House, was the game of hurling. We had the great honour of attending the All-Ireland Hurling Final. I found out afterwards that we were very privileged because there was a delegation in Ireland from America which could not get tickets. We were very privileged on that score. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The visit of the delegation to Europe occurred during a time of intense debate over the future economic, political and social shape of Europe. For instance, the world has seen immense change in the Soviet Union, especially regarding its role as a superpower. The world is also experiencing difficulties in maintaining and upholding the free trade principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, in most of the negotiations that we had in Europe, especially with the European Parliament, we were trying to convince our European friends of what a bad deal we had in Australia. When people in Australia say that we are on a jaunt around the world, it is not quite true. When we try to explain the CAP, people probably think it is the favourite in the 3.30 at Warwick Farm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me explain for the record what it means when we say that European farmers are subsidised. We in Australia can kill a prize beast, dress it up, package it, put it on a first class Qantas seat to Europe and sell it for less than Europeans would pay for meat produced in Europe. We can dig coal up in Newcastle, export it to Europe, put it back down a mine, remine it and sell it cheaper. This gives some idea of how highly subsidised European industrialists and farmers are. But that is not the real problem. The real problem occurs when we try to sell on other markets outside Europe where Europe dumps its surplus stock. That is where the whole problem originates. But I will leave that matter for my other friends to talk about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wanted to spend a couple of minutes of my time in supporting the delegation and speaking on the International Fund for Ireland. While I may seem biased, having originated from that part of the world, I think donations to the fund from a country such as Australia would be money well spent. Australia has such a great connection with Ireland. Nearly 40 per cent of our people have some Irish connection. I think that is a great contribution from a small country such as Ireland&mdash;immaterial of the circumstances at the time that drove the Irish to this country. Nevertheless, we pride ourselves in being the main movers in the establishment of this great country that we now call home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The money being spent is peanuts. The European Common Market, or European Community&mdash;which, incidentally, includes Great Britain&mdash;spends #10.7m sterling; the United States, a very rich country, spends #10m sterling; Canada subscribes #430m sterling; and our neighbours in New Zealand, who do not have the same connection with Ireland, see fit to spend #120,000 sterling. I think it would be very befitting of this country to make a contribution. I will not suggest an amount of money; I will leave that to my parliamentary colleagues. I strongly recommend, in support of our chairman, that we should be spending money on a country such as Ireland because of the deprivation that has always existed there. Honourable members should remember that some people, such as Senator Jim McKiernan and I, did not come to this country originally because we thought it was the greatest country in the world; we came because there was nothing in our homeland. It is only by accident that we came to the other great country in the world. I really plead with my parliamentary colleagues to look very seriously at the International Fund for Ireland and make a subscription, hopefully in the next Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For me personally, my return to Europe was a nostalgic one. I would just like to spend a few minutes on some of the things that happened to me in Ireland and in Europe, and on one of the reasons why it was so fulfilling for me. My grandfather disappeared in the First World War as a young man of 19, and he was never found. My family never had the resources to carry on and find out what happened to him. It was left to his grandson some 70-odd years afterwards to find his name on the Menin Gate, which is the entrance to the Fields of Flanders where the massacres of the First World War happened. We found the name. I was not quite sure that it was his, but the Commonwealth War Graves Commission has since confirmed that the name on there is indeed my grandfather's. I would like to thank publicly the Commonwealth War Graves Commission for its help. Roger Dalley showed us around the fields in Europe and particularly the largest graveyard of Australians. It holds 13,000 young Australians who gave their life for freedom and are now buried in the Fields of Flanders. It was a very moving experience, and probably such experiences dictate my anti-war attitude. We also visited an ex-concentration camp. It was a very moving experience but, I would not want to go there again. Nevertheless it was probably worth seeing it and noting what man's inhumanity to man achieves. </PARA>

Much has been said on the matter and, although I would like to avoid repeating what my colleagues have said, inevitably there will be some repetition in the comments I want to make.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I consider myself very fortunate to have been a part of this 1991 delegation. I believe that the one point that characterised this delegation was the timeliness of the visit. I found myself, as someone whose background is not Irish but who was there as a visitor, fascinated by Ireland and many of the preconceived ideas I had about that country were inevitably shot out of the water by the experience I had as a member of this delegation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the delegation there were three people&mdash;Senator Harradine, Senator McKiernan and the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace)&mdash;who knew a great deal about Ireland because their families had direct links with Ireland. We can tell when they stand to speak in this chamber or in the other place that that odd accent they have comes from somewhere other than Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Visiting Ireland was an experience of being showered with hospitality that made me&mdash;a non-Irish person, not one of the 40 per cent of Australians fortunate enough to have direct links with Ireland&mdash;feel very much at home. I want to join my colleagues in expressing our appreciation to Ambassador Martin Burke for all that he did prior to our departure for Ireland to see that we were adequately briefed on the things that we might experience there. I want to express, too, my appreciation to the Irish Government for all that it did to make us feel so very much at home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I place on record the delegation's appreciation to the Irish Government for selecting Miss Louise Tobin to accompany the delegation throughout its tour in Ireland. I would be grateful if the Ambassador could also bear in mind the fact that the delegation is indebted to Louise. No-one could have done more to make us feel at home and no-one could have done more to ensure that all of our needs were met, but all of that was done in a most unobtrusive way. Most significantly of all, we discovered that invariably if we thought there was something that we might need, Louise had already anticipated that need and taken steps to ensure that it was met. I also want to embrace the remarks of previous speakers and acknowledge the very valuable role being played by Ambassador Terry McCarthy, the Australian Ambassador now located in Dublin. His is a relatively recent appointment. It is obvious that he is very pleased to be appointed to Dublin, and he will really strengthen Australia's present links with Ireland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> For me the tour of Ireland was an excellent backdrop to the European Parliament, and it was a learning experience. As someone who had not previously visited Ireland, I had no idea just how much was being done in Ireland to make it an efficient and effective member of the European Community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think everyone in the delegation was surprised at the computer-based industrial development that has now made Ireland rival the rest of the European Community in this particular area. All of us were delighted at the dock redevelopment that we visited. In fact, many of us this morning are wearing the ties that we were presented with during that visit. I endorse the remarks that have been made by my colleagues about the International Fund for Ireland and the work that we saw that fund doing in canal development to the north of Dublin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I particularly want to make a comment or two about agriculture in Ireland. I am grateful to my colleague the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) for his support in ensuring that the Irish Government was prepared to find an Irish farmer who would host the delegation. It was a real experience to visit farmer John Ryan's farm and discover just how much Irish farmers are like Australian farmers. Their farm practice may be different and inevitably the weather and the climate demands that much of what they do is done in an environment quite foreign to Australians, but their hopes and aspirations are just the same as the hopes and aspirations of so many of my constituents and the constituents of the honourable member for Corangamite. They seek to have a property that they will pass on to their children in better shape than they inherited from their forebears. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was to the Ryan's great credit that they were not only hospitable in the traditional Irish way, embarrassingly so, but also that they were keen to show us all both the pitfalls and the advantages of being a farmer in Ireland. I believe the honourable member for Corangamite would agree that it was for us a real learning experience and timely in that it provided just the backdrop we needed prior to travelling to Strasbourg and participating in the European Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The feature of attending the European Parliament for me was once again that this was such a timely visit. I am indebted to the leader of the delegation, the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards) because it was possible for him and me to meet Agricultural Commissioner McSharry who happens also to have been the agriculture Minister in Ireland. I think Australians should pay tribute to Commissioner McSharry because he is proposing changes in the EEC that are electorally unpopular but fundamentally responsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there has been far too much focus in Australia, particularly in the last two months, on what is seen as the USA's attack on Australian farmers and far too little focus on the simple reality that we are in fact caught as farmers not as a result of what the USA is doing but as a result of the pressure that exists between the USA and the EEC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was a timely visit for me because I discovered that all the Government has been saying and all the Opposition has been saying about keeping the GATT negotiations alive was absolutely right. How does anyone in Australia suppose we can generate the $40 billion or $50 billion currently being spent in farm support in the EEC? All sorts of statistics have been given this morning, but I leave the Parliament with this sobering statistic: the annual subsidy for each dairy cow in the EEC is greater than the per capita income of half of the world's population. We cannot match that sort of subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only chance Australian farmers have to continue to operate while waiting for subsidies to be reduced is the GATT round. Meeting with Commissioner McSharry and with the European Parliament reinforced for me the importance of the GATT round and the importance of keeping those negotiations alive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time will run away from each of us participating in the debate on this report on our visit to the EEC. I would not want to focus solely on the European Parliament. I want to stress, as my previous colleagues have, the importance for me of the conference on democracy. I echo the sentiments of our leader. It was a rather sobering experience to be there and to realise that many countries participating in this conference on democracy were countries for whom democracy was a very recent experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of all, I found the briefing from NATO invaluable because, once again, it was timely for us to be in Europe. We were in Europe just as the dilemma that still persists in Yugoslavia was beginning to emerge. We were there to experience how the Europeans feel about all the changes that have occurred in Russia. It was valuable for someone like me, who presumed that NATO may no longer have a role, to discover that while NATO recognises that its role will be geared down, nonetheless it continues to have a very important role in Europe in keeping Europe stable in all the uncertainty that currently dominates the Russian landscape. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that Russia is moving into winter, and that we cannot expect democracies to survive where people starve, the responsibility Europe has on behalf of the rest of the world to ensure that some of its food surpluses find their way into Russia cannot be overstated. I found it timely to be in Europe and to be speaking to NATO at a time when it is grappling, in tandem with the European Parliament, with how the real needs of the Russian people will be met in order to keep democracy alive and well in Russia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, too, wish to pay tribute to my colleagues who made bipartisan travel such a pleasure. I wish to thank Mr Gilbert for all he has done in producing such a timely report. He has said that he enjoyed being part of the delegation. I am not quite sure why because he was the one who had to be up first in the morning to ensure that all the delegation's needs were met. We are grateful to him for all that he did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to conclude by echoing the sentiments of the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace). It was, for all of us, a very sobering experience&mdash;those children in the gallery might be interested to consider how sobering it was&mdash;to stand at the Menin Gate and see the names of thousands of Australians who have no graves in Europe because no trace was found of them at the end of the First World War. To consider that that was what war once did was, for all of us, a very sobering experience. The honourable member for Fowler is not alone in his abhorrence of war. I expect every one of the Australians who suffered there shared the attitude of the honourable member for Fowler. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also want to make a few remarks on the delegation to Ireland and the European Community. Like most working class Australians, particularly coming from Victoria, I have some Irish connections, although I think my family is basically English. My paternal grandfather was named O'Brien, which is an unusual Irish name! But I never met him because he was killed in France in 1916 during the First World War.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The visit to Ireland highlighted a number of things: the importance of the European agricultural policy to its member states, and the difficulties which would arise and will arise if that policy is materially changed. It also highlighted the fact that whilst Ireland has been a major beneficiary in the farm subsidy area, and also has been able to attract substantial and important industries because of its position in the EEC and its early membership, there are problems for other sections of the European Community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Right across Europe the question of employment appears to be as great a problem, although not as heavily discussed as it is in Australia. In Europe there are currently of the order of nine million guest workers. There is approximately 12 1/2 per cent unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we were in Europe French farmers attacked trucks carrying produce from Britain &mdash;another EEC area&mdash;because they were coming into their areas and the French farmers thought they were threatening their living standards and their entitlement to their markets. They are problems we all know about here and are problems that are not going to be easy to resolve. They will make it difficult for internal governments&mdash;I agree with the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur) on this point&mdash;which are relatively weak because of an electoral system which guarantees that there cannot be majority governments or that majority governments are almost impossible to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Europe there is another problem which may be corrected, but at this stage it does not appear likely to be corrected in the short term; that is, the lack of a representative decision making government with authority over the bureaucracy that runs Europe. There is a ministerial council, but that is a bypassing of democracy rather than an element of democracy. It enables a group of Ministers to meet and to make decisions which become binding on their parliaments. That is not the way in which I understood democracy to work. The European Parliament at this stage is a talk shop, and that is unfortunate because it will be necessary for Europe, if it is to have more unity, to have a representative form of government which has authority over the policies which are adopted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had meetings with numbers of people, probably more than could be dealt with in a report and more than can be adequately dealt with in a short debate. The primary element of our visit&mdash;this has been covered by all speakers&mdash;was to deal with the problems of European subsidies and European and American destruction of third markets. In Ireland we were told that surpluses were being created in some European countries, and I will not mention them, where cattle were being lot fed with American dumped grain and then sold into third markets with European subsidies. There was never any economic basis for the cattle at all but, quite seriously, that is the stupidity of Europe at the moment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>The second report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee for Long Term Strategies was tabled on 12 September. My colleague the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley) gave a tabling speech in my absence. This report, part of the broad subject, `Australia as an Information Society', is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Role of Libraries/Information Networks</EMPHASIS>. The honourable member for Adelaide in his speech foreshadowed that I would deal with the recommendations when I entered the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few words about the context of this second report would be appropriate. In our first report we concluded that Australia was an information society already, but rather a passive one, marked by extreme fragmentation in which the organisation and control of information was widely dispersed, with no overall policy framework. There is an extraordinary ambiguity in information. It has the capacity to be centralised, shoring up existing power structures, or it can be extremely dispersed and promote personal autonomy. Which model do we want? Up to now, we do not say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recommended the adoption of a national information policy and urged recognition of the centrality of information as a factor in production, employment, trade, education, culture, media ownership and control, social justice, government, and national autonomy. We were not urging a rigid centralised system of control on information&mdash;far from it&mdash;just that there ought to be a recognition by government, Parliament and the community of the importance of information and information issues, and that failure to respond was to Australia's detriment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our third report, still to be written, will examine the `Yes, Minister' problem, the inequity in access to information in government and the risk that the Parliament's role will become increasingly peripheral. The second report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Role of Libraries/Information Networks</EMPHASIS>, must be seen in the context of the first and even the third reports. There is no national library policy, any more than there is a national information policy. We need both. Libraries are the Little Orphan Annies of government. They are an obvious starting point for an effective national information network. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's main recommendation calls for the development of a national library policy and for the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly), or indeed the Minister at the table, the Minister for the Arts, Tourism, and Territories (Mr Simmons), to make a detailed statement about the adequacy of existing library and information networks. The Committee also calls for the development and provision of libraries and information services to be placed on the agenda of a Special Premiers Conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the fragmentation of responsibility for various aspects of information in the Commonwealth system, no Minister has responsibility for libraries. One Minister, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories, has responsibility for one institution, the National Library of Australia, but no general responsibility for libraries. The States and local government bear the cost&mdash;the heavy cost of providing library services. But has the question of libraries,  and</PARA>
<PARA>library funding, ever been placed on the table at a Premiers Conference? No, it has not. This is a classic illustration of the old adage `out of sight, out of mind'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Adelaide pointed out, the Whitlam Government in 1975 established a committee chaired by Allan Horton which produced the valuable report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Public Libraries in Australia</EMPHASIS>. While some elements of the 53 recommendations have been adopted piecemeal since then, the central thrust&mdash;the need for a national perspective&mdash;has been ignored. Since 1976 the demand for public library services has increased enormously, and the cost of books has risen even faster. Nevertheless, increases in public funding for libraries have been extremely modest. We pointed out in paragraph 1.14:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Horton Committee estimated (6.7) that to meet the library needs of local government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>local government, not the States&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">an additional $50m in 1975 prices would be needed over a 10-year period to reach an acceptable standard.</PARA>
<PARA>That is $500m over a decade in 1975 dollars. In Queensland, for example, between 1976 and 1989, there was a 60 per cent increase in book use. That is characteristic of what happened in the other States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been an explosive increase in publication worldwide, a phenomenon often referred to as the information explosion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. This problem can only be overcome on the basis of sharing, using comparative cooperative networks. The most obvious example of networking is one that we are very familiar with here, the relationship between the National Library of Australia and the Commonwealth Parliamentary Library. If the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and I want to pore over a Gutenberg <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bible</EMPHASIS>, we do not need to have two, provided we can both have access to one. But the question is how effective the networking can possibly be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We reviewed the Horton Committee very closely and recommended adoption of its main principles. The first three are probably the most important: firstly, the provision of public library and information services should be the collective responsibility of the Commonwealth, States and local levels of government, funded in part by each of these levels of government; secondly, the provision of equality of service on the basis of reasonable need should be ensured by the Commonwealth and State governments; thirdly&mdash;about which we have to put a caveat&mdash;the provision of basic public libraries and information services should be free of charge to all members of the community. Perhaps if we underline the word `basic', the concept of free provision follows. But if there is one area in which we tend to converge, it is that we can no longer expect absolutely free service in every area; that there has to be, where appropriate, some element of user pays. So whilst supporting the last principle in general, the Committee recognised that appropriate changes will be required to meet special needs involving significant use of resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Committee indicated in its report, paragraph 1.23, in discussions with the Committee in June 1991 Allan Horton estimated that only eight of the recommendations&mdash;17, 18, 24, 29, 30, 36, 37 and 38&mdash;had been implemented. Thirteen had been implemented in part&mdash;4, 5, 10, 13, 14, 16, 25, 26, 27, 28, 33, 35 and 42&mdash;and the rest were either ignored or overtaken by events. He thought that the most significant achievement was the establishment of the Australian bibliographic network, or ABN. Begun in 1981 on the recommendation of the National Library of Australia, it changed the face of library services in Australia, allowing for greater efficiencies in cataloguing and acquisition, minimising duplication and offering the possibility of a distributed national collection. It was the basis of the cooperative and coordinated approach recommended by the Committee of inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other factors that we wanted to comment on was of course the role of libraries as a factor in combating illiteracy. The Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, in its recent report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Words at Work</EMPHASIS>, stated that we have in Australia something of the order of one million adult illiterates. Remember of course that literacy is a moving target. Once the old UNESCO test of the ability to read and write a simple letter was enough. But now, in an increasingly complex society, the ability to be able to read directions, the ability to be able to read a label, the ability to be able to understand the form that one is filling in is increasingly important, so the question of literacy is a moving target. It is very much to our national detriment if we do not make sure that we are able to use the existing resources effectively to deliver services. I see from the clock that time is running out. I seek leave to re-enter the debate at a later hour. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the second report by the Standing Committee for Long Term Strategies. This report, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Role of Libraries/Information Networks</EMPHASIS>, has been produced in conjunction with the previous report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia as an Information Society: Grasping New Paradigms</EMPHASIS>, which was tabled on 6 June this year. The first report has been generally well received by the community, certainly among professionals and specialists who deal in information and in certain sections of the media. We are as yet to receive any formal response from the Government, and this is awaited with great interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a great responsibility upon the Government to take these reports very seriously. This goes for the Opposition too, even though it has no legislative need to respond formally. In mentioning the first report, I would like to make it clear to my colleagues that both these reports should be seen in conjunction with each other; they are part of a series. Let me reiterate some of the themes raised on that first report to put the matter into some context. Together with the rest of the developed world Australia is an information society. Incredibly, 40 per cent of our labour force is employed in the collection, processing and dissemination of data or knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet in this context, we are also defined as a passive information society. We are net importers of information and information technology. Unlike similar small countries, such as Sweden, Switzerland and Holland, we do not have a highly developed ideas and information based export economy. Our export base remains rural and dependent on our raw materials to a remarkable degree, with a very questionable future outlook. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the move to create `the clever country', it is crucial that we come to terms with the fact that in today's world the main players are those who deal with knowledge and information most intelligently and in a significantly imaginative way. If we become a `smart country', then our export opportunity in the field of information technology&mdash;either in software or hardware&mdash;should be boundless. The role our libraries have to play is vital in this process. It is a good starting point. As Deputy Chairman of the Committee, I commend the Committee for having undertaken to pursue the topic on libraries as a matter of top priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is estimated to be blessed with some 14,000 libraries, with a total stock of some 75 million volumes. This is an enormous national resource and, as such, this report seeks to bring to the attention of Government and the Parliament the fact that something must be done in the name of preserving, maintaining and renewing this resource in the most practical way, given the excitingly new and futuristic technology that already exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some 16 years ago Prime Minister Gough Whitlam commissioned the then librarian of the University of New South Wales, Allan Horton, to head a committee of inquiry into public libraries in Australia. The Horton report made some 53 recommendations, which unfortunately were not taken up by successive governments. This is regrettable because the situation we find ourselves in today is that libraries have experienced an extraordinary growth in demand and are finding it tough going indeed in providing the level of service that is expected of them with their limited and stretched resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Pro-Vice Chancellor's (Research) Committee, the university body, met recently, and in reference to university libraries&mdash;I quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> of 29 August 1991 &mdash;said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Old equipment and inadequate library and computer resources, the legacy of dwindling infrastructure dollars hampered research in Australian universities seriously . . . Australia's international competitiveness could suffer as a result.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Max Neutze, the Committee Chairman, went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, library resources and computer facilities are inadequate, buildings are overcrowded, and poorly maintained, and equipment is often out of date. Australian research cannot keep up with its international competitors and train post graduates if it has to be done on outmoded equipment.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a regrettable situation where some of the best minds and skills we have in this country have to be constrained in their advance by something as basic as the lack of adequate information resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report before the House, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Role of Libraries/Information Networks</EMPHASIS>, puts forward several recommendations. Following the speech by the Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), there is no need to go into each recommendation in detail. The report is readily available and all honourable members of the House should be reading it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report before the House seeks to redress a situation which has essentially been one of neglect by past Commonwealth governments. The report calls on the Government to take a more active and concentrated approach than it has done hitherto on our libraries and information systems. It calls for the Commonwealth Government to take the lead in formulating a coordinated national approach. As it is, our library and information sources lie dispersed and relatively uncoordinated at a national level. With a more coordinated approach, we could and should see the development of a national databank. This is vital to Australia's future and should not be regarded as a mere collection of words. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With specialist knowledge being developed within institutions, and with inter-institutional access to information, we might manage to cut out the enormous amount of duplicated work that currently goes on. A lot of this ground had been covered by the Horton report recommendations. Nevertheless, the report by this Committee is not just a rehash of Horton's recommendations, tragic though it was that they were taken little notice of during the past 16 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 16 years a great deal has changed and the context of information and information systems is wholly different today to what it was in the mid-1970s. The essential recommendations and tenets put forward by Horton still hold true and we look forward to a response on the matter from the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly), despite the very limited responsibility she has in the field of libraries, in the not too distant future, or even if we could hear from her office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am grateful for the great opportunity afforded to us as members of the Committee to discuss these issues at length with librarians and information professionals across the length and breadth of this country. It is a little disconcerting to see the onus that is put on librarians to be current with information. Clearly, there is a need for specialists within the domain of information services, and what should develop is accessibility to this specialist information. Technology allows to us to do it but no-one seems to be listening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my closing remarks, I again thank my colleague the honourable member for Lalor for his unfaltering chairmanship. I also thank the State librarians and others in the profession who gave the Committee their time and provided us with such detailed and thorough submissions. I thank those who assisted the Committee in the compilation of the information, particularly the staff, Mr Ian Dundas, Ms Kelly Fitzsimmons and Ms Margaret Swieringa, for their outstanding dedicated service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In dealing with libraries and information networks in our society, let us not forget that they were originally intended to be `food for the soul'&mdash;or nutrimentum spiritus, as I think the Latins used to say&mdash;as still inscribed at the State Library of Berlin, or as `medicine for the soul', as it was inscribed at the great library at Thebes all those years ago. The old dictum that an ignorant and/or illiterate society is an oppressed society is part of the philosophy which underlies what we have been trying to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is so much more to be said and there is so much more to be learnt. I am looking forward to participating in our next report. The degree of enthusiasm that comes from each and every member of the Long Term Strategies Committee, which was formed by the honourable member for Lalor, should be stated in this House.

Clearly, both reports are interrelated with Australia's trade situation. Paragraph 1.8 of the first report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is a passive information society and needs to make an urgent transition . . . unless it is to become marginalised internationally.</PARA>
<PARA>It further commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In information technology alone, Australia is a net importer with a trade deficit each year estimated (depending on the IT definition used) of between $4 billion and $8 billion.</PARA>
<PARA>This week&mdash;it depends on the definitions used&mdash;the EPAC report on the OECD survey of a variety of countries was certainly an indictment of Australia's performance in this greatly expanding sector of world trade. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 11 November it was noted that in 1989-90 we had a trade deficit of about $12 billion in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's percentage of exports of technologically sophisticated goods is 0.2 per cent compared with Hong Kong's 1.9 per cent and Austria's 1.1 per cent. Looking at international comparison, the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment in the US commented that world trade and intellectual property impact on more than 2.2 per cent of the US labour force and 5 per cent of its gross national product. Exports of intellectual property are 25 per cent of US exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this report and the related reports that have been produced, we are not just talking about libraries' impact on recreation, informing citizens about events in the country and helping their particular localised businesses; we are talking about an issue that is central to Australia's international trade. That should reinforce the demand of previous speakers that these reports be taken note of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been previous references to the Horton report, which indeed, as the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) said, certainly led to a very sad performance by a variety of governments. It took a period of 67 months for the final in a series of Ministers to come back and report the findings of an interdepartmental review of the Horton report. Indeed, it is a fairly shocking situation for any government when such a central report to our nation's good should be shovelled off in such a fashion. I should say in passing, however, that the Horton report was not a total waste of time, for on page 6 of our report we note:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The activity in the States however stands in contrast to the failure of the Commonwealth to make a significant response.</PARA>
<PARA>So indeed the Horton report did have an impact on the thinking of a variety of State libraries, and it did cause some of the changes made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee made a variety of suggestions. Obviously they largely involve expenditure of money. I will briefly go through some of them. One of the points that was made was the very great disparity in funding throughout Australia between regions and between municipalities. The figures range from $5 to $40 per capita. It is advocated that to overcome that unevenness in library networks there should be an acknowledgment that this vital national need is indeed the responsibility of all levels of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coming from an electorate that includes the Parramatta library system, I find this of particular importance because that library system, whether under liberal or independent administrations, has been indicted as Sydney's worst. It is typical of what happens with the duplication of systems that Holroyd and Baulkham Hills, previously being part of the joint effort, broke away from it because of its inept management of its responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another central point that we make is the need to develop the Australian bibliographical network. I note that its tenth anniversary was this year. It has managed to catalogue eight million records with a yearly input of a further one million. I think it is very central that the Government does indeed put funding towards this national need. I also note that in its report of its 10 years it comments on a point that we make, that there is a growing demand for script other than Roman. That again relates to another matter that we raise, the particular need for an emphasis on Asian materials. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

This report should not be seen in isolation. Rather, it should be seen as the second report of the Long Term Strategies Committee's investigations into Australia as an information society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first report, tabled on 6 June 1991, dealt with the broader question of the increasingly important role of information to our economy, our democratic institutions and our national well-being. This second report looks at the role and future development of libraries in great detail. The Committee has concentrated its attention on the important matters which have remained unresolved since the Horton inquiry into public libraries was presented in 1976. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In singling out libraries for particular attention, the Standing Committee for Long Term Strategies has acknowledged the important role they have to play in providing access to information for Australian citizens. Access to information is most important in a vibrant democracy and is important to our social and economic development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In principle, I support the recommendations of the Committee as detailed in the report. However, I do have a number of concerns about the direction of the Long Term Strategies Committee in its deliberations on this matter. I am concerned that too much emphasis has been placed upon the issue of funding. I happen to believe that the Long Term Strategies Committee should be looking at the broader issues, and to this end I believe that the Committee should have given more consideration to the issue of technological change as it affects the role and future development of libraries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a Long Term Strategies Committee, we need not confine ourselves to the issues of today and, in particular, to the day-to-day budgetary issues confronting libraries in 1991. It is very appropriate for us to look to the future and to inquire into the future needs of libraries, librarians and library users. In this regard I am concerned that this report falls short of the mark. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rapid development of technology has had and will continue to have a major impact on the library industry. Honourable members are well aware of the impact of computers on all Australians. Many Australians now have a computer at home and nearly all have some access to a computer at either school or work, or perhaps at their local library. Australians are already studying at American universities via their home computer linked by telephone and modem. The role of libraries in such technological and educational advances should be the subject of review by the Long Term Strategies Committee. We need not restrict our thinking or our investigations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Education, in particular tertiary education, is one of the growth industries of the 1990s and this will continue into the twenty-first century. Libraries should play an important role in this area and there is a golden opportunity for Australia to take a lead in this regard. It is the responsibility of the Long Term Strategies Committee to look at these new and challenging opportunities. The brief of this Committee is much wider and less restricted compared to other standing and select committees of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of Australia as an information society, libraries and library professionals have an all-important role to play, but we must be careful that the search for the elusive dollar does not become the main issue. It is not the role of the Long Term Strategies Committee to act as a budgetary watchdog for libraries, yet most of the recommendations contained in this report relate to funding. I believe that the Committee must adopt a wider approach to such issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I have some concerns about the direction of the report, I recognise that it is an important document for all library professionals and library users. This report is only the third major review of Australia's library system and therefore is of great importance to that industry. In many respects, the report is a reconsideration of the Horton inquiry report tabled in April 1976 but never acted upon. It is important to note that the Horton Committee recommended nine broad guidelines as the basis for assisting public libraries, and the Long Term Strategies Committee reviewed those guidelines and endorsed them. Other members have offered detailed comments regarding the recommendations of the Committee but I do not have the time to do this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I urge the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) to take note of the main recommendations of this report. I look forward to monitoring the progress of the development of a national library policy. I trust and hope that this report will not suffer the same fate as the 1976 Horton report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I thought the indication was that there would be time this afternoon; I have only two minutes now. However, I take up the point made by the honourable member for Isaacs (Mr Atkinson). Curiously, comparatively little was raised on those technological issues in the actual submissions. To some degree we are limited by that. Of course, it is the sort of issue that we ought to be talking about in the Long Term Strategies Committee generally. I accept that view completely.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, I think it is also fair to say that the primary emphasis of the report was not on providing an additional quantum of money. If the networking is right and we spend $X on facilitating networking, then it may not be necessary to spend $2Xm or $3Xm on book stock. Perhaps again that is an area where, if we had had a longer period for discussion within the Committee itself, that could have been developed. As I mentioned earlier, there is a higher degree of political consensus on this issue. The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) played a significant role historically in this matter. We all accept that the Commonwealth cannot be regarded as a milch cow from which we just squeeze out the nutrients that other people use. We have to be able to use our existing resources more effectively; hence the emphasis on networking rather than simply increasing the quantum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I am also concerned that, although we have this extraordinarily rich facility, the extraordinarily rich facility is not being used effectively. Somehow it has to be put much higher in the thinking of government; it has to be very high on the national priorities. The Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons), who is at the table, and the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly), as the senior Minister in the Department, have a very important role to play&mdash;but not in isolation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That this House commends Australian agriculturalists on the voluntary reduction in toxic pesticides used in primary production over the past 20 years.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>I want to pick up a comment or two unrelated to this debate which were made by the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones). He pointed out that there is a good deal of consensus in this House on a number of issues. He was talking specifically about information exchange, but those of us who are participants in the political process know that, contrary to popular opinion, there is a great deal of consensus in the chamber on a vast range of issues. In fact, the bulk of legislation introduced by the Government is supported by the Opposition. One does not spend long in this chamber before one discovers that there are no easy labels and that there are not simply goodies and baddies on the respective sides. But it strikes me that in one area of society people are, in the present environment, automatically labelled as baddies. This morning I want to put in a word or two for the so-called baddies who use the toxic pesticides in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The popular impression abroad is that agriculturalists, once they `take' a can of concentrated insecticide, are somehow seen by society at large as addicted. It is imagined that, like druggies who cannot get off their particular addiction, agriculturalists simply have to use pesticide because they love to pour it out, and that the consumer is the one who suffers. The purpose of my motion is to point out the nonsense that currently pervades the community when members of the community imagine that agricultural chemicals in Australia are somehow doing the food chain harm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, the so-called baddies, the users of agricultural chemicals, are the very people who least want to use them, who minimise the use of them and who are most anxious to reduce the use of them. Mr Deputy Speaker, put yourself, if you will, in the position of a farmer forced, for example, to drench his sheep, or a fruit grower forced, by reason of the crop that he is producing, to sit in a tractor seat with a machine behind him blowing out concentrated agricultural chemical and obliged to spend the day in a fog of agricultural chemical. It is not a situation he wants. Frankly, it is a situation that he wants to avoid. So I want to put on the record the real effort that has been made by Australian agriculture to minimise chemical use, and the success of that approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to point out to consumers that Australian produce that they are consuming is not only absolutely safe but also safer than products available from the rest of the world. More than that, 99.9 per cent by weight of the chemicals ingested by Australians occur naturally. I think that too few people appreciate that the responsible legislation in Australia is such that chemical companies are obliged to spend at least $25m per annum on developing chemicals that will have a minimum toxic effect on Australians, and it should be pointed out that every chemical must meet what is called the `no observed adverse effect level'. That level is then reduced by 100 times before the chemical is made available for registration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But even if this level of regimentation did not apply, we would still have the situation in which primary producers around Australia are determined to reduce their pesticide use, and have successfully done so. People should be more aware of the fact that over the last two decades broad-based agricultural chemicals used to clean up a range of agricultural pests have now all but disappeared. The chemicals that were once found in every farmer's shed&mdash;gusathion and parathion, with which the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) would be familiar&mdash;are now rarely used. That is because they have been replaced by chemicals that are specifically designed to target the pest that is causing the farmer concern and would, of course, reduce the crop that he has available to sell. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In place of broad-based agricultural chemicals, all farmers now practise integrated pest management techniques. Why? Because the farmer does not want to expose himself to the chemical levels of the past. Of course, having in the past been obliged to use chemicals at a particular level, he was then obliged, quite rightly, to market fruit which did not have more than the allowable residual levels of chemicals on it. So he found himself in a bind. How could he clean up his pest problems without exceeding the minimum allowable levels? Today, every farmer, particularly the fruit farmer, is involved in some form of integrated pest management. Today, far from using broad-based chemicals, farmers are using chemicals that are targeted specifically to a particular pest. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the integrated pest management techniques, what farmers rely on intentionally is accurate timing for chemical use. It is by no means rare when making one's way around an orchard to find various lures in the trees. With these lures the farmer can, by means of either a molasses bait or, in some cases, something as simple as corrugated cardboard attached to the tree with a velcro strip, measure how many goodies and baddies have accumulated behind the corrugated strip and, when the baddies exceed the goodies, take the opportunity to apply an appropriate pesticide spray. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Far more now than ever before, integrated control is part of the role that every farmer now plays in order to target pests. As if this were not reassuring enough, farmers are going beyond integrated control and into biological control. They are using the lures that I mentioned to indicate to them when they should introduce the predators needed to control the pests that are causing them problems in their orchards. What is crucial for pesticide control in Australia is timing, and it has been the work of departments of agriculture applied to properties and used by farmers that has allowed this timing to become critical and chemical use to fall as dramatically as it has fallen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians can be assured that, whenever they pick up from a shelf an item of foodstuff that has been made in Australia, it has met the most rigorous demands and that the chemical level in it will in 80 per cent of the cases be zero&mdash;that is, non-recordable; no effective toxic chemical at all&mdash;and in 99.7 per cent of cases be below the minimum allowable levels, which themselves are well below the levels that are accepted in the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other real change that has occurred in respect of toxic pesticide use for which farmers ought to be commended is the change in application. Whereas once farmers used large-volume spray rigs in order to saturate an orchard or a field with pesticide, those rigs have now been replaced by equipment that uses atomiser jets that allow for a very small application. I illustrate that statement as follows: if I were to have on my desk a basketball, it would cover about one corner; but, if I were to fill that basketball with ping-pong balls and then pour them over my desk, the entire desk would be covered by ping-pong balls. I use that illustration because presently in agriculture in Australia the minimum droplet size is used. In terms of droplet size, farmers are covering their farms and orchards with chemicals along the lines of ping-pong balls rather than basketballs. So, using small droplet size, one-twentieth of the quantity of chemical achieves precisely the same end result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of my remarks and of this motion are to reassure all Australian consumers that the products that they pick up on the shelves, particularly those produced in Australia, not only are entirely harmless but also in fact have a lower chemical residue than that tolerated by the rest of the world. More than that, Australian producers have led the field in minimising chemical use because it has been in their own interests to do so and because they have been the people most at risk from excessive use in the past. Frankly, Mr Deputy Speaker, if you are concerned about the quantity of chemical that you may imagine you are ingesting, may I simply recommend that you eat a little less, because it is not the chemical that is doing you harm; it is the natural chemicals in the fruit that you will be ingesting. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The only criticism I have is that we do not have enough time to speak on this matter. It is one of the most important issues in Australia. I am very pleased to be involved in this debate because there is no doubt that Australian farmers have come to understand the need to reduce the amount of chemicals that are used.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I wish to speak about is the very exciting integrated pest management program that is under way in Bundaberg. At the outset I would like to compliment John and Penny Hall from Crop Tech Laboratories Pty Ltd, Newfarm Road, Alloway in Bundaberg, who are involved in the integrated pest management program and who are dedicated to improving not only the environment but the agricultural sector. It is that type of research and dedication that is so important. I was very pleased when our current Treasurer (Mr Kerin), at the time Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, visited Crop Tech and met the fruit and vegetable growers in Bundaberg this year to see what exciting things the IPM program is doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because time will run out before I finish, I would like to get in as much as I can regarding the Bundaberg IPM program. Growers were facing rapidly escalating pest problems that had not been solved by high pesticide use. With the downturn in prices, of course, that was creating a massive squeeze. They have now enthusiastically embraced this community based approach to develop a sustainable pest management system. This program has a high emphasis on training growers in improved crop management practices, such as better crop hygiene&mdash;which is vital&mdash;and the use of crop rotations; close crop monitoring and pest identification; spraying of chemicals only when necessary; selection of products that are safer to beneficial insects; and the release of parasites and predators to control pests. As the honourable member for Wakefield mentioned, there are the goodies and the baddies among insects and other parasites in the fruit and vegetable environment. By learning about technology we are able to minimise the effects that they have on our fruit and vegetables and reduce the amount of chemicals that are needed, and in doing so of course reduce the cost structure for our farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fruit and vegetable growers of Bundaberg, Childers and Gin Gin districts who care about our future will now proudly display the IPM logo on their produce. I am pleased to hold it up for all to see. The logo will soon appear on selected fruit and vegetables from the Bundaberg region. It will signify the growers' commitment to minimal pesticide usage. To be authorised to use this logo, the grower must have satisfied the IPM committee that he or she has put into practice the principles of integrated pest management, IPM. Users of the logo must maintain a responsible attitude towards minimising pesticide usage and incorporating alternative means of pest management where possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fruit and vegetable growers in the Bundaberg region have taken this very innovative and positive step to protect the future of their industry and the environment. The $200,000 IPM project was designed and initiated, as I have said, by Crop Tech Research, a private consultancy and research organisation based in Bundaberg. The project is funded by the growers of the Bundaberg, Gin Gin and Childers areas, the Committee of Direction of Fruit Marketing and the Horticultural Research Development Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have our State body, along with the Government and private enterprise, working to produce the best technology for the industry. The objective is to introduce and develop in Bundaberg for the Queensland fruit and vegetable industry an integrated pest management pilot program which will reduce the growers' reliance on chemicals as the main tool in pest and disease control, and to develop new and innovative control options for inclusion in a whole farm pest management strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to point out&mdash;and I am sure that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, have partaken of our great produce from the Bundaberg area&mdash;that we are now the leading horticultural section in Australia. The fruit and vegetable industry in Queensland is now worth some $700m&mdash;a massive industry. Of course, we are looking overseas to expand our markets and we have already gained market access in New Zealand and in South East Asia. The Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) is fully aware of and committed to those export initiatives. Through his innovation and hard work with AQIS and through the protocol arrangements with New Zealand we have been able to break down some of the barriers, particularly with cucurbit crops, to gain better market access. Bundaberg is well known for producing the best cucumbers and zucchinis in Australia and there is a massive opportunity and market for them in New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The grower awareness of the philosophy of integrated pest management principles has improved in response to the planned extension program. As part of the program, two IPM videos have been produced and distributed to growers. Pest and disease activity on a wide range of crops, with advice on their management, has been the topic of daily radio and newspaper reports. As well as all the technology, it is a matter of getting all the information out to the growers and getting them to relate and communicate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An extensive grid system of 160 pheromone traps has been used to monitor the distribution and population dynamics of potato moth, the major pest of tomatoes in the region. Weekly data are used to plot areas of heavy infestation on GIS software, and the resultant maps are published weekly. The sources of these infestations are identified and offending growers are counselled on crop hygiene. In other words, we are monitoring on a daily and weekly basis. If producers fail to comply with the advice offered, the IPM coordinator has the power under the Plant Protection Act to order the destruction of the crop. As a result of the IPM program the average time taken for the removal of crop residues has dramatically decreased. This is reflected by a significant reduction in population levels and subsequent damage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The expected continued decline in pest populations will enable the program to address the use and encouragement of beneficial insects that have been suppressed by heavy chemical use. This is one of the sad aspects of overuse of chemicals. We not only kill the bad insects, but also kill the predators that can actually do a better job through mother nature. The next stage of the program will see the establishment of a comprehensive monitoring system for tree crops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the integrated pest management program is widely known in the citrus and other tree crop industries in other areas, very little was known by local growers of the principles that could apply to vegetables and trees in our region. We are now emerging as a fast growing area for avocadoes and mangoes. Sadly, this morning I spoke to two avocado growers in the Childers region who were hit by a severe hailstorm last night. We will not know for quite some time how much of a crop loss they will suffer because some of their crop was just setting. Custard apples and mangoes have been damaged as well. But our area is expanding in tree crops as well as in the vegetable area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many growers mistakenly thought that the IPM program meant biological control or organic gardening and were apprehensive. The perceived benefits were, however, much more attractive than the alarming situation they faced. The program received very good support when it was proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Education was therefore a first step towards creating an awareness of the basics of IPM. Two seminars were run, a manual was produced outlining the principles of IPM in our situation and two videos were produced dealing with cultural control and the benefits of monitoring crops spraying only when necessary instead of on a rigid program. Over 300 daily radio reports on both the ABC and the commercial radio station 4BU have been used to pass on information on the activity of pests and diseases to help growers with monitoring operations and ward off potential problems. The great aspect about that is that private companies and the ABC are cooperating and working together. With that sort of approach we are going to overcome many of the difficulties in agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we have come a long way in the last few years. The one positive thing to come out of the downturn or the rural crisis is the realisation finally that we have to work together. We have to work smarter as well as harder. It is through this type of technology that we will improve the profitability of farmers, reduce the reliance on chemicals and therefore reduce the health risk for workers and farmers alike. We will also succeed in being more competitive with the rest of the world. As I have said, I am only sorry that time does not allow me to continue, because this is one of the most important private members' Bills ever put before the House. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion proposed by the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) that we commend Australian agriculturalists on the way they have used toxic pesticides over the last 20 years. I think all Australians realise that it would be far better for us to grow our crops and produce our food with minimum use of insecticides, fungicides and pesticides, but we have to be realistic about this and remember that we face a great challenge from the insects that inhabit the world. If we did not use insecticides and pesticides to a certain level, millions of people would starve because our crops would be raided by insects. Handling this food production problem is a real challenge for mankind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable members who have spoken to this motion have extensive horticultural areas in their electorates. My electorate is no different from theirs, in that all of McDonald's chips for Australia come out of the northern part of Australia and are processed in my electorate. Northern Tasmania grows a tremendous amount of peas and other processing vegetables, and therefore we are very familiar with chemicals, pesticides and fungicides and take a lot of care with them. People have realised in the last 20 years that the long term impact of these chemicals on the quality of our food might be quite marked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The farming community certainly has been conscious of the need for care. The farming community, in general, is very careful in its use of chemicals. Farmers are essentially the world's first environmentalists, because they are always concerned about the way in which they treat their soils and the way in which things may accumulate in the soil, and about the products which they produce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only today I received some information about a survey conducted by Frank Small and Associates on the opinion of farmers and their use of chemicals. The farming community was asked whether farmers should prove knowledge of correct use. Ninety-five per cent of the farming community surveyed indicated that they believe farming people should be able to show that they know how to correctly use the chemicals which they are putting on their crops. The survey also showed that 88 per cent of the farming community believed that the chemicals they were using may contaminate water and soil. That is not unexpected, because I think many of the horticultural farmers in this country are aware of the long term implications of use of pesticides and chemicals. Seventy-three per cent of our farmers actually believe that they use too many chemicals. That makes me question why that has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The horticultural farming community has found that the pressures of commerce and of price and demand have been such that they have often used chemicals to maximise production, without giving a lot of thought to the long term effects. As a consequence, they have used more chemicals than they really wanted to or felt it was good to use. Therefore, as a country we need to think carefully about the demand which is placed on our food producers, ensuring that price pressures do not lead our farmers to use chemicals as a short term measure to increase their productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that farmers are very conscious of the effects of toxic pesticides and have done a considerable amount to reduce their use. I agree with the previous speaker, the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice), that that attitude has been helped by the scientists who have undertaken to find more effective ways of producing less harmful substances which can be used to spray our crops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three different types of compounds. There are the old compounds, of which very large quantities had to be used&mdash;for example, anything from 1,500 to 5,000 kilograms per hectare&mdash;and now we are down to using one-thousandth of a kilogram per hectare. Massive amounts of the old compounds were required to get any effect, while with the modern compounds the quantity required has been drastically reduced. We have also the experimental compounds, which as yet are not named but are being worked on by scientists, which will ensure that minimal amounts are used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general, the journals on this&mdash;for example, the journal of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Association&mdash;state that Australia's use of farm chemicals is low, owing to Australia's climate, geography and topography. That has come about because Australian farmers have taken on the new chemicals available and have cautiously applied them to their crops. To illustrate further the extent of this reduction, the National Health and Medical Research Council's market survey of 1987 shows that there has been a change in the incidence of detection of various chemicals in food. I will use as examples three types of chemicals to show that there has been a change which has largely been brought about by farmers changing chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1985 the detection rate of lindane was 7 per cent in the approximately 1,100 areas surveyed. In 1987 no lindane was detected in the 691 areas surveyed. In 1985 the detection rate for DDT analogues was 14 per cent. In 1986 it had reduced to 10 per cent and by 1987 it was down to 9 per cent. We see a gradual decline in the presence of these chemicals in our food. In 1985 there was a 1.9 incidence rate of hexachlorobenzene and by 1987 that incidence had dropped to zero. In the 691 vegetable and food samples taken, it had dropped down to zero&mdash;there was no incidence of that chemical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have evidence that the chemicals in our food are on the decline and we also know that the chemicals are being used in much smaller quantities. Various groups have been established quite voluntarily. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice), spoke of one in Bundaberg with which I am familiar. There is also one in northern Tasmania known as the Tasmanian Agricultural Productivity Group. That has been established voluntarily by people involved in the chemical industry to try to ensure that farmers are well educated about this matter and that they are taking action to reduce the use of toxic chemicals. I congratulate the farming people of Australia for taking this action, and I fully support this motion moved by the honourable member for Wakefield. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I congratulate the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) on presenting this private member's motion. I do not have any agriculturalists&mdash;it is a lovely term, is it not&mdash;in my electorate, but I have a host of consumers and, to some extent, it is consumers who are driving and requiring of producers that we use a minimum amount of pesticides and artificial means by which to keep vegetables&mdash;especially fruit products&mdash;as free from disease as possible. But there has to be some interplay between consumers, producers and retailers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the honourable member is quite right to congratulate agriculturalists in the reduction of the use of pesticides, et cetera&mdash;the figures are in&mdash;consumers and even supermarkets have a role to play in educating people as to what is and is not possible. At the same time though, I think we should continue to push the producers to ensure that we have the best standards in the use of pesticides and the safest means of producing good vegetables and other products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sorry that I missed the speech of the honourable member for Wakefield. I am not sure whether he mentioned the joint initiative in the apple and pear industry whereby growers, environmental groups and consumers have recently got together in the last 14 months or so in order to reduce pesticide use in the growing of apples and pears. This is a joint initiative of the Apple and Pear Growers Association and consumer and environmental groups with the aim of reducing pesticide use by 50 per cent over the next five years. That is a marvellous step and is very much in line with the motion. There is also an agreement to de-list 12 currently used pesticides in that industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is basically a good news story, although from time to time we will always hear that someone is blowing the whistle on the use of pesticides in the production of food products&mdash;and thank goodness for the whistle blowers. Australia, by and large, has an excellent reputation for producing and marketing food that not only meets but also exceeds world residue standards. We are one of the few countries that continues to publish and make available internationally information on chemical residues in foods. I note that we publish annually a market basket survey on prepared food and that results are regularly released to the World Health Organisation and to Codex Alimentarius. We also have a national residue survey. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Information is one of the most powerful mechanisms by which we can force agriculturalists&mdash;producers&mdash;to further reduce residues. Agriculturalists should inform consumers of the real limits on the reduction in pesticides. A number of factors have contributed to the decline in use of pesticides in the last 10, 15 or 20 years. I will run through a number of those factors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, but not necessarily foremost, there has been an increased cost in the use of many pesticides, and that plays on any producer's mind. Producers have looked to more cost-effective ways to reduce the damage to their crops and they have been discouraged through this high cost of using broad spectrum approaches to spraying for more efficient use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been domestic and international trade pressures brought about mainly by consumer and public health concerns for personal health and environmental health, forcing a reduction in the use of pesticides. For the agriculturalist&mdash;the farmer&mdash;there is the very real self-interest. The farmer is the one who has to get out there and spray this stuff. Farmers have a real concern for their own health in using these materials over a very long period and, of course, in much larger amounts than we would take in as consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a general shift, most noticeable in the USA but also in Australia, to tighter standards&mdash;the technological fix; to better chemicals, so that more specific and effective action is taken on target species, not just spraying for a broad range of species; to the use of materials that are less persistent in the environment and that degrade more quickly, so that their effect is not felt in soils for many years. These materials are designed to minimise residues in foods so that, by the time they reach the consumer, they are far less in evidence on the apple, pear, or whatever other product we are about to eat. The materials also give a better delivery of technology so that we do not broadly spray areas that are not designed to be covered at all and so that spray does not drift into townships and so on. We are much more focused on where these materials need to be delivered to a crop&mdash;to the target audience, if you like&mdash;and that they are delivered properly and without too much waste or overhang. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is better monitoring of the use of these products and a great deal more scientific endeavour to check out the results of the use of the products and to feed back information to farmers about the effect this will have on their crops as well as their health and the health of consumers. A far better understanding of the biology of pests has evolved which enables us to use not just a chemical means of controlling pests as they might affect various products. I will list a few others. There is a better knowledge of the impacts of the chemicals used; that is, toxicity to other organisms and persistence in the environment, which gives us a better informed grower and consumer. There has also been an increase in the use of natural products and derivatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to a recent book by Christopher Robbins called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Poisoned Harvest&mdash;A Consumer's Guide To Pesticide Use and Abuse</EMPHASIS>. We have come a long way since the publication of the book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Silent Spring</EMPHASIS> 20 years ago. It opened the lead on this horrible overuse of pesticides. Robbins indicates in his book that there has been a reduction in the use of pesticides. He does not say the game is over, that we have won the fight or that we need to relax our view on these things&mdash;he is not saying that at all&mdash;but he says that we have come a long way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Robbins points out some large supermarkets in the United Kingdom that have very large monitoring programs on the sorts of residues found in products that they sell to consumers. In a sense, supermarkets are competing with each other for the consumer's dollar on the basis of ensuring as low a residue as possible from these sorts of chemicals. That is healthy. Supermarket retailers react to the consumers. Obviously, consumers are now sufficiently well-informed to force not only the farmer but also the retailer of these goods to ensure we have the best possible standards. </PARA>

In this case the crew abandoned ship in heavy weather on 7 July 1991 after a fracture developed in shell plating and No. 3 hold had been flooded.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Melete</EMPHASIS>, a Greek flag bulk carrier of 72,063 tonnes deadweight, was built in 1975. It loaded with iron ore at Dampier. The master sent out a distress message on 24 August 1991, when south of Mauritius, stating the ship was taking water in the forward part of the ship. No further messages were received from the ship and a search located two survivors of the crew of 27. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These ships&mdash;events such as these and structural failures&mdash;hark back to the days of the coffin ships of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. Effectively, we have ships that are unsound to one degree or another; ships that are not being adequately inspected; ships that are on shipping registers not obviously meeting the requirements under international conventions and international standards or international maritime organisation standards; and ships often crewed by, effectively, seagoing labourers, where there may be one or two certificated officers on board and the rest of the crew learning their trades as they go along. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A large part of what is involved is Third World labour: the exploitation of people who have little skill and few employment prospects and who are desperate to get an income and a job. In other cases, safety equipment is non-existent or does not work. Crews cannot complain. If they do complain they lose their jobs. Because there is little monitoring, there is a lack of safety equipment, a deficiency in safety equipment that can be hidden. In some cases lifeboats have been welded down on the vessel to stop them banging around. That is fine unless the lifeboat needs to be used&mdash;obviously, in some cases lifeboats have not been used. Firefighting equipment is sometimes totally inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More recently we had the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> off the Western Australian coast, a Greek flag tanker &mdash;again, a vessel which, at the time of construction, had a bow plate of about three-quarters of an inch, 18 millimetres. At the time of the incident some of the bow plates were down to a one millimetre thickness. The inquiry into the sinking of that vessel is under way. We will see what comes out of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Undoubtedly, there are major breaches of standards involved. There are major failings in inspection standards on the part of the countries of registry of those ships. There is infamous behaviour by the operators and owners of those ships. That responsibility has to pass down the line to shippers and the users of those ships, not to mention the insurance companies, who are also involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one very simple answer to this. It is that insurance companies refuse to cover cargoes and ships unless those ships are proven to be seaworthy or unless the international classification societies have carried out, at the port of departure, inspections that prove the vessel is seaworthy. That is a very simple, easy answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Linked also to this is the damage to our environment. This is what in recent times has attracted attention in Australia. Our environment is priceless. We have fishing grounds that are of enormous concern to Australians and to our economy, and we have vessels coming onto this coast that are clearly not of required standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Towards the end of last year the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure went down to Port Kembla. At the suggestion of locals, we sought to inspect a vessel called the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Blooming Orchid</EMPHASIS>. That vessel was a rust bucket. The vessel was owned by German companies and crewed by Filipinos. Members of the Committee were denied an opportunity to inspect the vessel on the captain's words that the vessel `was in a condition that would endanger the safety of the members of the Committee if they went on board'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The vessel sailed from these shores; $500,000 worth of work was carried out. It was not able to load cargo. It was refused cargo because of its condition. It eventually found a cargo from Brazil to Singapore. On the way it again got into trouble. That vessel is now being repaired in Singapore. It came back into these waters in worse condition than it was when we sent it out towards the end of last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I raise the question: what price human life? What price no environment? What price are we prepared to accept in low freight rates to allow this kind of behaviour to go on?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is not just one for Australia; it is a question for our international trading partners and for the International Maritime Organisation. It is a question that has been taken up vigorously by the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins). I commend the Minister for the actions he has taken. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority has already initiated a pilot study to find out the performance and loading process of these vessels, whether the loading and unloading methods have a bearing upon their condition and what their condition is. The number of inspectors has been stepped up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this motion I seek the support of the House to increase the rate of inspection from the current 25 per cent&mdash;ideally so that all vessels coming here under foreign flags would be inspected.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support every word of the speech by the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris). The motion he has moved in the House this morning is commendable and echoes my own media release at the time of the sinking of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> which called for stricter application of seaworthiness certification requirements and a review of Australia's requirements of ships entering and leaving our ports and waters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without any doubt, the honourable member for Shortland is one of the most knowledgeable members on transport issues on either side of the House, particularly on his side of the House. It is a great shame that the honourable member for Shortland is not a Minister for transport. I think his knowledge and genuine sincerity in this area warrant giving him, above all of the Ministers for transport who currently represent the Government, a position. The content of the speech he has just given shows that he has both knowledge and sincere interest in the livelihood and well-being of seamen who go to sea and of the seagoing industry generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member's readiness to move this motion may give a clue to why a man with such talent and integrity is not better used by this Government. The motion calls on the Government to do what it has always been in the Government's power to do, and that is to enforce the highest safety standards for all shipping, be it Australian or foreign, in Australian waters. The motion exposes the hypocrisy of trying to evade Australia's responsibility under the safety conventions to ensure the seaworthiness of ships that enter and leave Australian ports, regardless of country of origin&mdash;not only the responsibility to Australia and our own coast but also the responsibility to keep the world's seas safe. The needless loss of life of seafarers is truly deplorable, regardless of country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unseaworthiness of vessels is of international concern. Unseaworthy vessels do not select the coastlines they sink alongside and they are just as dangerous one kilometre out of Australian waters as they are one kilometre within them. The Navigation Act gives wide powers to the Federal Government over all ships entering Australian waters and ports, the same power that it has over Australian vessels. Section 189 of the Navigation Act says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All ships shall be liable to inspection and survey.</PARA>
<PARA>So it is not just Australian ships. The power is comprehensive. Section 190AA(1) says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A surveyor may at any reasonable time go on board a ship and inspect the ship and any part of the ship, including the hull, boilers, machinery and equipment of the ship, and may require the certificates of the master or of any officer of the ship, or any certificate or other document relating to the ship, to be produced to him.</PARA>
<PARA>Sections 207 and 207A of the Navigation Act also define what unseaworthy and substandard conditions are on board ships. Section 207 says a ship is only seaworthy if:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">it is in a fit state as to condition of hull and equipment, boilers and machinery, stowage of ballast or cargo, number and qualifications of crew, including officers, and in every other respect, to encounter the ordinary perils of the voyage then entered upon.</PARA>
<PARA>If the ship is under foreign certification then it is unseaworthy if:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the condition of the ship or of its equipment does not correspond substantially with the particulars of that certificate or of any of those certificates.</PARA>
<PARA>It is substandard if it is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">for the purposes of this Act. . . seaworthy, but conditions on board. . . are clearly hazardous to safety or health.</PARA>
<PARA>That could include conditions such as the deck or engine area being covered in grease, causing seamen to fall and injure themselves or possibly be killed, as I suspect was the case with a Japanese engineer on board a ship in Australian waters just recently. He slipped in the engine compartment and was killed. He slipped on a deck that the rescuers were not able to walk upon because it was so greasy. The Act provides for the provisional detention, and then the detention, which can be indefinite unless the faults are remedied, of a ship that is unseaworthy or substandard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These conditions and provisions relate to all ships in Australian waters, not only to Australian ships. The authority for the determination of the above is none other than the Australian Maritime Safety Authority which was created by this Government. The Authority has the power to release a ship conditionally, for instance with a condition that it leave Australian waters and undertake repairs at a specified port. Why has the Government not utilised these very comprehensive powers to ensure the safety of Australian shipping lanes and our coastline and to ensure the lives of all seamen entering Australian waters?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins has tried to make foreign shipping a scapegoat for the Government's own failure to enforce maritime safety standards in our waters, which is nonsense since foreign vessels are subject to exactly the same safety provisions of the Navigation Act as Australian vessels as soon as they enter Australian waters. On 5 May the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> carried a report of Senator Collins's address to the Metal Trades Industry Association conference that was held the day before. The report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There have been some "scandalous and horrendous" examples of foreign ships where no-one knew how to operate the equipment, Senator Collins said. "In one case they did not know how to shut the engines off on the ship. Someone just started the engines in the home port and they were still running when they got here," he said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He said the life saving equipment aboard the Kirki was found to be in much the same condition as another foreign ship recently detained by AMSA&mdash;it had taken two days to get the other ship's life boats overboard.</PARA>
<PARA>That may explain why so many of these ships go down with all crews lost&mdash;simply because the lifeboats cannot be launched. The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Collins said Australian shipping standards were far superior to those used overseas. No Australian owned ship had ever been detained by the AMSA because of deficient safety standards, he said.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Collins completely missed the point, which was that many unsafe foreign ships were neither inspected nor detained; in some cases, such as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS>, they had been inspected recently and cleared. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> had been subjected to exactly the same procedures as Australian ships and cleared. There is nothing that makes an Australian ship inherently safer than a properly inspected foreign ship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not have a franchise on maritime soundness despite Senator Collins's boasts. We do have an international responsibility to ensure that, regardless of their nationality, all ships leaving Australian ports are found to be sound before they leave our waters so that they do not become a hazard to the rest of the world. The Government has not done this. It is a major concern if a ship founders or sinks anywhere at all&mdash;not only in Australian waters. The death of a seaman just outside our waters&mdash;or anywhere at all&mdash;is just as tragic as when it occurs in Australian waters. We do have an obligation to prevent these incidents when we are able, such as when Australia has the power to inspect and enforce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins has also sought to use this tragic issue to justify the Government's policy of cabotage protection. He said at the MTIA conference:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Government stopped cabotage and allowed free trade while insisting that foreign ships were up to the same structural efficiency, crew training and other standards as Australian ships, "you'd frighten away 90 per cent of the . . . people that we've had plying our coasts with sweated labour and death traps".</PARA>
<PARA>That is complete nonsense. Cabotage has nothing to do with safety. It relates by definition only to the coastal trade. The Government can and should ensure that foreign ships are up to the highest standards and it has the power under the Navigation Act to do so. Cabotage has nothing to do with making ships safer; it is simply a measure for preventing foreign ships from having access to Australian coastal routes. It does not and cannot apply to foreign ships engaged only in international trade in any event. They come and go through Australian ports regardless of the restrictions on the coastal trade. Senator Collins uses safety as a red herring to divert attention from the reality of cabotage protection. That is, it is a purely protectionist measure for a completely unionised industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scapegoat campaign by Senator Collins is a fraudulent attempt to deflect attention from the Government's protectionism and its failure to carry out its obligations to ensure the safety of all shipping in our waters. The honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) should know better than to echo Senator Collins's absurd claims&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Shortland has it right. The tragedy of losses at sea demands action, and the appropriate action is to step up the inspections of foreign vessels, and of all vessels, in Australian waters, for reasons that are humane and also for genuine self-interest. We do not want ships sinking in our waters. We do not want them sinking near our waters. We do not want them sinking anywhere else in the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If last year over 200 people had died in air crashes, there would be massive international publicity. Yet, almost unnoticed, during 1990 over 200 seamen lost their lives. Correctly, very stringent safety conditions apply to aircraft, but are the lives of passengers and crew on aircraft more important than the lives of passengers and crew on ships?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every so often an item appears in the media about ships being refused permission to load because of their condition. Predictably there is condemnation of the Australian workers involved, as the newspapers or Opposition members use it as a further excuse for union bashing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened to the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp). I have heard many of his speeches on shipping, as he has heard many of mine. That is why he could quote me before I rose to speak. I put to the honourable member for Gilmore that if he is so concerned and if he is genuine here today, he should come with me down to Port Kembla the next time a ship is delayed there, instead of staying in Goulburn and putting out a press release condemning the workers in Port Kembla. He should come down. He has not been to inspect the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Berlina</EMPHASIS>, which was there last week, or the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Blooming Orchid</EMPHASIS>, which was there last year and which the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) and I have seen. It is okay for the honourable member for Gilmore to stand in this House and express fine sentiments, but they are different from the comments and the statements that he puts out when a ship is delayed in Port Kembla. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told that our shipping costs are a national scandal and that the only way to bring them down is to open up the Australian coast to foreign vessels. Before we get too gung ho about foreign ships, we should be aware of the dangerous rust buckets we would be permitting around our coast. Senator Collins was right about that, and about the loss of life and cargo and the pollution of our coastline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Imagine the outcry if clapped-out aircraft were permitted to operate through our airports on our domestic routes. Remember the outcry a few years ago when second-hand buses were being imported and when second-hand trucks were being imported and let loose on our roads. Why the silence about the rust buckets that continue to ply our coast?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have outlined to this House before the dangers associated with flag of convenience ships, ships registered in countries that do not apply proper standards for the safety and seaworthiness of these ships or the lives of the seamen on them. A recent shipping trend has been second registries, where the national flag is retained on a ship registered in some other dominion, as in the case of France, which has 39 ships now on the books of Kerguelen Island. Kerguelen Island is a French territory in Antarctica populated by penguins. The French have 39 ships registered there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This form of registration keeps the vessels in the national fleet. Until recently they would only employ officers and not ratings from the host country. However, the officers are now being replaced by unemployed officers from Eastern Bloc countries. In many ways this method of registration is no better than flag of convenience registration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of flag of convenience ships over recent years has remained constant. But I am sure that it comes as no surprise to honourable members that Panama, Liberia and Cyprus alone accounted for 39 of the shipping casualties in 1990. Most definitely, second registries are the new fad amongst the world's shipowners, as they avoid tax and refuse to meet accepted standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said only last week, the Norwegian registered coal ship the MV<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Berlina</EMPHASIS> was in Port Kembla harbour unfit to load. It has been correctly referred to as a rust bucket by the local Illawarra media. This ship was crewed by Filipinos, although owned by people in Norway. It was surveyed by the port surveyor who, after inspecting the vessel, immediately ordered that it not be loaded owing to large cracks in the main deck and in between all the cargo hatches. As well, there were numerous other deficiencies and safety problems. In fact, many of the cracks on this ship were covered with tar paper. This is the fourth ship to be held at Port Kembla in the past 12 months because of the need for similar repairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Shortland referred to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Blooming Orchid</EMPHASIS>. `Blooming' Orchid is right! We saw this ship last October. It has been condemned seven times in Australian ports since 1986. The last time, it escaped from Port Kembla and was supposed to be repaired in Singapore. It almost foundered carrying iron ore from Brazil to Singapore. Undoubtedly it will be back in these ports again. Really, it is an international scandal. The loss of bulk carriers most certainly is an international scandal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As this motion says, 21 of these vessels have been lost, and six of them were carrying cargoes from north-west Australian ports. The mining industry is most vocal about the need for the cheapest ships possible and says that the OECD standard is not valid for comparison with Australian shipping. Let the honourable member for Gilmore push that line. The waters off Western Australia are becoming a graveyard for the world's ageing shipping. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mineral Diamond</EMPHASIS> sailed from Western Australia with a crew of 27 and disappeared. All that was found was the discolouration of the sea where it was thought that the ship had gone down. There were no survivors. As well as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mineral Diamond</EMPHASIS>, the bulk iron ore carriers that have foundered or sunk off the Western Australia coast since late last year are the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Manila Transporter</EMPHASIS>, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Alexandre P</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Melete</EMPHASIS>. How much longer are these rust buckets going to be permitted to enter Australian ports?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When people start talking about bans being put on ships, they are often criticised. When there is a ban on a ship in Port Kembla harbour I always make a point of going down there and personally inspecting the vessel. As I have said time and time again, most of them are just rust buckets. I defy anyone, including members of this House, to go to sea in some of the ships that have been rightly banned in Port Kembla. I always invite Opposition members to come down to Port Kembla to inspect the ships with me, to talk to the workers and to actually see what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was talking about these rust buckets to the Secretary of the Seamen's Union in Port Kembla last week, he informed me that they videotape every ship which has a ban on it. If members of the Opposition, or even members of the Government, cannot come down to Port Kembla, I will make these videos available to them so that they can see the condition of these ships that the Seamen's Union has put bans on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage it is not clear, because of the lack of information, just how many of the sunken vessels were lost owing to unseaworthiness alone or as a result of inadequately trained crews or poor seamanship&mdash;or, as I suspect, as a result of a combination of all of these. Vessels in bad seas need well-qualified, expert crews to handle them. There may be only one or two certified or qualified officers on board many of the vessels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Often there is a language difficulty between the officers and the crew. The crew, which is being paid poverty wages, effectively is made up of seagoing labourers.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear, as the honourable member for Shortland said, that in recent years we have seen a re-emergence of the coffin ships of past centuries, when ships were sent to sea in an unseaworthy condition or in a condition that was likely to result in their loss and the loss of their crews. For years, seafarers of the world have been pointing to the deplorable condition of many of these vessels that operate as flag of convenience ships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like particularly to pay tribute to the Seamen's Union here in Australia, and especially to my own group at Port Kembla, for the work it has done in this field. For their efforts the members of the union have generally been portrayed as people crying wolf, people who do not want to work or people who would draw undue attention to the safety aspects of ship operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now seeing the result of the continued neglect of this major safety issue by the shipping nations of the world. The irony is that attention is now being drawn to this practice of using coffin ships not because of concern about the loss of lives at sea but because of concern about the marine and global environment. That environment is a matter of major concern; however, one would have thought priority would have been given to the needless loss of sailors' lives at sea. I sometimes wonder whether it is because most of those sailors come from Third World countries that no-one is interested in them. If they came from Britain or the United States or Australia, it might be different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a concern in this nation about the risk posed to our coastal marine environment by oil spillage from poorly crewed vessels and from unseaworthy vessels in the event that they are wrecked. Recently we had the problem with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> off the Western Australian coast. I suspect the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) will tell us about that again. This focused our attention on the risk to Australia's fishing conditions and our coastal environment.

As the Parliament is aware, and as the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) just mentioned, I am on the record on this matter already on page 2233 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of 17 October, when I raised a lot of the matters that have concerned me in this particular area. I raised them relating specifically to areas of my electorate when the ship <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS>, which has been referred to today, posed a major threat to one of the major industries of my electorate, namely the lobster industry. We were threatened for many days when that ship sank and spilled some 60,000 tonnes of light crude oil into the sea. That oil covered all the reefs and the marine environment that supports a huge export industry for Australia &mdash;the fishing industry in general and the lobster industry in particular.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Allowing rust buckets to operate within Australia has many problems, the first being human safety&mdash;which other members have mentioned&mdash;and the second being possible environmental damage. There must be a cost. The honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) has been talking about the problems in recent times facing some of the names of Lloyds. This has been substantially caused by losses incurred through the loss of these rust buckets and, in particular, the cargoes they were carrying. Naturally, the response from the insurance industry will be higher premiums. It is time that this issue is taken up. The insurance companies themselves should be starting to set their premiums possibly according to the port of registration and certainly after checking their own inspection criteria. Every ship has marks that are set by Lloyds. It is just further evidence of the need for insurance companies to set the level of cargo that each ship should carry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a fact that too much of our waters are available for these sorts of environmentally damaging ships to sail in&mdash;ones that carry environmentally or potentially environmentally damaging cargo. They seem to come in close along the coast wherever it suits them and certainly do not follow a straight line from their point of departure. Some people have suggested that this is to drop a few drugs off on the way down. Others have suggested that they pick up some special tide. But, if this Committee is formed, we should be looking to designate certain areas where ships operate when they arrive and depart our shores. I am not sure that the little benefit they get from a bit of tide can compensate for the losses that might occur to other industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to talk about how we manage this problem. The honourable member for Throsby pointed out that the Seamen's Union puts bans on these ships. I hope this Committee will, if it is necessary, provide through government the necessary resources for government inspectors to do this task. I do not believe it is a role for trade unions. They might be the only people there, and I accept that, but it does bring criticism upon them. At times they have been known to take unnecessary action, and I think there is probably a better understanding today of the level of action that should be taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember that in my State some years ago I lunched with some people who were involved in the manufacture of fibrous piping in Western Australia, working with the Hardie company. They had very efficient plant that was working three days a week because that was all the pipe they could sell in Western Australia. They had Asian subsidiaries that were overloaded with work. There was a boom in development work in Asia at the time and they thought they would try to service some of their possible contracts out of Perth. They went to the shipping company that was servicing, very competitively, their Asian subsidiaries and invited it to give quotes to come to Australia. The shipping company refused point blank to do so and said it would not operate out of Australian ports because of the difficulties it had coming and going. I do not know whether some of its ships were of a very low standard, but Hardie's is a very responsible company and I am sure it would wish to get its product safely to port. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to remember that there is certainly an understanding in international shipping and other areas that Australia is a very difficult place in which to operate. On one occasion when I queried why Australian freight rates were about the same level as those in the war zone of the Red Sea, one shipper said to me, `Up there we lose a boat occasionally, but in Australia we never know when we are going to get them back'. I think those matters must be put on the record as well, because whilst I support wholeheartedly the proposal of shipping coming in and out of Australian ports&mdash;I am on the record as making some other suggestions&mdash;I believe that in that process we must be extremely responsible. </PARA>

Yet we see this time and time again. When people do those sorts of things, it brings the issue of safety&mdash;which is very important&mdash;into disrespect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it on the record that, whilst I am totally supportive of the motion&mdash;and I am totally supportive of the concerns expressed today by members of the Government&mdash;when we have our inquiry we must make sure that we do not follow what Australians and other people seem to do so often: go from the extreme of a ship that is an eighth of an inch thick to demanding rules and conditions that would make Australia totally uncompetitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I would like to remind people of the benefits that we could achieve as a nation if we had a major international shipping industry. I am not a supporter of a closed shop in any way, and for that reason I believe our interstate shipping should be more competitive and open to other operators. We hear the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) talking constantly about value added. The quickest bit of value adding that we can do is to freight our own goods in and out of our own country. That is a pretty significant fact. I have just checked some figures, and for 1988-89 shipping freighted into Australia totalled 33 million tonnes and shipping freighted out of the country totalled 267 million tonnes. That is a lot of freight. Every bit of freight leaving Australia goes a long way towards improving our finances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The current account deficit for 1990-91 was $15.7 billion. The export aspect of shipping represented a loss of $605m, and the loss on shipping for imports was $3 billion. Three and a half billion dollars out of $15 1/2 billion related to shipping in and out of this country. Surely we should be looking to increase our shipping on world best practice. That includes letting seamen go to sea for longer. Maybe we can get some flats on the boats so they can take their families with them. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a great pity. On the one hand, he said that he wants to increase Australia's involvement and do something about international safety standards yet, on the other hand, he is saying that he wants to allow all the foreign ships to take over Australia's internal and domestic trade. Those two things have to be in conflict. After all, the present rule, as honourable members would know, is that a foreign vessel can ship cargo on the domestic routes only if there is no Australian vessel available. It seems that the honourable member for O'Connor is saying that he is happy to see the foreign vessels come in. That flies in the face of what he just said: he wants to see more freight or goods carried by Australian vessels.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for O'Connor also had a crack at the unions in the building industry again. It is typical. He keeps forgetting that they have an enviable record when it comes to safety. It was the unions in the building industry that set standards for scaffolding. It was the unions in the building industry that set standards for the use of asbestos and finally got people to remove asbestos, and that set even air-conditioning standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the comments of the honourable member for O'Connor in supporting what the honourable member for Shortland and others have said here, but I think that he ought to rethink his own position, as far as the Liberal Party is concerned, when it comes to allowing foreign vessels to come into Australia. He is willing to let flag of convenience ships come to Australia. He has just made a speech that I took note of. I thought it was an excellent contribution in regard to safety issues. He talked about the problems that have come about because of the lack of standards. That is what this issue is about; it is a question of safety and an issue of seaworthiness of foreign vessels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge the point made by the honourable member for O'Connor about the Greek vessel, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS>. I was told that the thickness of the plating was the thickness of a sheet of newspaper, instead of the width of a matchbox. We need to argue the issue of safety. If we are going to do that we need to protect Australian ports. At the moment there is simply no way that we can test the standards of the ships coming here. There is no pre-inspection system; there is no international arrangement whereby we know the standard of the ships coming here. We do not know anything about them until they actually berth. They are the issues we ought to tackle. It certainly raises the question of the standards of the flag of convenience ships&mdash;those that register in countries such as Panama and Liberia for virtually little or no cost. The standards of those ships are inadequate, if they exist at all. The consequence is risk to property, people, seamen and passengers. I join with other speakers in saying that there is a need for tougher enforceable international standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the right as a country to know exactly what vessels are coming into port. We have a right to know not only that they are coming here, but also whether they are safe. Yet this information is not available. We have no advice as to the adequacy of standards. We have no certification of the standards. As we found with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS>, we could have a ship break up a few kilometres from the coast and there is always the risk of loss of property and of lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would argue in line with what is being said in the motion. Not only should we note it, but Australia needs to do more about it. There is surely a need for an international forum on this issue. There is a need to give greater priority to internationally enforced standards. Where we have ships of convenience moving around this nation, placing at risk property and people, then we need to speak out against it. That is exactly what the motion is doing: it is expressing concern about the unseaworthiness of foreign vessels visiting Australian ports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Shortland made the point&mdash;I want to reiterate it&mdash;that we do not need any further argument about it; we need standards. We need to have an increase in the inspection rules. We need to invoke some sort of system whereby we know that there will be a standards test on ships at their port of departure. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to congratulate the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) on moving this motion this morning. The motion notes the loss of bulk carriers, deplores the needless loss of life of seafarers, expresses concern about the unseaworthiness of foreign vessels visiting Australian ports and calls on the Minister for Aviation and Shipping Support (Senator Collins) to take action. That is a very appropriate motion for him to move.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is very dependent on bulk carriers because our iron ore, iron ore concentrates, coal, wheat, alumina and bauxite are all dependent on export by bulk carriers. This motion is aimed at bulk carriers and rectifying the deficiencies in safety factors. The problem with the debate as it has progressed, however, is that we have been able to detect within members of the Australian Labor Party the wish to use safety features as a process whereby they can make work for painters and dockers and perhaps provide unnecessarily stringent requirements, set not by safety standards but by the whim of those who happen to be on the job doing it. Their self-interest will naturally encourage them to go beyond international standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia needs to observe international standards. We have plenty of powers under the Navigation Act to apply to foreign vessels the requirements that are necessary. The fact is that it is not being done. The way in which the Government has chosen to protect the Australian industry is by imposing cabotage charges. That has the effect of frightening off all but the bravest of shippers wanting to put their vessels on the Australian coast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a recent survey it was found that 4 per cent of inward cargoes come fortnightly or more often, and 70 per cent of inward cargoes come monthly or less frequently. By contrast, 19 per cent of outward cargoes go fortnightly or more often, 29 per cent go between fortnightly and monthly, and 52 per cent go monthly or less frequently. It is not surprising that exporters are really concerned about shipping movements. When a question was put to them as to whether they would prefer slight freight charges or a decrease in the turnaround time, the cry was that a slight increase in freight charges could easily be carried by Australian exporters, but the tying up of vessels and the inconsistency of our delivery times are of greatest concern to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, I would like to see proper and effective safety measures applied to vessels carrying bulk cargoes on the Australian coast. It is important for the environment, for the protection of lives and for fishing opportunities that this be done. We should ensure that there is no pollution and damage to Australia by making sure that vessels safely carry the cargoes that we want them to carry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Alternatively, safety should not be used, as it is used in some areas, as a means of gaining extra opportunities for militant unions to apply their rules to this process. So the line between those two things has been part of the debate today. The honourable member for Shortland was impeccable in his presentation, not seeking to move into that protectionist union supporting attitude. Other speakers have not been so careful and they stand exposed for the real purpose of the motion. I support the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I grieve for my State of Tasmania, and first of all for the uncertainty in it. For the last seven weeks I have spoken about the Greens. I think it is pretty well known that I have not got very much time for the five Greens in Tasmania. I believe that they have created a situation in which Tasmania is on its knees. Many of the press reports about the Greens have been very damaging to the State of Tasmania. I believe also that people from this other island&mdash;I mean Australia&mdash;have a false illusion of what has happened in Tasmania. It is all very well to care for the birds and the bees and the trees but, regrettably, there are a lot of people who need protection and who need help and assistance. I believe that the five Greens collectively have done a lot of damage to Tasmania. I first of all grieve on that particular point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tasmania is a very unusual place. It has 430,000 people, with about 200,000 located in the south of the State. It is a very close community. After being a politician for 16 years, I have begun to understand a little bit of the intricacies of Tasmania, which can sometimes be to the detriment of people in public life. They can be very enclosed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very difficult to criticise the media because the media has the last laugh. It can ruin a politician. I do not wish to criticise the media. However, there are a small group in Tasmania who might eat together and have a few drinks together, but they know exactly what is going on. I watch with interest sometimes the way that they create a situation in which the people of Tasmania can believe it and the people on this other island, this big island&mdash;the mainland&mdash;can believe it also. That has perturbed me for a long time. I believe that what they have done to Robin Gray has been absolutely cardinal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this place I have parliamentary privilege. I do not usually like that; I usually like to say exactly what I think and what I feel, and it is too bad for the person at whom that might be directed. I hope that I have never become bitter. I hope that I have never become nasty. I hope that I have never really tried to harm anybody.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make no excuse for the fact that Robin Gray is a friend of mine. Over the 16 years that I have been in federal politics, at times I have been involved with Robin Gray. At times we have agreed and at other times we have disagreed. However, when I read what has happened to that man, I despair. When a person is in public life, that person can be ruined by the stroke of a pen, at the whim and fancy of a royal commissioner. The fact that a person might be a very learned judge or a very learned barrister or solicitor does not mean that he cannot be biased. It does not mean also that he cannot have a preconceived idea before bringing down his deliberations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it incomprehensible that a man such as Robin Gray particularly can be not charged and yet brought to his knees by a report that unnecessarily, I believe, cost the taxpayers of Tasmania money. It cost over $1m for a report that found nothing different from what the police found. The report has not ruined Robin Gray but it has brought him to his knees. </PARA>

For example, yesterday, 13 November, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hobart Mercury</EMPHASIS> led off with the headline, `Parliament says Gray should quit'. However, it did not say that the Parliament was led by the Labor Party and the Greens. It did not mention the fact that the Liberal Party in Tasmania has given its utmost support to Robin Gray. It has stood by him. It believes also that he has been the object of a nasty vendetta by the smiling Mr Field, the Premier of Tasmania, who smiles every time he is on TV. Of course, he is obsessed with power. He wanted to be the Premier of the State. He sold his soul to the devil when he joined in collusion with the Greens to form a government that has created the highest unemployment ever in Tasmania. It has created the biggest uncertainty that anyone could wish for a State and, as a result, it has been the worst possible government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Field today, thank God, has recognised his mistake and has come out with a vitriolic attack on the Greens. He is reported as `accusing the Greens of misplaced, self-righteousness and foolishness and of playing political games'. He has suddenly realised that the resource security in Tasmania, which cost the taxpayers of Australia $10m to bring into play, was rejected by the Greens because&mdash;let us face it&mdash;they do not want one tree chopped down in Tasmania. They want Tasmania to stay as it is, just for the benefit of a few people who would like to put a knapsack on their back and walk around Tasmania, and they forget about the ordinary people who are involved in the timber industry and about the other people who derive benefit from the Tasmanian timber industry. Of course we do not want to see Tasmania left barren; of course we do not want to see every tree chopped down. We need a balance.

Wake up Tasmanians! You have had the Greens for nearly three years, and look what they have done to you. You have crucified Robin Gray. You have brought him to his knees'. But, no, I do not believe that Robin Gray will be brought to his knees. I believe that the sensible Tasmanians will realise that this man has been vilified and has borne the brunt of a vendetta by the Labor Party and Mr Field and also by the smiling Mr Patmore. I have been told that he is a nasty piece of work. I do not know him very well, but I am told that he is a nasty piece of work and that he holds grudges. I am told that he would like to get Robin Gray, if he could, at every opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those sorts of things just have to stop if we are to bring stability back to Tasmania. I think that the whole sorry episode concerning Mr Rouse and what happened with the deception and the bribe that was offered to one of the Labor politicians should be forgotten. I do not condone what Mr Rouse did. If we have a democracy, we have to live within the rules of that democracy and people have to do the right thing. But I think he has paid the price for that. I think he has lost everything that he had. He had great wealth; he had great stature in Tasmania as a businessman. But he has lost it all. He has paid his debt, and I think that the matter has to be buried and forgotten. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In September 1987, when I made my maiden speech to this House, I canvassed the need to reform the structure of government itself in Australia. Australia as a federation has from the outset been in the grip of a conflict between the national and State governments&mdash;in simple terms, a battle between those who contend that the national government should be responsible for the setting of goals and the achieving of them and those who believe that State governments are more effective in responding to the needs of the people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our Constitution divides law-making power between the two levels of government. It specifically lists the subjects about which this Parliament can make laws while other areas not so listed are in the hands of the States. The exclusion of the Commonwealth from many areas has been viewed by many, particularly in the Labor Party, as a major constraint to reform. Indeed, as early as 1911, only a decade after Federation, the then Prime Minister Andrew Fisher described the Constitution as a dead hand on a reforming government. Fisher pursued a program of constitutional reform which arguably remains the most ambitious attempted by an Australian Prime Minister. In both 1911 and 1913 he put to the Australian people a sweeping referendum to extend the Commonwealth's powers over trade and commerce, control of corporations, monopolies, and labour and employment, including wages and conditions and the settling of disputes. On both occasions the proposals were defeated and in 1913, with the referendum held in conjunction with a general election, the negative vote contributed to Fisher's defeat at the polls by one seat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fate of Fisher's attempt to reform the Constitution has largely been shared by all those attempts that followed. Labor's attempts to gain constitutional reform, at least through referendum, have mostly been unsuccessful. In the last 20 years, three further serious attempts have been launched to revise our system of federalism. In the 1970s the Whitlam Government instituted a series of Constitutional Conventions involving both State and Commonwealth governments and, certainly, politicians from both sides. Although these conventions were useful and raised the level of debate, no meaningful reform flowed from them. In 1985, the then Attorney-General, Lionel Bowen, appointed a Constitutional Commission under the leadership of Sir Maurice Byers. The Commission reported to the Parliament in 1988, and we all recall the rather ill-fated attempts to have four very simple reforms to the Constitution agreed to by referendum. The Australian people rejected these reforms, generally overwhelmingly, with most of the questions gaining less than 40 per cent of the popular vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against this background, it is not surprising that the High Court has played a significant role in interpreting the Constitution to meet the changes thrown up by changing times. The High Court has gone through several periods of interpretation, but it is fair to say that in recent times it has taken the view that the Constitution must be read in such a way as to allow the national Parliament to make laws that recognise Australia's role in the international community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that context, the sometimes petty sensitivities of State governments cannot stand in the way of the Commonwealth being able to govern in the national interest. However, it is not the role of the High Court to make political decisions about the appropriate roles of State and Federal parliaments. The division of power between the States and the Commonwealth is an issue that law-makers in all Australian parliaments have to make decisions on. In this context the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) launched the third serious attempt to reform our system of federalism in recent times. That process has stalled. However, while this is of concern, it should not really surprise us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be remembered that in July 1990 the Prime Minister proposed that Australia spend the decade leading up to the centenary of Federation debating the future of our federal system and attempting to make it serve better the people of Australia; that is, it was going to be a decade-long process, not one decided in a number of Premiers Conferences in the first year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the 1990s do in fact see a decade of debate and, hopefully, reform in federalism, then the failure at this stage to reach agreement on fiscal imbalance probably will count for very little. This is especially so when one compares the process the colonies first went through in the 1880s in reaching agreement about nationhood. Nonetheless, I think most Australians will be disappointed with the attitude adopted by the States. Certainly the States are correct in wanting to have a guaranteed level of income and certainty about that level over a period of time. But surely no-one can reasonably expect that Australia will move down the path which will see separate State income taxes evolve. That debate really ended in Australia some 50 years ago and fond memories on behalf of the States about the good old days really do not advance the debate. In any event, a more fundamental question must be answered before discussions on fiscal imbalance in the division of power proceeds, and that is whether a nation of 17 million people really needs three levels of government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many years prominent Australians, including the Prime Minister prior to his election to Parliament, foresaw an Australia where the States would be replaced by a two-tiered system of a national government and stronger regionally oriented local government. I think that, if we had a blank sheet to work from, a country of our size really would not need the number of politicians and the level of bureaucracy that it has. The reality, of course, particularly given the Australian public's well-demonstrated reluctance to embrace even minor constitutional reform, is that the basic structure of federalism is here to stay unless that proper debate over a long period can change the nation's outlook. Such a debate in my view is worth while and I think the Commonwealth should promote debate on the basic structure of our federal system while attempting to make what we have work better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The disappointing aspect at this stage, in my mind, is that the States can see nothing worth while about the process, unless they can get their hands on more money or at least have the ability to get more money. Surely sorting out the proper division of responsibilities and the issues of service delivery alone merit the continuation of the Special Premiers Conference process. That the States, five out of six of them with Labor governments, do not accept this is something that I find very difficult to understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end, I suspect, the current disappointment will be only a hiccup and that reform will continue. When we look at the basic facts we see that we are a small country; we are trading in a world which is becoming increasingly hostile to us; we have a large international debt; and we have, obviously, compelling economic problems. That we should walk away from what, I think, can fairly be regarded as the most significant area of reform&mdash;the way in which government operates&mdash;is a luxury that we cannot afford. Various State Premiers have been reported in the media and on television in recent days as saying that they are pulling out of the Conference and that they are disappointed that there is not going to be debate about the State income tax. Their saying, `We are going to take our bat and ball and go home' does those State Premiers no credit whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before speaking in this debate I had a look at the Labor Party's national platform in relation to constitutional reform and the division of responsibilities between the States and the Commonwealth parliaments. That platform makes it perfectly clear that the orientation of the Labor Party is towards the development of a strong, effective national government. Again, I find it hard to understand and extremely disappointing that Labor State Premiers can get so caught up with issues within their own borders that they can tend to lose a national perspective. That is not a fault just of the Labor Premiers but, because there are more State Labor governments in this country, the Labor Premiers have responsibility for seeing this process through at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the process continues. I am confident that it will. I think maybe some time in the future&mdash;and I look forward to this day&mdash;a republican Australia with a modern system of national government will deliver the services that Australia needs effectively, efficiently and in a much better manner than is currently the case. </PARA>

Six months later, after 42 days of public sittings, 107 witnesses and expenditure of over $1m, the findings of the Commission were released last week on Tuesday, 5 November. Because of the nature of these findings and the process adopted by the Commission, I believe, along with many other Australians, that injustice has occurred. No-one doubts the involvement of Mr Edmund Rouse in an act that I believe represented a frontal attack on our democratic processes. The testimony of evidence, witnesses, his own admission and subsequent gaol sentences are a monument to that act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not the case in regard to Robin Gray. The Commission did not find that he had acted unlawfully. Bribery and the possible involvement of the number one Minister of state are very serious matters which the public has a right to know about. But, equally, everyone has a right to be dealt with fairly and justly. I do not want to dwell on the particulars of this Royal Commission in detail because I want to speak more generally than that. What happened in this Royal Commission&mdash;I have not gone back to read a lot about royal commissions previously, but it has happened in others as well, I know&mdash;would not happen in a court of law. One may ask why. Why can the proceedings and the standards of a royal commission be lower than those of a court? After all, are not royal commissions called infrequently because they are very serious matters? The courts are in action daily. Therefore, if the standards of a royal commission are different, should they not be higher rather than lower?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our system of justice in the courts is based on the principle of innocent until proven guilty. The standard of proof in a court would have been proof beyond reasonable doubt. In the Carter Royal Commission the evidence did not establish guilt proven beyond reasonable doubt with respect to the Hon. Robin Gray, MHA, otherwise charges would have been laid. To put it another way, there was such a degree of doubt about the evidence that Mr Carter believed that it would not stand up in court. The same conclusion was arrived at by the Tasmanian Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Damian Bugg, after consideration of police investigations&mdash;and without spending the $1m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the seriousness of an act of bribery, I am certain that if there had been one shred of evidence against the former Premier he would have been charged. There was not. Mr Gray was a most successful Liberal Premier and he has had his career shattered on the basis of suspicion. In a sense, it was a trial by assertion and implication. No citizen should have his career and personal standing so attacked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the editorial of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sun-Herald</EMPHASIS> of 7 November states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not presume to judge Mr Gray's role in this sordid affair, but we do argue that the Royal Commission's finding though in accord with the terms of reference has unintentionally and inevitably treated Mr Gray with absolutely no regard for fairness.</PARA>
<PARA>I say to the Australian people and I say to this Parliament: if we are to have royal commissions they should at least be fair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, I am not arguing a case for Robin Gray the individual. The issue is far greater. Mr Gray became associated with this commission of inquiry not because of himself but because he had the leadership of a major political party, a party which an arrogant businessman wanted to govern the State, despite not having gained a majority of seats at the most recent election. That is the sole basis on which Robin Gray got involved in this Royal Commission. That could happen to anyone in this Parliament who became leader of one of the major parties here or in our State parliaments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The actions of this Commission have raised the question: should the Parliament require findings in cases such as this to be made on the higher evidence of proof, as required by the criminal jurisdiction? I believe it should. Don Chipp, a former leader of the Australian Democrats, on page 50 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Telegraph</EMPHASIS> of 10 November 1991, was reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a man's career has been shattered with allegations of misconduct being found on the balance of probabilities.</PARA>
<PARA>I say that it is not satisfactory that the higher standards of proof be not used in such important matters of personal and public justice. Suspicion is not a necessary and sufficient condition to prove guilt. The evidence must move any person from a cognitive position of being suspicious to one of being convinced. Under our system of justice it is not enough to suspect a citizen of guilt, no matter who they are. That guilt must be proven beyond reasonable doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Gray is the latest example of someone who can be placed on trial publicly, without adequate safeguards for the protection of the right to natural justice. For findings to state that actions were improper but not unlawful is, I believe, a denial of the right to natural justice. Adding to the travesty of justice that has occurred is the injustice that a citizen, as in this case, can be committed to pay his or her legal costs, yet not be charged. For a State Government to act in this manner and deny legal costs is not a sign that it is searching for truth, but rather one of retribution and malice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The expectation that Mr Gray, or any other person for that matter, should be forced to find legal costs of $135,000&mdash;probably more&mdash;when no charges have been laid is unfair and unjust. If we have royal commissions, maybe everybody who goes before them, no matter what happens, should have their costs covered because they concern matters of high public importance. Otherwise, royal commissions should not be called. Mr Gray has repeatedly denied knowledge of the bribery attempt by Mr Rouse. After intensive investigation the Commission was unable to prove otherwise. Yet, at the moment, the defendant is liable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This latest Royal Commission highlights the need for parliaments to ensure that future royal commissions be directed to use the higher standard of proof; that is, `beyond reasonable doubt' and not `on the balance of probabilities' and that payment of costs be made for defendants not charged. Maybe we can give consideration to covering the costs for all people who appear before royal commissions. I am suggesting that at least we give directions to our royal commissions to have the highest standard of proof and to cover the costs of at least those people who are not charged. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on a matter of grievance because, as many people in this Parliament would realise, the city of Fairfield which is within my electorate has one of the highest rates of unemployment within Australia. The people in my electorate are hurting. All they want is the chance to work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My grievance today is that these people are not being given an equal chance to obtain a job, as many of them are now discriminated against because of their age. It was recently brought to my attention that an increasing number of my constituents believe that they are missing out on jobs because of their age. The over-40s category of people looking for work is apparently now the hardest hit, as many of the jobs being advertised have strict age limits attached. My point is reinforced by an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 22 October, which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People at 40 today are barely acceptable to some employers, judging by the plethora of job advertisements specifying younger workers. By 45 or 50, they have crossed the Rubicon. They have become the Older Worker, a social problem, the butt of employer prejudice and discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA>I add at this stage that in a survey I conducted, the average age of members of the House of Representatives is 48 years of age; of senators, 49.3 years of age; and of members and senators, 48.4 years of age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although in the area that I am addressing no age group looking for work is spared in a recession, the over-40 age group seems to be suffering the most from discrimination. These are the people who have established families and have the added pressures of keeping a roof over the heads of their children and food on the table. According to that aforementioned article, today's 40-year-olds often have young children or babies. They expect and need to work another 20 to 25 years. Often they have huge mortgages. They need the protection of age discrimination laws, which few States have enacted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, New South Wales is one of those States which has not, as yet, enforced any laws about age discrimination. With the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate at 9.7 per cent in that State, any law which will contribute to equal opportunities for those looking for a job is, I would think, vital. South Australia has already amended its equal opportunities legislation to cover age and it is now unlawful to treat people unfairly on the basis of age in advertising in that State. This means it is illegal to publish or cause to be published an advertisement in South Australia that indicates an intention to discriminate on the grounds of age. The Act also includes employment advertising originating from interstate which appears in South Australia, even if the job being offered is located interstate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This new legislation enables South Australian applicants to pursue work without age being a barrier. Complaints can now be made to the Equal Opportunity Commission in South Australia if an employer discriminates on the basis of age when hiring, sacking and training employers. Other States are also considering legislation to guard against age discrimination. According to an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Review Weekly</EMPHASIS> of 19 July:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New South Wales was the first state to propose legislation against age discrimination, but its original package of reforms has been altered significantly. Compulsory retirement has been outlawed, but further amendments to the Anti-Discrimination Act have been dropped because of pressure from employer groups.</PARA>
<PARA>In view of the unemployment problem facing New South Wales, and particularly my area of Fairfield, the New South Wales Government should stand up and have the guts to make the necessary changes to enforce anti-discrimination legislation, as the South Australian Government has already done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Council for Equal Opportunity and Employment, which was established by the Business Council of Australia, and the Confederation of Australian Industry in 1986 issued a report in regard to discrimination which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Age discrimination can occur in any sphere of a person's life. However, most age discrimination complaints in Australia and overseas relate to employment, in particular to discrimination against older workers.</PARA>
<PARA>I know that a number of my constituents would agree with that statement. One woman who contacted me was 43 years of age, single and had been unemployed for over eight months. Over the years, this woman has struggled to educate herself, single-handedly support her family and pay a mortgage. She felt that she was now considered too old for executive appointments. However, male executives the same age as her were considered to be too young when applying for those jobs. She said that she now wondered whether her next step was to lie about her age, to be able to compete on the job market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another case that I can bring to mind is of a male constituent who was also over 40. Recently he came to see me for help, as he had been retrenched from his factory job. He had been unable to find work to support his wife and three children since that time. He was not eligible to receive unemployment benefits of any kind as his wife was working part time in a supermarket. This man did not know where to turn and he felt that he was being discriminated against because of his age when applying for jobs. In light of this, should we not, as a Federal government, also consider legislating against age discrimination on a wider scale?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, perhaps age discrimination should be addressed in regard to our Commonwealth Employment Service. It has been brought to my attention that there is nothing in the current CES manual for CES officers which deals with age discrimination complaints. Surely in this day of equal opportunity and anti-discrimination we can legislate to ensure that discrimination on the basis of age is not acceptable in jobs advertised by the CES. Although age has been a popular criterion for employers to measure the level of experience needed in a job candidate, job advertisements that specify the age of an applicant are fast becoming offensive and inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the minutes remaining to me, I would also like to bring to the attention of the House my concern with the delay in New South Wales in introducing the Jobskills program which was announced by our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in the March economic statement. This program is currently operating in Queensland and Western Australia, reportedly with some success. But there has been a decided lack of interest from local councils and other organisations eligible to participate in the program within New South Wales. The $45m Jobskills program will allow local government to employ additional staff and help ease employment problems in the local communities over the next two years. The objective of the Jobskills program is to improve the long term employment prospects of those who have been unemployed for 12 months or more by broadening their employment experience and equipping them with new skills through work experience and training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would not like to try to estimate the current number of people in my electorate who have been unemployed for more than 12 months, but I know that in the June quarter that figure reached approximately 3,500. Jobskills would, therefore, obviously have a viable place in the Fairfield community. Consequently, I am going to continue to investigate why this program has not been implemented in New South Wales as yet and is not even expected to begin before February of 1992 at the earliest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been informed that at present there is resistance from some of the local councils and community groups in New South Wales to the Jobskills program, because they believe that it is too much like the old Commonwealth employment program which involved labour intensive and project related training. However, I have been assured by the Department of Employment, Education and Training that this is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has also apparently been some opposition from a union group to the training wage provided for in the program; evidently the group believes Jobskills would mean program participants were working for the dole. I must say that I believe such fears to be unfounded. Jobskills will provide a combination of work experience and training which will be arranged through appropriate organisations which will be contracted to act as intermediaries or brokers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly keen to have a Jobskills program initiated in Fairfield as soon as possible, as the Department has allocated in the program's budget 110 Jobskills places for Fairfield local government area. This is the largest number of Jobskills places allocated in any local government area in New South Wales and although Fairfield City Council is yet to decide whether it is interested in participating in the program as either broker or employer&mdash;or indeed at all&mdash;at least I am pleased to say that Wesley Mission's Skillshare project in Fairfield, Effect Employment, has expressed to me its interest in participating in the Jobskills program. I commend the Mission for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not until my inquiries in representation to the Department regarding the lack of Jobskills programs in Fairfield that the Council, I understand, investigated the feasibility of implementing such a program. DEET will be approaching Fairfield City Council personally and I sincerely hope that these discussions prove to be fruitful for the sake of all of those thousands of long term unemployed people living within my electorate. I have been informed that councils such as Parramatta, Blacktown, Liverpool and Bankstown have already been in contact with the Department and that DEET is now discussing with them the potential of the Jobskills program&mdash;an example that I hope Fairfield City Council will soon emulate. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to grieve on behalf of the 170 Victorians who are unable to get a job at the Camperdown abattoirs. This raises industrial relations issues of the 1990s and, in particular, the right to work, compulsory unionism, voluntary contracts between management and the work force, the role of picket lines, productivity, profitability, the use of contract labour and the high cost of the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service in meatworks. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to refer to two other meatworks in Victoria. The Seymour abattoirs use a similar system that has been advocated at the Camperdown works. Seymour is a domestic abattoir and contract labour is being used on that plant. The inspection service has allowed the works to proceed and all is well in that plant&mdash;a plant which operates similarly to Camperdown.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the position in Wodonga in northern Victoria, members of this House would be aware that there was a major confrontation at that particular plant. Wodonga Meats suffered from 82 days of strikes by the AMIEU members, between May 1989 and April 1991, costing the company $3m in losses. In April of this year management said, `Enough is enough' and terminated the services of 11 union delegates who would not abide by the bans clause inserted into their award. A picket line was then established by these delegates and the usual AMIEU thuggery was used&mdash;and that was identified by the television coverage of that particular picket line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of that month, management was forced to send termination notices to 200 employees who had declined to sign an agreement stating that they would be available to work five days per week without imposing bans or going on strike&mdash;quite a normal, sensible arrangement between management and the work force, I would have thought. Eventually 182 staff were terminated, 82 of the original staff were kept on and the balance of 325 staff was met by hiring of the new staff, most of whom required training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A bonus system of payments has meant that the work force is now achieving greater productivity in five days than the former unionised work force could achieve in four weeks, due to the continual imposition of bans, strikes and go slows by the AMIEU. We can contrast the production of 350 head of cattle and 2,800 head of small stock per day with the former union-approved tally system under which a level of 2,560 small stock and 260 head of stock was reached. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The workplace is safer and Workcare claims have been dramatically reduced. Most importantly, the work force is happier because people are grossing nearly $1,000 per week in some cases. Perhaps the most significant factor is that around 80 of the Wodonga meat employees are former AMIEU members. Other AMIEU stalwarts who declined the offer probably regret doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to return to the situation at Camperdown. Let us get the facts straight, because there has been a lot of misrepresentation about the argument at that abattoir. As far as the history of the abattoir goes, it was purchased by Mr Fami of Famicorp Pty Ltd. He operates a meatworks at Deniliquin and he decided to purchase the Camperdown abattoir in the hope of introducing new techniques and a new approach. What he was concerned about was the AMIEU attitudes to the low tally arrangements, working from 7.30 a.m. till midday. That was the eight-hour day. The work force was strike prone and historically it was very hard to get more than four days per week out of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Mr Fami was really trying to do was to introduce a section 115 provision, which has been introduced into the meat award in Victoria with Don Smallgoods. A similar arrangement has been introduced by ICI at its Botany Bay plant and is working particularly well. Productivity has improved, the work force is much happier and the plant is returning to profitability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the instance of the Camperdown abattoir, the management decided to put on contract labour. Troubleshooters was employed to organise the contract labour with a view to increasing production output, similar to the situation in the building industry, where Troubleshooters has been employed on a productive basis to get the job done at a particular price. A confrontation and dispute took place between the new owner and the old unionists who maintained old attitudes. Wally Curran had been in charge of a regime where originally, some 10 or 15 years ago, there were 8,000 members in the AMIEU; there are now 1,700 members. So much for Wally Curran's creation of jobs. There used to be 20 export works in Victoria and now there are only six left, largely due to Wally Curran's anti-productive activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation in Camperdown was that the Federal meat inspection service approved the works for export licence and the licence was granted. Various things were repaired and put in order. I make the observation in passing that one of the problems facing meatworks all around Australia is the high cost of the meat inspection service&mdash;$69,000 per meat inspector, when in fact the inspectors are paid only $29,000. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having had the permission to operate, Famicorp Pty Ltd negotiated possible changes to work practices, as I was saying, to move away from the outdated Federal award. It employed Troubleshooters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following these arrangements, the picket line was instituted by the AMIEU. We had an old style picket line in an environment where we had one million unemployed Australians. These personnel had never been employed by the new company and we had a battle of ideology, not a battle for jobs. The picket line in technical terms was instituted outside the works. The picketers had their own toilet. They had a heap of wood to keep the fires burning during the cold month of September. They had a tent to make sure they could be protected from the weather. In fact, they were very well established. One of the difficulties for management was that the roadway outside the works was a demarcation line the Hampden Shire and the local city council, so both municipalities had some difficulty in making a decision about whether the obstruction should be removed from the front of the plant on the council property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The union picket line, of course, was similar to other picket lines in Victoria where there are special deals done between the Government, the police and the union movement. It seems that unionists enjoy special privileges, unlike other Australians, when they are on a picket line. It was obvious in this particular picket line that they could conduct themselves in a manner that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I and other members of this House would be put in gaol for or for which we would be charged with using abusive language and other unlawful acts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand from investigation that the picket line can be removed if there are unlawful acts of public nuisance and obstruction. I understand that that is fairly difficult to prove in a court. On this occasion, it is quite obvious that violence, intimidation, bad language and physical jostling by those picketers on the picket line has taken place. But the courts in Victoria have been reluctant to remove the picket lines. I am in favour of the right to have peaceful protests, but not in the context of this sort of picket line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the works began to operate, we had 80 police on the site to allow workers to go to work. Five to 10 police horses were there to allow the workers to go to work. The workers had to leave the police station at 7 o'clock in the morning in a furniture van, be escorted by the police to the works and leave the works at 4.30 in the afternoon in a similar process in which they were abused and shouted at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Troubleshooters was training these new workers. It has managed to improve the productivity and meat quality standards. Along with the difficulties faced by the workers travelling in a furniture van, the picketers managed to make sure that black bans were imposed on the truckies who entered the works and on processed meat in other parts of Victoria. What is more, the works were sabotaged during these very turbulent times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Victorian Minister for Agriculture, of course, has been part of the action and he raised the issue in the Victorian Parliament only yesterday. He said the meat was not approved; that is wrong. He suggested that the quality was not correct; that is wrong. He said that management was late going to the works; that is wrong. And he also said that the Liberal Party was part of these confrontation tactics; that is wrong. He used parliamentary privilege to make these outrageous claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is happening in the Camperdown Meatworks is that the farmers want their animals processed, the workers want to work, the owner wants to get a return on his investment, the police want to return to their normal duties in other parts of Victoria, and I am quite confident that the picketers would like to get out of the cold and rain, return to their homes and not be involved in a worthless, useless and non-productive picket line which is stopping Australians getting work at a time when there are one million unemployed here in Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I desire to grieve on what I see as a fairly alarming tendency, in a situation of economic downturn, in certain sections of this Parliament&mdash;unfortunately on both sides of the House&mdash;to label certain groups as being opposed to any kind of economic or resource development. Two of the most obvious targets that are mentioned from time to time are conservationists, or Greens as they are called&mdash;we had an example of that in the Parliament this morning&mdash;and, of course, traditional Aboriginal communities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to deal with that view for what it is, an essentially dangerous process, because it seems to me, certainly from the history of my own political party, that if one is dealing with an idea whose time has come, for many conservative or vested interest groups what one does is unfairly label the group, and thereby minimise the concept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many people whose overwhelming political commitment is the preservation of the environment. As a group, they are probably more diverse than any of the political groupings in our own Parliament or in our established political parties. While maintaining their environmental concern, they may well disagree on what particular areas or projects are the subject of immediate concern. They may even disagree as to the tactics to be used. But it is important in a political democracy that we listen to the arguments that are being advanced rather than simply dropping a label on `the conservationists' or on `the Greens', on the basis that that means one does not really have to examine the merits of the propositions that are being put. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My own Party&mdash;and I have been in it for over 40 years&mdash;has constantly been a victim of that kind of strategy. I remember a time, as you would, Mr Deputy Speaker, not so long ago, when our own Party was amongst the first in Australia to recognise the reality of the Chinese revolution and say, `Well, we have to recognise the People's Republic of Red China'. We were immediately arraigned as fellow travellers and communist sympathisers. You would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, as other members of our House would know, that any unionist who happened to stand on a ticket for election to a union which may have contained a communist became a fellow traveller. Or if a union, which may have had a membership of 20,000 or 30,000 Australian citizens, had a communist officer it became a communist union. The purpose of that sort of terminology is to ascribe positions which do not necessarily hold for the organisation as a whole or for its membership. At this stage in Australia's development, I would have hoped we would have been mature enough not to use those sorts of labels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know, as do members of the Liberal Party and the National Party, that they are continually subjected to attempts by groups like the lunatic League of Rights to take over branches and to change their structures. That does not make every member of the Liberal Party a supporter of the League of Rights. There are, of course, differences of approach in the Labor Party. Therefore, I am putting my own position on record. I for one&mdash;and there are many individual members on both sides of this Parliament who feel deeply about environmental issues&mdash;am not going to simply be privy to a process whereby those concepts are downgraded and demeaned by using labels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same is true for traditional Aboriginal communities. We recently had the example of an independent commission, the Resource Assessment Commission&mdash;which was lauded both by representatives of Aboriginal communities and of the mining industry for its approach to the examination of all the evidence in respect of Coronation Hill. It is an extraordinary thing that a body as prestigious as this should examine all the arguments that are put and reach its conclusions, and those conclusions are then adopted by the Government&mdash;and an immediate attack is launched. The concept is again promulgated by no less a person, unfortunately, than the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), who became the disciple of the proposition that every time a mineral resource is discovered an Aboriginal group will find a sacred site. It is a demeaning concept; it is, essentially, part of an approach which should not have any credible position in our body politic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present these allegations are continuing to be made. We talk about speeding up resource development on the basis of having to deal with these groups. There is a certain inconsistency in our coalition Opposition talking about the freedom and the right of management and labour to reach voluntary agreements when at the present time in the Northern Territory a whole range of mining agreements that have been reached between Aboriginal communities, through their land councils, and mining developers are being held up on the basis that they are contrary to the provisions of the land rights Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Almost 15 years ago the mining industry was concerned that it would explore on Aboriginal land, with the permission of Aboriginal communities, and would find a mineral resource to be developed but that the negotiations that were to take place to bring that process to fruition would take a great length of time. The mining industry's concern was to speed up that process. I was Minister at the time and I responded to that because it seemed to me that there was evidence to show that these were legitimate concerns. But the process that was adopted was designed, first of all, to protect Aboriginal communities and, at the same time, to create a situation in which miners, having reached agreement about exploration, would not then find themselves hopelessly delayed when it came to development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has occurred in Aboriginal Australia since then has been a maturing and experience in respect of mineral development such that many Aboriginal communities, through their land councils or through their leadership, are perfectly happy. Once they are satisfied that their communities and their sacred sites are not under threat, they are more than happy to say to the miners, `Come in and explore and if you find something we'll develop it together or we'll discuss and negotiate about it'. And many mining companies are happy to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are at present no less than three disjunctive agreements&mdash;and that is how they are described. One is at Roper Bar, which involves 206 square kilometres; another is at Cox River, 2,898 square kilometres; and the third is at Beswick, an area of almost 2,500 square kilometres. These sorts of agreements have been reached freely between mining companies, on the one hand, and Aboriginal communities, on the other. But they have been held up because the Northern Territory Government&mdash;a conservative government that is part of this political grouping in Australia which says, `Really there has to be freedom of management and labour to negotiate' but which does not believe in freedom for mining companies or Aboriginal communities that have negotiated and reached agreement to proceed, because the Northern Territory Government and sections of the mining industry do not like disjunctive agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is going to be a court case wherein, and for the first time in history, the Northern Territory Government will actually be arguing, in my opinion incorrectly, to uphold provisions in the land rights Act. There are another three mining applications, involving large areas of land, which agreements are waiting to be signed, and the parties are delayed waiting the outcomes of the actions of the Northern Territory Government. In all, we are looking at agreements which have been reached for the exploration of over 15,215 square kilometres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are talking about the way in which we need to develop Australia, we should not be in a situation in which various interest groups, both in this Parliament and outside this Parliament, are prepared to stick labels on various groups and say, `They are the people that are holding up development'. We cannot blame either the Aboriginal communities or the environmentalists in Australia for the economic plight that we now face. There have been many arguments and there will be more; that will involve Aboriginal communities and conservationists, and that is appropriate in a democratic community. But I think it is important that we look at the arguments as they are presented, and the reality of what is happening on the ground. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the 1830s, first in the Hunter Valley and subsequently on the Clarence, my forebears maintained a tradition of good relationships with the local people; indeed, a member of my family is largely credited with leading the push for the vote for Aboriginal people in this country.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In turning to a sorry saga centring on Barwon Aboriginal Community Inc. at Walgett in my electorate, I reject any suggestion of motives other than those arising from genuine concern for the local Aboriginal people. Barwon Aboriginal community grew out of the Walgett Aboriginal Foundation, which was a charitable organisation devoted to housing, financial and funeral arrangements and, therefore, assistance for the local Aboriginal community. Today it is a registered company, limited by guarantee, which involves itself in a wide range of activities: Aboriginal housing, a bus service for the elderly, self-drive rental cars, general social work, the leasing out of a pub&mdash;the famous or, should I say, infamous Oasis&mdash;and construction enterprises. To put it mildly, the community has had a chequered career managing all of these affairs in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until some 15 months ago the company was directed by one Mr Chris Wilson, under whom it had greatly expanded.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Hall was eventually dismissed after an incident surrounding a boat, the specific purpose of which was to supply transport and food delivery during floods.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The loss of $2m of taxpayers' dollars in annual income has produced an extraordinary flurry of activity as Barwon sells off assets, often at grossly undervalued levels, in an attempt to remain solvent. A tractor which cost $40,000-odd a couple of years ago has been exchanged, as I understand it, for outstanding rent of $2,000 or $3,000. One home was sold for $48,000, when its estimated value was around $85,000 to $100,000. Another valued at $65,000 has been sold for $35,000 on $3,500 deposit. I understand that, in addition, 13 Barwon Aboriginal community flats, worth perhaps $1.5m, are on sale for $250,000. Effectively, I can draw no conclusion other than that these assets are being sold to pay off fraudulently incurred debts in a manner well outside what I understand to be ATSIC's guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Well might it be asked, `Who wants to do something to clean up this mess?' The answer appears to be that just about everybody wants something done except those who apparently benefit from the situation. The local Aboriginal community wants the matter investigated and cleaned up, and why would they not? The local council wants the matter investigated. The local police want the matter cleaned up. The local inspector is a man I have the highest regard for and he frequently tells me of the incredible frustration that he feels in the face of this implausible situation. ATSIC personnel privately informed me that they believe it ought to be cleaned up and that the ASC ought to be involved. As the local Federal member I want it cleaned up and the Minister responsible, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner), wants it cleaned up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the virtually unanimous recognition that the whole stinking mess needs cleaning up urgently before it erupts into something ugly on the streets of the town, virtually nothing has been done.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ATSIC's official position was quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 7 August this year. It said that it was under no obligation to investigate BAC, despite the findings of the internal audit. It said that under the ATSIC Act it was not obliged to pursue an inquiry into allegations surrounding the use of funds it allocated to BAC Ltd&mdash;although its cancellation of the corporation's $2m annual funding is a clear indication that it thinks that something is wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Walgett police have neither the authority nor the resources to undertake the massive auditing task that would be required to establish the true position and take appropriate action.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last Friday the House of Representatives Select Committee into Print Media held hearings in Canberra and the Chief Executive of West Australian Newspapers Ltd, David Aspinall, and the chief editor, Bob Cronin, appeared before the inquiry. The Saturday morning edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> reported those events<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The letter, as of this day, has not been published, so I intend to read it into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. I received today a letter from the editor giving his reasons for not publishing my letter and expressing concern about the fact that some of the details in my letter did not relate to the terms of reference of the Committee. I indicate that, of course, the Committee has had a number of witnesses before it and indeed the questioning has been wide ranging and widely reported. The letter that I wrote reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The selective coverage of Friday's Print Media hearings by your newspaper is alarming. During two hours of questioning a number of issues relating to the West Australian and its performance and management were raised. Reports in the West on Saturday did not reflect the tenor or breadth of that questioning.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I imagine that the readership would be interested to know that the Chief Executive David Aspinall agreed that he may well continue in the ongoing management of the newspaper&mdash;contrary to a report in the West on November 5th.</PARA>
<PARA>That was just four days before. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee was told that he, as Bell Group chairman, negotiated his own contract with Bond Corporation (which appointed him to the board). The details of the contract, which was varied as late as July, 1991, are confidential.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prospective buyers of shares in West Australian Newspapers Holdings might like to know that none of those appointed to the board of this new company have experience in newspaper management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No doubt employees of the West Australian would like to be informed about the prospective redundancies outlined by Mr Aspinall in his evidence. Equally the evidence given by Professor Baxt regarding the closure of the Daily News would be of interest to journalists and the public alike.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Somehow a profitable business which previously held valuable property assets has become burdened with substantial debt as a result of Bell Group borrowings. Bell shareholders lost, bond holders lost and owners and management received little scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The newspaper itself has carried little critical analysis of these events. Balanced coverage of Friday's hearings would have been in the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Copies of the full transcripts of the hearings are available from my office . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is the letter that I sent to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS>; unfortunately it was not published. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The letter I got today from the editor of the newspaper gives reasons why it was not published. Basically, it says that these things were not of interest. In fact, Mr Aspinall's evidence contradicted a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> just five days before. I believe that it would have been of interest for people to know that. Certainly his evidence in respect of his contract outlines the Bond culture that existed in Western Australia during the last decade. Indeed, electors in my area were horrified by the fact that Bond executives received salaries of $5m a year while the company was losing billions. There was no performance related reward for executives and there is considerable concern about that. </PARA>

Their chances of survival are not good and their chances of any sort of worthwhile or meaningful future are just about zero.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Moreton for his question. I am sure that all members of the House would be interested to know the developments of which we are aware, and I certainly want to share those with the honourable member and with the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since I spoke to the House yesterday on this issue our Government has discussed at very high levels with the Indonesian Government the appalling events in Dili yesterday. Yesterday afternoon our Ambassador in Jakarta, Mr Phillip Flood, met General Moerdani, who is Acting Foreign Minister as well as Minister for Defence and Security, and Senator Evans had long talks in Seoul with Mr Alatas, the Foreign Minister for Indonesia. In both these discussions, Australia expressed the points that I outlined to this House yesterday: we are deeply disturbed by the tragedy in Dili and deplore the loss of innocent life; we want an urgent account of what happened there; we want a full inquiry into the circumstances and that those found responsible be appropriately dealt with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In their responses, General Moerdani and Mr Alatas expressed deep concern and regret at what had occurred and understanding of the strong reaction that we in Australia have felt and have expressed about those events in Dili. In his long discussion with Senator Evans, Mr Alatas agreed on the need for a full and internationally credible inquiry and recognised the potential of the incident to undermine Indonesia's efforts to improve the situation in East Timor. The Commander of Indonesian's armed forces, General Sutrisno, has publicly expressed his regret at the deaths and he has promised a thorough investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government welcomes these indications that Indonesia is responding positively to the concerns that we and other members of the international community have expressed about the events of Tuesday. I must say that I am disappointed that they were not more fully reflected in the statement released last night by the Indonesian Embassy. We will, of course, continue to press our concerns and we will take a close interest in the manner in which the inquiry into the shootings is conducted, as well as in the conclusions and the action which follows.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the second part of the question, General Sutrisno is reported to have told journalists in Jakarta yesterday that at the most 50 people died in the incident. I want to stress that, whatever the final number of casualties, it is obvious that an appalling tragedy has occurred. It does not depend on what the final number is; an appalling tragedy has occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both General Moerdani and Mr Alatas have given us accounts of what occurred based on preliminary information which is available to them. In addition, I am pleased to say that our Embassy official arrived in Dili yesterday afternoon and he will stay in Dili for several days so that he can speak to as many people as possible about the incident. It still is not possible to speak with any certainty about many of the details of the incident.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Indonesian authorities are continuing with their inquiries and are awaiting the return of a number of key personnel from Dili. The Indonesian authorities have said that the incident was provoked by an attack on an Indonesian military officer. Other witnesses claim that there was no provocation. We are continuing to investigate these and other aspects of the incident, including with non-government sources. It would be unwise to comment further until we have more detail.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, I hope it will be recognised that whatever provocation may have occurred&mdash;we do not say that any did; but it is important to say that whatever provocation may have occurred, if any&mdash;the response by the Indonesian military has been tragically excessive. I believe, in saying that, I would be reflecting the views not only of all members of this House but of the people of this country. I conclude by saying this: after all these years it is clear that the problems of East Timor are not going to be solved by military force.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0H4">Mr GRIFFITHS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen claims that Australian ports are now amongst the most efficient grain handling ports in the world, and in this instance these claims were made not by the Government but by the Australian Wheat Board in a press statement issued on 4 November. The Australian Wheat Board, in its statement, describes the improvements evidenced on the waterfront as `spectacular', noting that since 1988-89 the time taken to turn grain vessels around at Australian ports has dropped from an average of 4.52 days to 2.4 days, almost a 50 per cent reduction, cutting in half the turnaround time, and representing, importantly, savings of some $10m per annum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, the Director of the Wheat Board says that reduction in loading time and the consequent cost savings have resulted from the Australian Wheat Board's enthusiastic adoption of the reform principles negotiated with the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority, stevedoring industry unions and employers and, importantly, the cooperation of the work force at the ports in question. This stands in stark contrast to the Opposition's `fix bayonets' policy of waterfront reform, wherein the Leader of the Opposition, amongst others, has indicated that the appropriate course to follow is to send in the troops. There is no doubt that, at a time when the grains industry is facing enormous difficulties, the Government's micro-economic reform package is bearing fruit. It is substantially reducing the cost of grain handling at the waterfront and there is a significant flow-on effect in the reduction of shipping freight costs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, you and honourable members will recall that when the Government put grain handling on the waterfront reform agenda, through the reforms recommended by the Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport, and also via the Inter-State Commission waterfront report, and when the Government set in train the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority process, which has made possible these spectacular gains through a negotiated process, the Government was vigorously opposed by all members opposite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everyone in this House will recall&mdash;and if perchance they forget, I invite them to have recourse to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> on this matter&mdash;the deep divisions between the Liberal and National parties on this issue. There was a total, chronic inability to put the national interests first in backing a vital program of micro-economic reform. This Opposition had to be dragged kicking and screaming, as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> will attest, to this fundamental reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two messages from these `spectacular' gains. The first message is that the Government's micro-economic reforms are working and they are providing real benefits to grain growers at a time of great difficulty for them. The second is that it highlights the enormous gap, indeed the chasm, between Government substance and Opposition rhetoric.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Prospect for her question. I am aware not only of the very keen interest she has in this area but also of the terrific job she is doing in assisting particularly the young people in her electorate. The honourable member for Prospect asked about the efficacy of labour market programs conducted and delivered by my Department. The Department has done some important work on just this area, comparing how many program participants in the labour market programs have jobs three months after they complete their placements and how many DSS beneficiaries generally who have moved from social security payments into the labour market over the same period of time have jobs. These figures show that those individuals who participate in labour market programs are much more likely to be in jobs than social security beneficiaries as a whole, even those who have been unemployed for the same period of time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Specifically, in August of 1991 for those unemployed for up to six months, 49 per cent of Jobstart participants were still employed three months after they had finished their Jobstart placement and, overall, 36 per cent of labour market program participants had jobs compared with just 13 per cent of those beneficiaries as a whole who had moved into employment. The figures are even more stark for those people who have been unemployed for 12 months or longer, as 47 per cent of Jobstart participants still had jobs three months after they had completed their placements and 21 per cent of those in labour market programs in general compared with just 3 per cent of those who were general DSS beneficiaries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, whilst it may well be true that the recession has made it very much more difficult for the unemployed and particularly the long term unemployed to find jobs, those people who have the opportunity to participate in labour market programs, and particularly in the Jobstart program, have very much better chances of getting jobs. The announcements that the Prime Minister will be making this afternoon will indicate further enhancements to these programs generally, and we make these changes in the sure knowledge that these programs will be of particular benefit to those who participate in them. I take the opportunity of tabling a chart which indicates the efficacy of these programs in the way in which I have described.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, whilst we can anticipate that members opposite will have lots to say on the question of employment and unemployment this afternoon&mdash;and they have a crocodile tears-type topic to put up in the context of a matter of public importance this afternoon&mdash;it ought to be very clear to everyone just exactly where those opposite are coming from in relation to assistance to the unemployed. If we go back to what those opposite said in the context of their economic action plan and to what they said in the context of the last Budget, it is perfectly clear that one of the areas which has been targeted as an area of expenditure reduction is precisely this area of assistance to the unemployed. They have in mind a dramatic reduction of some $288m in expenditure programs, which will deny assistance to something like 150,000 unemployed people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, whilst we can expect to see some mock anguish on the part of those opposite this afternoon, let it be perfectly clear that this Opposition has but one thing in mind&mdash;to rip away support and to deny additional support to these people whom we are trying to assist in this difficult period. Let me make it clear that the support that members opposite are intending to rip away, the support extension that they are denying, is real and beneficial support as demonstrated by these figures that I have read out. This is not some kind of trivial support. This is meaningful support to unemployed people, people in real need; it is assisting them back into the labour market.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question. I am certainly aware of his interest in disabilities and the concerns that he has conveyed to me concerning possible changes in direction in this program. Only this morning at a major meeting of service providers, the ACROD National Convention, I spoke about the Government's considerable achievements in relation to disability services and its intentions with regard to the future. The Government's disability services program, as honourable members will know, is a key aspect of its commitment to social justice and particularly social justice for this group of people who often have been denied the opportunity for full participation in the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning I announced that the Government would be amending the Disability Services Act to lay permanently to rest the anxiety about services closing after June 1992. The amendments will remove the June 1992 deadline and, hence, provide for the continued funding of services which meet basic levels of service. Organisations will have more time to make the changes necessary to provide a good quality service, one which reflects the basic human rights of people with a disability and that gives them more say in how the services work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also announced that the extension of time would be linked to other changes designed to help services continue to work towards meeting the requirements of the Disability Services Act. There will be three key steps. The first will be minimum outcomes or basic human rights such as people with disabilities being supported to set up workers' committees where they work or residents' committees where they live; in other words, the opportunity for people in the various workshops and services to have access to basic rights, to air grievances and to have that grievance dealt with in a way which is seen to be fair.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there will be enhanced outcomes or more advanced standards, such as improved wage levels for people in sheltered workshops. People who know anything about this area know that wage levels in sheltered workshops are extraordinarily low, often averaging about $30 a week, and that they have no relationship at all to any productivity contributed by people with disabilities. Thirdly, there will be eligibility outcomes or full implementation of the principles and objectives of the Disability Services Act, such as integration into open employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Services which have not met minimum outcomes by June 1992 will be subject to sanctions, including no access to indexation and transition funds. All service providers will generally be expected to reach eligibility outcomes by June 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Disability Services Act is one of the Government's most significant reforms. It has resulted in significant changes in the attitude to people with disabilities and in the qualities of service being provided. A large number of new services&mdash;over 100&mdash;are being funded. There has been about a 60 per cent real increase in funding for services for people with disabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the strategy I announced this morning will be successful. It will enable us to build on what has already been achieved under the Act. At the same time, it will deal with those concerns expressed by some service providers.</PARA>

I repeat it so that, just perhaps, the Leader of the Opposition might understand. The situation is that Mr Baldwin had the opportunity of speaking to Cabinet; and he spoke. He spoke on the basis that when he left after he had spoken he was not bound in terms of the subsequent Caucus consideration of that matter by the decision of the Cabinet. He still had open his position to argue in the Caucus a position different to that adopted by the Cabinet. He exercised that right, but once the Caucus had considered that Cabinet decision, and that was endorsed by the Caucus, then not only Mr Baldwin but every other member of the Caucus was bound by the decision.

Those reports are totally without foundation. This is not a matter that has had a great deal of public debate, but it is a fact that there have been discussions between the Victorian Government and the principal of Evergreen Airlines from time to time on what type of role it might play in the Victorian area. A set of quite interesting proposals are on the table in that regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These things have always been made absolutely clear by the Government to the Victorian Government and also to representatives of Evergreen Airlines: first, that the Australian Government has made a clear-cut decision on the issue of designation of a second carrier. We have said that, for the life of this Parliament at least&mdash;and that does not anticipate a change of policy&mdash;there will be one designated passenger carrier operating from Australia, and that will be Qantas. We will not be designating anyone else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also made clear to airlines operating to Australia&mdash;and Evergreen is now one of those&mdash;the terms of the agreement we now have with Taiwan, which is going extremely well and which has been one of the many advances in international aviation that we have made during the course of this year. Under that agreement, the principals of Evergreen are, as are the principals of any other international airline operating to Australia, entitled if they wish to bid for 25 per cent of Australian Airlines when it comes on the market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, if they are principals of airlines that do not operate to Australia or, for that matter, any other foreign businessman, they are entitled to look at a higher percentage than that. But 25 per cent is that limitation. Of course, they would be very welcome to do that if they wanted to express their interest in that and involve themselves. But there is no implicit or explicit government undertaking that there will be an opportunity, by virtue of such an investment, to then participate in a second designated carrier. I would not anticipate the Government going down the road of a second designated passenger carrier from this country. But if anyone were to turn his mind to that subsequently, I imagine that it would be quite clear that that opportunity would be tendered, not granted. As I said, that is not saying that we have any intentions in that regard at all. So there could be no anticipation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reviewing the navigation aids provided in the Spencer Gulf, AMSA relied on advice from the Maritime Services Advisory Committee on Navigational Safety, a consultative body drawn from the shipping industry which provides advice to AMSA, amongst other things, on changes in the navigation aids network. The Committee consulted its respective associations and shipmasters transiting the Spencer Gulf and, in October last year, confirmed to AMSA that the commercial shipping industry did not have a continuing requirement for those four navigation aids.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other Commonwealth and State navigation aids in the northern Spencer Gulf marking hazards and allowing fixing of position on the recommended shipping tracks and port approaches. One of the four aids concerned, the Middle Bank beacon, is redundant because of overlapping coverage provided by other lights. The other three lights are not required for navigation by commercial ships. In fact, two of the three are ageing structures in poor condition and are considered hazardous to AMSA maintenance staff.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hence AMSA proposes to decommission these four navigation aids, rather than continue to impose their cost on the commercial shipping industry, unless the State Department of Marine and Harbours wants to take responsibility for them. I think the comments attributed to Mr Gregory indicate that these lights are needed as port approach beacons and to assist fishing and pleasure craft. As these are clearly State responsibilities, it is within the purview of his Department to take responsibility for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concerns Mr Gregory and the local councils in the region have raised about this issue have been referred to AMSA. However, the bottom line for AMSA is continuing to impose a charge on commercial shipping for navigation services that commercial shipping does not require. Already the Chairman of the Australian National Maritime Association has been critical of the benefits of shipping reform being eaten away by increased State government charges, particularly port charges, and I think it is very important to ensure that that does not occur. Therefore, if the South Australian Government wishes these aids to continue&mdash;and it may have reason in the light of the circumstances in which it finds itself with pleasure craft in that area&mdash;then that is a matter it ought to wholly meet itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is that if commercial shipping is obliged to pay for these aids then it is likely to kick up very strongly. I know the honourable member for Grey is a man of some substantial influence with the South Australian Government. I think it would be very helpful if he were to go along and have a bit of a chat with that Government and strongly advocate that if it sees real value in these services&mdash;and only it can know this from the pattern of usage of pleasure craft in the area&mdash;it would be sensible for it to spend the money on them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The activities today of this House in Question Time are indicative of what is the single most important failure of the Hawke Government, and that is the complete shambles and complete lack of authority that have been demonstrated by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in relation to his Ministers. His Ministers in fact take it now almost as a God given right that they can speak out and take any public position on any issue irrespective of the decision making processes of the Government. What we saw today in Question Time was a Minister deliberately trying to duck the authority of the Prime Minister in relation to his responsibilities as a Minister of this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, it has been a basic tenet of the practices of the Westminster system of government that there are very clear-cut standards and procedures in relation to the concept of ministerial responsibility. Might I just read from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS>, second edition, page 87, where the following quotation appears:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been generally agreed that among the principles implicit in the convention each Minister is required to abide by the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* he or she must be prepared not only to refrain from publicly criticising other Ministers and their actions but also to defend them publicly, or else resign.</PARA>
<PARA>It is as clear-cut as that. They must be prepared not only to refrain from publicly criticising other Ministers and their actions but also to defend them publicly, or else resign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On several occasions this afternoon in Question Time the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) was given the opportunity to publicly and without qualification support the Government's decision in relation to the third runway, and he chose not to do it. In fact, he went as far as he could, I believe, in the context of Question Time, to maintain his independence on that issue. He went as far as he could to maintain his independence by drawing attention to the fact that the Prime Minister's description of the decision making processes in relation to Caucus and in relation to the Cabinet on the third runway were only essentially accurate, not totally accurate. Then, of course, he refrained from giving the unequivocal commitment that is required of him in his position as a Minister to publicly support the position of a government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know, of course, that this decision that has been taken by this Government has had a very long and chequered history in relation to the Government showing a degree of sustained inactivity. It was a decision that we had taken in government back in 1982. The honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife), now Manager of Opposition Business in the House, then, as Minister, took that decision to government and supported the construction of the third runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Government then ran in 1983 in opposition to the third runway decision. The members of the Government then spent the rest of the last seven to eight years fighting and scrapping amongst themselves to try to get that item back on the agenda and to take a decision which was, as I say, taken in 1982, and should have been taken at any time from then, particularly as our economy went into the worst recession in 60 years and there was a desperate need for this Government to come to grips with the economic malaise of this country and to show a little bit of leadership. But right through that period this issue has fundamentally divided this Government. What we have seen in recent days is a Prime Minister who is fundamentally weak, who lacks the necessary authority to continue as Prime Minister, and is unable to pull his Ministers into line on issues as important to this nation as the third runway.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is just the last of what has been a series of public displays of weakness by our Prime Minister where he has allowed members of Cabinet to speak openly and to criticise his position, to differentiate their position on major Government policy issues, and he has been unable, on any occasion through that period&mdash;as he was again today&mdash;to pull them into line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last couple of weeks, for example, we have seen Senator Richardson publicly criticise the Prime Minister and his leadership on several occasions, either directly or indirectly, in his role as campaign manager for the ex-Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), who is the major leadership contender for the prime ministership of this country at the present time in the ALP. This week we saw the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) publicly announce that the Prime Minister would be making a statement about the Government's position on the State Premiers' proposal for revenue sharing. Those are two clear-cut examples of the Prime Minister's having had every opportunity to pull these people into line and, of course, of having refrained from doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This example today is a clear cut example of what has been a succession of prime ministerial and ministerial failures that go to the very heart of this Government and its inability to govern this country. This Minister, the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services, has wilfully and knowingly, I believe, breached the agreed principles of Cabinet responsibility. It has come to our attention that yesterday evening, after the Cabinet and Caucus processes had taken their course, the Minister was quoted on radio as saying that he was not bound by the Cabinet decision. He went out knowingly to continue to support a position he had taken against what became the Government's decision on the construction of the third runway at Mascot. Called to account in the Parliament today, he was unable or unwilling to confirm publicly what he is required to do under the agreed principles of Cabinet responsibility, that is, to publicly support the position of the Government on a decision such as that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is pertinent to recognise that the Minister in question who is being censured has not got a sense of decency and sense of propriety, and does not give Parliament its due place in this public debate, because he has left the Parliament at this particular time and is not prepared to face the censure for his unwillingness to support the decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>The position is clear cut. If he is not prepared to come out and publicly support this decision that the Government has taken to go ahead with the construction of the third runway, if he is not prepared to put aside his own personal views&mdash;I might say he seems to have been given a particularly wide berth in being able to put those personal views both publicly and privately up to the time the decision was taken&mdash;and if he is not prepared, now that the decision has been taken, to publicly stand up and defend the Government's position, to give unequivocal support to that position and to go out to defend that position, he is left with no choice but to resign under now what are well established and well agreed principles of ministerial responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is interesting that there is probably more to this issue than has emerged in Question Time. When the Minister said that he thought the Prime Minister's description of what had happened was essentially accurate, he was tipping us off that in fact there were other elements to that agreement with the Prime Minister that had not yet come to light.<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS> It is interesting in this regard that an ex-Minister of this Government, the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch), was on television this morning on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Today</EMPHASIS> show and was asked this question by Mr Liebman:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Who sold you down the creek then?</PARA>
<PARA>To which he replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, it is reopening old wounds but I had undertakings from the Prime Minister that weren't honoured and that is simply the truth of the matter.</PARA>
<PARA>That begs the question as to whether the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services feels similarly cheated by our Prime Minister. I will tell honourable members what I think that deal was. I think the deal was that he would be allowed to campaign publicly, before the decision was taken, against the construction of the third runway; secondly, I think he was allowed to speak in the Cabinet meeting and to put his case; and I think that the third part of the deal, and the important part of the deal, which has in a sense been exposed here in the Parliament today, was that he could continue to speak and to campaign against that Government decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at what he said last night on radio when he was asked the following question by a journalist:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can you campaign against this?</PARA>
<PARA>we see that he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not bound by the Cabinet decision. My view is well known and my views are, I am sure you are all familiar with them.</PARA>
<PARA>It is a very clear-cut case; he says he is not bound by the Cabinet decision after the Government had taken its decision and after he had had his opportunity to put his case. From that we can conclude only one thing, that there was a deal with the Prime Minister and they hoped they would sneak by on the basis of his not being called to account. The Minister has no choice but to resign. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the motion, and say that the only charitable interpretation which can be put on the fact that the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) is so cowardly that he is not in the House at this time to deal with this motion is that he has gone back to his office to type the letter of resignation which is owed to this Parliament. There is no doubt that the principle of Westminster convention and Cabinet solidarity has been totally breached by the actions of this Minister, not only in the last 24 hours but also in 2 1/2 years. Remember that it was in March 1989 that the Federal Cabinet made the initial decision to proceed with the third runway, and to proceed with it subject to the environmental considerations. The principle became clear cut when the Minister, as honourable member for Sydney, accepted his portfolio position and then decided to mount a sabotage campaign against the third runway. At each and every opportunity he used his position as Minister, his entitlements and his additional staff resources to mount a major campaign against the fundamental decision of the Federal Cabinet of March 1989 to proceed with the third runway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Minister has breached that principle every week he has been a Minister, and more so in the last two days. In supporting the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) I want to highlight the very real nub of this matter. Yes, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) gave some sort of deal to allow this outer Minister to enter Cabinet to argue the case against the third runway. The second aspect of that deal, we were told, was that he was also allowed to then go to Caucus to continue that debate. But the third aspect which the Prime Minister indicated was that after that Caucus broke up, after that decision was taken, the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services was bound to the Cabinet and Caucus decision. Indeed, the Prime Minister added, `and so are all the other Caucus members', such as the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch), the honourable member for Kingsford-Smith (Mr Brereton), and indeed the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Leo McLeay). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was after the Cabinet and Caucus decisions that, we now suspect, there was a further deal. That further deal was that the Minister had a very special exemption to go back to his electorate and to continue to oppose the third runway decision. That was the answer the Minister gave to the first question by the Leader of the Opposition. That is the nub of the matter&mdash;he had a very special deal to go back to his electorate to say that `because of our very major concerns about the implications of the issue for our electorate, we were'&mdash;and I quote the Minister's answer to that question&mdash;`permitted to do that on the basis that we would not be bound by that Cabinet decision'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having watched the moronic performance of members of the Opposition during Question Time when they got their questions out of order, as far as I can see the last bunch of people I will take advice from on parliamentary tactics is that lot. Let me dispose of this matter very quickly. The simple fact of the matter is that there is no case to answer. The reason why we have taken the unusual action of allowing this to be debated as a suspension of standing and sessional orders rather than as a censure motion, is as a matter of courtesy to the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). He moved that the standing and sessional orders ought to be suspended. Generally speaking, we would accept a censure motion where we thought there was any particular point in it. If we were not going to accept it, we would knock off a suspension of standing and sessional orders without debate.

What did the Leader of the Opposition have? The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) came into this place and was asked the following question: do you agree with the analysis of events by the Prime Minister?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Mr Speaker, Australia today is at a point of historic convergence: the hurt of the recession is at its maximum impact; yet, simultaneously, and by no means coincidentally, the gains and rewards of the long hard process of restructuring are within our grasp.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The immediate focus of this statement is on the problem of unemployment. But through that prism, I want today to look ahead&mdash;to the prospects and promise for this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this statement today I bring to the people of Australia a message of fundamental confidence. It is a message grounded firmly on the facts, not only the factual evidence of recovery, but upon the most important fact of all&mdash;that the work of this Government over the years, and the response of the Australian people, have brought us together to the threshold of a new era of achievement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the specific context of unemployment, let me begin with this unqualified assertion: this Labor Government has an unalterable commitment to preventing the present levels of unemployment from becoming a permanent feature of the Australian economy and the Australian society. I say to this House what I have said repeatedly outside: I have not spent the whole of my 33 years in public life in the Labor movement of Australia to acquiesce in allowing the present high levels of unemployment to continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some weeks ago, I initiated an examination of what action the Government could take to respond to the current severe unemployment situation. In the same period, the members of the Parliamentary Labor Party's working group on unemployment, under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods), have worked with great diligence to produce a constructive report, and I thank them for it. Further, in accordance with undertakings I gave in my address to the ACTU Congress in September, I met with representatives of the ACTU on 29 October to consider their proposals to alleviate unemployment. I have also had the benefit of consultation within the Economic Planning Advisory Council, and I take this opportunity of thanking all members of EPAC for their constructive contributions to the discussion on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an outcome of our analyses and these consultations, I shall be detailing, later in this statement, measures related to the unemployment problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures build on the strategy for reducing unemployment already put in place by the Budget. The measures include:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">initiatives in the post&mdash;secondary area to ensure that our young men and women have access to training in the long term as well as in the short term. High quality investment in additional training now will deliver a work force better suited to the challenges of the future;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">a further expansion of labour market programs to assist the unemployed obtain and upgrade skills. This will not only help prepare for the recovery but will ensure a proper safety net is provided for those who have been most affected by the recession;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the acceleration of infrastructure projects in the areas of road, rail, post-secondary education, and science, with benefits for our traded goods industries and for the quality of teaching and research in our educational and scientific institutions; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">facilitation of the development of new industries and restructuring of existing industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures total some $313m in calendar year 1992. They are measures which meet the critical tests of advancing our economic strategy, while maintaining the integrity of the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the Budget, we have been carefully watching economic developments to ensure that the Budget strategy for sustainable recovery with low inflation is on track. It is on track, and we are determined that it stay on track. This Government will not be diverted from its fundamental economic strategy and its goals:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">sustainable recovery to provide sustainable job growth, and rising living standards; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">above all, the goal of building an internationally competitive economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There may be some who would argue that the Government, satisfied as it is that the fundamental economic strategy is on track, should pay no regard to the representations of the ACTU, and others, on the matters dealt with in this statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only do I reject that argument, but I go further. The very fact that our strategy is on track&mdash;the fact that the great objective of creating a restructured, low inflation, internationally competitive economy is now within our grasp&mdash;is in large measure a result of the constructive cooperation and restraint that have been practised by the working men and women of Australia. That is, precisely, a reason to listen to those who represent them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Their members have experienced unemployment, not only through the recession, but through the process of long term industrial restructuring we are pursuing. Yet in the representations they have made to us they have not asked for this process to be slowed. They understand, accept and are committed to its continuation, in the knowledge that it is in the long term interest of their country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And, of course, Mr Speaker, the views of the union movement reflect the growing concern at all levels of the community, as the statistical projection of unemployment of more than 10 per cent, made in May, has become the harsh reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nobody feels this concern more deeply than I. It is a concern fully shared by every member of my Government. That is why we accept it as our inescapable duty to take whatever action we responsibly can to restore sustainable job growth as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given this Government's unsurpassed record of job creation since 1983, there can be no doubt about our commitment to this goal and our capacity to achieve it. This is a Government which from its inception has been absolutely committed to sustainable job growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Budget-time forecasts were for growth of around 3 3/4 per cent through the course of 1991-92. The main sources of growth were expected to be business restocking, housing investment, and moderate growth in private consumption. Net exports were also expected to contribute to growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indicators available since the Budget support those forecasts: we are coming out of recession. The early stages of recovery are clearly evident in the trend growth now apparent in the housing and retail sectors, and there are now positive signs pointing to recovery in other sectors. Building approvals for private dwellings increased by around 15 per cent in the September quarter. Retail sales have shown renewed strength, growing by 2.9 per cent in real terms in the September quarter. Indexes of consumer sentiment are significantly above their levels of a year ago. Business surveys indicate that the outlook for sales, profits, and investment is beginning to improve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our international trading performance has improved markedly. We are on track to record a current account deficit in the order of $14 billion in 1991-92, considerably lower than in recent years both in absolute terms and as a proportion of GDP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While unemployment has reached unacceptable levels, the level of employment has stabilised in the last four months, halting the falls in employment that have been occurring since mid-1990. The recent improving trend in full time employment is encouraging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this is consistent with the view that the economy is in the early stages of recovery. This is not to deny that unemployment may rise further. But the essential point is that the evidence of the recovery has begun to appear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A central objective of the Budget strategy is to ensure that, as the recovery proceeds, the Budget will move back into surplus. This will free national savings for productive investment by the private sector. In this way, the current account will be safeguarded and the economy set on a sustainable growth path. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the Budget was drawn up, the immediate risk that private calls on national savings would grow faster than public calls were falling has lessened. This lessening is attributable to two main factors:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">first, the forecast reductions in inflation have been factored into community expectations more rapidly than we had hoped;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">and second, there has been a worsening of the drought, leading us to be less sanguine about prospects for the rural sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These domestic developments have taken place against the background of some uncertainties about the economic prospects for our major trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes have not been of a magnitude to cause us to revise the Budget forecasts for overall activity. However, they have reduced the risk that any supplementary measures would see the public sector's call on national resources become unsustainably high. This reduced risk is particularly true of measures targeted to the period immediately ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, there is now some scope to do more to prepare for new jobs and opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, Mr Speaker, we must continue to recognise the limits which responsible economic management imposes, at this critical point in the recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To fail to do so would be to throw away the real gains which underlie the present economic situation, and which underpin the splendid prospects ahead for this nation, as a strong, competitive, low inflation economy, enmeshing itself in the economies of the world's fastest growing region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To maximise the benefit to the economy at this stage of the cycle, the measures I announce today are concentrated in calendar year 1992 and, wherever possible, in the first half of 1992. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Education and Training</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said that a major thrust of these measures is directed towards expansion of education and training programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this area, I announce today proposals involving gross expenditure in calendar year 1992 of $130m. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Education and training are basic to the Government's strategy of building a competitive Australia. And they are basic to the more immediate hopes and aspirations of many thousands of individual Australians, especially among our young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Community demand for education and training is at its highest level ever. The proportion of our young people remaining to the end of secondary school has virtually doubled in a decade and student numbers at our universities have risen by over 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A different situation, however, applies in vocational education and training, including TAFE. While student demand for TAFE and training has continued to increase strongly, labour market conditions and budgetary priorities of State governments, who have the responsibility in this area, have combined to limit the training opportunities made available in this essential sector. In consequence, the level of unmet demand for TAFE has risen steeply in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This situation demands urgent action. I must say, Mr Speaker, that one of the major disappointments arising from the Premiers' decision not to attend the Special Premiers Conference in Perth next week is that it will make resolution of these problems even more difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem has been highlighted, may I say, dramatically and with extraordinary competence by the Finn report on post-compulsory education and training. The Finn report poses major challenges for all governments, State and Commonwealth. We must respond to these challenges. It is time TAFE took its rightful place within the education system of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has decided to provide extra funding in 1992 to enable additional enrolments in post-school education, mainly in TAFE. In total, a sum of $115m will be provided for post-secondary education and training. A further $15m in higher education capital funding will be brought forward from 1994. This additional funding will be allocated mainly to provide additional TAFE places, and to meet urgent needs for equipment and building refurbishment in both TAFE and universities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For 1992, the Government expects that these measures will provide an additional 40,000 students with opportunities to gain vocational skills. The States will be required at least to maintain their expenditure in real terms in 1992, pending the negotiation of longer term arrangements. They have also agreed to cooperate in maximising the number of places provided from the additional Commonwealth funding. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, the unemployed have borne the heaviest cost of the recession. Despite the economic recovery which is now under way, the number of long term unemployed will continue to rise for some time to come. If we are to harness in full the opportunities provided by recovery, we must strengthen the skills of job seekers and particularly the long term unemployed. It makes economic sense to do so&mdash;by ensuring that skills shortages do not emerge during the recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, social justice demands that we do so. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Speaker, my statement today focuses, and properly does so at this time, on the matter of most immediate concern to the people of Australia, the problem of unemployment. I do not seek to disguise the magnitude of the problem. And we should all acknowledge the fact that even when the recovery is fully under way, and job growth restored, substantial reduction of unemployment levels will take time. To grasp this reality, one only has to recall the post-recession experience last time. Even when this Government had achieved average job creation of 230,000 a year, as it did over the period to mid-1990, the associated fall in unemployment was gradual compared with the spectacular growth in jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in acknowledging that, let me say, Mr Speaker, it is time, beyond time, to stop talking down the Australian economy. The central fact is that the Budget strategy is on course. The economy is recovering. And we will emerge from the recession with a stronger economy than before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me illustrate this truth by pointing to the results of the structural reforms we have already achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Exports of manufactured goods have increased by 112 per cent in real terms since 1983-84. Within manufacturing, exports of manufactured metals have risen by 62 per cent and exports of the more complex non-metal manufactured goods have increased by 147 per cent. Over the same period, exports of services have increased by 77 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The official Oecd statistics show that Australia's manufactured export performance in the past five years has been by far the best in the Oecd. They show that, in real terms, annual growth of manufactured exports has averaged over 15 per cent in Australia compared with the Oecd average of 6 per cent. Australia's rate of manufactured export growth has even outpaced that of the four newly industrialising economies of Asia&mdash;south Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong. These trends emerged well before the recession and have continued throughout the recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These facts are a remarkable tribute to the drive and the initiative of much of our business sector. It is a performance which presents an example and a challenge to the whole business community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity of commenting, on behalf of the Opposition, on the parliamentary statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on what he calls the economy and employment. We do not need any more assessment of what we have had here this afternoon than that of his own colleagues: they sat there quietly; they sat their half asleep. There was a total lack of enthusiasm&mdash;a total lack of support&mdash;because they know, sad though it is, that this statement is little more than a joke. If the situation were not as serious as it is in relation to the pain and hardship of unemployment, this could be easily just accepted as a joke. But the situation is much worse than that and it calls for a much more substantive response than is within the capacity of either this Prime Minister or this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This statement this afternoon is nothing more than a blatant political exercise. Think about it: where did it come from? Where did this statement originate? There is an attempt in the first page to explain some sort of chronology of events leading up to this statement. But this statement arose under the pressure of the leadership challenge of the ex-Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), who, while the Prime Minister was over in Harare, made a couple of statements, publicly campaigned about unemployment and jobs and, of course, torpedoed the new federalism initiatives. The Prime Minister got on the plane to come home. He was under an enormous amount of pressure to do something positive. He got off the plane and said, `Well, I am going to have a jobs statement; I am going to make a statement about employment'. That is where it came from. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is nothing more than a blatant political exercise. This statement has been cobbled together in the last couple of weeks to try to give it some semblance of responsibility and respectability. But there is nothing in there of any substance. This does not go to the heart of the unemployment problem in this country. This does nothing about the true plight of unemployment in this country. I doubt whether the Prime Minister has any concept of the magnitude of the unemployment situation in Australia today. If he has, I ask how he could start a speech with the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia today is at a point of historic convergence: the hurt of the recession is at its point of maximum impact; yet, simultaneously, and by no means coincidently, the gains and rewards of the long hard process of restructuring are within our grasp.</PARA>
<PARA>Can honourable members imagine the joy and comfort and the warm inner glow that those who are lining up on the unemployment rolls are today feeling when they hear about this historic convergence? They have no doubt about the first part of that convergence, that the hurt of the recession is at its point of maximum impact, but they will be totally cynical&mdash;as will everyone else in this country be totally cynical&mdash;about the claim that the long, hard process of restructuring is about to bring us any rewards. There are no rewards, and there are no answers in this document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, this is a blatant political exercise. It is designed to appear to do something about jobs. It is designed to appear to recapture the initiative that has been taken away by the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland, while the Prime Minister was in Harare, and it does nothing to deal with the fundamental problem of unemployment in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is particularly important to note that the Prime Minister, having in his earlier remarks said that the immediate focus of this statement is on the problem of unemployment, went on to talk about himself and his job. He always puts his job far and away ahead of the jobs that need to be created for the nearly one million Australians who are unemployed as a result of his policies and as a result, of course, of the policies of the ex-Treasurer, who is sitting up there, I am pleased to see, in support of my statement&mdash;not necessarily in support of the Prime Minister's statement. As we go through the document we see how he focuses on his own role and he says&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There goes the honourable member for Blaxland. The Prime Minister made the following statement:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the specific context of unemployment, let me begin with this unqualified assertion: this Labor Government has an unalterable commitment to preventing the present levels of unemployment from becoming a permanent feature of the Australian economy and the Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA>I can only think back to the statement he made in the course of the election campaign in 1983, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One in ten Australians out of work&mdash;a figure no Australian would have believed possible a few years ago, and which no Australian Government should ever be forgiven for creating.</PARA>
<PARA>I could not agree more. He has had eight years in the job. The situation is markedly worse than the situation he inherited. He has done nothing about job creation in Australia. His monument today, 8 1/2 years into his term as Prime Minister, is nearly one million Australians unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been rightly said in the past, honourable members opposite can hardly call themselves a Labor Party or a Labor government if the only monument to show for it is one million unemployed. I make a prediction that this statement will go down in history with some of the other `world's greatest statements' and `world's greatest events' of the past. They are totally vacuous statements, absolutely without any sense of vision or direction, absolutely without any understanding of the nature of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Remember the great economic summit back in 1983? Then there were the tax summit in 1985, the priority one program of 1985, the billion trees program of 1989, the third term micro-reform agenda&mdash;and micro it was&mdash;and the new federalism initiative. There was absolutely no concept on any of those occasions as to the nature of the problem, and there is no concept today. This document does not even scratch the surface of what has to be done in Australia to deal with the problem of the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister makes another opening remark:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The immediate focus of this Statement is on the problem of unemployment. But through that prism, I want today to look ahead&mdash;to the prospects and promise for this nation.</PARA>
<PARA>`Prism' was a very carefully chosen word. It distorts his vision very, very badly. He has absolutely no understanding of the nature of the unemployment situation in Australia today. As I said, there are nearly one million Australians presently unemployed as a result of this Government's policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let us look at some of the components of that pain and hardship. The expression `one million unemployed' is getting a lot of currency, but it does gloss over the magnitude of some of the pain and hardship that really exists in Australian families today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latest statistics, for example, reveal that 226,000 people are unemployed from families where no-one has a job, which is an increase of 41 per cent in the last 12 months. There are 193,000 Australian children who live in homes where nobody has a job, which is an increase of 40 per cent in the last 12 months. There are 566,000 people who have now been unemployed for more than three months, which is an increase of 70 per cent in the last 12 months. A total of 219,000 people have been unemployed for more than a year, which is an increase of 74 per cent in just 12 months. One year ago the median duration of unemployment was 13 weeks; today it is 26 weeks. That starts to convey the magnitude of the unemployment problem and the pain and hardship that it brings for average Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no wonder that Roy Morgan research shows that 28 per cent of Australians now fear losing their job, and 53 per cent fear not being able to find another one if they do lose their job. Unemployment is the single biggest issue in this country today, and one can only be appalled that in those circumstances this Prime Minister comes in with yet another vacuous statement which will do nothing to create jobs of any significance in this country in the remaining time that he will be in government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that we are now locked into a level of unemployment in Australia that is nothing short of alarming. We have to go back to the 1930s to find an experience where our unemployment problems were as bad as they are today. One can take the Government's own model; one can use its assumptions. One can do projections out through the 1990s, and one will find that in 1995-96, for example&mdash;the middle of the decade&mdash;we will still have, under this Government's policies, nearly a 9 per cent unemployment rate in Australia. Think about it&mdash;another five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are starting from a position where we already have 30 per cent youth unemployment; we already have that long term duration of unemployment, with the prospect of 300,000 Australians ending up as long term unemployed, and under this Government's policies we will not do much better than 9 per cent by the middle of the decade. Of course, even to get that number, in the Government's model, means further significant cuts in living standards of average Australians, a resumption of higher inflation and a current account deficit that blows out back towards 6 per cent of GDP. Think of the pain and hardship now, and try to imagine what it will be like in five years time under this policy&mdash;indeed, under the policies of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against that background, to get a document like this, which does virtually nothing to create genuine and sustainable jobs, is nothing short of a tragedy. It shows the extent to which this Prime Minister is totally paralysed today in terms of his inability to put in place the decisions that are needed to actually give some hope to those who are unemployed in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go on and briefly talk about some of the measures the Prime Minister specifically refers to in this document. In doing so I think it is important to note that on the first page, of course, it is indicated that he got the clearance of the ACTU before he made any statement. The ACTU has the veto over this. One of the great challenges for the rank and file in the next election is to recognise, and to vote accordingly, that the leadership of the ACTU, along with the Government's leadership, is to be deserted. They should vote with their feet and demonstrate that they now have a total lack of confidence in that leadership, which obviously has not been in their best interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice Bill Kelty and his mates still have their jobs. But how many of the rank and file have lost their jobs while they played these stupid games with this Government in the way that this Government goes about its business?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also interesting to note on page 2 that the statement says that, despite the fact the Government is spending quite a lot of money, it is `maintaining the integrity of the Budget'. What on earth is `maintaining the integrity of the Budget'? It can keep spending more and more, but somehow it will maintain the integrity of the Budget. The fact is that the total package of measures the Prime Minister brought down today is unfunded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Next week when we bring down our package, Government members will climb all over it to try to find a dollar here or a dollar there to say that we did not fully cover this with the funds. They will ask, `Where is the money coming from?'. I ask: where is the money coming from? In this statement we have a significant increase in Government expenditure, something to the tune of $390m on today's initiatives alone, which is fully unfunded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just in case honourable members have missed it, I point out that towards the end of the figuring there is another admission that sort of slots in, that the Government has actually spent nearly another $1 billion since the last Budget. So we are looking at somewhere around $1.6 billion or $1.7 billion of additional expenditure, all of it unfunded. There is a $1.7 billion hole on top of the $4.7 billion deficit, which I think is a hole, which was the essential feature of the Government's Budget on the last occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that we recognise that this is nothing short of a blatant political document, an attempt to throw money at problems rather than deal with problems. Throwing money at problems has never solved anything in this country. What we have to do is get away from the Whitlam generation. He started that concept that everything could be free&mdash;free education, free health&mdash;and now we are going to have free jobs. It is easy to spend money, to throw money at problems. That is the fundamental problem with this country. We cannot create sustainable jobs in Australia by throwing money at the problem. We have to deal with the basic structural problems and inefficiencies of this country, a task that is way beyond this Government; it is way beyond its capacity to take the decisions that are required to turn this place around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, against that background, I think we should be fair. There are some initiatives in this document that do go in the right direction. Some of the education and training initiatives should be funded but they should not mask the fact, which the Prime Minister tried to do, that the Government has no medium term concept of a viable education system for this country. They should not mask the fact that the Government has no medium term concept of how to run the TAFE institutions or how to fund them adequately to ensure standards of excellence in those institutions; they have always been, in a sense, political footballs that are kicked around by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do not take from anything that I say that I endorse a vision behind these numbers. Nevertheless, it is important that we address the failures of the TAFE system. It is important that we make sure that they are adequately funded in the course of this decade. It is important that we make sure, in doing that, that we raise the quality of those institutions, that we do something about the industrial relations problems in those institutions, and we do something about the financial autonomy of those institutions. None of those problems are addressed in this document. The Government is simply throwing more money at them, but throwing more money around is not going to solve these major problems for this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have only to look at some of the statements that have been made by the Government's own committees of inquiry. For example, Ivan Deveson said that we are now arguably at the back of the pack in skills formation relative to other OECD countries. Brian Finn in the Finn report says that training in Australia generally falls short of best international practice. The Government does not have any concept of how to improve the situation. When employers do not train people, the Government figures it can solve the problem with a levy. We really do need a fundamental rethink of training in this country and we need to address the problem in a significant way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similar statements can be made about education. Short term palliatives such as are contained in this document are not going to do anything about the fundamental problems with education in Australia&mdash;the phenomenal erosion of standards and concepts of excellence in education, including TAFE education. Similarly in labour market programs, the Government, always in trouble, spends more money. People are going to be better educated and better trained; they are simply not going to have any jobs to go to because this statement does nothing about creating jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the most offensive parts of the statement are the bits that deal with what the Government calls industry development. We can go through this document and really struggle to find out what the Government means by industry development. One of the decisions is that the Australian Broadcasting Corporation is to get an interest rate subsidy to enable it to expand its borrowings to restructure its land portfolio in Melbourne. I am sure it will be of great comfort to the small to medium size businesses still struggling under 16 to 18 per cent interest rates to know that the ABC&mdash;another group of mates of this Government&mdash;has been able to get an interest rate subsidy to restructure its property portfolio in the midst of the worst recession in 60 years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nine years down the track. It is pinning its hopes on this major project to actually turn the employment situation around in Australia. We have called since 1982 for that project to go ahead&mdash;and we are pleased to see it, in that sense&mdash;but what about all the other projects sitting out there that have been blocked as a result of various other deals that have been done by this Government with the green movement and the Aboriginal heritage movement? Where are all those other projects? The Government says, `Don't worry, we have restructured here. We have got a new decision for approving projects'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It refers to the recent statement by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) headed `Government Acts on Impediments to Major Projects'. What a classic statement that was. The Government introduced a new process which it called the 45-day rule. The 45-day rule is that proposals are to be lodged with the Cabinet committee within 45 days of their receipt by the relevant Minister. On face value one is tempted to say, `That is not bad, within 45 days it will actually get into the Cabinet committee'. But then one realises that all the environmental procedures and the Aboriginal heritage procedures all take place before that piece of paper goes into that Cabinet committee. Of course it might take only 45 days to get from the Minister's office into that committee, but there is no time limit on the decision itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have a basis here for a repeat of the third runway. It was nine years for the third runway. With Coronation Hill we can go back to December 1986, when the conservation zone was established. Finally, the Government struggled with that decision and, in June this year, on the basis of Bula, it took the decision to knock it over. Again, it sent all the wrong signals to the business community about what has to be done in this country to turn things around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the Government has got itself into a bit of a bind on the wholesale sales tax. It concedes our point, as it did in the March statement, that wholesale sales taxes really are a major cost impost on business, so the Government has started to try to take a few of them off business. We have $400m of these taxes which are going to be lifted off business, neglecting the fact that business people pay about $6 billion or $7 billion in wholesale sales tax, depending on which estimate is used?</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9H4">Dr HEWSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What is $7 billion worth? We know $7 billion by 2 1/2 is about $16 billion, and that is what we are going to take off the business community when we abolish the wholesale sales tax as part of our tax reform package next week. I thank those opposite for conceding the argument. If it is worth starting, it is worth finishing. In that sense there are billions and billions of dollars that can be taken off the business community to create genuine capacity to create genuine jobs. Yesterday, my colleague the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), in anticipation of this package, took out some numbers in the Murphy model to see what impact there would be on unemployment if the Government were to spend a few hundred million dollars on infrastructure projects and other things. That is a pretty reasonable question. He used the Government's numbers again, of course, and did the exercise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be generous, let us say there was a $500m boost. This package is only about half of that or less. But with a boost somewhere between $250m to $500m, do honourable members know what that does for the unemployment rate in 1992-93? In percentage terms, it lowers it by somewhere between 0.01 and 0.03. If it starts at 10.55, it becomes 10.54 or 10.52. So all of that for a reduction of 0.03. Obviously the Government was not game to go anywhere near 0.05 because it thought it would be arrested for total incompetence when it comes to dealing with major economic problems in Australia such as unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tragedy of this statement is that there is an alternative if one is prepared to take the right decisions, there is an alternative if one is prepared to provide a bit of leadership, and there are alternatives that one can take in the short term and in the long term to turn our economic circumstances around. We do not believe that there is any real alternative amongst the ones we hear bandied about. To bring about major and dramatic social change in Australia, we cannot tinker. Those opposite have tinkered for eight years and they have got one million unemployed. We have to make significant, major and fundamental change and we have to do it as a matter of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence is there. We can go to any of the major studies that have been done, either by the Government's own body, the Industry Commission, or by the Business Council or others. The reform agenda is there. It is across the board. It involves trimming the size of government, privatising government business enterprises, and contracting out government businesses and the provision of government services. It involves tax reform. It involves, importantly, labour market reform&mdash;a genuine move to enterprise bargaining. It involves addressing all the cost disadvantages in the infrastructure industries, most of which are dominated of course by unions in the public sector in areas such as electricity generation and telecommunications. There is reform of the waterfront and all of those other areas. The package is there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the year 2000, on the Government's numbers we can boost economic activity by somewhere between 12 and 15 per cent or 16 per cent per year&mdash;$50 billion to $60 billion compared with a couple of hundred million dollars. That is what it is going to take to get full employment in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I challenge the Government to make a commitment to full employment. There should be a hard-headed commitment to full employment. It is achievable in the course of this decade. The Government can halve the unemployment rate from 10 per cent to 5 per cent in the course of this decade, keep price stability and get its balance of payments and its debt under control, provided it is prepared to take some of those hard decisions. The options are there. The evidence is overwhelming. It has been supplied by those in the Government and outside the Government, yet the Government has fallen short on every one of those reform decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that there is no alternative to that major process of structural reform in this country. If some of those decisions are politically difficult, too bad. If the Government wants to run around trying to scare people in the course of the next 12 months about a reform agenda like that, we will constantly remind it of the magnitude of the problem it presently has&mdash;one million unemployed&mdash;and the fact that it is not going to do much about it in the course of its remaining time in office under the policies it has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government does not need to be open and objective about this matter; it is going to take time to implement a reform agenda like that and for it to have effect. But it can do some things virtually straight away to turn this unemployment situation around. It could start, for example, by saying that there should be no more national wage cases; there should be no more wage increases in Australia unless they are matched by productivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Government goes straight to the workplace as a matter of urgency and starts to get wage increases that are based on productivity, then for the first time in a decade workers in Australia will have a chance of real increases in real incomes. They will have a chance to actually earn more. If it is backed up with a decent tax reform package, they will have a chance to take home more in their pockets. That could be done today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government could provide the lead. What does it do? Just before the last Budget it stitched up a deal in the Lodge for a 5 or 6 per cent wage increase this year through to September 1992. That, together with the other wage increases that have been given since the latter part of 1989, will give the Government a 7 or 8 per cent real increase in wages right through the worst recession in 60 years. It is the biggest increase that has ever been given by way of wage increases in a recession and it is a major reason why unemployment has already gone to 10 per cent&mdash;it has added a couple of percentage points to that unemployment rate. It is a major reason why it has gone to 10 per cent; it is a major reason why the Government's Budget predicted&mdash;despite what the Prime Minister said&mdash;that unemployment will keep going up under the Government's policies and its neglect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over and above that, there are a lot of other things the Government can do. It ought to be worried about youth wages. It ought to be worried about youth unemployment, given that it is 30 per cent and one in three of the kids who are now doing their school certificates and other examinations around Australia are not going to get a job. A lot of those kids are not going to find jobs in the first half of the 1990s under the Government's policies. It has a responsibility to look at the possibility of doing something about youth wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has so compressed the relativities in Australia that it has discriminated against youth. One of the great tragedies in this country was the monumental failure of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, when he was head of the storemen and packers. Honourable members will remember that he moved on wool classers and eliminated youth wages. What happened? They all lost their jobs. That is the Government's concept of dealing with unemployment. It can reverse that right now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government can also do something about its mad compulsory superannuation scheme. We have demonstrated that taxing the business community will create more unemployment. The numbers are somewhere between 45,000 and 100,000, depending on what sort of assumptions one wants to make. That is the Government's concept. It says, `If you happen to be left in the work force, we might be able to deliver you superannuation down the track as long as your employer doesn't go broke'. It not only destroys the national savings decisions that have to be taken; it also destroys any incentive for people to prepare for their own retirement and it sends the business community, under even more pressure, towards the wall and creates more unemployment. The Government can fix that; it can design a new superannuation system. It can get much more universal coverage of superannuation. It can easily do it if it stops running the rorts and so on that are associated with that system at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whenever these guys fail they resort to compulsion. The Government could not get a health system, so it introduced a compulsory Medicare levy. It could not get any training, so it introduced a compulsory levy. It believes in compulsory unionism and compulsion across the board. It is usually an admission of past failure when the Government resorts to compulsion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing the Government could do immediately is get through Cabinet all the things it blocked in the last few years&mdash;not just the third runway decision. It would send a very positive signal to the business community. People should watch the Government get off its tail and start to genuinely accelerate investment in this country. It could tell the business community it would support a Wesley Vale style pulp mill in Australia if somebody were to put it up and it would not block it on some notional deal that it had done with the green movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government could reverse the Coronation Hill decision straight away. Why does it not do that? It is only a small project; it would send a very positive signal. The business community would respond very positively in that sense. The Government has a three-mines uranium policy which the Prime Minister himself says is illogical, but he does not have the capacity, the courage or the guts to get it through his Cabinet. He is so paralysed that he cannot reverse what he knows to be illogical to produce something which could contribute to the creation of jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could go right through a very long list of projects that are sitting there, projects such as Marandoo, for example, which is still being held up. For nine months it has been promised that something would happen. Nothing has happened. It is a potential major iron ore development. The Government should think about the position in relation to projects like that today. It should go back and think about when the Pilbara was opened up and Hamersley Iron went in there. Two mines were opened, two towns were built and 320 kilometres of railways were built. A port was built and the first iron ore was shipped within 18 months. In 18 months the Government cannot even get to the first stage of the decision making process, let alone the 45-day rule. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area we have identified where the Government could do something about unemployment and jobs in the course of the 1990s is immigration. We have said that in the short term the Government has to face the reality that we are going to have to live with a significantly lower level of immigrants to Australia: firstly, because our capacity to absorb them is a lot less in a recession and we see a very significant percentage of them ending up on unemployment benefits, both compounding their pain and hardship and compounding the pain and hardship of other Australians with whom they have been competing to get a job; and, secondly, because a lot of them do not want to come any more. Why would anyone want to come to Australia in the midst of a recession when all that they can get from this Prime Minister is an inane policy statement that does nothing? It addresses nothing about the basic problems of unemployment in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of short term things that can be done. The Government can start today. It can put those policies in place and it can make a significant impact on unemployment, but all that has to be a forerunner to the major package of structural reform measures that have to be put in place in this country. It is coming down to a very interesting contest between us and the Government going into the next election. We have had the political courage and the determination to do something about these problems in Australia. We have set the political and economic agenda in this country for the last 18 months. We have developed a package of measures that address the issues that I have talked about today. We are going to enjoy jamming it down the Government's throat during the next 12 or 18 months or however long it takes between now and the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are absolutely committed to restoring full employment in this country. We are absolutely committed to maintaining price stability in this country. We are absolutely committed to breaking down some of the inane government practices that the Government has embarked on&mdash;all this reliance on compulsion and centralised control, the mad cities fantasies and mad everything else fantasies. We have seen no solutions to problems, just somebody's fantasy, all backed up by some political deal to stitch up a constituency to keep the Prime Minister in his job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are absolutely dedicated to changing the basic structure of this country. We want a generational change of leadership, a generational change of ideas and a generational change of policies and attitudes in this country. That is what we are going to deliver. We are going to give people what they want in this country&mdash;that is, the right to a job and the best hope they have for self-respect and decency and the best hope this country has. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, an article starting on page one and going over to page six referred in part to some remarks I made at the National Press Club yesterday. In the material portion the report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Howard said he applauded Dr Hewson and his leadership team for showing the political courage to push ahead with the GST package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In praising Dr Hewson, Mr Howard offered a thinly veiled swipe at former Opposition leader Mr Andrew Peacock for adopting much softer policy options at the last election.</PARA>
<PARA>It then quotes me as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`At various stages people have said: "Why don't you guys sit there, say nothing and fall into office, because the other mob are self destructing",' Mr Howard said.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>I am then quoted as going on and describing such an approach as being a recipe for encouraging greater cynicism about politicians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The misrepresentation is the suggestion that in some way those remarks were a reflection on my colleague the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock). That is an absurd proposition. I had in mind people out in the community who, at various stages, have said to me and to some of my colleagues, `We think your GST proposal is a great idea, but why don't you sort of keep it under wraps until you have got there'. Together with the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), the honourable member for Kooyong, everybody else on the front bench of the Opposition and elsewhere, I have rejected that proposition. I reject totally the suggestion that in any way that comment was an express or implied criticism of the honourable member for Kooyong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area of misrepresentation occurs in a report in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> which suggests, under the absurd heading `Howard backs Hawke on State taxing powers', that in some way there is a difference of view amongst the Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) and me on the question of revenue sharing with the States. This theme was taken up in error and in distortion during Question Time by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and, in a supplementary way, I claim a further misrepresentation during Question Time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is, firstly, that the Opposition has not totally determined a completely definitive position on revenue sharing with the States. Therefore, the analogy which the Prime Minister sought rather pathetically to draw between the attitude of the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin) and the Cabinet decision of yesterday on the third runway and the comments made by me and the Opposition Leader on revenue sharing was absolutely erroneous&mdash;patently erroneous&mdash;to all in the House. But, more importantly, when the comments made by me and the Leader of the Opposition are analysed, the suggestion in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, which revels in getting these things wrong I might say, is also absolutely erroneous. The Leader of the Opposition made it clear in a news conference on 18 November, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Well, we have put that as one of the options and we would be delighted to participate in the discussions in that respect.</PARA>
<PARA>Then critically he goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not really see those powers as the issue. Tax sharing though has got a lot of an attraction where really they just get a prearranged proportion of the tax revenue that is raised. They don't get a separate taxing power.</PARA>
<PARA>When one analyses the remarks I have made, one will find that there is no substantive difference between what the Leader of the Opposition has said and what I have said. I reject both the headline and the substance of the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> and, most particularly, I reject the pathetic attempt of the Prime Minister to draw some analogy with our position on tax sharing and the total collapse of Cabinet solidarity so far as the Minister for Higher Education is concerned. </PARA>

In his answer, Mr Paddison stated, firstly, that he believed that any official confirmation of the banks loan projections was most appropriately carried out in the context of the bank's full year results. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So I will not comment on that.</PARA>
<PARA>But he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I did comment that I thought that we were feeling fairly comfortable with our assessment procedures in an environment such as we have now. If you were plus or minus 10 per cent, I think that you would feel that you had done a pretty reasonable job of estimation, and we are certainly within those parameters . . .'</PARA>
<PARA>The concern that this answer may have been misleading arose from information contained in a copy of a confidential memorandum signed by the General Manager of the bank and dated 21 March. An attachment to this memorandum showed that the management of the bank projected non-productive accounts to reach $3.48 billion by December 1992 and potential losses to reach $1.3 billion by that date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The essence of the complaint was that it was reasonable to presume that Mr Paddison, as a senior officer of the bank, would have known of the memorandum of 21 March and the projections attached to it when he gave evidence to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration on 30 April. Mr Paddison confirmed, in evidence to the Committee, that he was so aware. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee of Privileges received a written submission from the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), who had raised the matter in the House in the first instance. The Committee made this material available to Mr Paddison and arranged for him to appear before the Committee on 7 November. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Paddison, in his evidence, expressed regret that the answer he had given resulted in the honourable member for Mayo forming the view that Mr Paddison had misled the Finance and Public Administration Committee. He said that it was not his intention to mislead the Committee or any person who heard or read his evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Paddison said that, with the advantage of time to reflect, he acknowledged that the clarity of his evidence had been compromised by his qualifying comment and that he had been trying to convey the impression that the bank's loan loss and assessment procedures were still regarded as essentially accurate. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I acknowledge that my evidence would have been enhanced by an explanation of the significance of the particular figures referred to by Mr Downer MHR&mdash;i.e. the net figures of $2.5 billion and the net present value loss of $1.0 billion. I apologise for not recognising at the time the desirability of ensuring such clarity.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Paddison stated that the variance between the figures quoted to him by the honourable member for Mayo and those quoted in the attachment to the 21 March memorandum was explained by the fact that the figures quoted by the honourable member for Mayo were net figures, whereas the figures quoted from the 21 March memorandum to the Board were gross figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After examining Mr Paddison thoroughly on this matter, the Committee of Privileges has concluded that he did not intend to mislead the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. Accordingly, the Committee has found that no contempt was committed by Mr Paddison. It recommends that the House take no further action on this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with pleasure that I table the report of the Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities regarding the operation of use immunity provisions in the laws governing corporate regulation. Removing the use immunity and derivative use immunity provisions of the current regulatory framework is not something to be recommended without detailed consideration. I assure the House that detailed, in-depth consideration, is exactly what has gone into this report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee undertook its investigation at a time of unprecedented concern about the ethics of Australia's corporate world and the effectiveness of the regulatory framework which oversees it. It is a concern generated by a minority, but felt by many overseas investors whose fingers were burnt by the questionable activities of ostentatious Australian cowboys and by an Australian public growing tired of reading about the lavish lifestyles of nominally bankrupt entrepreneurs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decade of decadence now past alerts us to the failings of the previous cooperative framework of corporate regulation. In the face of its obvious breakdown, the Government revamped the regulatory system setting up a truly national framework overseen by the Australian Securities Commission. In doing so, the Government was conscious of the need to grant this new body adequate powers of investigation and deterrents, both civil and criminal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advent of the new system met with general approbation from a traumatised investment community. However, doubts quickly arose about the efficacy of the criminal powers in the absence of any prosecutions. In the face of the startling revelations about the corporate excesses of the 1980s, the Committee knew that the absence of trials was not due to any absence of criminal activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The subsequent evidence supplied by the ASC and the Director of Public Prosecutions bought into question the supposedly enhanced powers of the new body. Indeed, it became apparent that the vital investigatory powers granted the ASC had become, in many cases, a poison chalice. In no small measure, this was due to the operation of derivative use immunity and document use immunity provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addressing the concerns about use immunity, the Committee had to strike a balance between the need to guarantee confidence in the regulatory framework and the need to protect the established common law right to remain silent. In striking this balance, the Committee took account of both the unique nature of corporate crime and the privileged legal position that a company occupies in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Corporate crime, of course, has a unique quality, that is, the apparent lack of a direct victim, although the number of indirect victims has run into tens of thousands over the last decade. It is also a crime which may only be known to one person&mdash;the perpetrator. That person is often exploiting the elevated legal status of the company, a status offering limited liability and indeed, in the case of public companies, the ability to raise public money. In many ways this makes the crime all the more reprehensible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee's recommendation to restrict immunities is by no means unprecedented. The superseded Companies Code, the less than satisfactory parent of the corporations law, offered no immunity for derivative evidence. Similarly, a previous report of the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation recommended that the derivative use immunity be removed. For whatever reason, this was not done, much to the detriment of effective corporate regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the United Kingdom the regulation of corporations and securities has been tightened through measures including the curtailment of the right to remain silent. The legality of this reform was subsequently upheld in the high profile, recently concluded Guinness case. If the ASC is to be an effective corporate watchdog, it must have the capacity to employ both civil and criminal penalties for corporate misdeeds. The Government gave it investigatory powers to enhance its other powers in this regard, not to leave it hamstrung by legal technicalities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When jokes about Australia become commonplace in the world financial circles, it is not only embarrassing; it reflects more seriously on the lack of faith in this country's regulatory framework. In a country that relies on foreign capital inflow this situation is clearly unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendations of the Committee are aimed at ensuring that the avenue of criminal prosecution remains open to the ASC. In doing so it will reinforce the intention of the original legislation. The Committee proposes to closely monitor the ASC's use of its investigatory powers. It also proposes a sunset clause so that the effects of the changes will be reviewed in five years time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the international context in which businesses now operate, and in terms of previous legislation, the Committee's recommendations are in no way path-breaking. They are, however, vital to the proper functioning of the country's corporate regulatory framework. For that reason, I would urge their careful consideration. The memories of the 1980s remain vivid. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The tabling of the report of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities raises a matter of utmost importance to this Parliament. Senator Cooney and Senator Campbell, together with myself, have submitted a dissenting report. The proposals to so greatly extend the power of the ASC so that witnesses before hearings are denied the right to remain silent are dangerous in the extreme, particularly where the derived evidence obtained can be used against them for criminal procedures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the principle of the right to remain silent&mdash;like the presumption of innocence&mdash;is absolutely fundamental to a democratic way of life and the freedoms most of us take for granted.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why should the common law privilege against self-incrimination be available to child molesters and the men who tortured and murdered Anita Cobby but not to a person who may have acted in an unethical way in business? If evidence is derived from evidence obtained compulsorily, it should be excluded from use in criminal proceedings. Lack of success in the prosecution of corporate crooks is not, in itself, a reason for this huge increase in the power of the ASC. Could it be that this apparent concern for those who have lost money as a result of the corporate collapses of the 1980s is simply a smokescreen for a more sinister agenda&mdash;that of transferring authority from the elected representatives of the people to the unelected social engineers of the bureaucracy? In these circumstances, is it any wonder that people are beginning to pose the question: who would become a company director?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it perfectly clear that we support the motion because of the absolute urgency of the issue. We do not support the motion to save the political skin of the Government. We do not support the motion if it is to be purely a measure to keep the troglodytes both in the Ministry and on the Government back bench quiet. The plain facts are that this Government has failed to serve the best interests of Australia by waiting until 14 November 1991 to announce the commencement of this most urgent project. It was the Government's decision to cancel the third runway in 1983. For 5 1/2 years it procrastinated, with senior members constantly deriding the calls for the construction of the runway. We have no respect for the Government and its failure to provide the runway before this stage. Any problems the Government may have are all its own doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government must proceed as soon as possible with this project. As the motion states, the project has been subjected over the past 2 1/2 years to the most comprehensive and exhaustive environmental assessment ever undertaken in Australia. Costs have blown out enough with the delays already, and further delays would only further expand costs and help to maintain the congestion and the delays at Kingsford-Smith Airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that Sydney is Australia's major international gateway and that the city and the nation are already severely disadvantaged by the delays at the airport. The Government is talking of doubling international visitors to Australia by 1995-96. The Opposition says that its aim is to redouble that figure by the year 2000. It is therefore absolutely essential that the Kingsford-Smith Airport facility commence immediately and the plans proceed posthaste for the construction of the second airport at Badgerys Creek. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The World Tourism Organisation estimates that by the year 2000 some 100 million people in Asian countries alone will travel offshore for holidays. The major expansion of international travel during this decade will be primarily in the Asia-Pacific region, and Sydney and Australia must be ready to earn their fair share of this growth, and therefore the immediate construction of the runway is absolutely essential. </PARA>

It is about earning foreign exchange for Australia. It is about an additional 40,000 jobs for Australians in the construction, aviation, tourism and hospitality industries.

The purpose of the motion is to exempt this proposal from the scrutiny of the Public Works Committee on the grounds of urgency. At the outset, let me say that I have no criticism of the Minister moving the motion; he is representing another Minister in this House.

However, I do not accept, nor does the Public Works Committee accept&mdash;and if my Deputy Chairman was here, he would be supporting me&mdash;that the project should be exempted on urgency grounds. I believe that the normal parliamentary process should apply.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I totally reject the claims that Ministers make that the Public Works Committee process delays projects. It does not. Projects are delayed because of bureaucrats who do not like coming before committees and departments that cannot get their projects up on time.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee takes very seriously its responsibilities to report to the Parliament as expeditiously as possible on all projects referred to it. If departments and authorities such as the Federal Airports Corporation kept to deadlines with the same efficiency as the Committee displays, we would not be faced with motions such as this, which seek to deny to this Parliament its rightful role in the scrutiny of major public works projects&mdash;and few are more major than this one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One must look very closely at claims made by Ministers that parliamentary processes cause delays to projects such as this. To give an example: the FAC advised the Committee on 3 April 1991 of its likely program of references for the remainder of 1991-92. In addition to the third runway proposal, the list included two other projects at Sydney Airport and one each at Brisbane and Melbourne airports. All were scheduled for referral by the end of 1991. However, with the possible exception of one Sydney project, all have slipped to next year, through no fault of the Public Works Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Will the Minister stand here next year and seek exemption on urgency grounds, when quite clearly the delay has been caused by the FAC? I have no quarrel with the FAC and its desire to get on with the task that it has been charged with completing by this Parliament. I have gone on record as commending the excellent job the FAC is doing in some areas, particularly with the new terminals at Darwin and Alice Springs, which the Committee inspected recently. I add that the Committee was instrumental in ensuring that aerobridges were included in the project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the third runway project is controversial, but that is all the more reason why it should have been referred to my Committee. I also know that the bureaucrats do not want it referred, and that they will fight tooth and nail, as they have for the last two years, not to have it referred. If the bureaucrats' case is so strong, why are they terrified to have it referred to the Public Works Committee? One would think that if their case really was so strong, they would welcome the scrutiny of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People assume that only people who oppose the project would appear before the Public Works Committee, but the Committee also gives an opportunity to those who support the project to put their case. I think it is important that they appear before the Committee, because it is one of the few occasions, especially on very controversial programs, on which ordinary members of the public have a chance to appear before what, in effect, is the Parliament. However, the Government, the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) and the FAC should be aware that the Committee is also charged with a duty by this Parliament and, while it may be inconvenient in the short term, there must be very good reasons for departing from the principles of parliamentary democracy&mdash;and in this case there are none. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a personal level, I am disappointed that the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support did not have the courtesy to inform me, as Chairman of the Committee, that this motion was to be moved today. The first I knew of it was when I received my daily program this morning, and I think that that is outrageous. </PARA>

Firstly, almost half the Parliament tried to censure the honourable member for Sydney (Mr Baldwin). What for? Because he was trying to tell the truth, as he saw it, and he was trying to represent the people whom he is supposed to represent. Yet the Parliament tried to censure him for it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing it underlines is that 147 members of this House will vote for this motion and only one will vote against it. Yet we have to admit that at least 600,000 people in Sydney are bitterly opposed to this project, and they are virtually disfranchised by our system. What we are seeing, as we have seen so many times, is the triumph of the private interest over the public interest. We have seen it in gun control measures, tobacco advertising and media concentration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who are the winners and losers in this issue? The first winners are the existing airline interests. One does not have to be very suspicious to think that the arrangement was made a couple of years ago, probably in my electorate, when the long term leases were granted for the space at Kingsford-Smith Airport. The infrastructure owners around the airport certainly are winners. The users are winners also, because there is no questioning that the airport is a much more convenient place for most local users of that airport. That will not be the case in 25 or 30 years, but it is at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The general aviation people, who are the most heavily subsidised group in this country, are winners. We hear a lot of talk about level playing fields, but we never hear it in respect of general aviation users at Kingsford-Smith Airport. We have to list the Federal Airports Corporation as one of the major winners. It is ironic to list as a winner a body that was set up to protect the public interest, when it has conducted a long and expensive publicity campaign with public money purely as a lobbyist for the airline industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose the Government must see itself as a winner out of this situation, but I think the Government has to look at itself. If it really wants to be a pale imitation of the Opposition, it has to ask itself what it is really doing here, because the Opposition would have got on with this project nine years ago and it would have saved millions of dollars of public money, and it would have saved nine years of hypocrisy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The losers are at least 600,000 inner-Sydney residents who are affected by the environmental breakdown which ranges far beyond noise. It goes also to traffic, physical breakdown of 56 community centres under the flight path, 18 schools and educational organisations and four hospitals, including Australia's most major hospital, the Royal Prince Alfred, with 51,000 patients per annum, and its staff. They are the losers. The real loser is the lowest socio-economic group in Australia. And this is the Labor Party! As many as 8,000 people live within two kilometres of the end of that runway, of whom 47 per cent are non-Australian born, 33 per cent are under the poverty line and 46 per cent left school before the age of 15. They are only a minority. But what is this Parliament about? Is this Nazi Germany? Do we crush 8,000 people because of the interests of the airlines?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A similar number of people in Sydney are now affected by physical danger. We have been living on borrowed time with Kingsford-Smith Airport. There will be a major air crash; it is just a matter of time. All of us hope it will be a long time in the future, but it will happen. While we continue to have Australia's international airport on a site which is only one-third the size of any comparable airport in the world, which will be more congested in the next five years during construction and when it is finished; while we are limiting the use of runways and we have to go against wind restrictions to justify not using the east-west runway; and while we are developing Australia's major international airport next to Australia's major petrochemical works, we have what has to be the worst planning decision in this country's history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The continuation of the Kingsford-Smith project is now depriving hundreds of thousands of people in the outer western areas of jobs and it is forcing on them vastly greater travel times. We have lost the opportunity to provide the infrastructure which that area desperately needs. Again, the lowest socio-economic group is always the loser in the long run. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The taxpayers have really lost out. That is why there has been no cost-benefit study. In spite of a $7m study for the most major project in many years, no cost benefit study has been done. Why? Because it would show overwhelmingly that the money it cost the taxpayer would have been far better spent developing an international airport at Badgerys Creek. It would have shown up the heavy subsidies to those general aviation users and those subsidies just cannot be justified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian tourist industry is also a major loser in this project because, contrary to what everyone is saying, Kingsford-Smith Airport will never be anything other than a third rate airport. It cannot be, because of its size and constriction. We might build a fourth runway in another 10 years, but it will still be a hopeless airport. In Asia there are at least seven new airport sites. Kingsford-Smith Airport is just establishing this country as the poor white trash of Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the effect of Kingsford-Smith Airport on the Sydney region in terms of urban sprawl. In 1945 that airport was as big as two football fields. Today, that area, together with the area around the airport for infrastructure, could house a quarter of a million people at just moderate densities. If we start looking at the public costs of that in Sydney, it makes the cost of airport construction pale into insignificance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would rank among the worst losers of this project the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe). Members of the Opposition have been taunting him about his `mad cities' program, and I give him a lot of credit for putting this whole issue of the cities on the public agenda. But members opposite are right: it is a `mad cities' program if he can support the development of a black hole in the centre of the city, which is one of the major factors in causing the sprawl of Sydney. </PARA>

If honourable members look at the figures, they will see that we have lost 51,000 people from around that airport in the last 15 years. At the end of the development chain, that is the loss of another 25,000 new dwellings out on the fringe of Sydney. In infrastructure costs, that is a loss of over $1 billion dollars.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 before the House particularly because it introduces measures to help frail older people stay in their homes. One enormous achievement of this Government has been the change of society's attitude towards aged people. Australia was rapidly approaching the stage where old people were expected to go into a nursing home for the last months of their lives. Now there is a growing realisation that older people are indeed able to stay at home, that they want to stay at home, and that it is more cost effective in the long run if they do stay at home. This has been the underlying premise of the home and community care&mdash;or HACC&mdash;program, which I think has been a successful initiative of this Labor Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since its inception in 1985, HACC has enabled continuous growth in community care services. The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) certainly has to be congratulated for this expansion. Services such as home care, Meals on Wheels, home nursing, provision of rails and ramps in the home, transport to and from day care centres and personal safety alarms have all been made available to people who would otherwise have to go to a hostel or nursing home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A particular feature of the HACC program has been the packaging or arranging of different types of services to meet different peoples needs. Not everybody needs nursing or Meals on Wheels, and a key feature of HACC has been the emphasis on finding the right mix of services for the right people. There are some people with vested interests who, despite protestations to the contrary, would prefer to see older people regularly shuffled off to hostels or nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite), who spoke at length on this Bill in this House last night, demonstrated, I believe, the Opposition's confused and indeed knee-jerk response to aged care issues. But the crux of this reform of aged care is the Government's community aged care services packages and the restructuring of personal care subsidies paid to hostels into three levels of funding geared to care needs. In what I believe was a rambling 30-minute speech full of groundless criticism of the Government's aged care policy, the honourable member for Dawson last night had the audacity to suggest that the restructuring of hostel subsidies was all his idea and falsely accused this Government of neglecting dementia sufferers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not surprised that the honourable member for Dawson was forced to acknowledge that he liked the three-tiered subsidy scheme for hostels. As a representative of a rural electorate, he would be a fool not to. The reason for this&mdash;and the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services made this patently clear in his second reading speech&mdash;is that initial approvals for community aged care services packages will particularly concentrate on rural and remote areas of Australia or, in the words of the Minister, `those areas of Australia in which it is difficult to build viable hostels due to factors, such as the cost of building, the concentration of people in an area who require care or the lack of suitable land'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly welcome the community aged care services package with open arms. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, my electorate of Kennedy takes up about 45 per cent of the Queensland land mass. It is very remote. Back in the Dickensian decades of the Opposition's aged care administration, once an older person became too frail to cope on his own independently at home, he would be packed off to a hostel or a nursing home usually some thousands of kilometres away on the coast. The emotional cost of this policy for my constituents in Mount Isa, Cloncurry, Longreach or on the Atherton Tableland was, and is, incalculable. Older people, still perfectly capable of living independently with a minimum of assistance, were uprooted from their families and from the communities in which they had lived for perhaps all their lives. The HACC scheme has been profoundly successful in my electorate of Kennedy because it has enabled such people to stay at home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This approach has been so successful that it is now being extended to the area of hostel services. Currently hostel subsidies are only available to people living in a hostel. This Bill, as you know, Mr Deputy Speaker, will enable hostel personal care subsidies to be paid to people receiving hostel personal care in their own homes. The mid-term review of the Government's aged care reform strategy has recommended greater flexibility in the provision of aged care services. In response, this Bill enables over $24m over a four-year period to be provided for community aged care packages. This new initiative will enable the more frail aged in our community to remain in their own homes rather than having to enter residential accommodation earlier than necessary. I know that the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), who is at the table, certainly applauds this response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has consistently demonstrated its commitment to aged care service development and its concern to ensure the relevance of services to the people needing those services. As part of the Government's practice of keeping the program continually under review, it was decided to reduce the target for the provision of hostel places from 60 to 55 places per 1,000 people aged 70 or over. The decision was taken as part of a wider range of decisions to provide more appropriate and effective care for those aged people with a higher level of care needs. The care packages will replace these five hostel places per 1,000, providing both a much greater level of independence and a guaranteed level of security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In keeping with this Government's aged care policy objectives, the packages are designed to offer an alternative to residential care in hostels for those aged people who, with a package of support, could still live independently outside hostels. The packages will be aimed at those people living in their own homes who have a high level of dependency or a large range of care needs and who are assessed as being at risk of needing admission to a hostel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite significant improvements and the numerous benefits of residential care, most older people stay within their own homes because they want to. The development of the care packages recognises this and allows for services to be delivered to appropriately assist people in their own homes. These packages will use a care package manager to arrange a comprehensive package of services. The manager will make use of the many different types of services currently available. These include residential facilities, community services, relatives and neighbours and, of course, private providers. All of the people participating in the care packages will be assessed to determine their needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A similar approach has been trialled under the community options projects under the home and community care program and the hostel option care packages. There are strong indications that this approach provides positive outcomes for the physical and emotional well-being of people using its services, particularly those at the higher dependency level, those with a greater range of care needs and those without carers at all. People at a high risk of entry to residential care have been able to stay in the community with similar security but, significantly, at no greater cost to themselves. It is recognised that, despite the numerous benefits of residential care, it can for some result in greater dependency. These packages maximise the choice for the individual and, as I have mentioned, they use a care package manager to make use of the different types of services currently available, including residential facilities, community services, relatives and neighbours and, as I have said, private providers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time and again governments are accused of providing services without really listening to what people receiving those services want or what people receiving those services actually need. This initiative shows that the Government is listening and that what it is hearing is that frail aged people want to stay in their own homes provided that they can get the services that they actually need. This initiative by the Government will promote just that. To stay in one's own home provides many frail aged people with a sense of belonging and a level of independence that others in the community so often take for granted. It may be a house in which a person has lived for half of that person's life, full of memories of family or a community in which that person has lived or worked for most of that person's life. Why should we take such people out of those communities?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This initiative will have two major benefits for service providers. Firstly, this coordination of services will result in a more efficient use of resources through better use of existing facilities such as kitchens, transport and home care services. Secondly, it will allow for a greater level of contact between the various organisations which provide aged care services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development of community care packages instead of hostel places is a sensible initiative, particularly in the bush. It will be of great benefit to those people to whom we owe so much, that is, the older citizens of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last night the honourable member for Dawson went on and on and on about how this Government is ignoring dementia sufferers. The honourable member for Dawson is ignoring the fundamentals of this Bill. One of the major reasons for the restructuring of hostel personal care funding is to better target funding to hostel residents suffering from dementia. The existing arrangements provide for only one level of personal care subsidy for a wide range of care needs. This is a disincentive for hostels to admit more frail residents. The new arrangements will provide for three levels of funding for residents requiring personal care. Firstly, additional support will be available for the top 10 per cent of residents who are very physically frail, including people with dementia. Secondly, additional funding will be directed to residents with a moderate degree of confusion or dementia. Thirdly, residents with moderate personal care needs will continue to be supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, while the existing dementia grants program is being phased out and incorporated into recurrent funding, the two higher subsidy levels will be provided to all hostels which provide care to dementia sufferers, as compared with only about 37 per cent of hostels under the current dementia grants program. It is a far fairer arrangement, as now all hostel residents assessed as needing support for dementia will receive support, compared to the 50 per cent of such residents under the current system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the honourable member for Dawson has a personal interest in all this and I am surprised that someone who knows the ins and outs of the hostel and nursing home industry, as he does, would have a problem recognising that dementia sufferers will be getting a far better deal under this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another initiative in this Bill that I applaud is the extension of the controls over the quality of personnel operating approved nursing homes to the hostels sector. There are thousands of honest, experienced, efficient people working in the aged care industry. This amendment to the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act will help to ensure that only people with these qualities are involved with the industry. Of course, I know that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, will agree that that is the way it should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may suit the honourable member for Dawson to have this Bill delayed. But I am sure it will not suit the thousands of service providers who would be caused unnecessary anguish as a result of the honourable member for Dawson's obstructionist amendment. This Government is well aware of the problems that delays in funding can cause for nursing homes. This matter is specifically addressed by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill proposes amendments to the National Health Act 1953 which will enable a nursing home to delay applying for a new classification for a patient whose previous classification expired during or shortly after return from hospital leave. Other amendments address nursing homes' concerns about delays in receiving funding for the nursing and personal care of new residents. I believe there is absolutely no need to delay the implementation of these measures, as would be the case if we agreed to the obstructionist amendment proposed by the honourable member for Dawson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also point out that the Bill contains additional amendments to the National Health Act in relation to nursing home matters. The provisions that I particularly welcome, because of the nature of my electorate, are for isolated nursing homes whose infrastructure costs are substantially higher than those of most other homes because of their isolated location. I guess one cannot get much more isolated than Mount Isa and the other remote towns and cities in my electorate. The aged care initiatives announced in the 1991-92 Budget and implemented in this Bill will make further choices available to Australia's aged population, which will lead inevitably to a far better, far improved quality of life. Unlike the honourable member for Dawson, I welcome the speedy introduction of the range of initiatives implemented by this Bill and I certainly commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

At present, as a supposed cost saving measure, it was intended that patients would have to go to their GP to get a referral for these services, rather than be referred by their physiotherapist. This clearly will not save money overall. It might have saved money on one aspect of the Budget, but it clearly would not save money because visits to the GP would have to be funded, at least on the first occasion to get the referral, and probably on the second occasion to get the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Government has very sensibly understood that there was an unintended loophole there. I think these amendments do actually close this loophole, and I am very happy to say that we have looked after the needs of not so much the podiatrists and the physiotherapists but the patients of the podiatrists and the physiotherapists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the guillotine has been applied, and as I know a number of speakers wish to address the House, I will be as brief as I can. The part of the legislation which relates to the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority contains an amendment which in effect allows a process of appeal against decisions of the PRA. As a result of this, aggrieved applicants will be able to go to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review of decisions in relation to the approval to dispense pharmaceutical benefits scheme prescriptions, and also in terms of essential pharmacy allowances and payment of financial assistance to amalgamate or close. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Walters actually drafted an amendment which was worded in very similar terms with certainly the same effect. So, since we would have supported Senator Walters's amendment, we will certainly support this. Again it is a reflection on the poor drafting, perhaps because of the haste in which the drafting was carried out, that there was really no effective system of appeal against the decisions of the PRA. There does need to be a system of appeal as there are a number of problems with the PRA. I think the House is aware, as a result of some of the questions which were asked in the Senate Estimates committee, of the extensive problems in Port Macquarie  Those matters are being investigated. It does seem as if there has been some, let me say, dirty work afoot, in metaphorical terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also another problem much closer to my own home, in fact, which is the area of Homebush West and Flemington. A pharmacist in that area received $70,000 to close. There was no account taken of the need in that area by the Authority. That area has a large number of elderly patients who need a lot of scripts and who are basically not very mobile. Public transport in that area is not good. It has really meant that a number of these elderly patients face a trudge over a couple of kilometres, across such areas as the Flemington Markets, in order to obtain their scripts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly there is a need there, and that need is demonstrated by the fact that some 2,500 people in the local area alone have signed a petition. Dozens of schoolkids have written to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). Little do they know it will not be worth while, because he will never do anything. But they have indicated their enthusiasm for the opening of a new pharmacy which, of course, because of the rigid guidelines of the PRA, has been denied. The guidelines say there needs to be a five kilometre space between pharmacists. In strict terms this area does not meet those criteria, even though the need is clearly demonstrated and will clearly be important, particularly to the elderly, in that community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was mentioned in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on Monday. I understand the journalist who wrote the article received communications from the Minister at the table, the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples), indicating that the information we had given to the reporter about the Homebush <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>West-Flemington area was wrong and that in fact the PRA had not closed any pharmacies. I am always inclined to believe nice things of people, particularly of course of Government members and politicians, so I would be reluctant to assume that the Minister was deliberately deceiving the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> reporter. But the facts of the matter are that a pharmacist did receive permission to close and did receive $70,000 from the PRA to close. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The address, in case the Minister needs it, is 102 The Crescent. If the Minister wants to check the records, the information given to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> was completely wrong. However, I will accept that it was a genuine mistake rather than a deliberate attempt to deceive. If the Minister checks the records, he will find that in fact that is the case. That is something that needs to be addressed and something I will continue to press for on behalf of the local community. I hope in the end we will get some commonsense decisions from the Government about this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other technical points in the legislation. I will go through them very quickly. They relate, in my area at least, to the National Food Authority Act. This provides that recommendations of the NHMRC which were made prior to the establishment of the National Food Authority but which were not actually dealt with by the previous council can be deemed to have been made under the new Act. It basically means that the recommendations can be dealt with as quickly as possible and the NFA does not have to start all over again. Again it was an oversight which is adequately corrected by this piece of legislation. It is a change which we will, of course, support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another loophole corrected and that is again supported by the Opposition, and indeed I think by the whole medical profession. I refer to the introduction of Medicare benefits to encourage day only surgery and the certification which is needed to go with these procedures. The amendment rectifies the oversight. Previously it meant that that certification system was not available to doctors at freestanding surgery facilities. I gather there are something like 64 of these around Australia. That is another loophole which we are happy to support the correction of&mdash;although we believe these errors should not occur. However, as they have occurred we are happy to fix them up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been very unhappy about the actions of the PRA, but we support the changes here. We will support, in concert with the Government, the changes for physiotherapists and podiatrists and to the National Food Authority Act, and also, of course, to the certification procedures. So from the health point of view we are happy to support the procedures in question, just by moving the simple amendment which has been agreed to by the Government to allow podiatrists the same access to radiology referrals as physiotherapists and chiropractors have at present. However, I just remind the House that should we get to the committee stage, we will be opposing clauses 13, 38 and 53 as has been pre-empted by the honourable member for Dawson. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own area a pharmacy recently closed at Merimbula, where there were two pharmacies. The people at Tura Beach, an area which has about 2,000 people, have been told by a pharmacist who holidays there occasionally that he would not mind opening a pharmacy part time. That is 4.7 kilometres away from the nearest pharmacy&mdash;just under five kilometres if it is established in the shopping centre. Naturally, the applicant pharmacist would be interested in establishing it near a shopping centre. He has said that he would be prepared to establish the pharmacy even though he knows that it will not be particularly lucrative. We need to have regard to that fact because the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal invariably puts the case that the dispensing fees it pays should be based on the dispensing costs of a pharmacy processing a reasonable number of prescriptions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naturally, in an area with a population of 2,000 people, the number of prescriptions would be fairly low. When the number of prescriptions is low, the cost of dispensing goes up. It goes up quite heavily because every pharmacy has the same infrastructure. The pharmacist usually has a computer; there is stock and, quite often, in a small pharmacy there are items which are dispensed perhaps only once, twice or three times a month. A pharmacy servicing a low number of people still has to keep a fairly high level of stock compared with pharmacies dispensing a large number of prescriptions. The pharmacy has to have a pharmacist and that pharmacist is entitled to receive a reasonable income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, what the Government has been saying to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal is that it should not have to pay dispensing fees on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme which will cover the costs of pharmacies which dispense well below average numbers of prescriptions. The Pharmacy Guild of Australia, of course, said to the Government, `If you are going to do that, we would like you to do something about the number of pharmacies'. The Government came back to the Pharmacy Guild and said, `Well, we feel that you are the people to do that. Why can't the industry do something about control? We are moving towards industry control; why doesn't the industry control numbers?'. The Pharmacy Guild said, `Well, we can't'. I can understand that. It is a difficult thing for anyone to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in the end the Government&mdash;there were a lot of mixed feelings within the Government&mdash;reluctantly, I believe, agreed to restrict the number of pharmacies, to allow pharmacies to close. We agreed to give pharmacists an amount of money to close. It was quite a lot of money if pharmacists had been there for quite a while&mdash;perhaps $60,000; the honourable member for Lowe mentioned $70,000. We said that we would give pharmacists that money if they were prepared to close. There was considered to be a surplus number of pharmacies. It is not a decision made, as the honourable member for Lowe said, just on the basis of a pharmacist applying. It is a decision that is made after full consideration. I refer to his example of 35 pharmacies within a five kilometre radius. We cannot have it both ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Plenty of pharmacists have come to me and said, `Jim, we feel that there ought to be people who are allowed to get out. They want to get out. They are really locked into this position. They are locked into their pharmacies. They are not making enough money for them. They would rather be out'. In the end they successfully proposed what was eventually adopted by the Government. The Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) knows what we went through&mdash;how much we went through in dealing with pharmacists and their concerns, how much negotiation there was. It was very extensive negotiation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Previously pharmacists were very unhappy. They had signs in their windows telling people that the pharmacy would be closed if the Hawke Government were re-elected. Well, it is interesting to see what has happened. I have plenty of pharmacist friends. One friend still has his four cars. One still has his boat and is able to play golf once a week. They are good friends. They deserve it. They have been in business a long time. But they are still there. I might have been in that position if I had not come into this place eight or nine years ago. They are people of my own age and they are doing pretty well in pharmacy. They are not complaining now. They have done well, particularly when we take into account inflation and the fact that there has not been a level playing field. As I said to the honourable member for Lowe the other day, when the Government is paying bills either directly or indirectly we can never say that there is a level playing field. So those pharmacists are not doing too badly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say some things about the Government's aged care policy. The Government has a policy which is coherent, forward thinking, cost effective and is welcomed by both service providers and older people. By contrast, the Opposition has produced nothing except a few vague words about removing fees control in nursing homes, means testing nursing home benefits and allowing people to buy into a nursing home. Of course, the Opposition is also talking about the impending goods and services tax. Its impact on aged care is awaited, quite properly, with considerable trepidation, particularly by the residents of aged care facilities. I add also that disabled people feel trepidation about the imposition of a goods and services tax&mdash;perhaps imposed on wheelchairs and crutches. Certainly, the residents of aged care facilities will be paying a goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Really what the Opposition has done, just as it did today in regard to employment issues, is come into this place again and attack the Government in all directions on aged care matters while it has had nothing to say.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To its great discredit the coalition allowed Labor to take the initiative, consult widely with all manner of people and organisations during Labor's latter years in the political wilderness and the result was a consensus policy that went to the 1983 election carrying the broad endorsement of many disparate groups.</PARA>

I believe that we are yet to see whether that trust expressed in the newsletter is to be vindicated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to turn to some of the specific measures introduced in the Bill. Probably the most significant change relates to the restructuring of hostel subsidies. The role of hostels in the provision of care for the aged is a significant one. This was recognised in the nursing homes and hostels review of 1986 and the establishment of the residential planning ratios which provided for a significantly expanded role for hostels in the provision of aged care. In the period 1985 to 1991 some 12,000 new hostel places have been provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The frailty of hostel residents also has increased over this period. In 1985 some 46 per cent of hostel residents were assessed as requiring personal care. This is compared with 57 per cent of residents in 1991. Therefore, the need for hostels to support a higher number of frail residents was recognised in the Government's provision of a real increase in the rate of personal care subsidies. This has increased from $7.80 a day in 1986 to $22.95 a day from 13 November 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) attacked the level of personal care subsidy. He talked about dementia patients. We are providing for dementia patients. We recognise that as time goes on people have a longer life expectancy. That means that more of us will suffer from dementia. Therefore, it is important that we take particular care to ensure that hostels and nursing homes have the ability to handle those dementia patients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One level of personal care subsidy has been replaced. That subsidy gave no recognition at all to the variable care requirements of hostel residents assessed as needing personal care support. There was no distinction between the more frail resident requiring support for a wide range of services and the less frail resident with less complex needs. No incentive was provided to hostels to cater for the more frail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since August 1990, the Government has been carrying out a review of hostel recurrent funding to examine the effectiveness of the present two-tier hostel recurrent subsidy arrangements. Specifically, subsidies should assist in providing an incentive for hostels to provide for increasingly frail people and accurately reflect the varied levels of care required by those people. The review consulted with peak bodies representing the service providers, consumers and unions, and took submissions from a wide range of organisations and individuals. The proposals in this Bill are the result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides for the introduction of new arrangements for the personal care subsidy in hostels from 29 April 1992. The existing hostel care subsidy is unchanged. The new arrangements will replace the existing single level of personal care subsidy with three levels of funding. The highest level will provide additional funding for the 10 per cent of residents who are very physically frail, including those with dementia. The second level will provide additional funding for residents with a moderate degree of confusion or dementia. Residents with moderate personal care needs will continue to be supported at the third level. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, I felt that I had to spend some time in responding to the points made by the honourable member for Lowe. It is particularly important that I make these points as well. The threshold at which a resident can attract the subsidy will be effectively lowered in recognition of the requirement for personal care support services by a greater number of residents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The restructured personal care subsidy will provide clear incentives for hostels to provide care for more highly dependent and confused people. An additional $14.6m will be available in a full year in support of the restructured subsidy arrangements. The existing dementia grants program will be phased out over a two-year period and incorporated into the new subsidy arrangements. The new subsidies will be provided to all hostels which provide care to dementia sufferers, compared with about 37 per cent of hostels under the dementia grants program. Several interesting new programs have been introduced recently to help people in hostels with dementia. These new funding arrangements which allow hostels to develop some of these programs will continue. I am not going to elaborate on the programs because, while it is important that I make these points, I want to allow time for other honourable members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The revised hostel funding arrangements allow for equity in the financial support provided to hostels caring for people with dementia. Contrary to the previous arrangements, under which only half of all residents suffering from dementia received specific funding, the revised arrangements will ensure that all residents requiring support for dementia will be identified and will receive appropriate funding. The new arrangements will better enable hostels to play their part in the provision of a range of services to meet the needs of the frail aged. They will considerably benefit hostels and the resources of government will be more sharply focused on those with the greatest need. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to pay a tribute to the shadow Minister for health, the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods), for the hard work and dedication he put in on behalf of the Australian Physiotherapy Association on the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill. I am sure, from the representations that I had from that association, that it would appreciate the hard work that he put in to make the Government see reason on what had been a very grave error in its legislation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like other members in this House, I received strenuous representations from a wide number of physiotherapists. They were particularly agitated about and stressed by the fact that under the original legislation they lacked the capacity to request R-type X-rays. They made strenuous representations to me. I want to mention a couple of them because a number of local physiotherapists made approaches to me. One was the Bendigo physiotherapy group which operates in Heathcote. I was also approached by Mr Trevor Peake, physiotherapist. I also had representations from Adrian Schoo and Ray Pang; Mr N.B. Houghton from the Bendigo X-Ray Centre; Mr Phillip Hughes, the President of the Australian Physiotherapy Association&mdash;and I am sure that he had extensive contact with the shadow Minister as well on this issue; Mr Paul Bennett, a physiotherapist who runs the Golden City Physiotherapy Clinic; Mr Colin Faulkner, physiotherapist, also from the Golden City Physiotherapy Clinic; and Mrs Wendy Cumming from North Harcourt. That is probably only a small sample of the number of physiotherapists who had contact with honourable members not only on our side of the House but also on the Government side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government was very tardy in coming to grips with this problem. It certainly did not show any willingness to agree with the Opposition when this Bill was first debated in this House.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government should have taken note of the Opposition from the outset when it originally introduced the legislation to this House. It would have saved the physiotherapists and their Association from some expense in the extensive work they did to ensure that Opposition members were made aware of this. The Government obviously would have received representations from the Australian Physiotherapy Association, yet it took no notice. This is typical of what the Government claims is its consultation process: it makes a decision, tries to railroad it through the Parliament, and after the legislation comes into the Parliament and there is a bit of an outcry from the electorate, it says, `We will go through the consultation process'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Migration (Health Services) Charge Bill 1991 and the Migration Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1991 are part of the Government's legislative scheme to introduce new charges on applicants, or more particularly their sponsors, for granting them a visa or entry permit to enter Australia. The classes of people who are involved in having to meet the charges that are proposed under these Bills are those who come within certain groups. Firstly, there are those entitled to a parent visa in which the balance of family test has been met; that is, people who are migrating from overseas and who are parents of an Australian permanent resident of more than 12 months duration and/ or a citizen, and that person has enough brothers and sisters in Australia to satisfy the balance of family test. That means that the majority of the family lives in Australia rather than a minority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also applies to the visa class 104 where there are preferential family members involved. That means those who come within the special preferred class of family in respect of minor orphans, special need relatives, remaining relatives&mdash;that is, the ones who may have been left behind on their own because of the migration of other family members before&mdash;or certain aged dependents. It also applies to those who might come to Australia in the Lebanese concession class, and to people who are in like categories who apply to stay in Australia. They are granted an entry permit. It also applies to an aged parent who obtains an entry permit after entry where the balance of family test is met; or a person who is able to stay on compassionate grounds, and that applies in relation to orphan minors, special need relatives, remaining relatives and aged dependents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Migration (Health Services) Charge Bill is designed to raise a charge of $822 which is paid in respect of all of the above visa or entry permits. It has been applied&mdash;and this legislation will therefore have some retrospective effect because it arose from the Budget&mdash;to those who have sought a visa or entry permit on or after 21 August 1991. Unless the charge is paid, the Minister can deny entry to such people. The person who has paid the charge for a relevant visa is exempted from paying the charge which would have arisen in respect of a relevant entry permit which corresponds with the class of visa granted. That means that when the person arrives at the door of Australia and is granted an entry permit, he does not have to pay the charge again if he came with a visa. If an applicant withdraws his application for a visa or entry permit, no charge will be levied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new charge for health and associated costs is to be introduced at $822, we are told, for each person visaed. It will be indexed against the all group consumer price index and is therefore subject to an increase where the indexation factor in any relevant year calculated from 21 August 1992 is greater than one, and the charge cannot fall below its highest previously determined level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been calculated that the charge represents an estimated 50 per cent of the contribution towards the cost of the Commonwealth in providing access to medical, hospital and pharmaceutical benefits to assured persons during their first two years in Australia. It ought to be understood that it does not apply to the cost that might be generated either through the private sector or by State governments, which is a matter I understand of some concern to States in relation to this matter. We will not oppose this Bill because we think it is better than the existing system, and I will come to that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Migration Amendment Bill (No. 3) will give effect to the provisions of the Migration (Health Services) Charge Bill when it is an Act. It will therefore commence on the same day. It amends sections 24 and 34 of the Migration Act which relate to the granting or refusal of visas or entry permits respectively. In the case of each section, the Bill introduces a requirement for the Minister to provide an applicant seeking to enter or remain in Australia with a notice in writing stating that the grant of the class of visa or entry permit applied for cannot take place unless the charge payable under the Migration (Health Services) Charge Act 1991 has been paid. These notices will apply only to those classes of visa or entry permits in respect of which an assurance of support is an essential criterion in relation to the person seeking to enter or remain in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill contains a prohibition on the Minister granting a visa or entry permit until the charge is paid. In addition, the regulation making power under the Migration Act is amended to provide for the refund of charges paid under the Migration (Health Services) Charge Act under exceptional circumstances. So this Bill gives effect to the health services levy and equally will not be opposed by us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we are not opposing this legislation, that does not mean that we should not look at the schema that is applying, the explanation of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand), and why this legislation is before us. I think it is important that we understand that. I do look at second reading speeches, and I read them. And I expect that when I read them I might find some reasonable explanation as to why we are dealing with legislation. I wonder what this second reading speech might tell me about the legislation with which we are dealing. I certainly noted that the Minister linked this Bill, which deals with the levy charge for health and associated costs, with the general schema that has operated to require certain newcomers to Australia to offer assurances of support as a condition on acceptance of their relatives in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been a matter of some longstanding moment, because Australia has sought to put an emphasis on seeking skilled migrants who will add to Australia's benefit, that over time, as we have moved to put a greater emphasis upon family reunion, those who have sought family reunion have come to Government and said, `Look, will you accept our relative? We know they do not have the same skills. They do not necessarily speak English. But we can tell you&mdash;we promise you&mdash;they will not be a charge on Australian taxpayers. We will look after them. We will meet all their needs. We will provide them with the housing. Just let them in'. The governments of the day, and I must say former governments, responded to those requests and they provided an assurance of support scheme. Originally they used to even ask that they produce certain job nominations from people who guaranteed that the family member who was allowed into Australia would be able to be employed upon arrival. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that over time these assurances of support have been maintained but only for the classes of relatives that are mentioned in this particular Bill; that is, parents, preferential family, minor orphans, special need relatives, those with a Lebanese concession and those who likewise apply to change status in Australia. Over time we have seen this schema&mdash;I must say that many people in the community still imagine that it exists&mdash;but over time all the brothers and sisters, all the nephews and nieces, have been allowed without any assurance of support to enter Australia under the concessional family category without having to establish the same standard of criteria in terms of skill and education and other attainment as independent applicants. Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not know whether you are surprised about that, but I imagine that many people are surprised that that change has occurred over time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The assurance of support scheme is very narrowly based, but the Minister tells us:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the assurance of support scheme is to ensure that the burden of some costs which newcomers may generate during their initial years of residence in Australia are borne by their sponsoring families and not by the general community. It is important to note that the existence of an assurance does not mean that any person covered by it cannot receive social security benefits or other assistance. Rather, it means that the assurer is liable to repay any support that is received.</PARA>
<PARA>That seems to be a very reasonable statement. He went on to give us some other explanations of the assurance of support scheme. In fact, he tells us that, at the same time as the Government is introducing these provisions, it is watering down the assurance of support scheme over time. We will not see any further legislation; but, in regulations that will shortly be introduced, the Government will reduce the period for which assurances of support are given, but only for the very narrow class of parents and preferential family visa applicants, and those who get the entry permits that I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those family members covered by those assurances of support will now have to give that assurance for only two years rather than five as has been the case to date. The Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This represents a marked decrease in the time taken to incur debts.</PARA>
<PARA>It certainly does, and I must say that it transfers an obligation to taxpayers generally. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the debts that may be recovered have been restricted to special benefits and job search and Newstart allowances paid by the Commonwealth. Other support costs will no longer be recoverable.</PARA>
<PARA>So all of the other costs that were traditionally the subject of assurances of support will no longer be the subject of a charge. What the Minister was telling us was that the Government is bringing in this new bonding arrangement, which will require somebody to put some money up front, to meet a much more limited assurance of support schema&mdash;one that is of shorter duration and which does not cover the same range of benefits as were previously covered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I read through the rest of the Minister's speech and I found a great deal of detail about the matters that were to be covered by the Migration (Health Services) Charge Bill, but what interested me was that none of the matters that came to notice in the Senate this week in relation to the assurance of support scheme&mdash;the disclosures by Senator Richardson&mdash;were mentioned by the Minister in his speech. We all know, and we have known over a long period, that the assurance of support scheme was honoured more in the breach than it was in its acceptance. We all know that that was occurring. We all knew that a substantial review of the assurance of support scheme was required. I must say that I thought we would have seen from the Minister some evaluation of what was occurring, and some statement as to why this legislation was required and why the reform should take place. I thought we would have seen some information about the nature of the costs that new migrants imposed upon government generally and the difficulties that their families might often have to incur in meeting those obligations. But, no, there was very little of that sort of explanation. That, I must say, was of very real concern to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members would agree, I think, that the support of the Australian people generally is crucial to the maintenance of any immigration program. I have to say that much of the support that the program has historically enjoyed has been seriously eroded in recent years in the light of proven and sustained abuse in many areas of the immigration program. There has been documented abuse across many categories, and while that might not always be the fault of those people who have exploited the possibilities, it certainly left the program with a tarnished reputation. I mention the sham marriages that we have dealt with recently and the business migration program. These are matters of very real concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the assurance of support scheme has also been abused. Millions of dollars remain outstanding, and a large proportion of those outstanding debts will never be recovered. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may be interested to know that Senator Richardson revealed in the Senate this week that at least $20m has been lost in benefits not recovered this year under the assurance of support scheme&mdash;benefits that should have been reclaimed from supporting families. But, because of computer difficulties and problems of keeping track of people who had changed their name&mdash;anglicised their name in some cases, or had multiple spellings or whatever&mdash;the persons against whom claims for that money should be made could not be traced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Richardson estimated that $32m had been spent on Job Search allowances, Newstart and special benefits for newly arrived migrants under the system. All of that money should have been recoverable under the assurance of support scheme. Yet the Minister told the Senate that only $1.77m of that was raised in debts in 1991. I have to say that this is the sort of information that brings the whole program into disrepute. It is a matter of very real concern to me and my colleagues when it occurs. This legislation was introduced, but there was no explanation from the Government of why it was introducing new arrangements of this sort. Not only has the Government been failing to administer properly this scheme, but also it hides the information from us when it can. The Minister did not mention it in his speech as a reason for introducing this new arrangement, but at the same time as he is putting this new arrangement in place, he is watering down the requirements generally for families to support migrants entering Australia. So I think that this is a matter of very real concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new medical levy is expected to recoup some $9.9m in a full financial year, according to the Government. So we can expect the cost of medical, hospital and pharmaceutical benefits to migrants who have been here for two years or less to be only around about $20m per year. However, it is not intended to recover any further health related costs, such as payment of sickness benefits in the first two years of settlement. Payment of sickness benefits to new migrants in the first several years after their arrival amounted to $23m in 1990-91. As I mentioned earlier, the health charge is intended to form a part of a new scheme to replace the old assurance of support scheme. The other part of the scheme involves the payment of a refundable bond by some applicants in the preferential family reunion program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existing assurance of support scheme will be supplemented by a bond of $3,500 for principal applicants and $1,500 for other adults in the family, that is, those who are over the age of 18 years. It is to be used as the first avenue of recovery of debts incurred by assured migrants in relation to special benefits, Job Search and Newstart allowance paid by the Commonwealth. The bond must be paid prior to the visa or entry permit issue, we are told, and will be returned with interest if no claims have been made after the person enters Australia. The validity of the amended assurance of support scheme will be reduced from five years to two, as I have said earlier, and further costs which can be recovered under the assurance of support scheme have been significantly limited. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not seen this other legislative arrangement. As I said, I expect that it will be the subject of regulations, but it is now three months since the Minister announced the totality of this new scheme. These bonds were required to be paid before the Immigration Department would issue a visa authorising entry for those who applied for entry to Australia on or after 21 August 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know I have been very critical from time to time of the speed at which the Department processes migrant applications, but I would be very surprised if we are not faced already with numbers of applicants from family members where assurances of support may be required, where these questions would be required and money ought to be presented. Funnily enough, I had one case drawn to my attention where a cheque for the bond money was sent with the assurance of support forms and lodged with the Department of Immigration in Brisbane. The cheque was returned because the officers in the Department did not know what to do with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question needs to be asked: what is happening to the applications that have been received since 21 August but are expected to have bonds? Are they being accepted? Is the requirement for the bond being waived? What arrangements is the Government making? It is all very well for the Minister to say that he intends to consult with communities before arrangements for the introduction of bonds are finalised, but how long should this process of consultation take? This is not the first example of undue delays in regard to implementation of announced Government policy as it affects the migration program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The time that will lapse between the abolition of the business migration program, for example, and any new business skills category that the Government promised to implement has already been announced as being over six months. These time lags between Government announcements of policy and the ability of the Government to implement policy indicates, at the very least, a lack of communication and, at the worst, incompetence that occurs when Ministers do not make appropriate demands upon the Service for performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be thought that I have been on some frolic of my own in relation to these matters. Some people often suggest that when I speak about immigration matters and raise a concern about the performance of the Government and its Department of Immigration&mdash;and particularly when I have been suggesting that the Government has been allowing the skill level of the program to diminish; when I have made criticism of the way in which particularly the preferential family category has operated and has been abused, especially with sham marriages and the like; particularly when I have made comments in relation to the way in which the Government is now faced with an inability to control our migration entry through the very large numbers of illegal entrants that we are now receiving, the very large number of people now claiming refugee status&mdash;I am out there on a frolic of my own, raising these things and being very harsh in my comments, and I ought to let them go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the fact is that we have seen this week all that I have been saying revealed by the Auditor-General as being absolutely correct in every respect&mdash;spot on. This is coming from people who have had the opportunity to do what I have not been able to do, and that is to get inside and see the way in which the processes are working, see the way the decision making processes are being undertaken and have a real understanding of what is occurring. The general public out there has an impression that there is something wrong, but people do not know, because all they ever see are outcomes; they are not in a position to make the judgments from the inside. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to read to the House something of what the Auditor-General had to say in his comments this week. This reflects very much the sort of observations I made a little while ago about the way in which this Department was treated by this Government when it ran down its ability to be able to effectively administer the migration program, when the Government starved it of funds instead of looking at other programs as a basis for determining savings. At a time when the immigration program was increasing in significant numbers the Government allowed the standard of processing to fall. It is not a matter to which the Auditor-General drew attention, but it is a matter about which I have commented. The Auditor-General noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that in recent years considerable attention has been paid to the need for Australia to become `the clever country'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>a term that we have all no doubt heard. I am sure it is a term you are very familiar with, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;`the clever country'&mdash;a term used frequently by our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and policies and programs in several portfolios have taken account of the national requirement for upgrading the skills of Australian workers, investment in new technologies and encouragement of a range of activities in which the nation could develop a basis for competition with the rest of the world.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This audit dealt with the selection of migrants in categories involving the assessment and testing of employability and skill and rating applicants on that basis. In the light of the national interest in `the clever country' it might have been expected that the process would reflect rising standards and a high priority to selecting persons with skills needed in the Australian work force.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Auditor-General was pointing out that when we degrade testing, as this Government has done, when we abandon the requirement for assurances of support in relation to concessional family entrants, we ultimately get a lower standard of entrant. That is what he was saying. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Several of the audit's conclusions suggest, however, that other policy priorities have received greater attention.</PARA>
<PARA>He lists them:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.In Family migration, the program structure places the skill tested Concessional Family category on a `residual' basis thus according it a lower priority than the Preferential Family category which is not skill tested.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A higher than estimated number of approvals in the `demand-driven' <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Preferential Family category leads to reducing numbers selected in <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the skill tested category.</PARA>
<PARA>He makes a further point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Changes in the points test&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>changes do not occur without changes by Government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">suggest a partial withdrawal from a formerly close nexus between occupational skills, qualifications and experience. It is now less difficult for some applicants to be classified as skilled.</PARA>
<PARA>These are comments from the Government's own independent assessor. He continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comparing the skill tested categories, Concessional Family applicants receive the advantage in the points test of a lower Pass mark than Independent Entrant applicants, and may also receive substantial points towards the mark from family connections with a sponsor.</PARA>
<PARA>What he is really saying is that in that concessional family class, for brothers and sisters, we can allow people entry provided they get the other points, from applicants who have a very low level of skill and do not even speak English. They are the very people who are manifested in all of the statistics on welfare benefits in Australia when they arrive. More than one-third of such people have no expectation of being able to obtain employment in Australia when they arrive here. This is the Government, in relation to that very group of people, which has abandoned any requirement for family members to offer an assurance of support. That is what happened.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have that situation. The Auditor-General goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The test process accords only marginal additional recognition to <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">skills and occupations in short supply in Australia. There are no <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">adjustments to reflect occupations in oversupply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These factors influence the process in directions away from the selection of the most skilled applicants, whose employment could make a substantial contribution towards the objective of a better skilled Australian work force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regard this report from the Australian Auditor-General as one of the most fundamental reports that we have seen for some time, one which the Parliament ought to have a long, hard look at. This Government has been about lowering the standards of entry to this country for a time. The objective evidence is now on the table for people to make their judgments. Part of the objective evidence of the Government's failure is the introduction of this legislation and its requirement for bonds and for a levy. If the assurance of support scheme had been in operation and successful, and if it had been properly monitored by this Government, this legislation would never have seen the light of day and would never have been necessary. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Migration Amendment Bill (No. 3) and the Migration (Health Services) Charge Bill. When the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) began his speech I was very pleased to hear that the Opposition was not going to oppose the Bills before the House. I then listened to 10 minutes of tautology from the honourable member for Dundas, who obviously does not have either an independent thought or comment, because all he said in the first 10 minutes of his speech was what the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) should have said, did not say or did say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the honourable member needed a filler for the final 10 minutes of his 30-minute speech, he quoted from the Auditor-General's report. In future the honourable member for Dundas, particularly when he is the first speaker for the Opposition on a Bill before the House, should do some research. With research he would gain comprehension; with comprehension he would have understanding of why we need legislation before we have regulation, and why we have to amend Bills and put into process that regulation and legislation even though it was announced in the Budget of 21 August. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bills before the House will allow for improvements to the arrangements for the recovery of cost in the Federal health and welfare Budget, which flows from the immigration program. The legislation proposes to improve existing cost recovery measures by changes to the assurance of support scheme and the implementation of the health charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the honourable member for Dundas that the introduction of a health levy, which must be paid by sponsored migrants who come to this country with little or no intention or ability to support themselves, is long overdue. Such a charge, as outlined in the Migration Amendment Bill, would mean that migrants who come to Australia under an assurance of support from their sponsor would be contributing in a small way to the cost of Medicare and public health care, just as all Australian residents do. The majority of the migrants who would come under this category, as described by the honourable member for Dundas, would be too old to work or too young to work, as in the case of orphan migrants, or unable to work. Many of the people in this category may also be in need of medical attention in their first two years in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At first glance this legislation appears to be tough, but on further investigation it becomes apparent that the Bill recognises the need to strike a balance between assurers' responsibilities and the protection of the community's resources. It also does not take away the individual's right to have access to social security benefits or Medicare. If the Opposition could have its way, it would ban newly arrived migrants for their first 12 months in Australia from access to these benefits and all services. Where is fairness and equity in the Opposition's policy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to stress that the bond and the health charge will apply to only certain categories of migrant under the family reunion program. I will not go into those because the honourable member for Dundas has repeated it on at least three occasions. As these migrants are largely unable to support themselves on arrival in Australia, such legislation as is now before the House is understandable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One part of the Minister's second reading speech that the honourable member for Dundas did not refer to states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This health charge will enable the Government to recover an estimated 50 per cent of the average medical, hospital and pharmaceutical costs incurred by persons covered by the assurance and will result in an additional estimated revenue to the Commonwealth of $9.9m in a full financial year.</PARA>
<PARA>As soon as they become permanent residents, these migrants are entitled to health and certain welfare benefits without having to make the lifetime contribution to these services that most other Australians have made through their taxes. When passed, this legislation will mean that the sponsoring families of migrants under an assurance of support would bear some of the cost that the migrants may generate in their first two years in Australia, rather than the community bearing the cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although I support the health charge, I am concerned about a certain double dipping scenario which may in a minority of cases occur on the Government's part as a result of this health charge. Obviously, the honourable member for Dundas was not aware of it; if he was, he did not mention it. I have expressed my concern in representations to the Minister and hope that such relevant legislation as this is not overshadowed by a problem which I believe could be rectified by a small amendment to the taxation Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem I see is that, if a migrant under one of the relevant categories who must pay a health charge before being granted a visa and permanent residency obtains a job not long after arrival in Australia as a resident, that migrant would pay for the Medicare levy in his or her taxes. Consequently, that migrant would be paying the Medicare levy twice. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I thank the honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale) for calling the quorum. The problem I see&mdash;as I have already stated in the speech&mdash;is that, if a migrant under one of the relevant categories who must pay a health charge before being granted a visa and permanent residency obtains a job not long after arrival in Australia as a resident, that migrant will pay for the Medicare levy in his or her taxes. Consequently, that migrant would effectively be paying the Medicare levy twice. As the Minister is aware, I have requested that he investigate the possibility of this situation arising and whether migrants affected by the `double dipping' scenario would be able to receive a refund of the Medicare levy. Even if the migrant worked for three months out of his or her first 24 months in Australia, I believe that three twenty-fourths of the Medicare levy should be refunded to that migrant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In every other respect this legislation is fair, in that the Australian community at large is not bearing the burden of costs imposed by newly arrived migrants who are unlikely to contribute in any way to the payment of these costs. Under the assurance of support, the migrant's needs are again not having to be paid for by the community at large, but rather by a relative who has made the commitment to support that migrant for a period of two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The full-year cost to the Commonwealth Government of social security payments to migrants who have been in Australia for 12 months or less was recently estimated by the Department of Finance to be $251m, with $183m of that being paid to migrants in unemployment benefits.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker; for the benefit of the Opposition and the Opposition Whip, I shall slow down&mdash;is taken <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>into consideration, it becomes clear why it is necessary for an assurance of support to be forthcoming from those who are sponsoring relatives to come to Australia and why it is reasonable for the Government to request a bond&mdash;10 years, five years, after this two years. If migrants have not had to make use of such benefits in their first two years in Australia, then that bond is recoverable. What must be remembered is that assurers have always had a legal commitment to repay the Commonwealth and other agencies moneys for services provided in support of sponsored migrants and for their health costs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This new arrangement, however, while reducing the extent of the liability from five to two years&mdash;a fact that the honourable member for Dundas reiterated in his tautology; and what he did not remind the House of was the fact that after two years one can become a permanent resident through citizenship of this country, so is he going to deny those citizens the right to full entitlements such as those an Australian born person is entitled to and, if so, will he want to also change that part of the Act?&mdash;will ensure that the Government is able to improve recovery rates if a sponsored migrant receives certain social security benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this legislation before the House, recoverable costs from the assurance and bond will be limited to the special benefit, Jobsearch and Newstart allowances paid by the Department of Social Security. The large majority of our migrants are not affected by this legislation and are not, for the benefit of the honourable member for Dundas, a drain on our economy or our Budget&mdash;as a recent Bureau of Immigration Research report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Immigration and the Australian Economy</EMPHASIS> has found.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to this report, the composition of the immigrant intake is of particular importance in regard to demand for government expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through much of the past decade there has been recurrent public debate over immigration and multiculturalism. For example, in 1984 the media claimed that immigration policy was contrary to the wishes of most Australians and threatened social cohesion; that it was leading to competition for scarce jobs and other opportunities; and that it left old Australians feeling like strangers in their own land. It sounds familiar; the honourable member for Dundas has just informed us of it all over again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, in times of economic downturn such as this, the immigration program is always the first to be scrutinised by a public who feels that it is missing out in some way because of the people who are allowed into our country. It is the old story of scarce resources&mdash;in this case, employment&mdash;and every man, woman and child having to fend for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The traditional views that immigration pressures the real wage down and/or adds to aggregate unemployment are now understood to be completely unfounded. The evidence indicates that immigration has no significant effect on aggregate unemployment; nor does it affect real wages, nominal wages or price inflation&mdash;again according to the Bureau of Immigration Research. Although equivalent net budget comparisons including health and education expenditure are not available to me, life cycle considerations suggest that immigrants might contribute more overall to government savings than non-immigrants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The traditional economic focus of the debate on immigration has been significantly overdrawn by supporters and critics alike. By contributing around 40 per cent of Australia's postwar population growth, immigration has clearly had a great impact on the scale of economic activity and the rate of economic growth with major implications for specific industries, particularly housing and associated sectors. This major effect on overall economic activity is, however, associated with non-existent or very minor effects on such aggregate economic parameters as the real wage, unemployment, nominal wages, inflation and living standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Research has found that immigrant household expenditure is broadly similar in both magnitude and pattern to that of comparable non-immigrant households, although immigrant households spend relatively more on food and housing-related items. Recent statistics indicate that house purchase tends to occur either very soon after arrival or some years later, after financial consolidation. The construction sector is particularly stimulated by immigration. Although the short term demands from immigration on government are relatively small, investigation has shown that the relative youth of the immigrant intake tends to generate longer term shifts in overall per capita demands for education, health and welfare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Immigration has been a major contributor to Australia's increased scale of economic activity in recent decades, which has seen concurrent gains in industry productivity. Immigrant skill levels on entry are on average higher than those of the resident work force, and a greater proportion of the overseas born have post-school qualifications. For these margins to be properly reflected in skill gains across Australian industry, immigrants must attain positions in the labour market commensurate with their qualifications and background. This generally follows for English-speaking background immigrants but not necessarily for a lot of our others. Appropriate labour market and English language programs are clearly important to assist immigrants in their initial period along with effective procedures for evaluating and accrediting overseas based qualifications, and access to education and training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further analysis from that same report by the Bureau of Immigration Research has found that there is no clear evidence on whether immigration's role as a source of skills has reduced Australia's commitment to its domestic education and training systems. However, there is likely to be a continuing important role for immigration as a supplementary source, whatever the strength of the domestic system. That report said that immigration does not appear to disproportionately affect the incidence of entrepreneurship in Australia. However, overseas born small business people appear more successful than the Australian born, so immigration may raise the quality of domestic entrepreneurial activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I originally was not going to use these findings in this debate, but I brought them in to show the honourable member for Dundas and the Opposition that, while there are certain charges associated with our immigrants when they first arrive in this country, there are also a lot more benefits we gain as a country overall. These findings, which have been carried out by people far more professional people than I am, have proven that immigration is valuable to Australia and that the majority of migrants are not relying on our social welfare system to support them. It also proves that, if given support and time to settle in, migrants can make and do make a worthy contribution to our country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet the legislation before the House is of great importance to the success of a fair and equitable immigration program in which sponsors and assurers are made to face up to the responsibilities of their commitment to support their newly arrived loved ones. Just recently, a committee called a public meeting in my electorate to say that this Bill was very harsh, that it was only going to allow the rich to sponsor their families in reunion and not anyone else. I say to them that a lot of people who, in the past, signed 10 years assurance of support, or five years, are honouring their agreement. Many, too, are contributing through their taxes to the support of others who choose not to honour their assurance of support. There are certain categories associated with our skill migration program as well as our point system program&mdash;but in these particular cases we do&mdash;and evidence has shown it very clearly&mdash;obtain benefit for this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation deals with a very specific immigrant coming into our country. I commend the Minister for bringing these Bills before the House. In doing so, he acknowledges not only the strength of family reunion but also the necessity for those people who state that they are willing to support and therefore want to be reunited with a remaining family member to also take onto their shoulders the responsibility associated with that desire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is only right and proper that, if a person is going to have access in this country to our Medicare and health programs structure that has been put into place over many years through the contribution of taxpayers' dollars, he or she in some small way should contribute to the facilities that are in place. If one talks to the migrants who have come to our country over the years and are settled within our communities and making a contribution to our country, one will find that they, too, support this legislation. They believe that it is up to the individual to honour his or her commitment. Most particularly the opportunity also should exist, for those who through unforeseen circumstances are not able to meet that commitment, to have available the assistance which is in place now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, importantly, if one is going to sponsor and to accept that responsibility, one's signature must be worth more than just a piece of paper. What we have done is to put in legislation that says, `You will provide a cash bond. In the event that your sponsored person, relative or whoever you are sponsoring does not have recourse to any of those special benefits from the Department of Social Security during the 24 months after your arrival in this country, that cash bond will be returned to you, the assurer'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What it also says is that, through that contribution of $822, which will be indexed as of next year, you contribute in some small measure to the health budget of this country. But, as I have said in the approach that I have already made to the Minister, I would like again to request that he fully investigate the fact that, if a person works in the country and pays or contributes to that Medicare levy in some way, he should not be asked to pay twice. I do not believe in double-dipping. I do not believe that that was the intent of this legislation or the intent of this Minister. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning to the remarks of the honourable member for Prospect, I do agree with some of the things that she has said in the debate tonight. She said that the immigration program is the first casualty in a recession. That is true. There is no doubt that, when there are economic difficulties in any nation, the people of that nation start looking for scapegoats, and one of the most convenient scapegoats is the immigration program. A lot of angst and anger is directed against those people who are most recently in the country. The surprising thing about this is that it is not only those who could be regarded as natives of the country who direct this anger; a number of migrant communities themselves are also inclined to criticise the nature of the immigration program and to say that it is wrongly directed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that one of the first casualties in a recession is the acceptance by the host community of the newly arrived migrant. That is a particularly important comment to make and, unfortunately, the honourable member for Prospect did not go on to develop the point. What we have in Australia at present is a real disquiet&mdash;this was brought out by the honourable member for Dundas&mdash;about the nature and the extent of the immigration program as administered by the Minister, who is now sitting in his proper place in the chamber. The fact is that, to have a successful immigration program, one has to have a willingness of people to migrate to a country and a willingness of the people within the country to accept them. To have successful integration of newly arrived migrants into any country, one has to have an accepting host community. Unfortunately, because of a number of different factors, including, of course and most particularly, the recessive situation which this Government has brought about, the first casualties in terms of public acceptance are the newly arrived migrants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we have to look at the nature of the program itself. The honourable member for Dundas has quite properly and appropriately drawn attention to the criticisms that have been made, not only by him as spokesman for the Opposition but by independent observers. He quoted the Auditor-General's report. I do not know whether the Minister would dispute the Auditor-General's report, or whether even so well informed an authority as the honourable member for Prospect would dispute the Auditor-General's report, which discusses the actions and the consequences of activities within the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we know, the Opposition will not oppose the Bills before the House. The point that I wish to make tonight is a fairly narrow one but, I believe, a most important one. It relates to Australia's right and responsibility to decide who shall or shall not enter this country. The national sovereignty of this country is determined by the government of the day administering an immigration program both for immigration and for temporary entry to this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very onerous responsibility on the Minister for immigration of the day to administer properly his responsibilities, particularly in a situation in which more and more people throughout the world are anxious to migrate to Australia or to live permanently in Australia. They will seek to live permanently in Australia either officially through the migration program or unofficially by coming in as visitors and then overstaying or seeking to regularise their permanent entry to Australia. They will do it in a variety of ways. Human ingenuity knows very few limits in relation to these activities. The Minister would know and be well aware of arranged marriages and all the other paraphernalia which are used by some unscrupulous people within the community to encourage people to circumvent the normal migration requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That does two things. Firstly, if it is successful, it gets around the program. In fact, it sets aside the Government decision as to what the proper migrant permanent entry to Australia will be in any one year or any one period. It gets around that. Secondly, those who seek to enter Australia legally and properly are disadvantaged. It advantages those who get around it; those who do the right thing are disadvantaged. The Minister of the day, whoever he or she may be, has a responsibility to ensure that that does not happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened? I believe that in Australia at present we are seeing, and have seen over the past few years, a taking away from the Government of the right to determine the extent of the intake and the composition of the intake of people coming to Australia. We have seen it by the exercise of judicial power. Judicial power has taken away from the Minister of the day the right to exercise his or her proper responsibility to make the decisions as to the nature of the program, the extent of the program and how it will be administered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, one has only to look at the number of refugee applications. I am informed that there are&mdash;I cannot vouch for these figures&mdash;about 22,000 cases of refugees in the backlog at present. There about 800 to 1,000 new applications for refugee status per month. One has only to analyse that for a moment to see the enormous pressure that is placed upon the Minister's Department and the judicial process to understand how quickly the official program can be totally distorted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, the present situation is that additional staff have been made available by the Government to the Minister's Department to handle this backlog. But in fact I am informed that the backlog is not being diminished; they are just keeping pace with the rate of applications. Here we have one particular example of how the official program of immigration to Australia is being rapidly circumvented by the interference of the judicial process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Dundas mentioned the case of the Hell's Angels. I do not know the individuals involved. I did have the responsibility of administering the Department for a number of years, and I do know the sorts of advice that come to the Department from time to time as to the background of certain applicants for entry, whether it be permanent or temporary. </PARA>

<PARA>The Federal Court of Australia Amendment Bill 1991 will provide a new representative action procedure in the Federal Court. The new procedure will enhance access to justice, reduce the costs of proceedings and promote efficiency in the use of court resources. Under the Bill a person will be able to bring a proceeding on behalf of a group of persons where the claims of those persons arise out of the same, similar or related circumstances and a common question of law or fact arises with respect to all their claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new representative proceeding provided in the Bill is based on the existing representative action procedure in the Federal Court and in State supreme courts. The Bill gives the Federal Court an efficient and effective procedure to deal with multiple claims. Such a procedure is needed for two purposes. The first is to provide a real remedy where, although many people are affected and the total amount at issue is significant, each person's loss is small and not economically viable to recover in individual actions. It will thus give access to the courts to those in the community who have been effectively denied justice because of the high cost of taking action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second purpose of the Bill is to deal efficiently with the situation where the damages sought by each claimant are large enough to justify individual actions and a large number of persons wish to sue the respondent. The new procedure will mean that groups of persons, whether they be shareholders or investors, or people pursuing consumer claims, will be able to obtain redress and do so more cheaply and efficiently than would be the case with individual actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The procedure contained in the Bill has been developed following the report of the Australian Law Reform Commission entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Grouped Proceedings in the Federal Court</EMPHASIS>, which was tabled in Parliament in December 1988. The Government was not able to accept all the Law Reform Commission's recommendations. In particular, it has not adopted the Commission's `grouped proceedings' approach or the extension of the Federal Court's jurisdiction for such proceedings. The Commission's proposals for contingency fees and a grouped proceedings assistance fund have also not been adopted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has engaged in an extensive consultative process in preparing this Bill and has received comment from the business community and consumer and legal groups. Since the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) announced details of the Government's proposed reforms, two matters of concern have been raised by some sections of the business community and of the consumer movement. The area of concern to business appears to be whether persons having relevant claims against the respondent should be included in the group covered by the proceedings unless they choose to opt out or whether all such persons should have to take a positive step to be included, that is, to opt in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government believes that an opt out procedure is preferable on grounds both of equity and efficiency. It ensures that people, particularly those who are poor or less educated, can obtain redress where they may be unable to take the positive step of having themselves included in the proceedings. It also achieves the goals of obtaining a common, binding decision while leaving a person who wishes to do so free to leave the group and pursue his or her claim separately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some consumer groups have expressed concern that the new procedure will not be available for causes of action arising before the commencement of the amending Act. Practical considerations have led to the Bill's applying only to future causes of action. These are the possible insurance implications of enabling increased recovery of claims in respect of past premium years and the possible impact on the Federal Court if past claims could be brought. The only likely costs to business of the reforms in the Bill will be through people being able to enforce existing substantive rights which claimants could not previously afford to enforce even though the liabilities existed. This is to the benefit of ethical businesses which honour their legal obligations without having to be forced to do so by legal action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other main feature of the Bill is the comprehensive powers given to the Court to ensure that the proceedings are not abused. The Court will be able to order that a proceeding no longer continue as a representative proceeding where it is satisfied that it is in the interests of justice to do so because, amongst other matters, it would be less expensive to have separate proceedings or that the relief sought could be obtained by means of an individual proceeding. It will retain all its current powers including the power to stay or dismiss any application it considers to be vexatious, oppressive or trivial. The Court is also given power to stay or discontinue any representative action where it considers that the costs of identifying group members and distributing money ordered to be paid to them would be excessive having regard to the total of the amount at issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These reforms are a significant part of the Government's equity and access policies embodied in its social justice program. There is considerable community concern about the cost of, and access to, justice which is now the subject of an inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The measures contained in this Bill will remove at least some of the barriers for persons who seek redress before the courts. The Bill represents a considered, balanced and responsible response to problems in an area where there is a recognised and pressing need for reform. It is not expected that the Bill will have a significant financial impact. A small number of additional cases may be brought. Offsetting this will be savings where multiple individual actions would otherwise be brought. I present the explanatory memorandum for this Bill. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GJ4">Mr SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bills we are debating cognately tonight, the Broadcasting Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991, the Radio Licence Fees Amendment Bill 1991 and the Television Licence Fees Amendment Bill 1991, are three Bills introduced by the Government to give effect to a change announced in the Budget with regard to fees for radio and also to facilitate the treatment of applications for FM licences in regional Australia. I have indicated previously, and do so again, that the three Bills enjoy the support of the coalition. We welcome them, although we have some reservations. This matter has been in contemplation for some considerable period, and I will be making some remarks about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures in these three Bills will allow the faster delivery of new FM commercial and supplementary radio services to regional listeners under the regional radio program, and they will also implement measures announced, as I said, in the Budget. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Snowdon) has just arrived. I inform him that I am agreeing to these Bills. They also implement measures announced in the Budget to halve the current level of annual commercial, supplementary and remote radio licence fees, and to streamline the taxation arrangements for broadcasting licensees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regional radio program amendments replace the current establishment and AM-FM conversion fees with an FM access fee to be paid by all commercial and supplementary non-metropolitan radio licensees before they commence service on the FM band. They permit a supplementary radio licence to serve an area smaller than that served by the related commercial radio licences. They also enable a supplementary radio licence to be separated from the related commercial radio licence two years after the commencement of the supplementary service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Radio Licence Fees Amendment Bill, which is a separate Bill, will cut in half the annual licence fees payable for commercial, supplementary and remote radio licences and it will establish a procedure for self-assessment by licensees of annual licence fees. There will be a requirement to pay all annual licence fees on 31 December each year for commercial, supplementary and remote radio services and commercial and remote television services. That is provided for in the third Bill, which relates to television licences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concession that is provided to the radio industry by way of licence fee reduction amounts to about $8m a year. One of the interesting features&mdash;if time permits, I might comment on it later&mdash;is that there is going to be an FM access fee. It is in my view a double-dip fee. I know that the Government was approached by many in the industry to see whether or not that double dipping by the Commonwealth could be avoided. There was a group named Equity in Licence Fees that was put together to make these approaches to the Government, but it would appear that its arguments have not been listened to, which I think is regrettable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basis upon which it put its approach is that there is already an existing fee structure and this is a double dip, but primarily of course the state of the industry is such that any alleviation of additional fees would at least ensure some continued viability. The matter of viability is also one that I will need to raise because this Bill winds back substantially the test of financial viability, which is a major criterion for assessment by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal in issuing licences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, these Bills will not be opposed by the coalition, although on many occasions we have expressed concern, as has the industry, about the snail-like pace of change under the Government. I will be raising some particular concerns a little later. But, taken as a whole, these amendments are a step in the right direction. That is not to say the industry will not face considerable hurdles, especially in the present difficult economic climate. However, the radio industry is a mature one. Many of the regulations surrounding it are questionable, and it is certainly time for review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, the exposure draft of the new broadcasting services Bill, which has now been in the public arena for some three or four months, recognises this fact and it presupposes&mdash;if it enjoys the support of the Parliament&mdash;a dramatic change in how we treat radio in this country. Driving the legislative changes are the rapidly changing and emerging technologies, increased networking and multi-station ownership, all of which we have to recognise. If more broadcasting channels are to be opened up to new players, then the existing operators must be allowed to operate freely in the more competitive environment that technology is going to force upon the industry and will become a reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The immediate impact on the economics of the radio industry may well be negative. The radio industry is in a very difficult position now. The emergence of new technologies may have some negative impact on some areas. However, the removal of the regulatory stranglehold will, in turn, create new opportunities. This is the area that is the most exciting. It will, at the same time, bring in tremendous change as the industry copes with the impact of that technology in the mid-1990s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of some concern to the industry&mdash;in relation to the primary Bill, the Broadcasting Amendment Bill&mdash;is the insertion in the Broadcasting Act of a new section 80B which restricts the meaning of the term `commercial viability'. The term `commercial viability' was a concept applied by the ABT in determining whether a licence would be granted. Broadly speaking, there was a test to see whether these services would be commercially viable. If it was felt that they would not be, a licence would not be granted. It effectively put in place a barrier to entry to the market. This has been a consistent approach of policy. This Bill winds that back. That, in itself, is a good thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like so much, we must not just go halfway. If we are to vary and remove that particular centrepiece of policy, we must also address the other regulations and restrictions because those other barriers to entry and the protection of the existing regime need to be challenged. There are four areas that need to be addressed in this sense. Firstly, we have to approve adequate and comprehensive services to an area under the existing regime. That is a fairly high test to meet. Perhaps that ought to be reviewed. Secondly, the 20 per cent Australian music content requirement would need to be reviewed. Thirdly, the requirement to provide local news needs to be reviewed, as well as the issue of deregulation of the labour market&mdash;the requirements of industry to be locked into awards for the AJA and the PREIA, which covers technicians. All those matters must be reviewed as well. If we are going to a deregulated industry then we must ensure that all the regulations, restrictions and protection mechanisms that have existed to give us the radio industry that we know are reviewed as well. That is the point I make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point that needs to be made is that the existing regime gives us relevance, in terms of the local market that is being served, and reliability. They are features of the existing radio market. That will change as a product of broader policies that will need to be pursued by both governments and oppositions, regardless of which side of the House we might be on. We are going to see a movement to quantity. That may well have some impact on quality. There will be a wider variety of services available, there will be more niche programming, smaller audience groups and, therefore, there will be far greater choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the existing regime we seek greater diversity but there will be pressures for the opportunity to provide even greater ranges of choice. That may well see some areas of programming curtailed. I suspect that in the early period there will be more noise because most programming will start to move towards the music type. In my view, this Bill is a way station on the continuum of the highway to major change. In that sense, we certainly support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am flagging that there is greater change yet to come. Whilst this addresses a specific problem in regional Australia&mdash;for a long time we have argued from this side of the House, as has the industry, a far more liberal approach to allowing FM, a technology that has been around for 40 years, to be made available in regional markets&mdash;it is not as quick as I and the industry would like and I do not agree with the access fee system. But it is certainly a step in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my view that it is not so much frequency that attracts audiences as format. What the audience gets is not determined so much by the frequency by which it is delivered, but by the format. We want to see a viability within the industry. That is currently under threat but there has to be a recognition that we have to balance those two issues. The Government has fallen down on the side of providing the opportunity for greater choice and greater utilisation of emerging technologies. We would certainly be going in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to recognise that there are dramatic revenue difficulties for the industry. By coincidence, today the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal issued radio advertising figures which show a drop of 3.7 per cent relative to the same period in 1990. Of course, advertising underpins the viability of the radio industry, so industry is certainly in a very difficult position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not sought leave from the Parliamentary Secretary at the table but I am sure that he will grant leave when I seek to table a graph showing the direction of radio revenue based on the industry's figures, which show that the industry has had a particularly difficult time. The graph shows that revenues for radio stations in Tasmania have dropped dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of a complete and total diversion, Mr Deputy Speaker, by coincidence you are in the chair, the Parliamentary Secretary is at the table and I am here. Tonight we will not have a re-run of the SBS debate, as we did the other evening. I hope that during that debate it was not construed that I reflected in any way upon your chairmanship, Mr Deputy Speaker. I will not now enter into the debate, but I am sure the Parliamentary Secretary would know that it is not usually in my nature to become so agitated. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GJ4">Mr SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just tabled a document about radio. We are not going to discuss SBS tonight. I was saying that the revenue has dropped dramatically for radio. This has been very difficult for the industry. At the same time, it has to go through a very difficult regulatory regime. It is clear that that adds to costs. Whilst we are having some change here, there are other changes that need to be taken into account.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Broadcasting Services Bill will, if supported, give far greater flexibility but it will not give the features of the existing system. The existing system is now undergoing change. It is inevitable that that take place. It will be driven by technology, and that technology must be accommodated. Digital audio broadcasting will have an impact in the medium term in this country and that will provide the opportunity, with CD quality frequency, to deliver services to many more people. There will be frequency liberation. That compounds the problem of charging monopoly rents. That is what the current system is about. I have often asked why country areas are paying a fee. If we are going to have greater frequency liberation, what is the point of having a fee system? It seems to me that no economic rent should be sought outside capital cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder whether we ought to be treating metropolitan radio regimes and regional country regimes completely differently. We do in the television industry; as we tried to pursue a policy in this country of greater diversity by the aggregation policy, we found&mdash;because of the economic pressures that policy has forced operators to acquire additional capital equipment&mdash;that there have to be concessions. They amount to over $100m. That recognises the difference between networking and metropolitan and regional markets. What we are going to see in emerging technologies in radio is a greater capacity for networking. This Bill recognises that with the seven station rule. I wonder whether that is a realistic rule. In any event, perhaps it should be lower. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that there will be this change. Equating the needs and opportunities in regional Australia to those of the metropolitan area by way of seeking the economic rent in the system that we do now is something that ought to be totally and completely reviewed. It has, in part, been done within the regime of the television industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some other matters that I want to mention. I have already talked about commercial viability, but the watering down of that viability test and the legislative preference given to new players may mean that only in the largest metropolitan markets can the existing stations meet the competition head on by merging or by establishing AM-FM combinations. In the smallest markets, however, the existing incumbent will be able to establish an FM supplementary but not without cost and several lean years. It takes about $1m, I am told by the industry, to set up a new station, with costs running at about 150 per cent and revenues at about 120 per cent, which wipes out profit in the initial establishment years. On the other hand, it does provide the station with the efficiencies which arise from the synergy achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An industry prediction is that in the bigger markets revenues are likely to fall as stations face new competition without the ability to tap extra revenue sources. The anomalies are clear apparently in the case of the Wollongong market. There are also issues in my own area. For example, the Bill appears to be silent on a number of matters. In the area of Launceston there is the capacity for an applicant to apply for an FM licence, but the proposal is silent on whether or not the other AM operator is able to object. One has to ask why it is that an existing AM operator just cannot automatically apply to have the FM licence. It appears to be something that should be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The competitive challenges facing the commercial radio industry are broadly in three areas. The radio advertising revenues, as I have pointed out from the ABT figures, are likely to experience only modest growth, and this is due in no large part to the recession that we `had to have' and its accompanying low inflation rates in an economy that is stubbornly refusing to move out of the doldrums, despite the protestations to the contrary by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another reason is the modest increase in total advertising expenditure in the short to medium term. There is no reason to believe that radio would extract an increasing share of the total and finite advertising cake. The second challenge is that competition is likely to intensify, and that was the point I was making earlier. We are likely to see more than just one more commercial station in each regional market and two new commercial stations in each metropolitan market by the middle of this decade. This is an acknowledgment of emerging new technologies such as DAB, which I have talked about and experienced overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might just cite what has happened in New Zealand. There has been an explosion of radio stations in that country. In one year, 1990-91, the number of commercial radio stations increased from 56 to 75 and all commercial stations increased by 34 per cent. Privately owned commercial stations increased by 86 per cent in the short space of 13 months. Soon there will be 261 stations, servicing a total population of 3.4 million. Australia, in comparison, has 147 commercial radio stations servicing a population of 17.2 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go back to the point that I was making earlier. We are emerging out of a fairly restricted regime, recognising that technology is driving that change. We are doing so at a time when the economic revenues expected to flow to commercial stations are not going to grow; they are going to be lower. There is going to be greater competition. Programming is going to be more narrowly focused. There will be many more stations. It will become somewhat more difficult for people such as us to determine what will happen, but it will certainly be different. I suspect that there will be an emphasis on quantity and more noise rather than quality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the community has to recognise that this change is going to come about. The industry does, reluctant as it is. It is not being forced necessarily by governments. In fact, I think that the Government has been too slow to recognise the changes that are about, and that is in part why we welcome this Bill. I think it has tried to put in place a far too restrictive regime with all the tests for localism, content and commercial viability. All those things I mentioned have to be reviewed. We are going to see change. It will go in the direction of the New Zealand model, and underpinning it, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications, who is an expert in these areas, would know, will be this frequency liberalisation that is going to come about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that that area itself is going to be subject to a reform. We have had a parliamentary committee recently report on that area. We are going to have to come to grips with those issues. At the end of the day we must make sure that legislation is technologically neutral. We allow the marketplace to take advantage of those technologies. We always will be concerned to ensure that the community is serviced by relevant programming where we are able but, if we are going to take the view that we have to be restrictive about that, that is the wrong role for government. I think the only thing that can be said is that there is going to be tremendous change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result of all this is that future profit growth and perhaps even profit maintenance are going to have to come from continued cost cutting and cost control. That is why the issues about labour arrangements are so important in this particular industry. It is the capacity of the stations to pay their staff relative to their audience, to their own productivity and to their own ability to attract audience and advertisers that will be important. If there are, as a set constant, wage levels and so on that cannot be negotiated directly with those participating, that is another major barrier that has to be addressed. Of course, there is even recognition within the Labor Party now that direct labour relations is something that must take place in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final matter that I think is worth mentioning is a change that relates to the ability of public radio licensees in areas which do not overlap with a commercial radio licence service area to broadcast sponsorship announcements. They will run in total for not more than four minutes per hour of broadcasting time. Clearly this is a change to allow public broadcasting to advertise. Indeed, some public broadcasters have been advertising or running sponsorship. I think the closest local example is the Goulburn station. Clearly this will mean that this area also will be out there competing for part of the advertising/sponsorship market. The SBS and the television area are now doing it and now the Government is permitting public broadcasters to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this takes place, the amount that will be flowing to public broadcasting from government will be scrutinised to see whether or not the amount needs to be increased, because basically it has been government funding and great support from volunteers that has enabled public broadcasting to be in its present state in Australia. It is quite successful. The ethnic public broadcasting people came to see me the other day, and I was surprised at the extent of the services that they provide to communities around Australia. They play a very useful and quite significant role. I do not always agree with some of the material that is broadcast but, given that we are going to have an explosion of services that will be available to the community, in a democracy it is good to see that diversity emerging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In time it will probably be cheaper to set up a radio station than it is to buy a newsagency. We have to recognise that fact and that therefore we will have greater diversity. So public broadcasting is playing a role, but it is a significant change for the Government to permit sponsorship on the public broadcasters. It is in a very limited form at this stage. I suspect, though, that it is the thin end of the wedge. I have an interesting quote that we picked up from Sir Denis Forman, who is the Deputy Chairman of the Granada Group in the United Kingdom, from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Listener</EMPHASIS> in December 1989. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On a national scale it is dangerous to meddle with the delicate checks and balances of a broadcasting system without calculating the results very carefully.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly his message was that the advertising cake is finite&mdash;that is certainly what the marketplace says&mdash;and if the Government gives someone a bigger slice everyone else gets less and demands a subsidy or goes broke. In an age when subsidies have come to an end, the alternatives will be that broadcasters will survive or fall on their ability to attract audience and, if they do not do well, they will not survive. It will not be for governments to be in a position to support that enterprise. Therefore, in that sense, the Government has started to embrace a very open regime of broadcasting in this country. The major debate on this whole central issue will be during the broadcast services Bill when it finally comes to this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That will be a very significant debate, because it will signal that a 50-year old piece of legislation that has been much amended and is heavily regulatory will be subject to intensive community discussion. I commend the Minister for taking that path. I think that is sensible. He did that with the telecommunications Bill, which was sensible. At the end we had a much better Bill because of it. Indeed, in this area the situation will be much the same. No-one can predict the outcome, but certainly there is a recognition of the significance of this area, which touches every Australian home. Every Australian home has a radio, and the vast majority have television sets. We are seeing a tremendous change take place. It is being driven by technology. We must accept it, and we must accept that there is a lesser role for government in this area. That is to be welcomed; it is not to be feared. But there will be dramatic changes in the mix and diversity of programming available to people and in the methods by which it is delivered to the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I turn to the Television Licence Fees Amendment Bill. All that Bill does is set a common payment date of 31 December. No concessions are given to the television industry with regard to the amount of fees that it pays. I am prepared to be corrected by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Snowdon), who is at the table, but I think that the amount is in the order of $93m a year. I know that in a recent speech to the Federation of Australian Television Stations the Minister said that he hoped there would be a capacity to reduce the impost of those fees, which is a super tax on the industry, in the next Budget. I am one who will certainly want to keep him to that agenda, because they are being used as a taxing point in a way that is unfair, as is the proposal for the double dipping FM access fee, which is encapsulated in this proposal that is being debated this evening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With those few remarks, and in the very calmest of terms, I say to the Parliamentary Secretary that we will be supporting these three pieces of legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy Speaker, it is a pleasure to appear in the House before you. I commence my contribution by saying that I welcome the Opposition's decision to support this legislation because it is recognised that at the moment it is needed. As has been outlined, the amendments to the Broadcasting Act define the term `commercial viability' for the purposes of the licensing provisions. The Radio Licence Fees Amendment Bill abolishes the current establishment and conversion fees and replaces them with an FM access fee. The Television Licence Fees Amendment Bill amends the Broadcasting Act to set a common date for the payment of licence fees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some questions one could ask about these three pieces of legislation. I would briefly like to cover those questions and some of the answers to them from the Government's perspective. Certainly people are entitled to ask why we are introducing these changes to the Act at the same time as we are distributing publicly a draft Broadcasting Services Bill for public discussion and consideration. That Bill is about much more fundamental reform in the industry as a whole. The fact is that we have recently tabled and released for public discussion a more fundamental approach to overall broadcasting reform than is represented in these three Bills. However, particularly in the case of regional radio, we have decided that urgent remedial action is required and these measures should not be put off pending finalisation of the broader review. I think it is true to say that there is very little possibility of the legislative changes that will result from the broader reform of the Broadcasting Services Bill being implemented before July next year. Therefore, there is a need for these transitional arrangements to go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might say that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Snowdon) have widely consulted the various players in the industry and the community in general on these measures during the past 15 months. I know that the Caucus working group that specialises in broadcasting issues, under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), has also worked through a lot of these issues. They all agree on the point that it is important to introduce these reforms at this point, even though they will certainly be subsumed in a much broader reform towards the middle of next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One might ask why we are inserting into the Act a definition of commercial viability in advance of the Broadcasting Services Bill. One could ask why this would not lead to further legal delays and whether it would not be easier to remove it altogether. It is important for people to understand that the proposed definition and the related amendments which limit its consideration are intended to limit the pressure on the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to carry out the exhaustive investigations, often at the behest of parties opposing the introduction of new services, as it is required to do under the current Act. In this way we hope to limit the potential for delays in the licensing process. These delays have been the constant focus of all the bodies presenting before us during the past 12 to 15 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also seek to reduce the Tribunal's current obligation to seek independent certainty in assessing commercial viability. We hope to redress the imbalance in past inquiries where, for various reasons, too much emphasis has been placed on the commercial viability criteria at the expense of other equally important considerations, such as the desirability of introducing more services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the question about favouring independent services and competition when in fact efficiency, cost and diversity arguments suggest that there may be merit in supporting the introduction of supplementary licences, I would just like to say this: while it is difficult to substantiate arguments that supplementary licences are the best way to achieve efficiency and diversity in service provision, we have accepted that in certain cases we do need to keep that option open. There will be areas where it has to be admitted that additional commercial radio services are not feasible. Therefore, in certain situations we need to maintain the option for the approval of supplementary licences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill, therefore, introduces streamlined measures to achieve that, recognising that in some cases a supplementary licence is the most practical way to introduce a new service. But in general we are saying that, in the interests of encouraging diversity of media ownership, it is preferable that a competitive service be introduced wherever it is reasonably practicable to do so, and therefore this Bill includes provisions which give a clear preference to commercial radio licences over supplementary radio licences. What that means in simple terms is that, where we feel that there is the prospect of providing a licence for a new radio service, we would be looking to the marketplace for people interested in setting up commercially under a principle of commercial viability, and such people would be able to tender for a licence based on those criteria. Where there is not the capacity to provide for an additional player, a supplementary licence for an additional station might be authorised for an existing operator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot needs to be said about the new access fee for FM radio, particularly in respect of why we have chosen to go down the road that we have rather than introduce a tender system. While the tender process has been used successfully for AM-FM conversion in metropolitan services and was initially proposed for regional radio, it is not compatible with the viability tests and the merit selection procedures for regional radio licences, which we have undertaken to maintain pending the completion of consultations on the draft Broadcasting Services Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current high level of fees has acted to discourage applications for new licences, and that has turned out to be contrary in practice to the policy of increasing the number of competing licences. We believe that the</PARA>
<PARA>current fee structure has contributed to the difficulties that a commercial radio licensee may face in establishing a new service in the current economic climate, when advertising revenues are hard to win and the establishment capital required, particularly in the radio market&mdash;although it is not nearly as high as in newspapers and television&mdash;is substantial and is in a much smaller revenue market for advertising. We have recognised that there is a need to reduce the fees that are involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are introducing a fee structure which is more effective in supporting these broadcasting objectives. We believe it will remove the discriminatory burden on new independent services. We believe it will provide greater equity between new service providers and that it will apply across the board on common principles to independent services, to supplementaries and to AM-FM conversions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are keen to try to reduce the workload of the Tribunal in this area, given that there are a number of protracted inquiries currently before the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. The arrangements that we have provided for in the Bill&mdash;the special transitional arrangements&mdash;are intended to ensure that enactment of the legislation will provide for those independent applicants to come under the regime of the lower fees. In the case of supplementary applications lodged before the 23 July announcement, no fee will apply on the basis that these applications were lodged on the understanding that no fee would be payable. One might say that this is government by press release, but the fact is that the statement was made on 23 July and the expectation was there for people intending to operate in this sector of the industry, so this legislation gives effect to the fact that applications lodged before 23 July will proceed on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should also make something of the fact that the Government has decided to reduce the level of radio licence fees by 50 per cent. It is not often that governments reduce charges by 50 per cent. There is a question, I suppose, that could be raised as to why television licence fees are not being reduced by a similar amount. What we would say about that is that we are recognising the fact that the radio industry is becoming increasingly competitive and that the public may be better served by a financially stable commercial radio industry. Not so long ago, when tendering for licences operated, a number of proprietors or intending proprietors did pay prices for their licences which were far beyond the capacity of the revenue in the industry to support. In other words, they have rendered themselves financially non-viable, with high borrowings and high tenderings, and that has led to a lot of instability in the industry. We see the need to stabilise that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have given consideration to a similar reduction for television licensees, but we have decided that radio and television are different and that in this case the first step ought to be to separate the regulation of commercial radio from that of television. It is interesting that, in the broader reform paper that has been issued for public comment, the Government is canvassing the question of radio operating without restriction, it virtually being accepted that there are so many players in the game that there is not the need for the same controls on competition and range of audience that might operate in television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there are considerable differences being flagged between commercial radio and television. We are recognising the fact that, from the terms of the regional radio plan and the national metropolitan plan, there has been greatly increased competition and at the same time the industry has been coping with rapid technological change. That is a point the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) raised in his comments earlier. It is true to say that the industry is not going to be stagnant in terms of technology; there will be massive changes and it could be as soon as five years when people receive their radio information, their radio broadcasting, in completely different technology than that which they are dealing with now. We need to provide flexible legislation that moves with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, our view is that we should increase the number and range of broadcasting services available to the public and we should not take a high taxing approach to the industry. We are also recognising that the commercial television industry has been experiencing financial difficulties over the past few years, but these problems are largely due to the commercial decisions made by those directly involved, and we do not take responsibility for those decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By implication, there is some acceptance of responsibility for some part of the difficulties in the radio industry. However, we are pledging relief totalling $117m for commercial television licensees who are establishing new commercial services in regional areas under the equalisation policy. If the question is raised as to why we are doing this for radio and not for television, I think there are very good reasons for the difference, and in fact it can be demonstrated that we are not without regard for the difficulties in the television industry at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude my remarks by commenting briefly on the questions of self-assessment and the common due date. The introduction of the licence fee, self-assessment scheme and the common due date is intended to simplify the administration of the current licence fee system for licensees and the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. Payment on 31 December means that some licensees will have to pay their licence fees for the 1991-92 financial year six months earlier than they would under the current system, but they have known about this change for at least five months now, and we believe they have had enough time to plan for the common due date. The downstream benefits of a common date in the industry are there for everybody to see and understand. I do not believe it is an issue which will cause any real difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also make the point that there are no transitional pro rata provisions included in the Bill for the introduction of the 31 December 1992 due date. This is because only the payment due date and not the period for which the fees are calculated has been changed. In other words, licence fees will still be calculated for the financial year, and that means that by 31 December 1992 they will have had plenty of time to plan for that introduction of the common due date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have given a lot of consideration to these transitional changes. We have looked at the questions that are most likely to be asked by the industry and by people interested in these issues. We have tried to accommodate those questions in the context of a much broader review of broadcasting policy, which I think without question will be one of the most exciting things done in this field for many decades. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we have recognised that, while that broader review is taking place during the public comment period, there is a need to do something immediately in these fields in particular, and that is why we have taken the step of introducing these three Bills, knowing full well that they will be subsumed in broader action in about eight months time. In the meantime I think it is a response to the industry, and the industry will be pleased to see it happening. I appreciate the fact that the Opposition has chosen to support the legislation. The comments which the honourable member for Bass has made will certainly be taken into account in our deliberations. In conclusion, I support the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The chairman of the Caucus committee normally supports the legislation and he normally runs his own line at the beginning of his speech and the Caucus line at the end. It was very interesting to watch the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) perform, and I thank him for his speech. Tonight we are considering some interesting Bills, basically non-contentious but important just the same. In my view, the Government has been far too timid in its approach in this area. It needs to be more adventurous and take up some of the challenges of micro-economic reform which are so critical to Australia's future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The demand for new and changing services in Australia has never been more pressing than it is at the moment. In fact, worldwide there has been a massive change in the way in which the use of the radio spectrum and the whole range of broadcasting and telecommunications services is being regarded. It is critical for Australia's future that we take up the challenges of changing technology, because we are geographically located in an area which is dependent on technological change. If we cannot take up the advantages, if we are unwilling or held back by any means whatsoever, we jeopardise our future, including the options available and the leadership that we should be showing in our region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia now has the chance to take a lead in this field, but regrettably some time has been lost through the Government's wish to control too tightly telecommunications and the use of the broadcast systems. That is unfortunate, but it is a characteristic of Labor Party governments that they cannot arrange a competitive approach where they cannot intervene. They always must be regulating and intervening. That has damaged to a fair degree Australia's opportunities in this adventurous and exciting field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, as well as those restrictions on Australia's use of the radio spectrum, telecommunications and broadcasting is hampered by the role of some very powerful players in the field. One of the most notable of these must be the Telecom unions. Those unions are seeking, step after step, to assume control in areas in which they currently do not have control and to tighten their control in areas in which they are now active. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The prospects for Australia in this area are massive. The prospects for employment and for the development of new skills, semi-trades and services can be developed to our advantage. That is why I am particularly keen that we move quickly into this development. If we hang back in this area to the same degree as we have hung back in waterfront reform, we run the risk not only of losing our international opportunities but also of not being able to create the jobs and skills that are so sorely needed in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know of only a few areas in which Australia can take a lead. Perhaps tourism is one, but this certainly is an area that Australia can take a lead in. Australian citizens have intelligence and high education levels, and we have a dedicated and hardworking work force, if it is permitted to operate freely, and we should be taking advantage of that. Intellectual ability, more than anything else, is required in this field, and that is where Australia excels&mdash;and we should be taking the lead in our region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The technological development is fast and unpredictable. User preferences cannot be predicted in any way. The quick change some years ago from black and white television to colour television indicates the nature of the Australian community. It is made up of people who want to move ahead quickly and take advantage of new technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The use of cellular mobile phones is another area which is massively growing as, unpredictably, Australians have seen the benefits of this new technology and are reaching out to take advantage of it. It is convenient, it is particularly applicable with the long distances that we have in Australia, and it allows the nature of our workplace, both in cities and in the country, to be accommodated. The nature of future demand for services is unpredictable; it cannot readily be foreseen or coped with by government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's processes are not sufficiently flexible, far-sighted or close enough to the marketplace to understand why it suddenly becomes very convenient for plumbers, builders, carpenters, truckies, and all sorts of people who need to be in touch, to grab the cellular mobile phone or to take advantage of radio systems. Those are two recent examples of where there has been a change in technological demand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is currently moving to pay television. Nobody can predict how quickly that will be taken up by the Australian community. It may be immensely attractive; it may not be. Cable television is also some time down the track. Nobody can predict where we are going to go, what the demands will be or what the possible rewards will be for those who take up the challenge and present these services to the Australian people. The unpredictable nature of what we are dealing with is something that governments are not good at handling. Technology and government combined do not create certainty in the marketplace. I was very attracted by a comment of Nicholas Negroponte of MIT's Media Lab in which he outlined the need for change. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . what currently goes through wires, chiefly voice, will move to air; what currently goes through the air, chiefly video, will move to wires. The phone will become wireless, as mobile as a watch and as personal as a wallet; computer video will run over fibre optic cables in switched digital systems as convenient as the telephone is today.</PARA>
<PARA>There is the massive change and the possible complete reversal of the modes of communication as predicted by one person. Who can confidently predict that? How can government regulate effectively in that area, meet the demands and allow the flexibility and opportunities we so desperately need to take us to the forefront in these fields?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst acknowledging the Government's action to legislate tonight, I am concerned that it is too timid and it is not taking up the opportunities for a major stride in micro-economic reform where it could. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications, the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon), will say that in eight months time it will all be in place&mdash;but we have to add that eight months until people will know what it is all about, and add another twelve months for them to gear up and take advantage of it. We are looking at huge delays in these systems. Huge capital investment is involved, so the Government should not hamper that process by being too ponderous in its decision making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at the current system as it applies and the regulation of it, one is forced to look at the basic spectrum and how it is being used. I was particularly pleased to participate in formulating a report for the Parliament prepared by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Management of the Radio Frequency Spectrum</EMPHASIS>, which sought to go to the basis of the way in which the radio spectrum is used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During that review the Department of Transport and Communications was asked whether incumbent users had any continuing rights in the spectrum. The Department gave an interesting reply, because it did start to identify the advantages of being part of the current system and being a current provider of services as well as the disadvantages for those introducing change or for those new entrants wishing to provide all sorts of services in radio or television. The Department said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a legal sense under the Radiocommunications Act, that is so because the licence is awarded on an annual basis. But there is an expectation and one which is a realised expectation that the licence would get renewed. Indeed in our arrangements to try to achieve spectrum re-allocation, we try to negotiate with people under our current system for that shift to occur . . . sometimes five years ahead of time. . . the expectation is there that tenure will continue.</PARA>
<PARA>So the system itself, as we have it, is one that does not encourage flexibility; it is not one that encourages the development of new techniques or new technologies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In examining whether our current system is suitable or not, there are a number of approaches that can be adopted. One can assess whether the current spectrum management practice lacks flexibility and timeliness with regard to changing demand for spectrum use. Mismatches may occur in supply and demand, demonstrating the difficulties involved in predicting developments in technologies. It is not a dynamic system, as we have at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The capacity to be technically efficient in the use of the spectrum and also to deliver services in the way that is in the best interests of the Australian community is also limited. The setting of standards imposes costs on new and prospective users and may in some instances benefit existing users. There has to be a public merit in this whole process. We have to have police applications of the radio spectrum, we have to have emergency service, and we have to have things such as community radio. Those uses derive for the community a public benefit, a public good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then on the other end of the use of radio and broadcasting is the area that we are dealing with tonight, Mr Deputy Speaker&mdash;in case you were concerned&mdash;the use for broadcasting and radio and television. Those are the areas of really great commercial value. That is the area where there is great competition to be able to get into the action, because using the airwaves is money. There there has been, until recently, the opportunity for people to find their way to quite lucrative returns. In recent days, that has not been the case. But I am sure the House will remember the changes of legislation that passed through this place to advantage friends of the Government, the way in which those friends abused that friendship, the way in which the value of their assets rose, and&mdash;certainly I remember from this side of the House&mdash;the way in which those friendships were later repaid at election time. Therefore, we have another reason why the Government's intrusion into this area is completely inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the deficiencies of the current system is that, I believe, while changes are meant to play a role in regulating demand in congested areas of the spectrum, there is little suggestion that this approach really works. That is what we are talking about tonight: whether the process the Government is adopting really does work. The Government tries to pick how much it should charge&mdash;and here we come to the licence fees. The Government tries to identify how much it should charge for an economic rent plus a tax on users of highly valuable commercial airwaves, the narrow part of that spectrum that really is highly sought after and that has a commercial use. The Government moves in and makes predictions so that its charge is not really based on a commercial assessment but on what it thinks it should charge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One only has to look at a table of excesses of revenue over outlays to realise that over a period of time, going back to 1983-84, in the broadcasting area the Government returned more and more revenue from the taxing process to itself. Actually, in 1983-84 its revenue was 5.8 times the cost of its outlay. But it has risen in 1989-90 to 9.8 times the cost of its outlay. So here is a taxing process that has been used by the Government over a period of years to return more and more revenue to itself&mdash;a taxing purpose which is a tax but is not identified as a tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe in the conclusions of the House of Representatives Committee that the cost recovery component of the annual charges for spectrum access be levied in such a way that the actual costs incurred by the spectrum manager on behalf of individual users are identified and recovered from individual users, and, to further assist in developing a transport charging structure, that the taxation component contained in charges should be clearly identified. I think that those are laudable goals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We look forward to the Government taking up some of these proposals so that there is a transparency. If the Government is going to tax people, it should tell them it is taxing them. It is like its wholesale sales tax&mdash;another example of where the tax is built into the cost of running Australia, particularly for our exporters and our manufactures, and nobody knows it is there. That is why next week, when information on our goods and services tax is released, people will say, `Well, maybe it's another tax or a different form of tax, but at least we know what it is and at least we know we're being compensated for anything that we purchase&mdash;we'll have a reduction in our personal income tax'. That is why the Government needs to change the approach that it is adopting in the whole of the broadcast area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Transparency and understanding by the Australian community will build confidence and support for the Government. I do not know why it runs away from it. If the Government can come out and say, `Well, this is the cost of running the thing; we are going to recover those costs and we are going to place a tax on you as well', that is understandable. But that is not what happens at the moment. Some of this legislation before us tonight is about the collection of fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On what basis are those fees first assessed? We had the chairman of the Caucus committee saying, `Well, it's crook out there, so we are going to drop fees a bit'. That is basically what he was saying. There is a Government making an economic assessment of how good things are in radio and television and saying, `Well, because things are crook, we're going to knock back our licence fees'. I do not think that is altogether a rational approach. Fees are fees for cost recovery and, if there is a tax component, let us identify the tax component. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of ways in which we can look at dealing with the system. We can go on with the current arrangement of Ministry fiddling&mdash;and there are very expert people involved. I do not want to discredit them. They are following, in fact, the instructions of the Government. But life is extremely complicated and rigid in the way in which these things are done. We could fine tune our current system and make it a little bit better. We could introduce a market based system of some sort where, in fact, those people who want to broadcast actually can take up the portion of the spectrum that they want to use by competing against each other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier tonight, the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Aldred) was in the House. I remember how he was decried years ago when he suggested in this area of high commercial value that there should be an auctioning process. Dear, oh dear, what a terrible thing! There were headlines; it nearly brought the Opposition to tatters. But it is interesting to note that one of the recommendations of the House of Representatives Committee, chaired by the Australian Labor Party&mdash;dominated by the Australian Labor Party&mdash;has recommended auctions as a system of establishing market value for those areas of high commercial value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So here we have it: within a period of two or three years, the Australian Labor Party, after denigrating a visionary, a far sighted man who had said, `This is the way we should fix up these systems'&mdash;a statesman&mdash;picks up his idea. The honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale) proposed these things two or three years ago and was bagged from one end of Australia to the other for proposing them. And, two or three years later, as is so often the case, the Government picks up these issues that were raised by the Opposition and says, `What a jolly good idea. How thoughtful; how intellectually sound; how practical and workable; and how well it can work for the management of the radio spectrum'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have the prospect of a complete market approach right across the spectrum, even the prospect of having community radio and police radio and those people being able to sell parts of the spectrum they have currently reserved or currently do not use to their own advantage so that others can use them. They collect the revenue from that process to further improve their own services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Alternatively, we could have a combination of that market approach and an administrative approach, reserving the market system for commercially valuable sectors of the spectrum and using the administrative approach of allocation by the Department to those areas where there is community interest concern and public merit and good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So those are the basic choices that Australia has in front of it. I believe that a greater use of the market system must be adopted. Community groups would gain great value from this approach, so I believe the Government must hasten. It must listen to its backbench and to those people who are desperate to expand the opportunities in this field. Australians for years on a worldwide basis have led in technology. We just need to capitalise on those skills. The Government should not be restraining the dynamic prospects that changes can bring, where opportunities for inventiveness and diversity are encouraged, where those who are poorly equipped and cannot devise efficient systems fail but those who are excellent and popular succeed. What more could we want from our system than that?<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset I indicate my support for the Broadcasting Amendment Bill (No. 2) and the Radio Licence Fees Amendment Bill. I listened with interest to the contribution from the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman), although much of the time he strayed a fair bit from the provisions contained in these Bills. But one of the things that he said&mdash;I note that he indicated at the outset that the Opposition would support the measures, as did the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith)&mdash;related to the process that we are going through in relation to the more extensive Broadcasting Services Bill. He criticised the fact that that would take some months to be considered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier in the debate the honourable member for Bass commended the Government on the process of this matter and noted that, with this Bill being tabled as it was last week by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) to allow for an extensive period of discussion, that would give an opportunity for the great range of interest groups covered by the whole range of issues in broadcasting policy and operation to have a chance to have an input into that discussion paper before it comes back to be considered by the Government and the Parliament in the new year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought&mdash;I think the honourable member for Bass made this comment&mdash;that it offered the scope to produce a better Bill than may have been the case otherwise. That is probably true. The Bill as it stands goes a long way towards the blueprint for broadcast policy in this country in a way that will serve Australia well. But there is certainly scope for the industry and all the great manifestation of players that exist throughout this industry to make a contribution to that debate and thereby ensure that what is finally adopted fits well with both the respective players and the great range of the Australian populace that is obviously concerned to ensure that the measures adopted are those from which they also draw comfort and satisfaction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures outlined in these Bills really start that first process going and recognise the practical difficulties that particularly regional radio has, and that I guess the radio industry as a whole has, at this point in time. The Government has decided, quite rightly, to act in that area and at the same time to ensure that the measures adopted with the passage of this legislation can be blended into the Broadcast Services Bill when it comes back to the House next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is important for a number of reasons. It would be easy to say that it is important only because we want to ensure the viability and stability of the radio industry. That is certainly one of the motivations behind the measures, particularly in relation to the reduction in radio licence fees. But it goes somewhat further than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To suggest that all the difficulties that the radio industry has in Australia today are due to Government policy is a very unfair interpretation to place on what has actually happened in that industry. Indeed, if one takes account of the experience of radio over the last decade, one could argue very strongly that the auction system, the tendering process that the honourable member for Mitchell alluded to as being appropriate to adopt, is one of the reasons that much of radio is in the predicament that it is in today. Certainly, if one takes the Sydney market as an example, absurd prices were paid for radio stations as part of that manic flavour of the month mentality that existed through the 1980s as people&mdash;particularly some notable people&mdash;sought to get into that industry, believing that it would be a great new financial windfall. It was driven not so much by economic considerations as by broader ego considerations and perhaps a whole host of other things that we will not try to enunciate tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, the industry has gone through that process and almost all commercial radio faces the predicament of falling revenue because of the economic downturn, but just as significantly because of the debt servicing that people have had to go through. The problems of people exiting the industry because of financial failure and so forth does mean that the Government is right to seek to act in those areas at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Mitchell also referred to the radio frequency spectrum, which is certainly an interesting area. There is no doubt that the report that the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure brought forward on that issue opens up a lot of exciting opportunities in that area. It is fair to say that, whilst it is an incredibly complex matter to try to debate or articulate in any logical sort of fashion in a debate in the House, it gives very exciting opportunities for Australia. We know that Australians generally have a great thirst for technology and are willing to take advantage of that. In fact, these Bills recognise that in a number of ways because what we are actually saying is that there is scope for new and more players and the development of niche marketing in radio that perhaps has not been fully appreciated in the past because of the fairly fixed sort of structure that has been operating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures tonight represent an important part of the restructuring that is going on. The Broadcasting Services Bill that we will deal with next year will really go very much further in that process. I have no doubt that the opportunities and the flexibility that the honourable member for Mitchell sought in this area in his contribution tonight are well and truly catered for in the various proposals in the two parcels of legislation that the House will consider over this period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the period of discussion and debate is a worthwhile one because one of the things one learns as soon as one starts to look at these areas is that changes in technology are so rapid&mdash;and almost beyond belief for someone who does not have any particular understanding of the technology. A period of debate will not be unhelpful. Far from it; it will very much help to get the environment and the setting right so that those who seek to participate in radio, be it in regional areas or broader community interests, will be able to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, that raises the other points about what we seek to do with these measures relating to licence fees. Over a period I have had many representations from radio operators who have expressed great concern. As the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) outlined earlier, a lot of people have put to the broadcasting working group the difficulties experienced by people in regional radio because of the limitations and the time delays that have occurred in dealing with those processes. So I will talk about those at some length. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the fee structure first of all, the levels that were set in 1988 reflected the very speculative sort of valuations on FM channels rather than sustainable commercial values. With that experience we are able to say that it is reasonable to have a reassessment of that process now. The current fee structure has also had the failing that it could not be applied to FM allocations other than new independent services and conversions where a new FM service entered the market. Its progressive scale relied on brackets which could produce inequities at the bracket margins and which were naturally subject to inflationary bracket creep. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new access fee arrangement recognises a more efficient way of enabling particularly new players to come into the radio industry. It will be a more equitable means of encouraging that access. Certainly in terms of the competitive environment, as we get more players in the radio industry, it lends itself very much to that sort of approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The calculation of the FM access fee takes into account the number of commercial radio services operated in a given service area and the relevant average gross earnings for these services. The honourable member for Mitchell felt that those sorts of economic considerations should be left out of it. But I think experience has shown that this type of approach, particularly for radio and particularly in the current climate in the radio industry&mdash;and particularly because of the new opportunities that exist for people to get into the radio industry&mdash;is one to be fully taken advantage of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear when one looks at the media issues generally that the opportunities for people to run radio stations as time goes on will be very considerable indeed, with technology developing as it is. The old times when someone would be more likely to set up a small newspaper or the like, or seek to develop other sorts of media interests, will give way to the technology that radio and optic fibre and other things offer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of speakers have referred to the development of cable TV. Even in that area, if one was to take a 10-year spectrum, one would be very brave indeed to assert that any one particular mode of pay television will apply right through that decade. Clearly that will not be the case. The changes which will occur in technology will be immense in that field.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In trying to establish a framework, in this particular package of Bills we have said that we recognise that particular difficulties face the radio industry, particularly regional radio operators. We have acknowledged that in some cases there is a limited opportunity for people to participate with the public broadcasters who often, as the honourable member for Bass pointed out, have not had their services fully appreciated. This applies particularly to ethnic broadcasters, as I think the honourable member mentioned. That is certainly true. A number of positive and encouraging things have been achieved in that area, and the changes outlined here certainly will facilitate much of that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the combination of measures here gives scope to the radio industry to be more commercially viable and vital. It also ensures that the Tribunal has a role. It has had a tendency in these areas to get somewhat bogged down and to become unduly complex. It will be able to streamline its processes in this regard and it will be able to have more effective regard for public interest criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sort of debate that goes on between competition and efficiency is more adequately reflected in the Bills before us. The Tribunal, in taking account of the changes in the law in that area, should be able to ensure that the whole administrative process for the granting of licences is one that it is able to carry out more efficiently and effectively. As to the delays that the honourable member for Mitchell spoke about earlier, the passage of these Bills will give the Tribunal much more scope to deal with applications for licences more efficiently than in the past. One hopes that the streamlining of that process will lead to those participants getting involved more readily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other provisions in the Bills relating to the supplementary licence set-up. Certainly the difficulties that the existing law has created in that area have been put to the broadcasting working group. The Bills go some way towards that. There are other recommendations contained in the broadcasting services Bill which will fundamentally influence that process. Again, the combination of those measures will go a long way towards meeting the concerns expressed in that particular field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, I think these Bills are very positive. They will be very important for many regional areas of Australia. They will be particularly beneficial in providing the certainty that the industry has been seeking. It is all very well to say that it is all caused because of this problem or that problem, but what the industry was saying in the lobbying it did in the past was that it had a particular predicament and that it would like to see the Government enunciate its policy clearly in this area. It did not believe that these measures should wait until all the other consequential matters of the broadcasting services Bill were fully developed. I think it was right in seeking that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government and the Minister have acted very appropriately in bringing forward these particular Bills. Hopefully they will have the effect of ensuring that the great competitive environment that can and will develop in radio is facilitated by this process. Certainly the commercial viability question, which is important in this exercise, will be dealt with more speedily. The Tribunal's role, which should facilitate efficient consideration of licence requests, will be undertaken more readily as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those reasons I think the Bills are a very positive step for our broadcasting policy generally, particularly when one considers them together with the blueprint for the industry outlined in the broadcasting services Bill. The community at large will have great opportunity to debate it. Certainly all the people I have heard discussing this issue are very happy to have the opportunity to have input into the deliberations on the Bill. It will mean that the final product that is developed, as occurred in telecommunications, will be one the whole industry can feel it has had input into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fair to say that, if the Minister had come along without a proper process and introduced this Bill and if Parliament was asked to adopt it without proper consideration, the consequential effects would have been most unfortunate for the Parliament and, more importantly, for the people of Australia, because that would not have ensured that the whole range of interest groups which are concerned about broadcasting policy and our media interests generally would have been able to contribute. Many of them have great expertise, as we found not only in the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, but even, in more recent times, in the print media inquiry. We found a lot of people there with a lot of expertise who are certainly prepared to put their views, quite forcefully on occasions. With those few words I am pleased to support the Bills before us, and I trust the Parliament will give them a strong endorsement. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that such measures have a greater success rate and will be advanced at a far more significant pace than the Government initiated aggregation process. The phrase coined in rural Queensland and, I imagine, in many parts of rural Australia is that it is not aggregation but television aggravation.

In fact, aggregation has left many rural communities far worse off. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Parkes said, I wish the Government would come out and have a look in the bush sometimes. I recognise that these communities are in a minority. However, I do not believe that as taxpaying residents they have lesser rights. The provision of ABC services is a clear example of the denial of such rights. Some towns are provided with the service with no associated cost, while others must install re-transmission facilities at their own cost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Barcoo Shire Council in the far west of my electorate provides a good example. While townships south, north, east and west of the shire are provided with ABC broadcasts free of charge, the towns of Stonehenge, Windorah and Jundah, in the Barcoo Shire, are not. The Shire's commercial television service is also paid for by the residents. This situation does nothing to encourage decentralisation. A television service certainly assists in attracting and holding a more contented work force in remote areas of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1985 the Barcoo Shire Council spent $61,722 on the provision of an ABC television re-broadcasting system. This money was spent on a service that is taken for granted and provided free of charge to the majority of Australians. I ask honourable members to consider the ABC's recent advertising slogan, `The service costs only 8c per day'. The residents of the Barcoo Shire would certainly begrudge one cent more of their income tax going to the provision of ABC services across the country, let alone 8c a day. Their 8c a day goes towards the provision of a service for which they already pay $4,200 in ongoing costs and $6,000 in associated costs every year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1988, $38,994 was spent on providing additional equipment for the re-broadcast of commercial television. The Barcoo Shire Council is not an isolated example. I am sure that in the electorate of Kennedy, which borders the electorate of Maranoa, there would be many towns and shires which suffer the same problems, as there would be right across all the large rural electorates. I am sure that the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) would have communities and shires who are funding their own commercial television. </PARA>

The ABC operates on a pay television basis in the towns of Eulo and Wyandra, along with many other small towns in my electorate. Let me tell the House that when the debate on pay television starts in the urban community, we will be able to say that we already have pay television out in rural Australia. I do not think that there will be a great debate in rural Australia as to whether we should or should not have pay television. We already have pay television in rural Australia. I was very fortunate to have the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) visit my electorate earlier this year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is very, very pleasing to hear. Mr Deputy Speaker, I have here a document which outlines the costs of providing television by local councils in the electorate of Maranoa. One can see quite clearly from the document that there are six shires which have spent in capital outlays up to $366,000 in providing this television. They have annual running costs of $45,700 in continuing to provide this service to the residents of their communities. I seek leave to table the document.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YT4">Mr BRUCE SCOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Snowdon) for allowing me to table that document. The cost of providing this service, which towns with a population of more than 1,000 get free, represents thousands and thousands of dollars, as that document will confirm. This ongoing cost is met by local ratepayers. It represents a heavy burden on very small towns. What must also be taken into consideration are the annual operating costs and associated costs of providing an ABC service to residents who are quite clearly disadvantaged by location.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many examples of services that are offered to cities and suburbs and are either threatened or do not exist in rural areas, such as ABC television, child-care facilities and post office agencies. The lack of these services, coupled with the overall high cost of living, is a deterrent to living in the more remote areas of Australia. This situation reflects poorly the fact that 80 per cent of all of Australia's export income comes from the rural and remote areas of Australia. I refer to the farms and those many mines which are located in rural and remote Australia. I ask the Parliamentary Secretary to look at that problem. I hope that he will address that in his summing up tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to aggregation and the provision of commercial television to remote Queensland. I have lodged petitions on behalf of concerned residents of the electorate; I have written to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal; I have written to the relevant Minister&mdash;all to little avail. Many communities and properties receive poor commercial television reception or, as the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr) said earlier, no commercial television, whereas previously the reception was unhindered. In the east of my electorate, the town of Texas, which is set at the foot of a large hill known as the Beacon, since aggregation and the conversion to UHF, as opposed to VHF, has had very poor commercial television reception&mdash;if, indeed, people can get it at all. A reasonable reception can be received only by the residents installing a UHF antenna costing anywhere in excess of $500 each. Prior to that they had a small antenna for $50 and were able to receive the VHF signal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People unable to afford this cost, as a result of aggregation now receive only the ABC&mdash;which is still on the VHF signal. The situation upriver at Riverton also is considerably worse, with properties unable to get a picture from the high cost antennas because of the rugged terrain. Previously, VHF transmission allowed a reasonable reception. All this has changed under aggregation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously not, because the Government has not addressed it. As I have said, I have written to the relevant Minister and to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal&mdash;to little avail. The situation is still as it was months ago. The residents' only option in these areas is a $1,500 individual satellite dish&mdash;once again, pay television. Interference has also become a major problem as the signal strengths have changed from VHF and, in some cases, to UHF. Interference is a major problem in the Bauhinia Shire in the north of my electorate. Aggregation will not be completed in this Shire until December 1992. Until such time, residents will receive the ABC and substandard commercial television reception. The community is appealing for the aggregation process in that area to be speeded up. Residents feel that they are being treated as second-rate citizens.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regardless of aggregation, commercial television is not extended to many parts of my electorate. Many communities must fund their own re-transmission facilities to receive commercial television and, in some cases, to receive any television at all. My initial cost analysis has estimated that the capital outlay of providing television by local councils in my electorate is in excess of $350,000. The annual cost of providing such a service is approaching $46,000. The associated annual costs are in the vicinity of $20,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I greet the news of hastening the pace of providing FM radio services to regional listeners with due scepticism. I know that the preference of many people within the electorate would be to sort out the aggregation-aggravation mess before proceeding with another venture. I appeal to the Government to address the inequity in providing ABC television services across the country. I further make an appeal that the current difficulties faced by many rural communities as a result of aggregation be addressed as a matter of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one other subject I would like to touch on before closing, that is the funding cuts that were initiated, out of necessity, earlier this year to the ABC. One of the fears of rural Australians was that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Country Hour</EMPHASIS> may have been subject to funding cuts. The real fear was that perhaps the State segments would be cut as a result of funding cuts. I am happy to say that that did not happen. I am sure it was because of the representations of many honourable members around Australia. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Country Hour</EMPHASIS> is a part of everyday life in rural Australia; it is very important to people living in rural Australia. The ABC <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Country Hour</EMPHASIS> provides up to the minute market information, which is a vital service. I commend the Government on continuing funding for the ABC <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Country Hour</EMPHASIS>, because in many remote areas that it services, there are no daily papers sitting on the doorstep every morning. Honourable members would be surprised where they would hear people listening to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Country Hour</EMPHASIS>. If honourable members went down to the shearing sheds some day they would find the shearers listening to it. It is not only the people on the properties who listen to it; it is the whole community; it is part of everyday life; it is part of the Bible for people living in rural Australia. If any cuts are to be made to the ABC, they should not be to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Country Hour</EMPHASIS>, because it provides a vital service to rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I close by paying a tribute to the staff of the ABC because they provide a vital service on ABC radio, particularly at times of floods when the only communication link is by that radio service. Many of these ABC broadcasters are up before the majority of Australians are out of bed. They are getting information; they are looking at the weather for the day; and they provide an invaluable service. I pay tribute tonight to a broadcaster who has given in excess of 25 years service to the ABC in Queensland, and that is Adrian Scott, based in Toowoomba. He is a legend in his own time. He deserves recognition, and he received that recognition some two years ago when he received an Australia Day award. It is people like him in the ABC who make life a little more bearable in rural Australia. We should all commend the work of the ABC rural broadcasters. </PARA>

I welcome the addition of this amendment in the Bill. I spoke on it initially just over two years ago. I am delighted to see that the Minister has taken it up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, it allows public radio stations, where there is no overlapping commercial radio station broadcasting into the same area, to be able to broadcast sponsorship announcements which promote products and services. Up until now they have been able to run only sponsorship ads, as they call them, which have been able to mention only once the sponsors' name and telephone number. Of course, it is very hard to get people to kick in money to run these types of `ads' when they cannot have their product described properly over the airwaves. The western area broadcasting in Bourke in my electorate, which goes out under the call sign of 2WEB, needs this kind of sponsorship so it can generate the income necessary to run the station. I understand that this particular amendment will cover only about five radio stations in Australia. There is one in Victoria, a couple in South Australia, one in Western Australia, as well as the 2WEB radio station at Bourke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are something like 110 public broadcasting stations now operating right across Australia. Public broadcasting has been in existence since 1972. They are independent, non-profit and non-commercial. Sponsorship for these types of stations usually pays for about 25 per cent of their budget. The rest comes from the Government and some fundraising activities which they may engage in. But with 2WEB at Bourke, something like 50 to 60 per cent of its income, out of a total budget of $400,000 a year, comes from sponsorship. It is vital to them.

The only Government help it gets is through that DEET funding, as well as some Government advertising that is run, for example, with health promotion programs plugging anti-smoking or anti-drinking or if the RTA wants to plug how people should be wearing helmets&mdash;that sort of thing. Otherwise the radio station is largely self-supporting. The advertising, as I say, makes up 50 to 60 per cent of its budget. That comes mainly from small business and local community groups. It raises the rest of its money through such things as selling T-shirts, mugs, stickers and selling records. In previous years it has run concerts and outside broadcasts.

When we pick up the main newspapers in Sydney we see that radio stations there are struggling to get 10, 15 or 20 per cent of the audience. But this station has 80 per cent. The reason that happens is that it is the only station that puts on local news. It also broadcasts rural news that is particular to that area. It puts on Aboriginal programs for that area as well as educational community programs. These types of programs unite the people of that area.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me great pleasure to close the debate on the Broadcasting Amendment Bill (No. 2), the Radio Licence Fees Amendment Bill and the Television Licence Fees Amendment Bill. I thank all honourable members for their contributions. It has demonstrated that there is a great depth of knowledge and a great deal of interest on both sides of the chamber on this particular subject. All honourable members should be commended for that interest. It also demonstrates that in an area where there is a great deal of change, we can get agreement on that change. I feel confident that the legislation, which has been the exposure draft of the Broadcasting Services Bill, which a number of honourable members have referred to tonight, will be used wisely by people. I think that there will be a great deal of merit in the consultative mechanisms which have been put in place. I know that a number of changes to broadcasting in this country will be supported throughout the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to address any issues in particular. I am pleased that all Opposition members were able to support the legislation. I was going to talk about 2WEB, but I have decided that the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) did such a fine job that there is no need for me to contribute. The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) made a number of very fine points about the difficulties which face people living in remote areas. I remind him that I have similar difficulties with areas in my electorate. I am sure he understands the implications of that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not keep the House very long. I was surprised tonight because I thought I was the only person in the chamber who represented an electorate where some people could not receive a television signal. After the speeches tonight by the honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) and the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), I appreciate the fact that other parts of Australia are having problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raised this matter in the House a week or so ago. However, I would like to emphasise that I have many constituents in the Gloucester district and in the g<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>reater Taree City Council area who previously could always receive a signal from Prime and ABC television. Because of aggregation, there has been what is termed an upgrading from VHF to UHF in the Middle Brother Mountain area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been told by the ABC and the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) that television reception would be available to all of the people of Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have received many letters about this matter. I have written to the Minister for Transport and Communications. However, his reply certainly does not satisfy the people concerned who are not receiving the reception they used to get, although the equipment has been updated with the intention of improving television viewing. Some people who were able to watch Prime Television are now not able to do so. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased in a way to note that so many people on farms watch and listen to ABC television and radio. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VF4">Mr COWAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. The honourable member for Parkes and the honourable member for Maranoa spoke about this matter this evening. Country people rely upon ABC television. Not only do they watch ABC news but also they also watch the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> and a lot of sensible programs involving such things as music. I might say that they do not have to watch any advertisements. The ABC is part of their life. Dr John Taylor, who comes from the Forbesdale area in the Gloucester district and who speaks on behalf of many in the community, has written to me about this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of old grazier families cannot work out why they are unable to receive a television signal when they are supposed to be living in a modern world. After a technician has been out to have a look at the problem, they are told, `There is no problem here. We are going to boost it a little at Christmas time and you may happen to receive a picture'. Admittedly, some, but not all, of the area I am talking about is in a fairly mountainous region. People living in the problem areas are told, `Righto, if you would like to buy a dish at a cost of about $4,000 you will be able to receive an improved service'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member says, that is basically pay television. I take this matter very seriously because I live in the country. Country people love to be home and sometimes watch television. With the technological knowledge in telecommunications that is available today, it is time that Australians received a better service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other day I wrote to Mr David Hill, the Chairman of the ABC. Each year Mr Hill comes to this place and talks to members of the National Party of Australia. He gives us the opportunity to speak to him and question him. He always says to us, `Look, if any of you have a problem, please contact me'. So I decided to write to him. Only a day or so before I did so, people from Telecom were telling us about the wonderful services that they are providing, the profits that they are making and the way in which they are catering for people right throughout Australia. I told them that some of my constituents were not able to get a reception. They said, `Look, we are working under the direction of the ABC'. But Telecom is still the organisation with the technical knowledge that must advise the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not suppose the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Snowdon), who is at the table, will be able to answer the question that I want to ask. But I want to know who is responsible? With the ABC providing the money and Telecom providing the technical knowledge, surely this problem can be worked out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just wanted to rise to speak tonight because I am very concerned about the situation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendments to the Transport and Telecommunications Legislation Amendment Bill are quite significant. I have some remarks about the amendments, in addition to those made by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Snowdon). I indicate that, as the amendments have come from the Senate, the coalition supports them. We supported the amendments in the Senate so they will pass through here with the concurrence of the House tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of matters I want to raise. I refer to the changes to the Australian Overseas and Telecommunications Corporation Act. Those changes relate to the concept of merger and the tax consequences that flow to subsidiaries of the principal bodies that are being merged. The Parliamentary Secretary gave the example of Telecom Australia International and OTC International. It is envisaged that those two bodies will be merged into a new entity. Of course, that remains to be seen. Quite clearly, that is a matter for the new board&mdash;that is, the board of the new amalgamated body of Telecom and OTC, which will be the largest company in Australia&mdash;which is yet to be announced. I understand that a decision on the board is imminent. The merger will be a matter for the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite possible that Telecom Australia International and OTC International may stay as subsidiaries but the tax consequences, as I read this amendment, are to be neutralised so that in the event that they are merged there is not an ongoing tax liability. That is quite important. As I said, it remains to be seen whether those two entities will be merged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, one of the underpinning principles that the Government put forward for the benefits of this merger was that the international arms would be able to generate significant income for Australia. One would hope that that is the case. If one has a look at their broken down accounts, apparently that has yet to be realised. In any event, that is a significant amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another significant point is that the Bill also amends the Telecommunications Act and places in the Act a broader test of reasonableness. In the event that the second carrier applies to the principal carrier&mdash;that is, Telecom; the second carrier is yet to be announced&mdash;for a right to interconnect its facilities to the network of another, that carrier has the right to have telecommunications supplied to it  by  another  when  it  makes a  reasonable request. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This broader test of reasonableness will be arbitrated by Austel&mdash;the telecommunications authority. It will oversee the emerging greater competitive telecommunications services that this whole proposal envisages. Where Telecom will not entertain a request, it could stymie the development of the second carrier's network and that would not be reasonable. This additional amendment has been required. As it facilitates the growth for the second carrier and entry into that market, we of course support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that when we ask Telecom to enter into a competitive arrangement&mdash;that is what the legislation does&mdash;we have to expect that it will act competitively. We hope it does. Already, Telecom is showing that it is interpreting the Telecommunications Act in a very strict and narrow way. This additional test is put there to facilitate the second carrier accessing that network. In the broad, that is what this amendment is about. There are also amendments as to how Austel will operate. The Bill has regard to several matters which I will not go into and amends tariffing procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important amendment to the Bill proposes to vary the time period for the scrutiny by the Parliament of the licences that will need to be issued by the Government once it makes the selection of the second carrier. The licence conditions are central to the terms under which the second carrier will be able to compete against Telecom. Under the licensing conditions, there will be industry requirements, interconnection arrangements, environmental procedures and international arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are absolutely the centrepiece of the requirements that the second carrier will need to fulfil, when it makes its bid, to be able to operate successfully. It is proposed that these licence conditions come to the Parliament under the normal Acts Interpretation Act arrangements to see whether or not the Parliament agrees and, if it does not, they can be disallowed. The normal period is 15 days. This proposal collapses that 15 days down to five, and that means that there will still be parliamentary scrutiny but over a much shortened period. That, of course, will impose upon the Government&mdash;and I am sure the Government will agree&mdash;an obligation to provide the fullest, frankest and most complete briefings to those within the Parliament who seek them. I am sure that there will not be any difficulty with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a major change in telecommunications that has been undertaken. This amendment, as the explanatory memorandum points out, is intended to facilitate as quickly as possible an opportunity for the successful bidder to start the roll-out of its network. The figure of $3 billion-odd over a period has been cited for rolling out a network. It is most important that, once the decision is made about the bidder, the bidder is able to undertake the work that needs to be done immediately. With the proposed sitting patterns, if this matter is not dealt with expeditiously by the Senate these vital items relating to the licences will not be dealt with until next year. As we do not resume until the end of February, that is something that all of us would not want to see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the key points that I wanted to raise with the Government was whether or not there was a precedent for varying the disallowance time, because I think that the disallowance provisions of the Parliament are essential for the proper functioning of a democracy. There are occasions when one would want to collapse the time frame, and I have been provided with such an example&mdash;I take it by the Attorney-General's Department. That occurred with the Australian Capital Territory Electricity Supply Act back in 1982 when the disallowance period was collapsed down to five days. But I point out that that was envisaged in the case of there being an emergency. We would not want the power to stay off to the inconvenience of the Parliament, and that is why it chose to collapse the time period. I do not think that this situation quite fits the same bill of goods in that it does not relate to emergencies, but it is a matter of fundamentally major importance that the Government take every step available to it to put in place the new competitive arrangements. It is an inferior structure, I might say, but in any event it goes down the right path and that is why the Opposition has agreed to support these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) is here&mdash;I do not know whether he heard me earlier&mdash;I might just say that we would expect full and complete briefings on all the licence conditions. Also, of course, the articles of association of AOTC are to be subject to tabling as well. They are very important decisions. As the Minister knows, throughout this very complicated debate we have tried to facilitate, where we can, the Government's program of reform which is, as I have said, going in the</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Reform of planning and building processes is primarily a State and local government responsibility. However the Commonwealth Government, in keeping with its micro-economic reform agenda, is encouraging broader reforms of the planning and building approval processes. In particular the Local Approvals Review Program (LARP), administered by the Office of Local Government, has encouraged about 30 Councils, with the active support of State Governments, to participate in case studies to review their development and building approval procedures and to develop options for more efficient and effective approval practices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Building Regulations Co-ordinating Council at the request of the Local Government Ministers' Conference, is developing a Model Building Act for adoption by States and Territories as the basis for consistency in building approval processes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The project is in its final stages and includes a consultation phase to provide for input from industry and other affected sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regulatory Reform Committee will be reporting to the Special Premier's Conference to be held later this year on its reform efforts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) (a) As a result of case studies mentioned in (1) a number of Councils are being encouraged to find ways of improving their performance in the management of approval processes. It is hoped that the findings of the case studies, which will form the basis of a model approach to reform, will encourage a greater number of Councils to assess how well they perform, how their practices can be improved, and how they can monitor the continuing effectiveness of their development and building approval procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) During 1991-92 the model approaches to reform in the approvals process will be further developed in the form of a manual and a marketing strategy will be implemented to promote and encourage wide acceptance of LARP's reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition the Commonwealth/State Planning Ministers' Conference held on 20 September 1991 agreed that the Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments support accelerated reform of local government approval processes, particularly in relation to approval times and decision making. Two other outcomes of the Planning Ministers' Conference were</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Housing Industry Development Council (AHIDC) also supports the need to make faster progress in achieving regulatory reform in the housing sector. One of the key priorities of the AHIDC is to facilitate and evaluate LARP reforms to secure the adoption of LARP proposals by December 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) In the Report "Local Government Regulation of Land and Building"&mdash;a study commissioned by the Office of Local Government to review the local government regulatory system in Australia&mdash;it was estimated that savings in the order of $1 billion per annum could be achieved through the reform of the development and approvals process Australia wide. The potential savings were in the area of reductions in delays ($350m-$450m), improving approval processes ($300m-$400m) and rationalisation of development standards ($100m-$150m).</PARA>
