<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Consideration of assistance to the Australian wheat industry, as honourable members well understand, has arisen because Australia's wheat growers are experiencing substantially lower prices for their production, and this is a consequence of record world production last year-a very big harvest-and the aggressive use of production and export subsidies by the United States and the European Community. The EC subsidies now are anything up to $US140 or $US160 and US subsidies are about $50 or anything up to $70 in some markets. This has had an enormous impact on the wheat industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In considering assistance, the Government is mindful of the impact the downturn is having on a number of growers and on the rural communities which service our rural industries, particularly in the light of the current downturn in the wool industry. This last weekend I was in the wheat growing districts of Western Australia and witnessed the level of concern in the industry. The Government has decided to introduce measures which will enable the Australian Wheat Board to extend its borrowings to allow for the lifting of payments to growers, and further payments to growers will be possible at a time when decisions are being taken on next season's plantings. I would expect the Wheat Board to make a further announcement of post-harvest payments to growers shortly.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, Cabinet has foreshadowed a boost in funding of the rural adjustment scheme (RAS) to cover carry-on finance for farmers. As honourable members are aware, the rural adjustment scheme provides the most effective means of targeting assistance to those most in need. Even under prevailing prices, some growers will have no cause to seek assistance from the Government, but what the Government intends does overcome a major deficiency of blanket support measures.</PARA>
<PARA> The extent of further funding of the rural adjustment scheme will be decided once an assessment of the RAS scheme has been completed. On the question of further cover for the Australian Wheat Board's outstanding debts from past sales to Iraq, it has been decided that the existing arrangements adequately share the burden of sanctions.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is me; and I do not agree. The fact is that it is often the case, as it was in the period of high growth, that some sectors are down and some sectors are up. This is pretty much a normal condition of most economies, including this economy. It is also true that some sectors are doing better than others at the moment. In the December quarter balance of payments figures which came out the other day, we had nearly two percentage points of net exports in the quarter; so there is production occurring. Of course, as the economy comes out of recession-and I believe it will-no doubt some sectors will be stronger than others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The gloomy view put by the Leader of the Opposition that there should be a permanent rolling recession-this Jeremiah proposition that there is no hope for Australia which the Leader of the Opposition is putting all the time and bathing in its misfortunes-is a vicious view which does reflect the capacity of the economy to withstand a cyclical change, to recover from it and to come out of it with gross domestic product and employment growing, notwithstanding the fact that some sectors may not do as well as others.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The December balance of payments figures were very revealing. They showed, amongst other things, that there were net exports of 1.9 per cent in the quarter and 10.3 per cent growth in manufactured exports over the year. It is also revealed very graphically on page 3 of the release by the Australian Statistician that there was constant growth in exports through the 1980s under this Government's policies and the closing of imports from the structural gap in the trade deficit from the early 1980s, closing totally in 1986 and actually producing a trade surplus in 1986 and 1987. The trade gap again opened up in 1988 as imports rose in response to the pick-up in the terms of trade, which is again graphically revealed on the following page.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Graph 5 on page 4 shows a very sharp pick-up in the terms of trade which has obviously amplified the imports which have come into Australia and which have now been again stemmed by Government policy. It reveals the obvious point that had the terms of trade not picked up in 1987-88 we would be running a very strong balance of trade surplus and would probably have the debt near the stabilisation point.</PARA>

<PARA> The fact is that had that surge of income worth about $15 billion per year in each of those years not occurred, which this release by the Statistician very graphically shows, it is obviously clear we would now be running a huge balance of trade surplus, as the Government had set the economy up for the low terms of trade of 1986 in the election of 1987.</PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, what this shows is that we have again crimped import growth and brought it back under control with monetary and fiscal policy and, notwithstanding that, there has been that very strong growth in exports in constant prices which is shown here. Of course, in constant prices it is an extraordinary growth-a very strong growth. In other words, what is there is what the coalition was incapable of doing-restarting exports, restarting investment and trying to deal with the structural weakness. If one looks at the chart on page 3, it shows that the huge structural weakness-the huge structural trade gap-which was there under Treasurer Howard--</PARA>

In other words, that structural improvement was there and still is there and now we are getting over the cyclical response of the terms of trade. As the terms of trade come off we are seeing imports come back again and a balance of trade surplus re-emerging.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Eden-Monaro for his question. I did see the comments that were made in Alan Wood's column. His assessment is completely incorrect. As far as this Government is concerned, subject to the environmental impact statement (EIS), we regard the third runway at Sydney as essential.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not just an alibi that that environmental statement is an absolutely essential part of the legislative concern. There is a requirement for an environmental impact statement to identify the full range of environmental impacts associated with major infrastructure developments such as the third runway. The EIS process will identify proper management measures that are necessary to mitigate the environmental impacts of the third runway development, if it is to proceed. The draft EIS was released last September and followed a three-month review period.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) is now addressing issues raised in the public submissions. It is absolutely essential that the commentators on our political system comprehend the nature of the legislation that binds Ministers to act in a particular way. In circumstances such as this, where the controversy is enormous, if we fail to act in accordance with the legislative requirements on us, there will simply be challenges in Federal courts which will hold up the processes even more than the environmental impact statement procedure.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is determined to build the third runway at Sydney airport subject to the successful completion of the EIS process. As an earnest of our good faith in that regard, the FAC has already commenced preliminary work on conceptual design and investigations for site reclamation for the third runway. Also, the FAC will shortly be letting a contract for design work associated with drainage and road works.</PARA>
<PARA> All that leads to this point: provided that those environmental impact statements come out right for the project to proceed, the third runway will go ahead and our seeking of contracts to implement such a decision will go ahead immediately that clearance is given.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Page asks a question that reflects on some of the statements by the Leader of the National Party, and he is wrong in assuming that trade with South Africa is not continuing. Let me give some details to the House on the nature of the wheat trade to South Africa. Since 1979-80 Australia has exported a total of 525,000 tonnes of wheat to South Africa. The situation is that South Africa is normally self-sufficient in wheat; it mainly buys during a drought. Last December the Government confirmed to the Australian Wheat Board that it could tender, and that tender was successful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia produces about 14 million tonnes of wheat a year on average. South African production is about 2.2 million tonnes. It is not a major producer of wheat and its imports have averaged, since approximately 1980, 93,000 tonnes. That is equivalent to the production of about 67 farms in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> I am aware of some of the comments made by the impetuous Leader of the National Party, who believes all the work done by the current trade mission led by the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development will be to no avail and, as a consequence, wheat trade with South Africa should be resumed. This is really a big bit of nonsense.</PARA>
<PARA> In fact, he was quoted as saying that he is `bitterly disappointed with the outcome' of that trip. He would have had a very good point if he had been backed up either by the opinion of his party or by the facts, because the Deputy Leader of the National Party, the Opposition spokesman for primary industries, who is now travelling with the Minister, said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in the time available-</PARA>
<PARA>in the United States and-</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in very difficult circumstances, I believe we have achieved the best that was achievable . . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I do want to commend Dr. Blewett, the leader of the delegation for the work he has done, the leadership he has given, and what has been achieved . . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Let me make this clear to the House, instead of this nonsense we hear from the Leader of the National Party: the real grains for Australian producers are to be won by working solidly on the substantive issues of trade liberalisation and access to market. That is what the Government is doing right now. It is slow, unspectacular stuff, but it has to be done.</PARA>
<PARA> One thing is clear enough: contrary to what the Leader of the National Party thinks, South Africa does not exist as some type of wheat El Dorado. If it did, the fact that Australia has no restriction on the sale of wheat to South Africa would be reflected in massively increased expected returns to Australian growers.</PARA>
<PARA> May I take this opportunity just to add to an answer to a question earlier on the wheat industry, in which I failed to point out that the Cabinet is still looking at the question of identifying losses specifically associated with Australia's compliance with the United Nations trade sanctions on Iraq.</PARA>

<PARA>The United States moved in May 1988, the United Kingdom moved in June-July 1988, and we moved earlier than both of them-in April 1988. So the whole claim is untrue. As to the advice from the Treasury, the Treasury never advised me to tighten monetary policy early in 1988 because it shared a view with the Reserve Bank of Australia at the time-a view shared by the Bank of International Settlements-that monetary conditions post the stock market crash should be left accommodating otherwise there would be large wealth effects from large corporate collapses a la 1930. That was the prevailing view; it was not a view I agreed with.</PARA>
<PARA> I actually argued against the Treasury and the Reserve Bank to increase interest rates in January 1988 and again formally in March 1988-that is, before the elections. The fact is that this claim has no veracity about it whatsoever. There was a fallout from the stock market crash and there was, in all of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, a more accommodating monetary policy because of the wealth effects which were feared might be larger than those following the stock market crash in 1929. At the time, nobody believed that demand would take off, but as soon as demand looked like taking off I was putting a view that rates should rise. As it is, they rose first in April 1988. So there was a stock market crash fallout, but it occurred two years later, in 1990, as the demand arising from that monetary accommodation went through the Western world. So the whole charge here, this mealy-mouthed charge, is entirely incorrect.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1645" SPEAKER="Bilney The Hon G.N." NAMEID="RE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="KINGSTON" MINISTERIAL="DEFENCE SCIENCE AND PERSONNEL" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RE4">Mr BILNEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know of only one person who takes a greater interest in the submarine project than the present honourable member for Port Adelaide, and that is the former honourable member for Port Adelaide. I am very pleased to be able to tell the House that the new submarine project, which involves the design and structure of six Collins class submarines for the Royal Australian Navy, is progressing extremely well. The construction facility is complete and fully operational. The keel of the first submarine, Collins, was laid in February last year, and the keel of the second submarine, Farncomb, was laid in the presence of the Prime Minister just last week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The design of the submarine is well advanced, and the fitting out of the platforms for the first submarine has already commenced. The production of the combat system is also well advanced, and preliminary software testing of the combat system data package has started. The project remains within budget and on schedule for the first submarine to be delivered in January 1995. The estimated total cost of the project is $4,620m at April 1990 prices.</PARA>
<PARA> The contract with the Australian Submarine Corporation specifies that work amounting to about $1,951m at June 1986 prices be placed with Australian industry. Ninety-nine per cent of that work has now been committed, and about 65 Australian companies are involved in the project. The Australian Submarine Corporation employs directly over 550 people, and that figure is expected to increase to around 800 as construction peaks. A total of about 2,000 new jobs have been created as a result of the submarine project.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member asked about the spin-off effects of the transfer of technology. I am very pleased to be able to cite a very significant example of one spin-off to Australian industry and employment in Port Adelaide, and that is the establishment of a facility to construct submarine batteries across the road from the other plant. Pacific Marine Batteries, which is a joint venture company formed by Pacific Dunlop Ltd of Australia and Varta Batterie of Germany, will transfer to Australia the full range of technologies and allied skills needed to make these extremely heavy duty batteries in Australia. From talking to the management, I am certain that it is pursuing both the domestic and the export market for other heavy duty batteries.</PARA>
<PARA> The formation of Pacific Marine Batteries and the associated investment in South Australia is a good example of the benefits which flow to Australia from the Government's decision to construct the new submarines here rather than overseas. It is indicative of the confidence that major overseas companies have in South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps I should conclude by mentioning one statistic. I know that it is difficult to attract the Opposition's attention to good news, but five or six years ago, of the $2.5 billion spent on capital equipment by the Department of Defence, about 75 per cent was spent overseas and 25 per cent spent in Australia. This year those figures are precisely reversed: three-quarters of our expenditure will be spent in Australia and only one-quarter spent overseas.</PARA>

Clearly, the United States will not be defining or dictating Australian Government policy in relation to explor-ation generally or, more particularly, in relation to either exploration adjacent to the reef or, as I indicated earlier, anywhere near that.

The Industry Commission draft report itself does not recommend the construction of a nuclear power station at Jervis Bay, or anywhere else in Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member-and indeed you, Mr Speaker-for this question. Whilst the honourable member's question is about consistency, perhaps he deserves a gold medal for his persistency in finally getting his question recognised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Consistency within the education system is an important issue, although sometimes a controversial one. Nobody ever seems to worry about the fact that within each of our States there is a common approach to curriculum, a common approach to assessment, and a general consistency throughout not only the public system but, indeed, the private system as well. But as soon as we get to a State boundary there seems to be no interest at all in trying to develop a more nationally consistent approach to some of these important issues.</PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to inform the honourable member for Adelaide that of course a lot of progress is being made on this question. We are working with the States in order to try to establish a common approach to curriculum. We are looking at the question of a common approach to starting ages, and a common approach to pre-service and in-service training for teachers and the like. This is all about trying to build a better education system within Australian schools.</PARA>
<PARA> I was delighted to see a recent speech by Brian Loton in his capacity as Chairman of the Business Council of Australia, where he essentially gives a very strong endorsement of this Commonwealth-State effort to try to remove some of the fragmentation within our school system and to try to develop a more nationally consistent approach to such issues as curriculum, assessment, and questions of the status and standards of teaching in Australia. This speech identifies that the question of education and schools in Australia is not just something which is an education debate; it is a debate which is crucial to our economic success. It is a crucial part, as Brian Loton says, of the micro-economic debate in this country.</PARA>
<PARA> There is in some quarters a view that approaching these issues of national consistency is about embracing some dull uniformity across the country, when in fact nothing could be further from the truth. What we are trying to do at the same time as we develop these consistent frameworks to schooling is build into our schools some quality-the best quality that we can find in this country. Some of the announcements that the Prime Minister will make tomorrow will go to the heart of this matter.</PARA>
<PARA> We recognise that if one wants to build better schools, if one wants to look at issues of quality, it is a good idea to go to the best schools, find out how they are getting it right and see how we can extend their excellence to other schools in Australia. I commend to the attention of everyone the important aspects of the Prime Minister's statement tomorrow, which will address this important question in the context of another Commonwealth-State initiative.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AJ4">Mr SHARP</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Gilmore)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(2.50)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Australia languishes in the worst recession that we have experienced since the end of the Second World War, as our foreign debt increases to $131 billion net from about $20 billion when this Government came to power, as unemployment levels increase dramatically to the point where we look realistically at the prospect of seeing double digit unemployment figures by the end of this year, Australia needs to look to a government which can give it some hope, some fresh direction and some opportunity for the future. We need to have a government that is prepared to implement change, particularly in the micro-economic area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is for that reason that in this matter of public importance discussion the Opposition has decided to talk about the need to reform our transport sector. Our transport sector is a good test of this Government's resolve to implement micro-economic reform to create extra productivity for Australia so that we can trade our way out of the difficulties that we are currently experiencing, many of which have been generated by this Government's economic mismanagement.</PARA>
<PARA> If we go beyond the general issue of transport reform to look specifically at the waterfront and use the example of the waterfront as a good means to assess the Government's determination and preparedness to take on the hard issues to create real micro-economic reform, then I think we can get a true picture of what this Government stands for when it talks about creating a new Australia and reconstructing our problems to give us a better future. I can assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that within the transport sector there is no greater example of what is wrong with Australia's transport industries than what we see on the waterfront today, because the waterfront houses everything that is wrong with our transport industries. All of the bad work practices, all of the old rorts and all of the trade union militarism is based and housed within the Australian waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us focus our attention on the Australian waterfront and see how this Government is achieving its micro-economic reform in that area. If we look at the importance of the waterfront, we will realise, as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) said in a comment he made to the Daily Telegraph a couple of weeks ago, that the major blocking point within the Australian transport sector is the waterfront. If we are going to fix up the transport sector and fix up Australia's economy, we have firstly to address that major blocking point of the waterfront. If we can do that, we will be able to start helping farmers, manufacturers, people in the motor vehicle building industry, people in our textile, clothing and footwear industries and so on, because they are the people who are bearing the costs of the inefficiency right throughout our transport sector, and in particular as a result of the inefficiencies that exist today on the Australian waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1988 some research was done to determine what precisely is the cost of having an inefficient transport sector. Interestingly enough, the cost of that inefficiency came to some $3,240m per year in 1988 figures. That is the cost of having those inefficiencies on our waterfront, in our rail system, on our roads and within our coastal shipping industry. The greatest cost of that is borne by our farmers, but to bring down to a more individual, more personalised basis how much all those inefficiencies mean to us, I can tell honourable members from those figures that the cost of the inefficiencies inherent within our transport infrastructure is $720 per household throughout Australia. Some $720 per household in 1988 figures is a great cost. The cost in today's terms would be even greater. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us focus on the waterfront and see how we can start to overcome the huge cost of over $3,000m that is being imposed upon every Australian each and every year. In 1984 the Government talked up big about its desire to reform the waterfront. In September 1984 we had the first of two major inquiries into reforming the waterfront, the first being the Webber inquiry. In 1989 the Government implemented its Waterfront Industry Reform Authority (WIRA), the vehicle by which all of its rhetoric of the previous five years would be turned into action. This would bring us home the bacon of reform on the waterfront. Where are we? We are halfway through the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority's program of reform, and what have we achieved? To date, any objective observer would say that the Government's waterfront reform program is snail-paced: it is totally inadequate and is way behind schedule. That is the view that I hold, that members on this side of the House hold and that most objective observers throughout the industry hold. The Government's reform of the waterfront is snail-paced. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable members do not believe my objective judgment or the judgment of others throughout the industry, we can go to the Government's own targets for waterfront reform set out in its in-principle agreement when WIRA was established in 1989. Where does it tell us we should be with waterfront reform today? The agreement said that, within 12 months of establishing WIRA, 500 waterside workers should be made redundant through the WIRA process by September 1990. Where were we with redundancies on the waterfront by September 1990? Did we get 500; or did we have 400, 300, 200 or even 100 redundancies by September 1990? No, we did not get any of those. We got a big fat zero-zero redundancies-within the first 12 months when the target that the Government set was for 500. Already we are behind schedule. Already we are snail-paced, measured by the Government's own targets that it set itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Here we are now at the halfway point. According to the Government's own measurements, that halfway point should have delivered to us 1,000 redundancies on the Australian waterfront by today. How many do we have? Do we have 1,000, 800, 600 or 500? We have not got that at all. If all the redundancies that have been agreed to and that are to take place by the end of March actually happen, we will have 451. That means that we are moving at less than half pace in terms of the Government's own stated targets of reform on the waterfront. We have to balance that against the fact that the Government has employed an extra 213 new workers in the process of getting us those redundancies. Nobody can say that that has been done at a startling pace. None of us would argue with the claim that the reform process of the waterfront is moving at a disgraceful pace and is costing us tremendously. </PARA>
<PARA> Here we are at the halfway point, moving at less than half pace. If we extrapolate the experience that we have had from the first half of the WIRA process to the second half of the WIRA process, which starts next month, we will realise that Australia is likely to get up less than half of the targeted reform programs that this Government set for itself over three years. We might say, `Well, maybe the Government had set too high a target and this is why it cannot get anywhere near it'. That would be fair if it had set too high a target. But the reality is that its target of a 30 per cent gain in productivity on the waterfront over three years is absolutely wimpish. It is typical of some of the things we see every day from this Government. It is wimpish because 30 per cent over three years is nothing like that which we need to achieve on the Australian waterfront to keep Australia competitive as a trading nation. </PARA>
<PARA> To assist the Government to even get those meagre reforms up and running, it has a $300m redundancy package for retiring waterside workers. If we extrapolate that into direct figures, we will find that for every one per cent of productivity gain on the Australian waterfront these people in the Government are prepared to spend $10m of our money paying off retiring waterside workers. I wonder what small businesses, farmers and other people who are currently suffering would think of that. </PARA>
<PARA> We have only a very modest target set by this Government for reform on the waterfront. Meanwhile, what is the rest of the world doing? In 1989-the same year this Government kicked off its WIRA program-the United Kingdom reformed its waterfront. What did it achieve? It achieved a 65 per cent gain in productivity in 12 months. In the same year, New Zealand reformed its waterfront and achieved a 100 per cent gain in productivity on its waterfront. New Zealand did not need to give a $100,000 package on average to each retiring waterside worker. It got its 100 per cent gain in 12 months with a $27,000 average pay-out to its waterside workers. These people in the Government are being very modest in their goals and very generous in their payments to their mates. We are not going to get anywhere near the targets that this Government has set for itself. Yet the Government talks about 30 per cent as if it was something really meaningful and significant. </PARA>
<PARA> A very useful exercise is to look at the way this Government measures itself in terms of what it achieves. This Government gets awfully excited about saying, `Goodness, we are going to create a 30 per cent increase in productivity on the waterfront. Isn't that fantastic? Aren't we worldbeaters? Aren't we a great government? Aren't we up there with the leading nations of the world as far as reform is concerned?'. The fact is that we are way behind because the rest of the world is moving faster than us when it comes to waterfront reform. If one looks at some of the figures that the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority itself puts forward, one will see that Australia's productivity levels on the waterfront are hopelessly behind. </PARA>
<PARA> If one compares Melbourne with a similar port, such as Yokohama, and looks at the 20-foot containers that each port takes over its waterfront every hour, one will see that, according to the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority, the port of Yokohama can handle thirty 20-foot containers per hour. Currently, Melbourne can move twelve 20-foot containers per hour. If we have a 30 per cent productivity gain over a three-year period, what will we end up with? Melbourne will move sixteen 20-foot containers per hour whilst Yokohama's figure of 30 will have been surpassed because Yokohama is constantly reforming and it will probably have gone to 35. So we will still have only half the level of efficiency that a port such as Yokohama will have. </PARA>
<PARA> David White, the Victorian Minister for Industry and Economic Planning, said at a parliamentary committee hearing a couple of weeks ago in Melbourne that if this Federal Government implements fully its reform on the Melbourne waterfront the port of Melbourne will be 20 per cent as efficient as the port of Singapore. How does that stand up to the measurement of how international trade is carried out?</PARA>
<PARA> We are not competing against ourselves. Thirty per cent better than what we were is of no significance to anybody. What we have to do is be 30 per cent more efficient than the rest of the world because it is the rest of the world that we trade against, not ourselves. That is why the whole policy of this Government on the waterfront is fatally flawed. As the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) pointed out to me, how can we have efficiency on the waterfront when every container requires 104 separate pieces of paper to be filled in by somebody before it can be moved through the port? It is a bureaucratic nightmare. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government looks inwards, not outwards, and that is why its program of reform will actually leave the Australian waterfront more inefficient-in comparison with our trading partners-than it was at the beginning of the program. By the time we get to the end of this Government's waterfront reform program-if we assume for a moment that we achieve all of the goals-we will still be more inefficient than the rest of the world, but more efficient in comparison with when we started out. That is one of the failings that this Government has forgotten in its process of reform and in its decision to drive through with that reform by pushing the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia and others to the negotiating table. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole process of this Government's reform program has been flawed. Even last week when Conaust Pty Ltd got a successful ruling from the Australian Industrial Relations Commission the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) claimed this as a great success on behalf of the Government. Even that reform, whereby Conaust was able to achieve some gains-certainly not all that it would like to get, but some-was achieved, not through the Government's waterfront reform program, as the Government will no doubt try to tell us tomorrow afternoon when the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) gets up, but because Conaust went outside the waterfront reform program driven by this Government. It went outside it because-as Captain Richard Setchell, who runs Conaust, said-the Government was, at very best, neutral in its help in terms of achieving reform on the waterfront. A couple of weeks ago he said, `The lack of purposeful government involvement and support has left the ship foundering'-the ship being waterfront reform. </PARA>
<PARA> The gains that this Government has achieved rest wholly and solely with the National Terminals agreement, an agreement which has seen some redundancies take place, but which, according to the peak shippers advisory group-a group which the Government set up just a couple of months ago to advise it-is nothing better than a group of motherhood statements. The Government has not achieved reform on the waterfront. It has not been able to get even halfway towards its own test of success in reform on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> Until the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) and his colleagues can achieve significant micro- economic reform, Australia will continue to languish in the recession which we are currently experiencing-a recession brought on by the Government-and which will be continued by the Government because of its lack of courage to take on these hard issues of micro reform. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since this interests Opposition members a great deal, let us have a look at the talk about where this waterfront reform process is going and what the Opposition's policies are. The Opposition has no policies in this area at all. Opposition members have attitudes but no policies-and I will detail that later because the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) was honest enough to admit it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The waterfront reform process that we are going through is based, in its entirety, on the report of the Inter-State Commission and its recommendations on how waterfront reform should be achieved and what targets should be set. Let me remind the House of the original attitude of the person who has just spoken, the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp), to that Inter-State Commission report on which we base our reforms. He said this about that report:</PARA>
<PARA>The approach of the Liberal and National parties has been to support the Inter-State Commission's recommendations. We recognise that they are not perfect; we recognise that they do not fit properly every one of the aspects that we would like them to. However, we do believe that they are a good basis for fundamental structural reform. We believe that this recommendation by the Inter-State Commission represents a framework for achieving real improvement on the waterfront, and it reflects the coalition's emphasis on increasing competition and a more enterprise-based approach to employee relations. </PARA>
<PARA>What we have just heard from the Opposition spokesman is total, unremitting opportunism. He endorsed those targets-the targets that we subsequently picked up in our waterfront reform process-yet he now stands up to turn his back on them and walk away from them because it is opportunistic for him to do so. The honourable member for Gilmore has seen a few criticisms around the place about the waterfront reform process so he walks away from his commitment. I tell the Opposition that, as far as all these areas of micro-economic reform are concerned, nothing happens by declaration or by marching into this place and making a great speech. Everything happens by a process of deliberation or it does not happen at all. </PARA>
<PARA> I will go through what the honourable member for Barker had to say about these matters when he appeared at an Australian Chamber of Shipping lunch. He was asked questions by people who actually know about these processes, as opposed to the general public, which can be misinformed from time to time. When one appears at something like the Australian Chamber of Shipping lunch, one appears without alibis and without the opportunity for a quick flick through notes in order to be able to convince the panel that one has a process of reform under way. According to an article in the Australian entitled `Coalition ducks outlining waterfront plan: Trust us, McLachlan urges', this is what the honourable member for Barker had to say:</PARA>
<PARA>By the time the election comes there will be a number of important people in this room who will know exactly what the process of reform will be.</PARA>
<PARA>That is terrific! That is two years off and yet here he is criticising us for not having a policy or an approach that suits. He comes in here and has nothing to say because he knows nothing. The article in the Australian also attributed this to the honourable member:</PARA>
<PARA>`You never know whether anyone's going to be any good at anything until you put him in a position of responsibility and I believe that applies to politics as well,' . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Later he told a questioner: ``Your question is `will we have the guts to do it' (reform the waterfront)-I don't know. George Bush said, `read my lips' and he backed down (on United States taxes). I can only say you're going to have to either trust people or keep voting Labor.''</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed! The article concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr McLachlan said he was sure . . . that there would not be a one-off solution or a short cut to solve industry problems . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Barker has not been around long enough to know that performances by Opposition spokesmen in these sorts of areas ought to reflect, from their point of view and for their political protection, a high degree of dishonesty, as we saw from the previous spokesman on waterfront reform. It does not require an honest approach, such as that put forward by the honourable member for Barker, conceding that the Opposition has no policies and that the industry will have to proceed on trust. On the question of having the guts for a confrontation, we have only seen one example of the Opposition in a confrontation and that was in the pilots' dispute last year. Its response involved ducking under the table really quickly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed. People make great promises in opposition, but when they actually get themselves in a position to do something, then they may well cut and run. Well might honourable members opposite cut and run because they do not come into this debate with clean hands at all. Their hands have been dirtied by their endorsement of the Government process back in 1989 when the Inter-State Commission brought down a report. But even more their hands have been muddied by their performance in government over years and years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When this Government came into office, in the transport sector we inherited a road policy that had atrophied, that was not delivering the changes that were required. There had been no reform on the waterfront. For 30 of the last 33 years, through all of those changes in the fifties and sixties which set the current prevailing work practices in place, the Opposition parties had been governing and had no policy in regard to it. In telecommunications, there was a state monopoly operating without any reform to that process at all. There was a two-airline agreement set in concrete-it had been there for 40 years. Qantas was massively protected and there were very few airlines effectively operating to this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Now the Opposition comes in here and says we need to take a lesson from it on micro-economic reform, and `What the public ought to do is look at the Opposition's record and trust us. Do not worry about a policy, public-we might have a policy in two years time-but just trust us because we can talk up a storm, if even we can deliver nothing'. The public has a right to be sceptical about that sort of approach, as the honourable member for Barker was happy to concede to the shipping council, and the read-my-lips formula which he applied to George Bush on the subject of taxes. We do not ever really know-and indeed we do not when it comes to the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> What have we achieved since then? There is no two-airline agreement in place-none. The efficiencies that can come to the tourism industry from competition in the aviation sector are now coming. Why? As the result of a decision that we took. That is the first point. The second point is that Qantas, which had 23 competitors when we came into office, now has 40. In addition to that, there are liberalised international charter arrangements which are seeing charters to parts of the country important to the tourism industry but not well served by international aviation, at least until we put those policies in place. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a situation now where seats available under our agreements are running at about twice the level of those which were in existence when we came into office but can only be half filled. In other words, we have a negotiated capacity well beyond the Australian tourism market or any other market to sustain. That leaves, of course, massive room for growth. They are the achievements of this Government after 30 years of atrophy under the Liberal Party of Australia when it was in government. </PARA>
<PARA> In the roads sector, we are now 21 per cent up in real terms on the levels of expenditures that the Opposition coalition had when it was in office. So there is improvement there. As far as the rail freight industry is concerned, we are getting in place a national rail freight authority which will deal with some of the inefficiencies that come out of the system that was inherited by us when we came into office. In the telecommunications area, we now have a position where there is going to be competition across the board with networks, a massive liberalisation of the ability of people to operate off leased lines, additional cellular mobile operators and eight competitors in cordless telephones. There has been the introduction of real competition in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition tries to demonise these achievements with a plethora of nonsense that it has come forward with. The honourable member for Gilmore said of the Conaust Ltd agreement which has just been reached that it was outside the framework of the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority. Unfortunately he would say that only because he has not read the reform process that has been put in place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I go to page one of the summary in principle agreement. If the honourable member read it, he did not read it very well. It says that nothing in the agreement shall affect the right of any party under the Industrial Relations Act 1988. We anticipated that in this process there would be occasions when there would be a requirement to resort to the industrial relations system to cement those gains. What did Conaust Ltd say about it immediately that decision was brought down? Captain Setchell of Conaust Ltd said this-</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Our on-going commitment and belief in the established system has been vindicated by the decisions made by the Commission yesterday. The Commission's direction was based, we believe, on a rational and logical evaluation of the issues put before it for consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>What we have had from the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins), who sits in the other place, is a constant urging of the parties to go through these processes and constant intervention to ensure that these things have been achieved. What else has the Opposition had to say about the propositions that we have been putting forward on the waterfront? The Opposition endorsed the proposals that we have put forward in the shipping area which will reduce us effectively to below the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) levels of manning. The Opposition had this to say, again from its spokesman who so conveniently forgets his past words, though we will not:</PARA>
<PARA>Looking at the Government's performance in micro-economic reform of coastal shipping and the waterfront, we find that its greatest area of success has been in shipping. It has had some notable reductions in manning levels from the low thirties towards the low twenties. The Government should be congratulated for that-we must give credit where credit is due because this is a notable change. </PARA>
<PARA>So the Opposition adds to its statement on the Inter-state Commission. The shadow Minister's endorsement of that adds to his statements on that endorsement of our shipping policy. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Now he says-he is heckling me-`What about eliminating cabotage?'. What a nonsense position. The equivalent of eliminating cabotage for example in our aviation sector would be to say, `Stand aside Australian, Ansett and Compass. We will now have operating Philippine Airlines and we will have Bangladesh Biman. We will have a team operating down here which is in exactly the same position, as far as our aviation industry is concerned, as what you advocate for coastal shipping'. I do not know why the shadow Minister singles that out to be so special.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So far only one of the OECD nations, to my knowledge, has abandoned cabotage-assuming it is a relevant policy, because of course some of them are land-locked-and that is the United Kingdom. What did they introduce into Parliament a year or so ago-an Act to restore cabotage in the United Kingdom system. As a result of walking away from it, they discovered that they confronted the collapse of a British maritime industry-and so we would here. But we have liberalised it. Something over one million tonnes was carried around our coast last year under a system of special voyage permits which has been introduced, or at least amplified, under the shipping reform process. </PARA>
<PARA> So we have been getting on with the job of micro-economic reform, not just yakking about it and ducking our responsibilities to establish a policy. The honourable member for Barker says, `We will have a policy which in two years time you will know all about. Will we implement it? Well, trust us; maybe we won't'. Instead of having what the honourable member for Barker talks about, we have in place the process which in 1989 the Opposition endorsed. </PARA>
<PARA> What are we establishing from that? When this Conaust agreement is finalised, there will be a rampant knock-on-as those opposite well know-with a whole series of other agreements affecting Conaust. When that occurs-and that will be a month or two from now-we are talking about 80 per cent of the Government's objectives being settled. It is true that it is not exactly in line with the timetable that was brought down, but in those circumstances, if those things go through, it will be ahead of the sorts of schedules that were placed at the time. In other words, we will go from being behind to being ahead of it. And the sorts of improvements that are being produced under the National Terminals Australia Ltd agreement include a 35 per cent shedding of labour associated with national terminals and increases in productivity, depending on the ports, of between 40 and 90 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to understand one thing in this area and it is important to develop policies about it. Dealing with the problem of work practices and manpower levels is only dealing with part of the problem. The fact of the matter is that in this country, unlike New Zealand and the United Kingdom, we do not have a unitary system of government. Our system is broken down between the States. If we look at most of the problems in the micro-economic reform area in the transport sector, they virtually all stem from that fact. </PARA>
<PARA> Most micro-economic reforms require substantial infrastructure developments. The Commonwealth owns no ports; it only owns bits and pieces of railways. It does own the civil aviation sector, where we have been able to effect dramatic changes. But unless we have cooperation from the States, unless we have some substantial infrastructure expenditures-because that is where real productivities are gained on the waterfront, and that has been so historically-and changes in technology and the way in which business is done, we are not going to have all the changes we need to put into place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has to understand that. The Opposition also has to understand where it comes from. It comes from the most unclean hands conceivable as far as micro-economic reform is concerned, and it comes from having endorsed our positions and now opportunistically walking away from them. It is not a reasonable subject for a matter of public importance from the Opposition in those circumstances. </PARA>

He talked about implementing a policy of reform and about the problems of not having a unitary system; but let me remind the Minister that five State Labor governments have been in power virtually the whole time since this Labor Government came to power eight years ago.

In an interview in the Daily Telegraph Mirror, his colleague agreed that `reform was moving at a grindingly slow pace'. He was talking about reform on the waterfront. It seems that even one of the colleagues of the Minister for Transport and Communications has realised just how hopeless the Minister's efforts have been. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister also seems to be very selective, as is his colleague the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), when he talks about road funding. It was the Fraser Government that brought in the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Fund, as the Minister well knows, which came on stream in full force in 1983-84 and increased the level of road funding. The Labor Government then froze the amount of money going into roads for the next six years. But the key point is that the Government continues to index not only that 2c surcharge but all of the fuel excise. Today the amount of money going into road funding has dropped by 27 per cent in real terms since 1984. So who has welshed out on the question of road funding?</PARA>
<PARA> If we look at other major areas of reform, to which I would have expected the Minister to have referred in his contribution to this matter of public importance, I think he devoted about 20 seconds to rail transport and virtually nothing to road transport. Nearly a year ago the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) wrote a letter to the Minister, in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA>We must explore all options to create and fund a competitive land system-</PARA>
<PARA>this was in the letter written to the Minister-</PARA>
<PARA>and must ensure the best possible return from the huge annual investment in this area. We must create a rail system which offers effective competition to road transport, and which is more productive, integrated and reliable than at present. Pursuit of the national rail freight initiative should be a priority in this area. </PARA>
<PARA>What has happened in that 12 months? We have heard a lot of talk about reform from the Minister and from the Prime Minister, but let us put it into perspective. The National Rail Freight Corporation, which may get started in a very small way some time this year, will only be concerned with 12 per cent of the total rail freight. If one listens to the way the Prime Minister talks about it, one would think it was 120 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at what has happened in this area, we find that virtually nothing has happened. We have had meetings, committees and overarching committees. The Australian Transport Advisory Council (ATAC) looked at this area at one stage, but it did not seem to get too far, so it was taken out of its hands by the Prime Minister. We have seen virtually nothing. We have a suggested starting date of 1 July, but what have we seen that actually shows that this can be achieved? Has there been any management appointed? No. Has there been any headquarters decided upon? No. Have we got any agreement with the States on capital? Have we got any agreement on how we will share the question of debt? The question for the Minister is: where is the action?</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister said that reform should be a priority. That sounds a bit familiar: it was said after the last election. Let me look back to the 1987 election? Do honourable members remember what the Prime Minister said at that time? He said that in this term the Hawke Government will be making micro-economic reform a priority. As my colleague the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) has already pointed out, that priority seems to have been very conveniently overlooked as regards reform of the waterfront. That priority has also been overlooked as regards road funding, land transport in connection with trucking and rail. Four years on, we have seen very little reform. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we ought to put this into some sort of perspective and focus on what this reform is really worth-not only on the Government's record but also on reality and the rhetoric. In March 1989, the former Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) and the Business Council of Australia did a study which suggested that reform in the transport sector could lead to savings of over $3,000m in transport costs. The study went on to show that real wages could increase by 3 per cent; that the Government surplus-something that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) would love to hear-could increase by $1 billion; that real consumption could rise by over $700 a household; and that the benefits would be three times the abolition of all tariffs. Yet, here we have the Prime Minister talking about a great industry statement when years ago he had in front of him the evidence of how he could get real reform and how he could get real savings if he tackled the obvious. But, obviously, the obvious is too difficult to tackle. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been other studies. In February 1990, the Business Council published further work of the IAC and talked about not only the value of micro-economic reform in general but particularly about transport, communication and electricity. Collectively, it pointed out that reforms in these areas could increase gross domestic product by around $16 billion, or 5 per cent, over 10 years. These are big figures in terms of government reform and yet, to date, we have seen a lamentable lack of results. Those figures would mean for the average household an increase of something like $1,600 a year. I would suggest that every household in Australia would be very grateful for that $1,600 right now. Sixty per cent of these gains would come from transport reform. Not only that; we would expect a fall in inflation of 2.2 per cent. In yet another report two weeks ago, the Business Council again pointed out that Australia's transport costs are one of the major impediments to our export performance. So after all these years, despite all the rhetoric and all this overwhelming evidence, we have seen so little from the Government when it comes to real reform in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> When we talk about road transport and road reform, we look at the Government's record and see what it has really done. Since coming to power in February 1983 and prior to that election, the Government promised that it would conduct a national inquiry into the road freight industry in consultation with State and Territory governments. We saw a report in 1984, another report in 1986 and another one-again by the Inter-State Commission-in October 1987. During this time a rail inquiry was even started-one that took four years to get somewhere. Then in 1990 we had two more reports on the road transport industry. </PARA>
<PARA> What have we seen? We have seen the Ministers going along to their ATAC meetings. As long as six years ago there was an agreement that there ought to be uniformity on driver licensing, uniformity on speed limits, uniformity on policies to improve rail costs recovery and the extension of consumer protection to trucking. But we have seen no action. We have the latest report and we have seen that the Special Premiers Conference has had to take it up because the Minister could not even get the reform through the ATAC meeting. He could not get the States to agree so he had to hand it over to the Prime Minister because it all got too hard for him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What a farcical performance! What an absolute farce! The gall of the two shadow Ministers, the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) and the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) to walk into this House with this matter of public importance! Thirty years of indolence is represented on the back bench there! What did the Opposition do in government to reform the road transport industry? Not a jot.

It reinforced the worst excesses of the aviation industry with the policies that it introduced. It continued with the worst excesses of both the road transport industry and the railway industry in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) has said, honourable members opposite come into this House with their hands sullied. Let there be no doubt about it. I am absolutely surprised at the performance of the honourable member for Wannon, a person who has some integrity. He has tried to claim that this Government has done nothing about road transport reform. Is he saying to me that he rejects the initiatives of this Minister, through the InterState Commission (ISC)? Is he saying to me that he rejects the proposals which were adopted at the Premiers Conference in November last year? Does the honourable member opposite oppose them? He has already heard the honourable member for Gilmore, who is sitting next to him, say that he supports the shipping industry reforms that this Government brought into place. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a quote from the Premiers Conference resolution:</PARA>

<PARA> Let me just point to the sort of dissension there appears to be in the ranks of the Opposition. In November last year I announced that this Government would be sponsoring a road transport conference in Alice Springs, and that road transport conference would address a number of issues, but principally to enable people with diverse interests in transport throughout rural and remote Australia to come together to discuss issues of common concern-including, I might say, the shadow Minister for land transport, the honourable member for Wannon. </PARA>
<PARA> I recall that we had a discussion at Canberra Airport, in which the honourable member indicated to me he would be pleased to come. We subsequently discussed the matter. But what did we see from National Party senators? National Party senators put out a press release without any consultation with the honourable member for Wannon, no doubt, and without any consultation with my office, the Minister's office, or the office of the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown). Without making the most fundamental inquiries about the nature of this conference, they bagged it! Why did they bag it?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a very good analogy. It is a dog of a policy that honourable members opposite have. Indeed, let us look at the behaviour of these National Party senators and see what they had to say.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senators Tambling, Campbell and Macdonald criticised the guest list. They said the conference was stacked. Yet they had not seen the guest list, discussed the conference with my office to obtain details of the guest list; they had not discussed the conference with the office of the Minister for Land Transport, and they had not talked to the organisers of the conference-yet they bagged it. Happily, of course, the methods they used to bag the conference were rebuffed. In that regard I point to a newspaper headline, `Critic of transport conference rebuffed'. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Maurice Barclay, the Commercial Director of the Australian Road Transport Federation (ARTF)-a person whom I am sure the honourable member for Gilmore would know-said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the ARTF and the Western Australian Road Transport Association (WARTA) as well as various other road transport industry representative bodies from Queensland and the Northern Territory had been invited and would attend. </PARA>
<PARA>He also said he was confident that the industry would be represented strongly enough at the conference to ensure that a balanced discussion of the issues would ensue. What sort of positive contribution was made by the Opposition, apart from the honourable member for Wannon? Those people who represent the interests of the Opposition in the Senate, the shadow Minister for regional development, external territories and northern Australia, Senator Tambling, undermined what the honourable member for Wannon was doing. He undermined the bipartisan approach to this conference by the honourable member and decided that he would try cheap political point scoring; but to what advantage?</PARA>
<PARA> Later, Maurice Barclay, on the ABC radio in Darwin, contrary to the advice given to the Northern Territory listeners and indeed people in north Queensland and Western Australia by their respective senators, said:</PARA>
<PARA>We believe that it is a Forum where there will be constructive discussions between the industry and government, and we're looking forward to having some positive outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition trumped in here this afternoon with a so-called matter of public importance (MPI), which purports to address what the Opposition asserts is a failure of this Government to achieve reform of Australia's transport infrastructure. Yet the shadow Minister says he supports the initiatives-at least I think he supports the initiatives-taken by the Minister for Land Transport on road reform by the ISC and the Premiers Conference. His colleague the shadow Minister for shipping and waterfront reform supports the initiatives of the Government on shipping reform. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has made no constructive contribution to the debate on how it might differently address those issues. What would the Opposition do to expedite waterfront reform? Would they send in the police? Perhaps they would send in the military? What would the Opposition do? It appears they would certainly not try to seek consensus from the parties involved in the reform process. This is not the first occasion when the Opposition has brought to the House this sort of motion. Nor is it the first occasion when Opposition members both here and in another place have criticised the Government for its initiatives in transport infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA> After the 1987 election the Government announced it would build two airports: one in Alice Springs and one in Darwin. There were catcalls from the Opposition, saying that the Government would never live up to those undertakings. I am pleased to report the progress of these two airports, perhaps even for the benefit of the Opposition. In the case of Darwin airport, the project was awarded in January 1990. The total airport development project cost is $55m. The project is over 70 per cent complete, with the terminal building completely enclosed and the installation of main service lines and mechanical equipment proceeding on time. </PARA>
<PARA> On present indications, John Holland Constructions Pty Ltd will finish the main contract about July and well ahead of the 1 October contract completion date. There is a total work force of 104 people on site-95 per cent local employees. </PARA>
<PARA> No lost time due to accidents has been recorded. In terms of domestic aviation traffic, Darwin airport is ranked No. 11 in Australia, and is an important airport. In the context of the motion moved by the Opposition, in which it asserts a disadvantage which might accrue to Australian exporters, this airport is extremely important in earning Australia foreign exchange earnings from tourism. </PARA>
<PARA> The Alice Springs airport is equally important in earning foreign exchange earnings. The contract for the Alice Springs airport was awarded in February 1990. It is due to be completed on 1 August 1991 and will be officially opened on 22 August. With regard to that airport, the shadow Minister and the Northern Territory Minister-I would not dare use the words I usually use to describe this person-all decried the Government's purpose for building these airports and said that they would not be built on time. But they have been built ahead of schedule. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition should be fair dinkum when it raises these matters of public importance which assert that this Government has not done things. The Opposition should at least have some semblance of credibility. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Later in the debate I will be moving an amendment to the Marine Navigation (Regulatory Functions) Levy Bill which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That all words after ``That'' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> ``whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for its failure to reduce costs imposed by Government through inefficiencies and inadequate reform in the Australian shipping industry, placing a competitive disadvantage on Australian exporters''. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill relates to the Australian Maritime Safety Authority's philosophy of full cost recovery for the services that it provides to the private sector. In this particular case, AMSA provides a number of navigational services to commercial shipping interests-navigation services such as lighthouses, navigational buoys, markers and so forth, all of which are an essential part of the safe operation of any shipping service and also an essential part of any recreational boating or maritime operation. These are vital services being provided by AMSA through the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The creation of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority was shrouded in considerable controversy. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may well remember that at the time of the introduction of the Bill that created the Australian Maritime Safety Authority, the Opposition opposed the creation of AMSA-not on the basis that we thought putting all of the relevant organisations under the one roof was a bad idea, but because we believed that there was no justification for the creation of AMSA based upon cost savings or operational efficiencies. Indeed, as we looked at the legislation that created AMSA and the way in which it was to operate, we became increasingly alarmed that, rather than cost savings flowing as a result of the creation of this new authority, there would actually be cost increases, increases which would have to be borne by the industry itself and which would further burden the industry in terms of its trying to be competitive, trying to get out and compete against foreign flag vessels and trying to compete on behalf of Australian exporters in the world marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA> We were very concerned about the establishment of AMSA and our concern has proved to be correct. This Bill further verifies the concern that we expressed late last year when AMSA was created. At the time we could see that the Australian Maritime Safety Authority was to be sweeping up all of the various Federal Government operations that provided services to the maritime industry, putting them all under the one roof, taking them out of Canberra and, as was the proposal at the time, shifting the entire operation down to Newcastle. </PARA>
<PARA> This may at first glance seem to be a sensible arrangement. Bringing all those disparate groups together and putting them under the one roof sounds like it is an efficiency gain and something that we should be applauding. As it actually turned out, this was not to be the case. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), in the run-up to the election campaign in 1990, had promised the people of Newcastle that a major Federal Government operation would be brought into Newcastle to create jobs and provide additional income in the region to try to boost that region's economic opportunities. That major Federal Government initiative turned out to be the creation of AMSA, and it was to be shifted to Newcastle. </PARA>
<PARA> In the process of creating AMSA, the Government developed the policy, which the Opposition does not argue with, of full cost recovery. I think in any reasonable circumstances full cost recovery for government services provided to the private sector is the way to go. Of course, we must place qualifications on that to ensure full cost recovery does not leave the new authority that has been established to collect these revenues in a position to allow its costs to run rampant, further burdening industry with more and more costs where industry has no control over either the provision or the cost of the services. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the background to the legislation today. Our concerns now, as they were when AMSA was established, are justified. They were justified because shortly after the legislation came into this House late last year the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) did one of the few things since he has taken on that portfolio which I think many of us would say was responsible, and decided to stop the move of AMSA from Canberra to Newcastle. He did it for very good reasons, which we outlined at the time. The first was that the costs of shifting to Newcastle were becoming outrageous. It was first estimated that the shift to Newcastle would run to $6m to $7m; maybe a little bit more, maybe a little bit less. But, as it turned out, a little bit more turned out to be a whole lot more. It initially became apparent that the cost had run to something like $15m; it then became apparent that the cost was closer to $20m- just to shift a group of government department functions from Canberra to Newcastle. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, $20m was starting to become alarming. Whilst the Government said, `We will meet the costs of making that move from Canberra to Newcastle', the industry realised that the Government might put up the money initially but the industry would be left with the bill because the Government was expecting a commercial return on its investment in AMSA through full cost recovery processes later down the track. So, whilst the industry would not put up the money initially, it would end up paying for the huge cost of shifting from Canberra to Newcastle. </PARA>
<PARA> Why did the Government make the announcement to shift from Canberra to Newcastle? There was no reason other than pork-barrelling. There was no justifiable reason for making that move. This was highlighted by the responsible Minister, Senator Collins, in his decision finally to axe the move due to the alarming increase in the cost. At the time, there was a great deal of concern by local members in Newcastle. That concern will be highlighted not necessarily by the Federal members from Newcastle but by those in the industry itself, because this legislation will further burden them with costs just as the Government's decision to axe AMSA's move from Canberra to Newcastle burdened the four local Australian Labor Party members with a considerable degree of angst, upset, complaint and criticism. </PARA>
<PARA> These people-one of whom, the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Brown), sits opposite me today-were seriously embarrassed by the Government's decision not to proceed with the move to Newcastle. Why were they embarrassed? Because during the election campaign they had gone around and trumpeted AMSA's move as one of the good reasons to vote for them-one of the reasons Labor is good for people in Newcastle, one of the reasons people should continue to place their faith in the Labor Party. As it turned out, that was another broken promise by the Government from the last election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> However, returning to the Bill before the House this afternoon, it is quite apparent to see that the industry has justifiable concerns with this cost recovery legislation through the introduction of this levy. Whilst the Government introduces a cost recovery process, the question that everybody in the industry is asking is: just how much control does the industry, which has the ultimate responsibility of paying for the services provided by AMSA, have over, firstly, the type of services that are provided to it and, secondly, the cost of the provision of those services?</PARA>
<PARA> In the legislation that is before the House this afternoon the Government has said that there will be an upper limit of 15 per cent placed upon all cost increases over the next three years in order to achieve full cost recovery for the services provided by AMSA. An upper limit of 15 per cent is an unusual figure. Why is the figure 15 per cent? We have looked through the second reading speech of the Minister for Land Transport and the explanatory memorandum that was provided by the Government in relation to this legislation and have asked: where does it explain why 15 per cent is the chosen figure? Does it represent the figure that the Minister who introduced the Bill believes inflation will be each and every year for the next three years? Will inflation be 15 per cent next year; will it be 15 per cent the year after; or is this a combination of both inflation and a catch-up in order to achieve full cost recovery? That question that we had in our minds was not answered in any of the inquiries that we made in reading the second reading speech of the Minister nor the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>
<PARA> Fifteen per cent seems to be a rather arbitrary figure. In the process of having a cap of 15 per cent on price increases that AMSA can impose for its services upon the industry, one wonders what sort of pressure that places on the Authority to keep its costs within reasonable bounds. Surely, if we are going to make Australia a more competitive country, we should not cap increases at 15 per cent per annum but at much lower levels, or even negative levels, so that Australia's shipping industry and Australia's exports can be more competitive. That is a matter that I will discuss further when moving the amendment in relation to this legislation at the conclusion of this speech. </PARA>
<PARA> We asked the question: why 15 per cent? We got no satisfactory answer. That figure does not place any discipline upon the Authority to keep a close watch on the provision of its services or the cost of those services that it provides. All it does is give the Authority plenty of room to absorb cost increases, inefficiencies and cost blow-outs and pass those on to the industry. On behalf of the Opposition, I state that we do not think that is the right thing to do. We believe that if there are to be cost increases the Government should not pass on the power to just have those cost increases pushed up to 15 per cent each year. If those cost increases are necessary, they should be brought before the Parliament for ratification by the Parliament so that we, the people who represent everybody in Australia and who have interests on behalf of the industry, can view for ourselves precisely why those costs need to be put up. If we are not satisfied, we can say to the Authority, `Sorry, that is not a justifiable reason for putting your costs up; you are going to have to go back and find ways of creating more efficiencies in order to keep your costs down to the industry'. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment the Government is giving the Authority carte blanche to increase its costs to the tune of 15 per cent without having to come back to the Parliament and the people of Australia for their approval. We think that is the wrong way to go. It raises the question which was put by one of my colleagues in our Party meeting the other day: how many other of these Commonwealth authorities have the authority to push their prices up by amounts of 15 per cent or more each year without proper regulation or proper review by the Parliament? I think it is time for us to go through the process of analysing how many of these departments or authorities have been given this power, how many of them are able to increase their costs without parliamentary scrutiny and what burden that then places on industries that have to pay for the cost increases that these people impose without any proper discipline being placed upon them. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are some of the concerns that the Opposition has. We want to know why 15 per cent is the arbitrary figure for cost increases. Why is the Government not saying to the Authority, `If you want to put your prices up, bring your arguments to the Parliament and we will either ratify them or not ratify them. At least in the meantime, though, we will have had an opportunity to look at them, to analyse them and to express our views on them. The industry will have a back-up through the Parliament to ensure that its best interests are being represented as well'? I know that the Minister will say, `But industry has an input into these things'. Quite frankly, while industry might have an input, it does not have a sufficient input from my point of view to ensure that that proper discipline is being imposed on this type of authority or other similar authorities which make up the full retinue of the Government's statutory authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has no argument with the principle of cost recovery. We simply have an argument as to how we ensure that cost recovery does not get out of control and that the power that is given to the statutory authorities is not abused at the expense of the industry. Our argument is that there has to be some form of public scrutiny of all these authorities to ensure that the most competitive gains can be had for Australia's industries and that industries like Australia's shipping industry are not further burdened with additional costs as a consequence of an authority that has carte blanche virtually to increase its charges to the tune of 15 per cent per annum for the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are a few of the thoughts of the Opposition. We will have an opportunity in a few moments to continue this debate in the committee stage. I now formally move the amendment that I foreshadowed at the commencement of my address this afternoon. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after ``That'' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA>``whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for its failure to reduce costs imposed by Government through inefficiencies and inadequate reform in the Australian shipping industry, placing a competitive disadvantage on Australian exporters''. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak on this important legislation-the Marine Navigation (Regulatory Functions) Levy Bill and the Marine Navigation (Regulatory Functions) Levy Collection Bill. At the outset, I reject the amendment moved by the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp). Far be it for me to comment on such things, but if the amendment had been moved in another form it would have been ruled out of order because it has nothing to do with the legislation that is before the House. The amendment talks about the so-called inefficiencies and inadequate reform of the Australian shipping industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a speaker in the previous debate said, it is a bit of a gall for these people who occupied the Treasury Bench for something like 30 years to come in here and read the riot act to us on shipping reform or transport reform. The gall of the Opposition is almost beyond belief. The Opposition occupied the Treasury Bench for 30 years. In the time that we have been in government, we have put in massive reforms, especially in the shipping industry. I do not know where these people opposite have been for the last few years if they are not aware of these things. </PARA>
<PARA> I sympathise with the honourable member for Gilmore. I think he found the going fairly hard, because there was not very much that he could object to in this legislation. He kept going on about the 15 per cent upper limit. Again, it always surprises me when the Opposition talks about these things. The Opposition is constantly telling us that it wants government business enterprises to act in a fully commercial manner. We on this side of the House are committed to acting in a fully commercial manner. But the Opposition is not so committed. Immediately we give any authority the right to act in such a manner, the Opposition says, `No, you can't do this; it's all got to come back to this chamber for this chamber to approve it'. We are either going to run a business or we are not. How can we have a free enterprise system, which I thought the Opposition was in favour of, if every time the Government imposes a cost the House of Representatives and then the Senate have to approve it?</PARA>
<PARA> In very broad terms, the purpose of the legislation is to recover the costs of the maritime and safety regulatory functions of the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) by imposing, on a sliding scale-and it is a sliding scale-a levy on certain seagoing ships. These Bills give effect to the Government's decision, announced on 21 August 1990, to recover the costs of maritime safety and regulatory functions from the commercial shipping industry by imposing this levy on certain seagoing ships. The functions were transferred to the new Australian Maritime Safety Authority upon its creation on 1 January 1991. The decision to impose a safety and regulatory levy is consistent with the Government's overall policy for government business enterprises, whereby the full costs of non-community service obligations are recovered by those who benefit from such services, rather than having the taxpayer pay for them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill introduces a sliding scale of levy under which the rate per tonne reduces as the tonnage increases. The formula adopted in the Bill has been developed in consultation with the industry. I do not know who in the industry the honourable member for Gilmore was talking to, because all the way through there has been full consultation with the industry on this matter. I note that he said it will be a burden on the industry. If it will be a burden on the industry it will be a very minor burden and it is putting onto the industry a fee which it, rather than the taxpayer, will pay. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the formula has been developed in consultation with industry and it is one that has been used successfully in the Marine Navigation Levy Act 1989. It is well known that this Act is as fair as possible to all sections of the shipping industry. The Marine Navigation Levy Act enables the cost of navigation aids to be recovered. So we are bringing in the safety part of it and it will operate in the same way as the Marine Navigation Levy Act enables the cost of navigation aids to be recovered. </PARA>
<PARA> The levy will be phased in over a three-year period, achieving full cost recovery in the 1993-94 financial year. To enable increased costs to be met in future years, the Bill allows for the individual rates of levy to be varied by regulation. The Bill, however, restricts increases introduced after the phase-in period to a maximum of 15 per cent per annum. For the life of me I do not see why the honourable member for Gilmore is making such a fuss about this. It is a maximum of 15 per cent per annum. Perhaps he wants it to be much higher. Maybe he will talk about that at the committee stage and tell us exactly how much above the 15 per cent he wants the increase to go. This will ensure that the regulations are used to provide increased revenue reasonably related to the overall provision of services to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Currently, the annual cost of AMSA's safety and regulatory activities is estimated at just over $7m. There will be no costs to the Commonwealth arising from this Bill. The levy will apply to all ships, except those exempted by regulation under the Marine Navigation Levy Collection Act, which make a call into an Australian port for the purpose of undertaking a commercial trading voyage. No ship will be levied if it makes an Australian port call for the purpose of repair or refit, to take on provisions, to change crew, or to land a crew member or passenger for medical treatment. I do not think there would be any objection to any of those exceptions. </PARA>
<PARA> Ships currently exempted by regulations are: military ships; ships of the Commonwealth, States, or Territories; ships in ballast; ships less than 24 metres long; ships belonging to religious societies; ships laying submarine cables; hospital ships; sailing ships under 500 tonnes; fishing vessels; and pleasure craft. Application of the levy is non-discriminatory. Australian ships will not be advantaged or disadvantaged by introduction of these new levies. The levy is to be paid by all foreign ships visiting Australia in commercial trade, as well as by the Australian fleet. </PARA>
<PARA> After the Government's announcement last year of its intention to recover the costs of maritime safety and regulatory functions, consultation took place with the industry on the issue of how the new levy might be applied. The starting point for these consultations was, as I said before, a proposal that the new levy adopt the same formula as that already in place for navigation aids. The Opposition, from memory, opposed this very strenuously, but since it has been in operation there has not been a lot of opposition to it. Interested parties were invited to suggest alternative options. In the event, no constructive suggestions for alternative methods of collection were proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government announced on 28 November 1989 that it intended to establish the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. This Authority was to be established to enable the safety services to be provided with greater independence and greater responsiveness to the needs of the maritime industry and community generally than was possible from a department of state. Legislation for the establishment of AMSA from 1 January 1991 received royal assent on 22 October 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> From 1 January 1991, AMSA assumed responsibility for most of the maritime operations functions formerly undertaken by the Department of Transport and Communications. These included: marine crewing and qualifications; ship registration; search and rescue; pollution control and response; provision of marine navigational aids in Australian waters; and safety regulation of maritime operations in Australia. The Authority will perform these functions in a manner which is consistent with the obligations of Australia under any convention, treaty or agreement to which Australia is a party. </PARA>
<PARA> The maritime accident investigation role is to stay with the Department to ensure that conflicting interests do not arise when there is a need for an objective report on regulatory issues connected with a maritime accident. The separation of the regulatory and investigative function is consistent with practice in other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> As is known, and as the honourable member for Gilmore made much of, the AMSA headquarters are situated in Canberra, with three main regional offices located in Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth. The honourable member really spoke a load of nonsense about why the decision was made to not go to Newcastle. I must say that, from a personal point of view, I would have supported the headquarters going to Newcastle and I hope that the Minister for Land Transport, the honourable member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), hears me saying that. As Chairman of the Joint Statutory Committee on Public Works, I would have had something to do with that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, there was absolutely no element of pork-barrelling. The Government made the decision that the headquarters should stay in Canberra and, as I say, purely from a personal point of view, I would have preferred to see them go to Newcastle because I think some of these services that we are providing should go into the regional areas. In the area of maritime safety I sometimes find it a little strange that the headquarters should be in Canberra-maybe there are some problems on Lake Burley Griffin. Nevertheless, it was nonsense spoken by the honourable member for Gilmore. The decision was made with regard to various considerations-not least budgetary ones-and the headquarters will remain in Canberra.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Authority's initial annual budget is estimated at around $70m, which is to be funded on a cost recovery basis for those services which can be provided for on a commercial basis, and by the Commonwealth for those functions which are considered to involve community service obligations, such as search and rescue services. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the outset, I am really quite surprised that the Opposition is moving an amendment. Apart from the honourable member for Gilmore asking some questions about keeping the levy at 15 per cent and how 15 per cent was arrived at, he had no real criticisms of the legislation. Indeed, I do not think there could be any criticism of it. I say again that this amendment, which I have looked at, really has nothing to do with this legislation. It would have been better to tack it onto the honourable member's discussion of a matter of public importance earlier today, or maybe discussed as another matter of public importance if he actually believed in it. It really has nothing to do with this legislation. I will be supporting the legislation and rejecting the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) in opposing the amendment that has been put by the shadow Minister for shipping and waterfront reform, the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp). As the honourable member for Throsby says, not only is it totally inappropriate, but it also completely overlooks the fact of 30 years of conservative government which did nothing for the waterfront.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can recall that when we came into government in 1983 a team of people in the stevedoring industry used to turn up around 7 o'clock in the morning. Apparently about 20 years ago they were told that once they had finished their work they could go home. As a result of new technology, these people finished their work about 11.30 in the morning and would go home. This situation resulted from a combination of conservative government apathy towards the stevedoring industry and bad management. One does not blame the workers for going home if they are told that they can go home at a certain time. This was the sort of problem that confronted this Government. We were certainly confronted with a need for enormous restructuring in the shipping and towing industries, in waterfront reform and in some of the enterprises at the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> Changes have occurred. In rejecting the amendment that has been moved by the honourable member for Gilmore, I point out that in shipping reform, for instance, since coming to office, this Government has consistently demonstrated its commitment to developing an efficient, competitive Australian shipping industry. It introduced measures in 1984 based on the Crawford Committee recommendations and in 1987 based on the Maritime Industry Development Committee report to encourage investment in new, technologically advanced ships with smaller crews. </PARA>
<PARA> In June 1989 the Government announced further initiatives to reduce crew numbers on existing ships as well as maintaining the drive towards lower crew numbers on new ships. So substantial progress has been made with 290 ratings having been removed from existing ships and a further reduction of 350 jobs having commenced with the progressive removal of the fourth deck officer and electricians on existing ships. Most of these reductions will occur by mid-1991. Twenty-one ships have been introduced using the multi-skilled crewing arrangements developed by the Maritime Industry Development Committee. A further six will be delivered by 1992. In all, one-third of the Australian fleet will have been modernised in the five-year period concluding in mid-1992. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, reforms agreed and in train will see the average crew size on Australian trading ships reduced to 21 in 1992, matching that on ships of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, to which the honourable member for Gilmore referred in his speech on the matter of public importance earlier today. This figure is down from 33 in 1983, a 36 per cent reduction under this Government. `It is not good enough', says the shadow Minister, speaking on behalf of a party which did nothing for 30 years. These substantial improvements in efficiency are being achieved in an atmosphere of industrial harmony-something the Opposition never achieved-with the full cooperation of unions and ship owners. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of towage industry reform, substantial progress has been made in implementing the Government's towage reform strategy announced in December 1989. The first phase involving an initial reduction in harbour tug crews was completed by the end of March 1990. Crew numbers were reduced from as many as eight in some cases essentially down to five. Further reductions to a maximum of four will occur progressively over the next 18 months as crew members complete training courses which began in January 1991. A major review of work practices and rostering arrangements at individual mainland ports has produced further labour productivity gains and has led to improved operational flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA> To date, some 110 seafarers have left the industry with an early retirement package. All told, reforms agreed and in train will result in a 25 per cent reduction in the towage labour force and cost savings approaching $20m per year. In addition to the operational reforms now taking place, the Government is looking at ways to increase competitive influences on the industry and to further improve efficiency. A range of options is being pursued in discussions with State governments, including those recommended by the Public Service Association's towage report. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) said earlier today, this is not always easy when there is a three tiered system. I have a simple solution, which is to phase out State governments and have two systems of government. We would have a lot more efficiency and we would save billions of dollars. Hundreds of millions of dollars would be saved in this industry alone. Of course that would be difficult, but at least when we are thinking about a new federalism we ought to be thinking about the fact that too many levels of government are involved in areas such as this industry. Let us hope that we consider the obvious-which is that Australia really needs only two systems of government-when we consider the practical, which is that we ought to have a lot more reforms when we are thinking about a new federalism. I compliment the Premiers and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on looking in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA> We have made progress in waterfront reform. With the reform program gaining momentum, the Government is confident that we will be achieving a timetable in the waterfront area. Agreements representing more than 80 per cent of the stevedoring work force are being implemented or are close to finalisation. As a result of the National Terminals Australia Ltd (NTAL) agreement, 300 surplus NTAL employees in Melbourne and Sydney left the industry recently. A joint drafting team is finalising Conaust Ltd's Container Terminals Australia Ltd (CTAL) enterprise agreement. This is likely to go to the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority (WIRA) for its assessment by the end of this month. The union-company agreement, which I understand will give rise to a further 60 early retirements, is currently being examined by WIRA to confirm that it meets the Government's guidelines for productivity and efficiency improvements. This shows that the process is working and, as a result of these developments, there can now be reasonable confidence that the reform timetable can be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> The last issue is the progress of Conaust's group of companies enterprise agreements. Again, we welcome the agreement reached in the Australian Industrial Relations Commission between Conaust and the stevedoring unions on the CTAL enterprise agreement for Sydney. The parties have established a drafting committee to finalise the details of the in-principle agreement with the aim of submitting the agreement to the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority by the end of this month. WIRA will then assess the agreement to ensure that it meets the Government's productivity, efficiency and reliability targets for the release of government redundancy funds. The CTAL agreement in Sydney paves the way for the resolution of outstanding issues in a large number of Conaust enterprise agreements in ports around the country, including Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Fremantle, Adelaide and Darwin. This will significantly increase the momentum of the waterfront reform process. </PARA>
<PARA> So when the honourable member for Gilmore talks about inefficiencies and inadequate reform in the Australian shipping industry placing a competitive disadvantage on Australian exporters, he is talking about something which can suitably be directed at his own side for its record over 30 years, not against this Government with its shipping and towage industry reforms, its waterfront reforms and the progress of the Conaust companies enterprise agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation really refers to operational functions which will be exercised by the safety and regulatory levy proposed in this Bill. This is extremely important. Just recently, the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) and I returned from a seven-week tour to Antarctica. We were confronted with some very severe threats to maritime safety, especially in one storm which we encountered off Heard Island when we lost cargo. At least 30 drums of fuel were lost overboard. Containers were moving from one side of the deck to the other, even though they had been properly inspected. There was great danger because of the severity of the storm where the ship was moving to 50 degrees from the vertical each side, time after time. Naturally this imposed huge strains, and of course there had to be smoking bans. The safety of people was paramount. I recall that at one stage during that storm I was floating around the radio room together with the radio operator, the first mate, a typewriter, a photocopier, a number of books and quite a large amount of paper. There was quite a considerable threat to safety. It is an extremely important issue. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HJ4">Mr SNOW</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. We do not need to have a by-election for Eden-Monaro or for Cowper as a result of that journey, thanks to the excellent work done by Conaust's person in charge on the ship, Tony Cousins, and by the captain and crew of the ship, and of course by the voyage leader of the Antarctic Division, Richard Mulligan. Certainly the storm severely tested their knowledge. What happened of course was a tribute to the safety and regulatory functions and standards that have been set not only in Australia but worldwide and, as a result of that, we were able to get back to port in Hobart in a fairly good condition, considering the dangers that we had been exposed to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The funding of the work being done by these services-and the industry agrees-should naturally be borne by the industry. It should cover the important functions carried out, including cargo inspections, which were done meticulously before we left; cargo handling gear inspections; seaworthiness and stability inspections, assessments and evaluations; and activities directed at the audit of delegated functions. So not only do we have the exemptions which the honourable member for Throsby referred to, but we have also covered work concerning navigational and operational safety; coordination of participation in international forums, which is particularly important-we, for instance, were on a German ship on that voyage that I mentioned; marine accident investigation and audit; seagoing qualifications work; marine council payment of fares; sitting fees; meeting expenses; marine personnel functions; operation of industry State and Commonwealth technical consultative and standards committees; and the need to review, draft and promulgate marine technical legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> So the legislation is important. The amendment moved by the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) is inappropriate, and I look forward to the support of the House for the passing of the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to respond to some of the issues raised by the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp), being the honourable member of the Opposition responsible for the carriage of this legislation. I thank him for the contribution that he has made to the debate and, in particular, I thank the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) for the way in which they demolished the points that had been made by the honourable member for Gilmore.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Gilmore moved an amendment the first words of which, of course, indicate the extent of any genuine level of concern the Opposition may have about this piece of legislation. The honourable member for Gilmore expressed it in this way:</PARA>
<PARA>whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading-</PARA>
<PARA>he then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>the House condemns the Government for its failure to reduce costs imposed by Government through inefficiencies and inadequate reform in the Australian shipping industry, placing a competitive disadvantage on Australian exporters.</PARA>
<PARA>Like the matter of public importance which was considered earlier today, an approach of that kind on the part of the honourable member for Gilmore is nothing less than incredible. </PARA>
<PARA> Probably the greatest and most significant contribution which this Government has made to the reduction of shipping costs-and, of course, it is only a relatively small proportion of our total trade which is carried on Australian ships-has been made in the area of ships' crewing. I know that the honourable member for Gilmore is sufficiently well informed about those changes not only to acknowledge them, but perhaps even to be some- times sufficiently gracious to give the Government some credit for doing something--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Bilney" NAMEID="RE4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr ROBERT BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But the honourable member for Gilmore says that one of the purposes of seeking to have all the words after `That' omitted is to condemn the Government for its failure to reduce costs. In fact, as the honourable member would know, the level of crewing costs on our ships has been reduced by-as the member for Eden-Monaro more than adequately indicated-something like over 30 per cent. Those reforms that have been agreed to and are now in train will see the average crew size on Australian trading ships reduced to 21 in 1992-that of course matches the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) ships-from the 33 that we inherited from the Opposition when it was in government. That is a 36 per cent reduction under this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am amazed at the unmitigated gall that honourable members opposite display so repeatedly. They really believe that the community and the electorate will let them get away with it. The electorate knows; everyone involved in the shipping industry knows; everyone involved in export and import in Australia knows; and everyone involved in shipping and moving freight around Australia's coast knows. So honourable members opposite--</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Wilson interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5A5">Mr ROBERT BROWN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I include the honourable member who interjects. They do themselves no credit by making claims of that kind, knowing that those people to whom they address their comments know that what Opposition members are saying is without substance. Those substantial improvements in efficiency are being achieved in an atmosphere of industrial harmony with the full cooperation of unions and shipowners. The unions and the shipowners, the two primary groups involved in this area, know that what I am saying is correct and that what honourable members opposite are saying is incorrect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government announced a three-year reform strategy in June 1989. That was based on the consensus report of the shipping reform task force. It was building, of course, on the progress which had earlier been made possible as a result of the Crawford report and the Maritime Industry Development Committee (MIDC) schemes which reduced crew levels on ships to 26 and then finally to 21. The latest strategy extends the reform process to existing ships and provides a blueprint for improving efficiency and competitiveness into the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA> In connection with the recrewing of existing ships, 290 ratings have been removed from ships, and a further reduction of 350 jobs has commenced of which 290 will take place by mid-1991. Of course, we do not do that simply to see jobs disappear. We pursue that with the support of the shipowners and the unions, and with their cooperation and their agreement. We pursue those objectives in order to build into the whole system of the question of Australian shipping a greater level, a greater degree, of efficiency than was there before. The reduced crews on the new ships through greater multi-skilling together with the integration of officer functions and the catering services rationalisation-elements of that kind and others-are all making their contribution towards the improvements that are taking place. I mention from 28 at June 1989 to 25 at present. </PARA>
<PARA> During the term of this Government, from 1983 until now and well into the nineties, those improvements have continued and are going to continue. That of course has also had the effect of encouraging investment in modern efficient ships by extending the MIDC incentives to 1997. Furthermore, in addition to applying to new ships, those capital encouragement programs will be extended to the modification of existing ships in order to make it possible for them to operate with smaller crews. Already there are 21 MIDC-type ships that have been introduced, with six more to be delivered by 1992, including 15 in new trades. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Eden-Monaro also said, one-third of the total fleet will be modernised by 1992. By that year, the reforms agreed to and in train will see the average crew size on Australian trading ships reduced to 21-again, that matches the OECD ships-from 33 in 1984, or a 36 per cent, almost a 40 per cent, reduction under this Government. That represents a reduction of almost 1,000 jobs in the shipping labour force, which is over a 20 per cent reduction-a reduction in crews on new ships to 17 or 18. The way, of course, has been opened for crews below this level-for example, of 14 to 16 on new ships from 1993 where this makes commercial sense. </PARA>
<PARA> These substantial improvements in efficiency are being achieved in an atmosphere of industrial harmony with the full cooperation, as I said before, of the unions and shipowners. As I said, if the honourable member for Gilmore, who has a responsibility for the Opposition in this area, were a little more gracious, he would have been more than willing to acknowledge that and to give credit to the Government. He claims he has done so, but the amendment he has moved in this chamber gives the lie to that type of claim. </PARA>
<PARA> I was interested to hear the honourable member's observation to the effect that while the Opposition supports full cost recovery this legislation will further burden the industry with costs. It will not further burden the industry with costs at all, nor does the industry for one moment believe that it will. The industry knows that this is a cost recovery exercise on the part of the Government and, while the Opposition claims that it supports cost recovery, it supports it while ever costs are not recovered. Again, the industry knows that. The Opposition damages its own credibility in connection with issues of this kind; and as the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) indicates, the Opposition does so in all areas of concern to it. </PARA>
<PARA> The shadow Minister referred particularly to the 15 per cent cap. He said no explanation had been given in either the explanatory memorandum or the second reading speech as to why the 15 per cent cap was being imposed. The explanatory memorandum, in referring to the restriction on an increase to a maximum of 15 per cent, stated:</PARA>
<PARA>This will ensure that the regulations are used only to provide increased revenue reasonably related to the overall provision of services to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA>In the second reading speech, in echoing that explanation, I indicated that after the phasing in period has been completed the annual rate of increase in the levy which may be effected by regulation will be limited to an absolute maximum of 15 per cent. I went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Any actual increase in the levy effected in this way will be related to reasonable cost increases. </PARA>
<PARA>We do not have to explain every time the nature of those regulatory provisions as far as legislation is concerned. That does not need to be spelt out and it does not need to be spelt out to someone like the honourable member for Gilmore who has been here for as long as he has. That 15 per cent is a limit on increases by way of regulation. It was chosen simply to represent a reasonable limit by this method of change as opposed to an amendment of the principal legislation. Even then, the regulations increasing the rate are disallowable by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> So if there is any inadequacy in the extent to which the Parliament is able to supervise and monitor those changes, it would reflect on the Opposition and those members of the Opposition who have a responsibility in this area, because they will be tabled in the Parliament. They are disallowable, and they are transparent. They will be on the table and, if necessary, they can be debated to the extent that members of the Opposition wish. If the Opposition finds that the industry, for some reason, believes that the percentage increase is not justified as a result of an increase in the level of services being offered, being provided, then the opportunity is available to the Opposition to make that point. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the implication or the suggestion may have been made by the honourable member for Gilmore that the cap should be limited perhaps to inflation, the consumer price index (CPI) or something. By adopting such an approach we would simply ensure that the present level of services remained at that same level into the future, because a provision which would allow the Authority to increase those charges only by the amount of the CPI would mean that all we are being allowed to do is cover the increasing nominal cost of providing those services. </PARA>
<PARA> The Authority is charged-and will be charged-with a commercial responsibility to operate in a commercial way. It will be subject to all of the usual constraints which would normally apply to operations of that kind. It will have a direct responsibility to the industry-because the industry will be funding it-not only with the navigational aids and safety regulations, but also with the general regulatory arrangements that are covered by this legislation. I have no doubt that there will be more than adequate avenues available to the industry to communicate its concerns to members of the Government, members of the bureaucracy and members of the Opposition in order to ensure that their concerns are more than adequately aired. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude with this remark: the genuineness of the Opposition's position concerning this is indicated by the fact that it has suggested that it does not choose to give the Bill a second reading. In fact the Opposition is supporting the Bill, and perhaps it might be more gracious next time to tell us that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity to follow on from the debate led by the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) and supported by the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) and the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow). I am pleased to see that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro was able to make it back. I have heard some of the stories; they will make good reading later on. He certainly experienced something unique and I think he is very lucky to have come back in one piece. It was an extraordinary story which he had to tell.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The amendment that the Opposition moved was designed not only to highlight the whole burden that this Government is placing on the users of navigational services that the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) provides, but also to broaden the debate out to enable us to cover a range of issues which relate to costs which governments impose upon shippers and upon those people who use shipping services, such as manufacturers, exporters and importers. The amendment dealt with a very wide range of subjects and therefore gave us the opportunity to speak in such a fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to take up a few of the points made by members of the Government in their comments a few moments ago. One of the things that they tend to forget is that one of the huge costs, one of the unforgivable costs which they impose upon Australian shippers, exporters and importers is the cost of cabotage. Cabotage is a tremendous burden on Australia's industries. We have only to look at some of the examples from the motor vehicle industry to understand just how expensive the maintenance of cabotage is. Cabotage, for those uninitiated, is the banning of all foreign flag competition on the Australian coastline. That ban has been extended illegally by the trade unions between Australia and New Zealand on the trans-Tasman route, so no foreign flag vessels may operate along the Australian coastal route or across the Tasman. So cabotage limits competition simply to Australian flags or New Zealand flags. </PARA>
<PARA> From the point of view of the motor vehicle industry, the cost of that ban is horrendous. We have examples that people like Ivan Deveson, the Chief Executive Officer of Nissan Australia, can put to us. Those examples indicate that, rather than use the existing and traditional shipping services to export cars from Australia to New Zealand, the industry is now prepared to airlift cars simply because it is more reliable and cheaper to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> If it is cheaper to send cars by air and if shipping services are more expensive and less reliable than air services, surely there must be something desperately wrong with Australian shipping services. Surely, with the high cost of operating aircraft and the limited space on board, it would be more expensive to send them by air; but it is not, simply because this Government imposes a burden on shippers, on the people who use shipping services, on exporters, importers, manufacturers and so on. That is called cabotage. Cabotage makes Australian shipping uncompetitive. It makes Australian manufacturers, exporters and traders who trade around Australia that much less competitive. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a number of examples of this-cars of course are not the sole example. I have some detailed analysis of sea freight rates for items such as raw sugar. It is interesting that in times past we have heard that Australia's sugar industry is losing sales to Western Australia because shipping rates from source countries such as Mexico and the Philippines to Western Australia are cheaper than shipping rates from Queensland to Western Australia. Why? The answer is cabotage. </PARA>
<PARA> The indicative costs of shipping raw sugar from Bundaberg to our domestic refineries are: from the discharge port, Sydney, using Australian flag vessels, $15.40; from Sydney using a foreign flag vessel, $12.80; from Melbourne using an Australian flag vessel, $17.70; from Melbourne using a foreign flag vessel, $14-a difference in that case of $3.70. If we ship raw sugar to New Zealand, the differences become even greater. The cost from the loading port of, say, Mackay in Queensland using an Australian-New Zealand flag vessel is $23. To use a foreign flag vessel, it costs $17 to $19. So we can very quickly see that the costs that this Government imposes on shippers and shipping users are horrendous because this Government will not address the cost of cabotage. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of shipping raw sugar from Australia to New Zealand, the cost can be as much as $5 per tonne extra in imposing Australian or New Zealand flag vessels on that route and banning foreign flag vessels. These are the sorts of examples which are added to further in the industry paper I have. For example, it says:</PARA>
<PARA>The steaming time from Australia to New Zealand is five days; from Thailand to New Zealand 15 days. The Queensland sugar industry has only a $4 per tonne competitive advantage over Thailand in supplying the New Zealand market yet it is one-third the distance away from the market. </PARA>
<PARA> For comparison, international market freight rates are:</PARA>
<PARA>Mackay to Japan ... </PARA>
<PARA>$A21.0 per tonne</PARA>
<PARA>Thailand to Japan . $A19.0 per tonne</PARA>
<PARA>It will be noted that</PARA>
<PARA> - The use of Australian flag vessels for Australian coastal voyages results in freight costs 20% to 30% higher than would be achievable using foreign flag vessels, and assuming the cabotage restrictions were removed.</PARA>
<PARA> - For shipments to New Zealand, the freight cost if Australian and New Zealand flag vessels are used is around 30% higher than for foreign flagged vessels. </PARA>
<PARA>There are a lot of specific, detailed examples of just how expensive the maintenance of cabotage is for Australian shipping users. This is what we must be concerned about. Other points were made by honourable gentlemen on the other side of the House in their contributions this afternoon. They made the point that the situation they took over in 1983 was all the result of our inadequacies during our years in government. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a number of points to make on that. Firstly, I take no responsibilities for any inadequacies we may or may not have had during our years in government because I was not here for them. In fact, just a few days ago it was eight years since this Government took office. We must remember that that is the case. The other thing we must remember is that, when we were in government in the late 1960s and early 1970s, `containerisation' came into Australia's ports. If my memory serves me correctly-and I am speaking off the top of my head-we had something in excess of 30,000 waterside workers in Australia prior to containerisation. A coalition government in control of the country at the time was able to negotiate and to reduce the numbers of waterside workers from 30,000-odd down to around 10,000-a cut of two-thirds in the number of waterside workers during the last years of the coalition Government prior to Whitlam coming to power. </PARA>
<PARA> In times past, we have done the right thing as far as waterside workers are concerned. We have reduced their numbers considerably when given the opportunity and the reason to do so. The opportunity and the reason to do so are much greater today, and that is why we must persist with reforms which reduce the cost of these services to shippers. For example, we must address the cost of privatising our port authorities. I know that, until recently, privatisation was a dirty word for the Labor Government; it has now adopted it as if it invented the word itself. But this is an area that the Government has not addressed. In none of its waterfront reforms has it addressed the high cost that is imposed upon Australia's shippers through inefficient port authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, Julian Manser, the former Chief Executive Officer of National Terminals (Australia) Ltd, said that it pays $55 charge per box that goes through Sydney to a State authority that provides no services in return. We must see a government prepared to address the high cost of port authority inefficiencies. The argument put forward by the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) this afternoon that the Government has not been able to persuade its State colleagues is a nonsense. There have been five State Labor governments during the term that the Hawke Government has been in office. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is not about addressing the true costs that are being imposed upon Australia's shipping industries; it is just further adding to them. That is why we propose this 15 per cent cap on the increase in the cost of services provided by AMSA. We want to see AMSA look inwards, reduce its operating costs, become more efficient and reduce the costs that it imposes on Australia's shipping industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) indicated that, apart from the question of inefficient port authorities-which he recognised of course is a responsibility essentially of State governments-his chief concern is the question of cabotage. People need to understand that that means reserving for the Australian flag vessels the movement of freight around Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We make no apology at all for the fact that we support in general the principle of cabotage, as does ever other member country of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development which has coastal shipping. We do not treat coastal shipping in any way differently from any other domestic industry. If the honourable member for Gilmore and the Opposition want to take their position to its logical conclusion, they would have nothing in place which prevents a policy being adopted in the future of bringing in guest companies with work forces made up of guest workers from any other countries of the world. That is really what they are proposing as far as cabotage is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been flexible in our interpretation of the principle of cabotage. Not only did we adopt the single voyage permits before to made it possible under certain circumstances for foreign flag vessels to fulfil the task of moving freight around Australia, but also we have extended permits when certain conditions are satisfied. We will not embrace the position which appears to be embraced by the Opposition. I would like the Opposition to spell out whether it would or would not maintain the principle of cabotage, even if adopted in some type of modified way?</PARA>
<PARA> The position that the Opposition has adopted so far is to indicate very clearly to us, to the shippers and to the shipping unions that it will abolish cabotage. The honourable member for Gilmore nods in agreement, so let the record show that the Opposition policy of abolishing cabotage is firm and confirmed. I have indicated the reason why we would maintain the one element of cost to which the Opposition refers. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of those particular examples were quite speculative. They were not even based on firm freight charges that may have been imposed. Some of those freight charges to which the honourable member for Gilmore drew attention were part of the freight charges that were being adopted by foreign shippers in promoting the possibility of being involved in the carriage of some of that freight. To base a case on freight charges linked to that kind of argument is most inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member also knows that, in general, one of the principal reasons there are those significant differentials in freight charges is the thickness of the trade that is involved. The trade to which the honourable member referred is very thin. It is like trying to compare a major wagon moving bulk minerals from one side of Australia to the other with sending through a few kilograms in a taxi and expecting the cost of the taxi to be competitive on a unit basis. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition understands this because it was faced with essentially the same problem in the past. The honourable member for Gilmore has denied any personal responsibility for it, but I do not think that is adequate because for a greater period of time since Federation the coalition has had the responsibility to do something about Australia being one of the great commercial nations of the world but one of the minor maritime nations. The coalition presided over that-not the honourable member for Gilmore. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Gilmore says that he will accept no personal responsibility for the inadequacies of former coalition governments, but some of his colleagues were here during that time. While he will not accept responsibility, some of those people who sit with him on the front bench and behind him on the back benches were here so they should accept some responsibility. While the honourable member for Gilmore may not have been here then, he is here now because his motivation is as theirs was; he is here because his commitment is as theirs was; he is here because his philosophy is as theirs was. If their motivation, commitment and philosophy were collectively inadequate to satisfactorily address and resolve those problems, I would submit to the honourable member for Gilmore that his are as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to respond to a couple of the points made by the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) in his address. Firstly, he claimed that the figures that I quoted from in the report, which indicate the difference in costs of services when provided by Australian flag vessels as opposed to foreign flag vessels, are unsubstantiated. I can assure the Minister that they are not unsubstantiated. They come from people who do not operate shipping lines, who do not have any intention to operate shipping lines, but who try to not only export these products across Australia but also transport them around Australia to other States where they are not grown.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point that the Minister made about these figures being unsubstantiated is wrong. Indeed, if the Minister needs any substantiation as to the high costs that cabotage imposes upon Australian shipping users, he need only go to the Industry Commission report that was brought down I think the year before last in which the Commission did an excellent job in highlighting the very high cost that cabotage places upon Australian shipping users. If my memory serves me correctly, the report says that the trans-Tasman route-because of the ban on foreign flag vessels-adds another 25 to 50 per cent to the cost of freighting goods from Australia to New Zealand. This is indisputable. All shipping companies, shippers and New Zealanders will confirm that these figures are mainly correct. So let us not try to right off the argument that cabotage is not a cost by simply saying that these figures which we put forward this afternoon are unsubstantiated. </PARA>
<PARA> Everybody understands that cabotage is a cost to Australia. When the Minister asked why we do not make an announcement that we are going to remove cabotage, I nodded my head and said that we are going to. In the 1990 election campaign, the Opposition went to the people with a policy which said that we would remove cabotage over a period of five years and wind it down over that period. I have reiterated this policy at every opportunity along the way. The Minister must remember that we make no bones about it, just as his own Government makes no bones about what it is going to do with the textiles, clothing and footwear industries, the motor vehicle industries and a whole host of other industries which enjoy other forms of protection. What this all boils down to is that cabotage is just another form of industry protection. </PARA>
<PARA> Tariffs provide protection for the motor vehicle industry. Cabotage provides protection for the Australian shipping industry. The same arguments that one can use to wind down tariff protection for the motor vehicle industry, for example, can be applied equally to removing cabotage from the Australian shipping industry. The bottom line is that protection for these types of industries does not work. If one looks at Australia's shipping industry over the last 10 years, one finds that the number of berths on Australian flag vessels has dropped by a third. If my memory serves me correctly, it has dropped from somewhere around 3,018 berths in 1980 to about 1,980 berths in 1990. So, despite protection, we have lost jobs in the Australian shipping industry. The same example, of course, applies to the motor vehicle industry. Despite the tremendous protection that the motor vehicle industry has had, jobs are being wound down in that industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us not kid ourselves; protection does not save jobs. Indeed, it hurts the creation and maintenance of jobs further downstream as the knock-on effect hurts other industries. The coalition looks at the issue of removing cabotage in the same light as we look at the issue of removing industry protection in other sectors of the economy. We see other matters being more important to try to help the industry, other than keeping cabotage in place. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason Australia's shipping industry is as inefficient as it is in comparison with international freight rates is the high cost of finance in Australia, the high cost of our taxation system and Australia's industrial relations arrangements. Those three things make Australian shipowners less competitive than their international counterparts. They all buy their ships from the same sources and they cost roughly the same. It is only when one gets down to interest rates, tax rates and industrial relations that one finds a difference between Australian shipowners and international shipowners. If the coalition is prepared to address those three areas of difference when we get into government, we will give Australian shipowners an opportunity to have an industry with viability rather than an industry that depends upon protection which ultimately will be removed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister pointed out that it was our philosophy-the one that I represent now-that caused these inefficiencies to be generated in the first instance. I would make the point that it is the Government's philosophy which has aided and abetted these inefficiencies right from the outset. The Australian Labor Party stems from the trade union movement, the Labor movement in Australia, which currently makes up 60 per cent of the body that decides the Party's policies. The Government cannot deny that. In fact, it is a cause of a great deal of debate within the Party at present. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Hinkler may be very proud of it, but in the process of being proud of it he must remember that if we are guilty-that is, I am guilty as I represent a certain philosophy-of the sins of the past as far as the waterfront is concerned, he also must be prepared to admit that he, as a person who represents a philosophy which is borne from the Labor movement, must bear the responsibility for the inefficiencies that the trade unions have imposed upon our shipping industry, our waterfront and other sectors of the Australian community. If one places blame upon who represents a particular philosophy, the Government's labour movement is very much responsible for the inefficiencies that we have today. So let us not kid ourselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Inefficiencies continue to abound. True it is that the Government has been able to bring down manning levels from the low 30s to the low 20s and, indeed, it will be going below those figures over the next couple of years. This Sunday I will be travelling on an Australian flag vessel from Brisbane to New Zealand-hopefully not to experience the same things that the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) experienced; I hope it will all be smooth seas and straight sailing. I think, if my memory serves me right, that the manning levels on board that vessel are in the high teens. This is something the Government can claim it has achieved. But, once again, let us not kid ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is a country that needs to trade with the rest of the world. We cannot compare ourselves with ourselves. Let us not say, `Isn't it whacko that we have been able to bring down our previous manning levels from 30 to 20 or to the high teens?'. What we must do is compare ourselves with the rest of the world because we have to be able to beat international competition and even the goal of working to average Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development levels of manning is insufficient. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia, because of its geographic position and because of its dependence upon trade and exports, must be a better maritime nation. In order to be better we must recognise the distances that we have, and therefore we must have the most efficient shipping services being offered to us as are available anywhere in the world. That is why we take the policies that we have to the people. We will continue to take these policies to the next election. I believe that during the next two years that remain between now and when the next election is scheduled people will appreciate that if we are to solve our economic problems we have to reduce our costs. One way to reduce our costs is to have a more efficient shipping industry and a more efficient waterfront. Those are the matters with which we propose to deal. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to my amendment, I would like to conclude by saying these costs being imposed upon Australian shippers and the Australian shipping industry are in fact a great burden to them. Julian Manser, until recently the chief executive of National Terminals (Australia) Ltd, a government owned stevedoring operation, one of the biggest stevedoring operators in Australia today, is the man who negotiated the first and only enterprise based agreement (EBA) through the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority (WIRA) process under this Government's waterfront reform program. About three weeks ago, Julian Manser said in a speech to a conference in Sydney-I forget its name-that despite the existence of the EBA, he could see no cost savings flowing through to the users of the waterfront, and to the shippers and so forth, simply because the costs of implementing the enterprise based agreement would absorb all of the gains to be had by the efficiencies created by it. </PARA>
<PARA> So what this all boils down to, what this whole amendment is based upon, is summed up in those words of Julian Manser-that despite the semblance of reform, at the end of the day the users of our waterfront, the users of our shipping industries do not benefit because costs are not likely to decrease. Until we focus our attention on reducing the costs to the users of our shipping industry and to the users of our waterfront, we will get nowhere. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Primary Industries Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 is an omnibus Bill to amend several Acts. Basically it changes the name of the Australian Meat and Livestock Research and Development Corporation and the Australian Dairy Industry Conference to the Australian Dairy Industry Council. It also introduces equal opportunity amendments for the Australian Dairy Corporation in the same manner as was approved for the Australian Wheat Board in past legislation. Other amendments in the Bill allow horticultural research and development to develop a more commercial role in research.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill also contains minor administrative amendments to the Australian Meat and Livestock Research and Development Corporation Act 1985 and consequential amendments to the Dairy Produce Act 1986, the Dairy Produce Levy (No.1) Act 1986, and the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation Act 1987. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Australian Meat and Livestock Research and Development Corporation Act change the name of the Australian Meat and Livestock Research and Development Corporation to the Meat Research Corporation. The decision to change the name came from the Corporation to prevent its being confused with the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation. Other amendments will confine the Government's commitment to match industry research funding to 0.5 per cent of the gross value of production. Because of the name changes, 15 other Acts will need to have consequential amendments made to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments to the Dairy Produce Act 1986 insert Government equal opportunity clauses. They are exactly the same as those approved for wheat in that there is a merit clause which says that:</PARA>
<PARA>Nothing in this Act requires anyone to do anything incompatible with the principle that employment matters should be dealt with on the basis of merit. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments also change the name of the Australian Dairy Industry Conference to the Australian Dairy Industry Council, and its executive council is to be known as its executive. These name changes require consequential amendments to the Dairy Produce Levy (No.1) Act 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Horticultural Research and Development Act 1987 also provide for changes to the commercial role, the administrative control, and the accountability of the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation. They are consistent with those contained in the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989, which sets the framework for all rural research. These amendments will allow the Corporation power to commercialise research and development, and to join in the formation of a company to acquire, hold and dispose of real and personal income. They also provide for any interest or activities relating to any such companies to be included in the Corporation's annual report. Other amendments will allow meetings to be held by electronic means rather than be face to face meetings. The shadow Minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), has held several consultations with appropriate industry bodies and organisations, and they are supportive of these new arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> In its impact, this legislation is not of major significance. However, the circumstances in which it is being debated, the tragic social and economic implications of the rural depression, must be of great concern to this Parliament. Whilst the debate in recent weeks has focused on the free trade and fair trade issues, and on the question of protection and tariffs, the horrendous impact of domestic costs has not received the attention it warrants. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EG4">Mr PETER FISHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It should have indeed, and I will speak about that shortly. I guess this House would expect me today, in a debate on a Bill relating to primary industries, to comment on the wheat statement made today by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin). I believe that statement was a great snub to one of our great rural industries-an industry that has been affected by the Gulf war, by the sanctions that have been imposed on Iraq and generally by corrupt international trading practices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yet the Government's attitude to this great wheat industry, which has done so much to bolster and to stabilise the Australian economy over the years, is to provide welfare as the only answer for the wheat industry's problems. It has done nothing to come to grips with the promise the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) made in relation to compensation as a result of the Gulf war when he said that no one sector of Australian agriculture or any other industry would be picked out and expected to bear the burden of that war. Yet this is exactly what the wheat industry is being asked to bear. </PARA>
<PARA> That statement contained some guarantee for borrowings on past pools. An amount of money in excess of $300m is probably owed to the Australian wheat growers. However, that is what the industry is owed, and it should be paid that money now so that the Australian wheat growing fraternity will have confidence to plant adequate crops this year to meet the markets that we have built up over the years-markets in which we have credibility and which are stable markets for the Australian wheat industry, but which will be lost if we fail to produce an adequate quantity of wheat in the coming season. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) referred to the impact of domestic costs on Australian primary industry. Some 60 per cent of the cause of reduced incomes to rural industries today relates directly to our own internal structures on interest rates, on inflation, on outdated work practices and on the sustained and continuing attack on the productive sector and its assets. I therefore direct my comments on this legislation to just one of those outrageous rorts which are destroying a vital sector of our economy. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the Government's decision to recover the total cost of export and domestic inspection charges. This has shocked farmers and has further eroded our abattoirs, which in the past have been our most significant value added industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Victorian meat industry is in a state of crisis. We are already suffering from the actions of the Victorian section of the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union (AMIEU), which has seen this State go from having the largest kill with many abattoirs operating to the worst State in Australia with a loss of 17,000 jobs in this industry. Wally Curran, the Victorian boss of the Union, has now admitted that he has not only seen but in fact has written a critique on the original Victorian Government submission to the Harrison meat inquiries, despite denials that over recent weeks have come out of the Premier's office. It is now known that 11 pages of that submission containing industry statistics showing the poor performance of the Victorian meat processing sector and the high level of disputes were deleted from the final Government submission. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Shame indeed! The fact that the meat industry itself has been the cause of a loss of so many thousands of jobs is something that the union members should take their leaders to task about. Thank goodness that the Victorian Minister for Labour, Mr Neil Pope, has had the courage to claim, and is correct in claiming, that the unions are running the Australian Labor Party (ALP) factions as they have obviously run ALP governments. It is now a case that if the AMIEU does not get you, the Commonwealth Meat Inspectors Association will. A Brooklyn abattoir in Victoria has been forced to close down the abattoir twice in a four-week period owing to members of the Meat Inspectors Association walking of the job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If abattoir operators are going to have to pay the full cost of meat inspection, surely they should have the right to hire and fire or the Government should at least invoke an essential services Act to keep these important works operating. Members of this union today are holding export abattoirs to ransom and over recent years the number of stock being killed and abattoir employment in Victoria have very seriously declined as farmers are sending their stock interstate to be slaughtered. The Meat Inspectors Association and some public servants in Canberra have been responsible for adding millions of dollars to meat exports costs by frustrating continual attempts to streamline the meat inspection service, and these people who are refusing to work in Victoria and in Queensland may soon have no work to do because the cost of inspection has, as a result of this Government, increased by some 68.37 per cent from last January. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EG4">Mr PETER FISHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The farmer and the consumer are paying 100 per cent of the inspection charges instead of the 60 per cent that originally existed under our previous coalition government. Of course, the worst aspect of the Government's increases is that the people paying the bill have absolutely no say and no input into the efficiency of this service. Indeed, many abattoir operators are being blackmailed by underworked inspectors who take turns to have days off.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Abattoir operators today are too frightened to speak out for fear of having their plants closed down or their meat condemned. Between the meat workers and the meat inspectors is it any wonder that the price of processing meat is so expensive? As an example, the cost of labour for slaughtering and processing beef in the United States of America is 10c a kilo; in Australia it is 45c per kilo. Even if our sheep today are given away, as they have been during the recent difficulties in the wool industry, it still costs about $13 a head to put them through an abattoir. The present inspection fees are so high that many abattoirs are having trouble paying their inspection bills, and this, of course, is being aggravated by the meat workers' strikes. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been advised that inspection services will be withdrawn unless these outstanding bills are paid, and this again will have an awful impact on the number of abattoirs. At this time of a crisis in the wool industry it is unbelievable that abattoirs have not been able to slaughter their usual number of sheep, let alone the additional numbers that have been required as a result of flock reduction programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The same position with inspection costs exists in many other industries. Inspection costs increased for grain, as an example, by up to 82.35 per cent. These increased costs come at a time when many grain growers are wondering whether their returns would even be enough to pay the planting costs for next season's crops. The cost of inspecting export grain has risen from 17c a tonne to 31c a tonne, and for bagged grain from 47c to 81c a tonne, which is an increase of almost 100 per cent. Containerised grain will cost $5 a tonne. In fact, today in some industries the cost of inspecting a container-load of some agricultural products is more than the value of the product itself in the container. </PARA>
<PARA> As an example, the cost of inspecting grain on ships will rise from $24 a half hour to $43 a half hour. In the dried fruit industry-an industry that is very important for the northern sector of my electorate, where we are fighting against cheap imports from Greece and Turkey-the Government is now going to charge $11 instead of $5 per quarter hour for an inspection, which is an increase of 120 per cent, and it will charge $100 per half hour in the field, an increase from $59 per half hour. </PARA>
<PARA> These Government increases could not have come at a worse time for the farming community, which is already on its knees. I call on the Government to delay the implementation of these charges to at least allow a more user accountable system to be established and to at least allow time for work practice reforms to take place in many of these industries that are so important to the future not just of rural Australia but also of the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Many inspectors who cost more today than the cost of employing a lawyer or a surgeon work only from Monday to Friday between the hours of 7.30 a.m. and 3.30 p.m., and after that they are on overtime. This is quite a ridiculous situation in regard to export and international trading arrangements today. Some companies would like two shifts a day. This would provide extra jobs for Australians and much needed export income, but because of the cost of inspectors who are on overtime rates this cannot be done. Surely it is time that the shackles were removed so that industry can obtain necessary supervision from reputable private independent companies-I understand for as low as $3.50 a tonne. Why should they be looking at prices of up to $20 per tonne from the Government service?</PARA>
<PARA> Export industries are today paying the total bill for the Australian inspection service and have absolutely no say in how it is run. The featherbedding of these services must stop, and they must be reminded that the major job is to help Australian exports and to keep plant and livestock diseases out. </PARA>
<PARA> With the national wage case currently under way, we are seeing industrial action again. Again we are seeing industrial action by the meatworkers at several export abattoirs as well as at our domestic plants. Union members have orchestrated several stoppages involving the Gilbertson group in the past fortnight; as well, there has been a stoppage at Wodonga Meats Pty Ltd over superannuation. A domestic abattoir at the country town of Stawell went on strike when employers would not agree to the accord. </PARA>
<PARA> While this strike action only further emphasises the poor state of industrial relations in this country, the stakes for our country have never been higher. The tragedy is that, while employers and the unions slug it out, the States and Australia lose valuable export dollars. A spokesman from the Gilbertson group, which handles about 35 per cent of the Victorian kill for export at its abattoirs at Kyle and Brooklyn, estimates that a day's stoppage costs Victoria $1m. In the last 2 1/4 years, the Gilbertson plants have had 124 days of industrial action, creating a total loss of income of about $100m. This has forced many export abattoirs to shut, some in my own electorate, and it has forced farmers to send their export livestock interstate to be slaughtered. The obvious consequences are enormous job losses for Victoria and an enormous impact on the domestic economy and the international economy of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In light of this serious situation affecting the Australian meat industry and the general economy of the nation, I move:</PARA>
<PARA>That all words after ``That'' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> ``whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House is of the opinion that the renaming of the Australian Meat and Livestock Research and Development Corporation to the Meat Research Corporation will be of minimal effect unless the Government undertakes:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again the Opposition has moved an amendment which is not appropriate to the legislation that we are talking about. On this occasion, when we are debating the Primary Industries Legislation Amendment Bill, the Opposition has attacked the Government for not taking action where the Opposition itself failed to take action over 30 years of government. Here in the meat industry we see a situation where the Opposition is condemning the Government for the inefficiency and exorbitant costs associated with the current meat inspection system and trying to ensure that industrial action by meatworkers does not continue to cause serious disruption to the operation of abattoirs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As in the case of waterfront industry, which we spoke about in a previous debate today, once again this Government has taken decisive action. The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) has taken over the role of inspection, a role which was carried out by the States, and it has been able to reduce staffing by 500 positions. AQIS is currently reviewing positions and procedures. Once again the Opposition is condemning the Government for actions which are being taken by this Government and which were not taken by the previous conservative administration. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government and the States have recognised the fact that it has been extremely costly to have a system operating with both Federal and State governments involved in a range of services, not least in the meat industry. There is a major review of the domestic meat industry under way. The honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher) has not acknowledged that, and it is certainly not acknowledged in the amendment that he has moved. In addition, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service has taken a range of actions which will ensure that there is much more efficiency within the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The second part of the amendment moved by the Opposition refers to the need to ensure that industrial action by meatworkers does not continue to cause serious disruption to the operation of abattoirs, once again failing to recognise the fact that an inquiry has been set up by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission under Commissioner Harrison to look at industrial relations in the meat industry. The people involved in that inquiry are looking at a range of issues, particularly the tally system, so important work is being done to reduce the costs that are occurring in the meat industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The reforms which have been undertaken were not fostered by the conservative parties. When they were in government, they failed to come up with policies, let alone actions, which would tackle anything like the issues that are being tackled by the Government in meat and horticultural inspection. I appreciate the point that has been made by the honourable member for Mallee that costs can be reduced; that is why AQIS is having a major review of domestic meat inspection and that is why in the area of industrial relations action is being taken under the Harrison inquiry into the meat industry. Important things are happening. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge also what the honourable member for Mallee has said about the difficulties in the areas that are mentioned under the legislation-the meat and livestock research and development area and the areas of dairy farming and horticulture. Government economic policies are not the only answer to the problems that exist in each of these areas. Profound changes have occurred throughout the world. Profound changes in eastern Europe have had a negative impact on the demand for wheat and wool, for instance. </PARA>
<PARA> But there is hope. Since the beginning of 1990, official interest rates have dropped about 6 per cent. This is gradually being reflected in general interest rates. The current inquiry into banks may make clear exactly the role being played by the Australian banking system in primary industry. A number of micro-economic reforms initiated by the Government will be of assistance to people in the country, including farmers. These include reforms such as the national rail freight initiative; reforms of the State and Federal governments, with their getting together on road transport; shipping reforms, which will be extremely important; and the resolution of industry enterprise agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> Reforms in train to see average crew sizes on Australian trading ships reduced substantially-down 36 per cent under this Government-will make an enormous difference to the viability of farming, because it will decrease export costs. Reforms in train in the towage industry will result in a 25 per cent reduction in the towage labour force and cost savings approaching $20m a year. </PARA>
<PARA> On the waterfront there are in train reforms which have been held to be long overdue by primary industries. Agreements representing over 80 per cent of the stevedoring work force are being implemented or are close to finalisation. As a result of the National Terminals (Australia) Ltd agreement, 300 surplus NTAL employees in Melbourne and Sydney have recently left the industry. The union agreement, which I understand will give rise to a further 60 early retirements, is currently being examined by the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority to confirm that it meets the Government's guidelines for productivity and efficiency improvements. </PARA>
<PARA> All these reforms are happening, whether they be in shipping, land transport, aviation or in broadcasting where people are able to get a better range of television services in country areas, particularly in south-eastern New South Wales, than they have ever had before. Micro-reforms are taking place in land transport. They are also taking place in the area of meat inspection, to which the honourable member for Mallee referred. I look forward to the reports from those reviews and the report from Commissioner Harrison on his examination of industrial relations in the meat industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Opposition has been opportunistic, knowing full well that the Government is proceeding with these inquiries and reviews and taking actions which ought to have been taken many years ago. I am confident that those reforms will give the `No' to the amendment that has been moved by the Opposition. I oppose the amendment. I support the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to join in this debate because I feel the Primary Industries Legislation Amendment Bill is rather important. I certainly want to support the amendment moved by the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher). At the same time, I congratulate him on many of the facts that he, as the acting opposition spokesman for primary industry, has brought forward. When we look at the amendment and the facts that were brought out, we fully appreciate that there are many problems within the primary industries today. I want to deal with a few of these because I think they are most important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill deals briefly with the changing of names in connection with research of the Australian Meat and Livestock Research and Development Corporation, the Dairy Produce Act and also the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation Act. These are minor matters so far as we are concerned, but they are important. Hidden behind these changes is the economic situation that confronts Australia today and the fact that our primary industries are the important industries that can get our economy back on track. I believe that the honourable member for Mallee has exposed only some of the problems that government can attend to in order to help overcome both our present economic difficulties and the world situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Part of the Bill before the House refers to equal opportunity for females within these corporate bodies. I do not think we oppose that in any way. It falls into line with legislation relating to other statutory authorities. But I take the opportunity to pay a tribute to those women who work within the primary industries. I think this gives us the opportunity to do that. I am speaking of the family farm that is basically the backbone of agriculture today in Australia, and I trust will be over many years ahead. If one goes on the farm today, one finds that the wife of the farmer-and even the children, the daughters and the sons, of the farmer-shares the responsibility of running and working a property. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been closely related to the dairy industry and the grazing industry. In my electorate, these are most important industries. If one goes onto a dairy farm today, one finds in most cases that the wife is in the bales in the morning and assisting with milking the cows in the afternoon. We often find her out getting the cows in, cultivating the ground, driving the tractor and doing all the jobs that are associated with the running of a farm. I pay tribute to the wives of the farmers of Australia who are playing an unnoticed but most important part in primary industries within this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Research programs are very important to the future of Australia. They are very important in relation to obtaining better quality commodities that are produced from our soil. I say `better commodities' simply because many of the products are marketed here domestically within Australia. Our people are always increasing their demands for better quality fruit and vegetables, grain, dairy products, beef and the like. Research assists us here at home, but also assists us in our export of the products. That is why I believe that research is so very important. </PARA>
<PARA> It is disappointing for me to see that for 15 years or so the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) has devoted less funding to research into primary industries, particularly matters affecting the farm. This is of concern to the industries themselves. I ask the Government to have a look at the next Budget to see whether its funds can be increased. The CSIRO is a very important research group within Australia. It studies various matters relating to noxious weeds, animals and the production per acre on the farm. We cannot at any time overlook the contribution that is made by private industry into research. I think that there is a responsibility on the Government to increase the funding of CSIRO and for us to support what it actually does. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn to horticulture for a moment. I went to Russia about 18 months ago. We went to a research farm which grew 1,000 different species of grapes, 450 of these species being seedless grapes. They grew about 400 different types of plums. Great research in some of these countries is being undertaken into production, not only to get extra quantity but also to improve the quality of the various types of plums both that housewives use for cooking purposes and that people eat, about which we are very concerned. Australia may be up with this type of research, but I do not believe that we are. We are an agricultural nation that is so very dependent on what we turn out of the soil.</PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate that primary industry is not fully recognised as it should be in this country. What support does government basically give to primary industry outside of research? As the honourable member for Mallee mentioned this afternoon, the Government has withdrawn the inspection fees on export beef at a period when producers in this country are at a worldwide disadvantage. There is no use us sending a delegation of Ministers, or even the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), overseas to talk to the United States of America or the European Economic Community when we have a situation where those countries have no intention in the long term to reduce support for their producers and consumers. This is the important fact to remember. We know that we are efficient upon the farm, but if there is a problem, as there is in the wheat industry at present-we are going through a crisis also in the wool industry-we are saying grudgingly that the Government has to come to its support; and it is in most of cases. The Opposition strongly supports this. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to belong to any political party-my own Party included-unless we are prepared to go out on a limb to support the various forms of primary industry that we have in Australia. It is very important to this economy and to our soil, which is what we live on-it is the lifeblood of our land. When we talk about research in relation to these Bills, only 0.05 per cent of research funding goes into the Bill about which we are talking. That is the maximum that the Government will contribute. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the other support that the Government gives to primary industry in this country. We get a rebate on diesel fuel, certainly, and there are other little forms of assistance. I hope that the wheat industry will receive a large form of assistance. But we should compare what is given in Australia with what is given in other countries which our farmers have to compete against. This is the important fact: our farmer is working his family farm and has his money tied up in the capital of that property-in his stock and plant-and he has to compete with other countries. So we had better be a little more open-minded than we are today with regard to the needs of our farmer and the important role that he plays so far as our national economy is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> When I say that I know that the leading farm organisations within Australia are saying, `We want to stand upon our own feet'. Can farmers stand upon their own feet when we go overseas and find that other countries are dumping and are supporting their farmers so much financially? I look across the floor at a couple of Government members-one has only just been to Washington-and I am sure that we all think alike on this matter. I am sure that we appreciate the importance of primary industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The farmer does not want a handout, but he wants to know that he has friends in government and opposition who are prepared to come to his aid if needs be. This is important. When I say `if needs be', I mean in comparison with other assistance which is granted throughout the world. If we are going to compete fairly, assistance has to be there for farmers. Many farmers today have bank mortgages, averaging, I think, about $220,000 each, and this has grown enormously in the last few years. </PARA>
<PARA> Our seasons have not been too bad recently; we have had a few good years. But what happens if this situation reverses? That is what we have to think about. We are not spending money on water resources within Australia in the way that we should because of the environmentalists around the place who are saying, `You must not disturb the ducks and the waterhens and all of these types of things which we see running around the property'. I have dams on my farm and I have plenty of ducks and waterhens. The ducks are eating the pasture but I will not shoot them and I do not want anybody else to shoot them. I protect them. But we have to look at our water resources program which is so tied to this legislation which we are discussing today. Between the Commonwealth and the States, the program amounts to virtually nil. What are we doing to assist a farmer to go in for water resource conservation on his own property? What taxation concessions are we giving farmers? I do not think we are giving them very much, if anything at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Farmers want to write off their costs over a period of years. We should allow farmers to say, `I want to write it off over one, two, three or five years'-whatever is of benefit to them. All of these factors could lead one to talk, I am sure, for hours about the need that we have today to support the farmer. As I have said, we do not disagree with the Bills before the House, but we take the opportunity to point out to the Government that there is a need to support the primary producer. There is a principle that is very closely involved with this need. Many farmers are in a desperate plight at present and if we can help them to produce extra, better quality commodities from each hectare of land, I believe that we will be achieving something. Undoubtedly, the people who are involved with primary industry in this land know where they are going. I do not think any of us in this House would deny that. I am pleased to support the amendment and I am pleased to support the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Primary Industries Legislation Amendment Bill contains a number of minor administrative amendments to existing legislation. Firstly, the amendments to the Australian Meat and Livestock Research and Development Corporation Act 1985 will change the name of the AMLRDC to the Meat Research Corporation. This Bill also brings the AMLRDC into line with other rural research and development bodies by confining the Government's commitment to match industry funding for the Corporation to 0.5 per cent of gross value of production.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are all aware of the great work done by the various research and development corporations. Work in an abattoir has always been messy, hard and dangerous. But things are about to change. The AMLRDC, as the funding body, has launched Fututech, an Australian semi-automated slaughtering system, which offers a more humane process for animals, better conditions for workers and savings of up to 30 per cent for the Australian meat industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Slaughtering technology has remained basically unchanged for 50 years. However, Fututech is expected to revolutionise the process completely. By reducing the amount of arduous, dirty work for the abattoir workers, Fututech will also contribute to savings in health and safety costs which amount to about $330m a year in the meat industry. Fututech has evolved from the research and development carried out by Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation staff at the CSIRO Meat Research Laboratory. It is a uniquely Australian invention and a good example of the way in which a research organisation and a funding body can pool their resources and attract considerable commercial interest. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) says that we need a clever country. Fututech shows what can be done with Australian research and funding in an industry which is not one of the trendy industries that we hear so much about but which has done more than its share over the years to assist the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> With the first phase of the liberalisation of the Japanese beef industry about to commence shortly, we need to have an efficient beef industry. Every piece of research and development that can give us that little competitive edge will help us get more beef into the Japanese market. For almost 20 years Japan has been Australia's second largest beef export market. During this period, Australian exporters have serviced a market which has been controlled by the Japanese Government. Australia's export performance to Japan over the last three years has been very encouraging and we are now well-placed and in a good position to take advantage of the opportunities that will arise in a more liberalised market. </PARA>
<PARA> While I concede that the tariff will phase down slowly over a period of time and that it is not as liberalised as we would like, it will still give consumers an opportunity to purchase Australian beef. I believe that, as more and more people take up that opportunity, pressure will be applied-through the consumer movement in countries such as Japan-to governments to liberalise more of their markets. Obviously, we stand to be beneficiaries if that is the case.</PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that liberalisation of the Japanese market, the termination of the tender system and the departure of the Japanese Livestock Industry Promotion Corporation as the central buying authority will bring about fundamental changes in marketing and distribution and consumption of beef in Japan. Future prospects depend very much upon the way in which suppliers in Australia and the trade in Japan work together to adjust quickly to the changing circumstances and capitalise on the growth prospects. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to touch briefly on the amendment to the Dairy Produce Act 1986. This amendment will include equal employment opportunity provisions in the Act and bring the Australian Dairy Corporation into line with existing Government policy on equal employment opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> I strongly concur with the introduction of equal employment opportunity. I have four ladies working in my electorate offices. Unfortunately, members of the National Party of Australia in my electorate are not so open minded. The Leader of the National Party in Monto, Jeff Seeney, recently attacked my press secretary in a number of rural newspapers calling her my `minder'. They will probably attack my cat and dog next. The Government is implementing its commitment to improve the status of women by paying attention to their needs and rights in its broader programs and by implementing specific initiatives for women. The International Labour Organisation Convention No. 111 binds the Australian Government to seek to eliminate discrimination on seven grounds-race, colour, sex, religion, political opinion, national extraction and social origin-in the areas of employment and occupation. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill further requires amendments to the Dairy Produce Act 1986 and to the Dairy Produce Levy (No. 1) Act 1986. The Australian Dairy Industry Conference Inc. has decided to change its name to the Australian Dairy Industry Council Incorporated. It has also decided that its executive council will in future be known as its executive. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation Act 1987 provide for minor changes to the commercial role, administrative controls and accountability of the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation (HRDC). The Corporation's functions and powers are amended to include the commercialisation and dissemination of research and development and the power to join in the formation of a company. Its ability to acquire, hold, and dispose of real and personal property is also extended. The objects of the HRDC include: to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of Australian horticultural industries; to develop awareness by these industries of the contribution that can be made by research and development; and to make more effective use of resources available for research and development. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) very competently covered the reasons why the Government does not support the amendment moved by the Deputy Leader of the National Party, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd). Basically, my view is that the amendment is irrelevant to the changing of the name. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make a few other points. By paying the 100 per cent and having a greater say in input, I believe that the industry will be able to better work towards more efficiency. This year there has been a discount of $27m with regard to meat inspection. With regard to the concern over industrial action in the meatworks, it is true that none of us want to see industrial action. That is why we have the accord and the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. In fact, as the honourable member for Eden-Monaro said, the Industrial Relations Commission is looking at the meat industry specifically to see whether there are ways in which we can reduce the amount of industrial disputation. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that we have to try at all times to get our costs down, providing that it is done on a fair basis. One of the previous speakers mentioned the difference in slaughter costs between the United States and Australia. While I mentioned earlier that the breakthrough in research and development in the slaughtering process will be not only innovative but also cost saving, I would like to make one point with regard to the difference in the costs of slaughter in the United States. In a lot of those meatworks in that country cheap and, in some instances, illegal Mexican labour is used. People are entitled to a sell their labour at a decent price. We have a civilised system in Australia through the accord and the Industrial Relations Commission whereby people do get a reasonable wage. On the same basis, people should be responsible when it comes to industrial disputation. As I have said, the Industrial Relations Commission is looking at ways of improving that. Consequently, I think that that is a positive step. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the big cost saving measures in the long haul-something which has not been tackled in the past because it has been too hard but which this Government is tackling-is waterfront reform, including shipping reform and an integrated transport system in cooperation with the six States. That is not something which will happen overnight or by waving a magic wand. If that were the case, it would have been achieved 10 or 20 years ago. Somebody would have just woken up one morning and said, `I have a great idea: let us fix the transport system in this country', and it would have been done. But that is not the case. It will take a long, hard slog to achieve it and we will achieve it only if we work together. </PARA>
<PARA> In the long term there will be massive savings-something like $4 billion-in a better integrated transport system in this country. It will mean massive savings for farmers in getting better efficiency from farm gate to market-whether it be domestic or overseas-by virtue of a better and more efficient waterfront and shipping industry. But it will be done only in consultation; it will not be achieved by belting someone over the head with a hammer. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to irrigation and better water, like the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr), I, as a farmer, understand some of the vagaries of drought and the consequences that it has for us. Just before I came into this House, I received word of some good news with regard to this issue. In my own area, a grant of $30,000 has been approved to improve the quality of the water supply at Mulgildie in the Monto shire. The money is provided under the Federal country towns water supply improvement program, COWSIP. The project is estimated to cost some $90,000. Mulgildie has suffered from a poor water supply for many years. Since 1985-86, the COWSIP program in Queensland has funded 11 projects valued at more than $22m with a total Commonwealth contribution of almost $8m. These projects have provided improved water supplies for more than 15,000 people. </PARA>
<PARA> I do concede that that is not what the honourable member for Lyons was talking about, but it is part of the whole program of supplying water for domestic use. It is a part of the whole process, but it is slightly different from what the honourable member for Lyons mentioned. I concede that in the driest continent on earth we do need to conserve and make optimum use of our water. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the great breakthroughs in the horticultural industry has been through the use of trickle irrigation which cuts down the amount of water needed by about a third. I am sure that in the electorate of the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher), who is at the table, drip irrigation is now being used, resulting in a massive conservation of water. It puts water into the right place. Instead of weeds being watered, only the plant is watered. With research and development these are ways in which we can overcome many of those problems. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would like to mention something that has been topical recently-the visit of the Australian delegation to Washington, led by the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Dr Blewett). Also in the delegation were the shadow Minister for trade and trade negotiations, the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer); the shadow Minister for primary industry, the honourable member for Murray; Mr John Allwright, the President of the National Farmers Federation; and I. Last Thursday and Friday we met with representatives of the United States Congress, the Senate and members of the Bush administration. I was very pleased with the bipartisan approach that was undertaken and the response and respect that we were shown. </PARA>
<PARA> While we recognised that the export enhancement program (EEP) will continue while the Europeans have their corrupted markets, we tried to convince Congress not to increase the cap. It is looking at another $475m. If there is an increase, either up to the full amount or part thereof, the EEP does not directly impact against our markets. We were all very pleased that Carla Hills, who is the ambassador and principal adviser to the President on international trade, gave an undertaking that all efforts will be made to ensure that EEP does not impact on our traditional markets. The Middle East in particular was one of those areas of concern. In the long haul, what is important and is recognised by all of us and the United States is that we need to have a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round so that we can start to break down those trade barriers that are affecting us through the European Community. No matter what we do in this country, the actions of overseas countries in dumping and subsidies will impact on our agriculture. Having such a small population, having to rely so heavily on export markets for our large major primary industries, we are always vulnerable to the vagaries of world markets. That is why we have been so forceful in the Cairns Group in efforts to get some commonsense into the trade sphere. </PARA>
<PARA> In the longer haul, I believe we will get some common sense into the trade sphere, but it is going to be hard work. Again, like the integrated transport system, it is not something that is going to happen overnight and it will only happen with a lot of goodwill. As I said, I was very pleased with the bipartisan approach and, of course, the very genuine approach of John Allwright, which enabled us to get that concession. Whilst it was not everything that some people may have wished for, I think it is a concession that farmers will be pleased with. But we recognise the serious effect that this trade war is having on our farmers. We made that very clear to Senator Richard Lugar and the seven or eight members of Congress we met with in that brief time, plus representatives of the United States State Department and members of the Bush administration. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I believe that by working together we can achieve a successful round in Brussels and, if we do, of course it is going to be beneficial in the long term. Nevertheless, we do recognise the impact that this is having now on our primary producers. In conclusion, I do oppose the amendment moved by the National Party and support the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will very briefly refer to some of the comments made by previous speakers in this debate. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) referred to the fact that the coalition did not acknowledge the inquiries that were taking place in the meat industry. Of course, he just happened to go out of the House at the time I did acknowledge those inquiries. I would like to remind him that I referred to the Harrison inquiry into industrial relations in the meat industry, but I was querying the credibility that the report of that inquiry will have, particularly when the union boss, Wally Curran-who was responsible for 17,000 job losses in the Victorian meat industry-wrote a critique on the Victorian Government's submission. As a result of his critique, I understand that some 11 pages have been withdrawn from that Victorian Government submission.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is correct. Wally Curran did have taken out of the report major statistics that referred to the industrial unrest in Victoria, the loss of jobs, and the cost to industry. I believe that the Harrison inquiry will now not have the sort of credibility that it should have. The real problem with the issues that we have been discussing in this Bill is that the Government of the honourable member for Eden-Monaro and the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) doubled meat inspection and all other inspection costs in the recent Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say to the honourable member for Hinkler that it is not true that by paying 100 per cent of inspection charges the industry will have a greater say. It would be a reasonable result if it did, but people in the meat industry today have absolutely no say in the industry. Employers have very little say; they have no ability to improve efficiencies in the inspection services. More importantly, they have no opportunity to correct some of the rorts that are taking place in the system. It is not the employers or the coalition belting the Australian meat industry over the head with a hammer-it is the employees' own union leader, and it is time those involved did something about it. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the comments that were made by the honourable member for Lyne (Mr Cowan) about the equal opportunity provisions in this Bill. He referred specifically to the role of women in agriculture and to the vital part that women play in the operation of family farms. He also referred to the horrendous burden many women are carrying at this particular time of crisis in many parts of the rural sector. </PARA>
<PARA> There are certain radical groups who see the current phenomenon of an increasing number of women in the work force as important. I would like to put a slightly different view, that in agriculture this is not a success story but an indication of the failure of our social and economic system where women who have been a partner in farming activities and who have formed a very valuable part of agricultural pursuits are working not to achieve some new career aim but because the chosen career that they took up with their partners is being destroyed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My claim of misrepresentation arises out of an article written by John O'Neill which appeared in various forms today in the Sydney Morning Herald and the Melbourne Age regarding the media ownership issue in Australia and, in particular, the ownership concentration accruing to Mr Murdoch's News Ltd.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My concern relates to certain remarks attributed in the article to the former Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, regarding my handling of amendments to the Trade Practices Act which he alleges were material to the later concentration of media ownership in Mr Murdoch's hands. In particular, Mr Fraser alleged that I had, in effect, misled his Cabinet in 1977 in proposing amendments to the merger provisions of the Act which undeniably watered down those provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> I reject that allegation attributed to Mr Fraser in the articles to which I have referred. I specifically reject his charge that the advice for which I had responsibility was inept, to use the word that has been quoted. I make the point that what I put to the Cabinet at that time and what was self-evident was that we were changing the merger provision to take out a requirement that the provision be triggered if there was a lessening of competition and replacing it with a requirement, which I think survives until today, that the provision is only triggered if a company is in a position analogous to a monopoly position, that is, in a position to control or dominate the market. </PARA>
<PARA> In amplification of my denial, I point out to the House that when the decision was taken I put out a release, as Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, dated 5 April 1977 which read:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Howard said that the amendment bill would significantly alter the merger provision of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> In future, the only mergers which would be covered by the Trade Practices Act would be those which involved a company already in a monopoly position-as defined by the Act-or would as a result of the merger be in that position. </PARA>
<PARA>I simply observe that it would pass strange that somebody would tell a Cabinet that there would be no material change, yet that very afternoon release a press statement acknowledging that it amounted to a significant change. The allegation that I misled that Cabinet is wrong and I deny it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The House is debating cognately, with the annual report of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, the first report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations and the Government response, and the ministerial statement on the Migration Legislation Review, which is essentially a statement of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) dated 9 May 1990. Obviously, this will be a wide ranging debate on matters relating to immigration. While I may constrain my own comments particularly to the review of migration legislation, honourable members may well range widely in this discussion. It seems to me there would be no proper basis to constrain such discussion, given the wide range of issues that are addressed in the Department's annual report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to use this opportunity, some 10 months after the Minister made his statement to this House, to review the document. When one looks at a document of this sort some 10 months later and when one is led to believe that it was to be a major statement on behalf of the Government, one sees how amazingly deficient the Government has been in consider- ation of the issues then raised. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, you may recall that the Government, with the assistance of the Opposition, saw passed in June 1989 amendments to the Migration Act, and subsequently regulations were introduced and operated from 19 December 1989 in order to give effect to that new legislative schema. What occurred was a rushed legislative outcome and one which was severely defective. When I have addressed this topic in the past I have said that, in my view, the Minister having said that it would be a trial and error approach, we have ended up with an approach more of error than trial. We had Minister Hand's apologia on behalf of the Government when he in fact said that the Government had decided to act upon a number of criticisms and voiced concerns and that he intended to make some changes to regulations immediately. Minister Hand, after the election, acknowledged that the program of law reform was severely flawed. </PARA>
<PARA> When I examine in detail the Minister's statement, which starts at page 136 of Hansard, I see that he gave a number of excuses. He said that the body of law under the amended legislation was `much compressed' in time. He also said:</PARA>
<PARA>This resulted in a lack of clarity, and, in a number of cases, unintended consequences. </PARA>
<PARA>If one was looking for a lexicon of excuses for legislative failure, this speech contained it. He then went on to say that as Senator Robert Ray, his predecessor, had said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it would be necessary continually to monitor the regulations and amend them as problems emerged. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to add that the Government had basic objectives and that they were being met, particularly the objective of keeping a non-discriminatory migration program in place. He also commented on maintaining an appropriate balance, introducing certainty into the law but also ensuring that adequate discretion was maintained to enable the Government `to respond sensitively and with compassion when individual cases arise that require special consideration'. </PARA>
<PARA> If one reads this speech, as I have done, one will come to the view that the matter upon which I addressed this Parliament at considerable length-and that was that a schema be put in place that ensured some continued capacity to deal with matters by way of discretion-was being addressed. One will be very surprised to note, as I have been, that there has in the intervening period been only one occasion upon which the Minister has, pursuant to section 137 of the Migration Act, tabled in this Parliament a statement wherein he exercised his power. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not intend to canvass at length the particular circumstances in which the Minister did exercise that power. I have reviewed the report that he gave to the Parliament. What is so interesting is that this was the first and only case in which I am aware of the Minister having actually exercised discretion under the Act. He tabled that statement in the Parliament in the last sitting weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the Minister foreshadowed in his ministerial statement that he intended to make a number of significant changes. He said that they would be undertaken in three phases. If we look at those three phases, we find in relation to the first phase that he said that there would be immediate changes including a number of technical changes which have minor policy and procedural implications. He also said that he would reinstate the Immigration Review Tribunal, and those decisions have been largely taken. </PARA>
<PARA> But when we go on we find that the Minister foreshadowed a Bill to ensure that his discretion to make a decision after the first tier could be exercised only at the request of the applicant and he outlined specific legislative changes; yet we have not seen those proposals. He went on to say that he intended to:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . report to Parliament every six months on any intervention at any decision-making stage in respect of applications for visas and entry permits. </PARA>
<PARA>He added:</PARA>
<PARA> My reporting will cover an analysis and cataloguing of cases determined by me and will contain my conclusions about possible needs to amend existing regulations or make new regulations. </PARA>
<PARA>As I have indicated, the Minister has brought forward one case in all that time where he has exercised such discretion. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> My reporting will also include Immigration Review Tribunal comments about the impact of the regulations in the light of the cases that come before them. </PARA>
<PARA>There was one matter in which the Immigration Review Tribunal over a period has indicated that the legislative process was flawed, and that was in relation to concessional migrant entry cases wherein the spouse of any applicant was always assessed against the points score in order to determine whether a case would be successful or otherwise and that, in many cases, would be an important factor. </PARA>
<PARA> It was a longstanding policy of both this Government and former governments to deal with those matters in that way. When these regulations were introduced, that schema was not put in place. So the Tribunal said that, where these cases arose, it considered that the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs could not consider them on the basis of considering both parties to a marriage when looking at the points score because it would be illegal to do so. There was no report on that matter to the Parliament by the Minister. The Minister merely implemented regulations for change-and yet he promised on 9 May that he would be making such regular reports to this House. The Minister went on:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I will reduce the complexity of the application procedures by collapsing the current 97 entry permit classes down to a possible seven . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He would not have done that without advice that it was possible, yet we have not seen that statement implemented by the Minister. The Minister then went on to talk about the second and third phases. I suggest that, if the current timetable is being followed, there is little expectation that the second and third phases, which would involve a general redrafting of the regulations, are likely to be implemented at all quickly-and that is a matter of very considerable concern. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister also indicated that he would be dealing promptly with refugee and humanitarian cases. To date, we have not seen any legislative changes; nor have we seen from this Minister any statement as to the way in which the Government intends to deal in a comprehensive way with this difficult and ongoing situation. We have a backlog of 7,000 applications, yet to date there have been no new regulations introduced to deal with the consideration of refugee issues and humanitarian issues which the Minister has foreshadowed in subsequent statements. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a large number of grants of resident status after entry applications. It is possible that these cases and the refugee cases will significantly distort the program for migration entry. There are news reports appearing daily in which expectations are being built up about the way that the refugee program will be dealt with, and yet we have not seen any announcement from this Minister as to how these problems are likely to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> Last Friday in the Sydney Morning Herald there was the report: `Govt to let in up to 14,000 refugees from Gulf War'. In that article, by-lined by Mr Col Allison, certain statements were sourced to an official of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, Jenny Hoskin. I do not know the young lady, but it is recorded that, about refugees, she said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there were thousands of them in camps in Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> ``There are others still on the move and in due course those in fear of their lives, if forced to return to Iraq, will be processed by the UN High Commissioner for Refugees . . . </PARA>
<PARA>She went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> However, we are already geared up for immigration emergencies and have allocated extra places, 12,000 to 14,000 of them, for Middle Eastern people as a result of the Gulf War. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement caused considerable alarm in Sydney with the matter being raised frequently on talkback radio last weekend. Yet there has been no clarification by the Minister as to the portent of that statement. It seems to me that it is probably a flawed statement that has been made in this instance.</PARA>
<PARA> I cannot imagine that the Government, without any formal announcement, would be doubling the number of refugee cases that we are likely to have to take. Australia had some 11,000 places dealt with in the Government's announced statement last year, and in the material given to the parliamentary committee the program composition was broken down further. Some 4,100 were to be Indo-Chinese; 1,800 were to be Latin-American; from eastern Europe there were to be 300; from the Middle East-taking out the Afghan people and the Lebanese concession-a total of 300; from Africa, 200; and there was also a global unallocated program amongst it. So effectively from some 300 places for refugees from the Middle East we have this speculation that the Government has already allocated an extra 12,000 to 14,000 places for Middle Eastern people as a result of the Gulf war. A matter of that sort is of very considerable moment. </PARA>
<PARA> I issued a statement last week seeking clarification from the Minister on this matter, but no clarification has been forthcoming. We have this difficult ongoing situation with this Government and this Minister wherein important decisions remain unannounced. We have the Government's statement on what progress it intended to make in the area of regulatory reform and on that matter it has failed to follow its own program. These are important issues of ministerial performance. They warrant a full and detailed statement to this House by the Minister. I certainly hope that at an appropriate time in the context of this debate the Minister will intervene and endeavour to ensure that the House is informed of these matters and that a full and complete statement will fully clarify the issue of any large expansion of Middle Eastern refugee places. </PARA>
<PARA> If there is a proper case to be made out the Opposition would, of course, regard it as being an appropriate response. But the people of Australia are entitled to know the basis upon which the Government comes to such a view, if that is what it has done. To date we have not heard any announcement, or been acquainted with any reasons, as to why the Government should have made such a decision. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, we have been discussing three documents here-the review of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations, Illegal entrants in Australia: Balancing control and compassion, and the statement on review of migration legislation of the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before the dinner break we heard from the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), the shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, about these three major documents. All we got from the shadow Minister were nitpicking little points which really had very little to do with anything at all, when I must say I thought that a large number of issues on immigration could have been raised. I am really surprised that such an opportunity was allowed to slip by the shadow Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> On one of the points he raised he was factually wrong. He said that the Minister had not done his duty because he had only presented one case to the Parliament in relation to his powers under the new Act. But he did not bother to check how many cases the Minister had had or had dealt with under the new Act. The fact is that very few cases have gone through the whole process under the new Act, and-surprise, surprise-only one case has gone to the Minister and been decided upon. Therefore it was ludicrous to claim that the Minister was not doing his duty because he had only reported on one case in relation to the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather than waste the time of the Parliament with this nitpicking as the shadow Minister did, I intend to bring to the attention of honourable members the way in which a number of issues have been dealt with, in my view in a very commendable way, by the Minister through the processes of these reports, and to indicate the way forward in terms of migration legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations, the first thing that need to be said is this: although the report was criticised at the time as having a number of points of view-which occasionally happens in parliamentary committees, this being a democracy-the fact is that the Minister adopted most, although not all, of the recommendations of the majority view. Where he differed from the majority view he made it perfectly clear. The outcome in terms of illegal entrants has been what the report was trying to achieve in the first place-a balance of control and compassion. The new regulations on illegal entrants have achieved that result; there is now a balance between control and compassion in relation to the way in which illegal entrants are treated in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has made it clear that those people who think that they can cheat and get round the system have another think coming. More resources have been put into control and under this Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs we are taking control seriously. At the same time the genuine cases, the compassionate cases, are able to go to the Minister, through various mechanisms, to be dealt with. So we have achieved a positive result in what was a complex and difficult issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the processes-firstly, the parliamentary Committee, followed by the Minister's discussions with the Caucus committee, and the decisions that finally resulted-were the proper processes, and ones of which we can be reasonably proud in terms of dealing with this area. An index of how successful this has been is the way in which these provisions have been widely accepted, not only in the broad community, but also within ethnic communities, which have recognised that we have to do something about control, whilst at the same time recognising that we have put into place mechanisms to deal with the need for compassion. So it is important that we recognise that this is what has taken place in this particular area. </PARA>
<PARA> The parliamentary Committee did not stop there. Because the Minister requested it, it went on to make a set of interim recommendations in relation to the question of marriage. The full report on marriage will be presented to this Parliament shortly. The Committee put forward recommendations in relation to marriage and change of status on the basis of marriage. Again, this is one of the most difficult areas in immigration. People have a right to marry and stay in Australia if in fact the marriage is genuine-even when they are visitors. </PARA>
<PARA> One simple solution that was given to us was the idea that everyone should be forced to go back overseas and reapply, even when he or she had married an Australian. We did not think that was in accordance with principles of social justice, so we put into place a recommendation which has been adjusted from the recommendations of the Committee. We suggested a two-year rule for de factos, and that has now been extended to marriages as well. Thus we have now introduced two-year conditional entry. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst referring to this, I have to say that I am concerned about the fact that this matter has not been sufficiently publicised by the media. There are still insufficient numbers of people in the community aware of the fact that we have introduced the two-year rule. There are still visitors coming to Australia who believe that by marrying an Australian they will automatically get permanent residence. This is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation is as follows: if a person comes to Australia on a visitor's visa and marries an Australian, that person will be able to apply for a change of status. However, in the first instance the status that will be granted to that person will be conditional entry for two years. Then two criteria must be met. Only if the marriage lasts for those two years, and if, in the intervening period, the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs has made a judgment that the marriage is a genuine marriage, will that person be able to stay in Australia permanently, and apply for permanent residence after the two years has elapsed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that the community knows more about this, because visitors to Australia still go to the offices of members of Parliament and say, `I have married an Australian, and I want to stay here permanently'. We have to make it clear to them that that is no longer an automatic path, that they must meet those two provisions-that of genuineness, and that of the two-year requirement. This matter ought to be more widely disseminated in the community so that people do not believe that the situation which existed before, namely, permanent residency through sham marriages, will continue in the future. This whole process has been put into place to ensure that these sham marriages will not continue to be used. I hope that we will be able to publicise this matter more widely. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the determinations that were made on the basis of consultations between the Minister, the Joint Committee on Migration Regulations and the Caucus committee, have resulted in what is a fair system. Of significance is the fact that a category of conditional entry has been introduced into the system, something I have been talking about for some time. Conditional entry is a very important category because we may be able to use it to solve some other, more difficult problems in the area of immigration. It is a common category in other countries, but it had not existed in our immigration system until these arrangements were put into place. </PARA>
<PARA> The shadow Minister has talked about how the Minister promised legislation, yet was not able to bring forward that legislation. There are problems with legislative timetables. The honourable member for Dundas would not be aware of that problem. There are other problems associated with legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that there has been no hold-up in implementing any of the programs. All of the programs announced by the Minister have been implemented, notwithstanding that the necessary legislation has not yet been passed. The shadow Minister should be pleased to know that shortly the Government will introduce legislation aimed at meeting the requirements he outlined. I hope the shadow Minister will actually debate the questions when that legislation is introduced rather than continue with the quibbles he gave during his contribution to the debate earlier today. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to bring to the attention of the House some of the problems which the Department has had to face on the introduction of the new regulations. The Department has had to come to grips with a tremendous number of changes in the past 15 months. I cite as examples the introduction of new regulations, new ways of processing applications, changes to the regulations, and new ways of dealing with applications. All of these processes are difficult. </PARA>
<PARA> While there are individuals in some sections of the Department who may not have treated people as well as they ought to have done, in general, given the enormous number of changes that have occurred in the administration of immigration in this country in the past 15 months, the Department has done a good job. The shadow Minister should have at least acknowledged the excellent job most officers of the Department have done under those difficult pressures.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Dundas never blames a department when he can blame a Minister. I am suggesting that some of the blame he has thrown on the Minister is really quite unfair and unjustified. The Minister has dealt with some of the most ticklish questions in immigration, such as illegal immigrants and the marriage question, and he will shortly announce changes to the humanitarian and refugee system for refugees and persons in Australia on visitors visas and who wish to seek humanitarian status. Given all of those tremendous changes that have occurred in an atmosphere in which we have tried to achieve a bipartisan approach to immigration, the contribution by the honourable member for Dundas was less than generous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We should examine how the Opposition, the Government and the Australian Democrats in the other place ought to work to ensure the continuation of the immigration program against the attacks mounted in the current atmosphere. Last year the Department assisted in organising the national conference of the Bureau of Immigration Research, and the Department ought to be congratulated on doing that. It was an excellent conference that brought together academics, politicians, ethnic community leaders and many other people involved in the immigration processes. They all got together and discussed and debated whether, for example, immigration presents problems for the environment, the economy and social cohesion or because of our multicultural policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, that conference was a success in a number of ways. The academic research illustrates that many of the arguments presented by people either speaking to a public audience or writing in newspapers against immigration are fallacious. That does not mean that those arguments do not continue. One still hears people say, `We do not want immigrants because they take our jobs' and make other such false claims. Parliament should ensure unity between the Government, the Opposition and the Australian Democrats to convince those sectors of the community that have doubts about immigration that immigration is important because of the contribution it can make towards the development of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I am happy to have been speaking in support of these reports. I congratulate the Department upon what has been a difficult year and for the way in which it has handled it. I congratulate the Minister on the way he has handled all of these issues. I hope we can deal with the rest of the issues in the near future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I might pay the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) a compliment, I must say that at least he could never be excused of understating his case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The whole question of immigration is a very important one to the Australian people. In fact, research suggests that it is not too far behind the economy in terms of the level of public concern about the Government's handling of the issue. The concern most often expressed is that the level of migration is either too high or is biased towards one particular ethnic group or another. As the honourable member for Calwell pointed out, it is hard to dispute or refute the economic arguments put forward in support of the contention that Australia is currently underpopulated. The vast majority of economists take the view that Australia needs a significant immigration program to have a growth in population, which will contribute positively towards future living standards. Most economists also note in this context the effect that the ageing population is having as well. So there is, quite rightly, considerable support for a continuing high level of immigration. </PARA>
<PARA> It is pertinent to note that Australia currently has the highest immigration intake per capita in the world. In 1988-89 our immigration intake was 145,316 people, which is a rate of 8.7 per thousand. This rate dropped a little to 7.1 in 1989-90. The United States of America, which has a very high aggregate intake, has a per capita intake significantly below that of Australia. The rate per thousand in the United States of America in 1988 was just 2.1, which is only about one quarter of the level of migration to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's policy reflects the fact that Australia's population needs to grow in order to positively enhance living standards. Assuming that environmental concerns about sustainable development can be met, most Australians agree that the population does need to grow. The extent to which it needs to grow is a matter of considerable conjecture. Perhaps when the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley) speaks after me, he will espouse publicly some of the theories on population growth that he and I have discussed privately on other occasions. I will not put him too much on the spot, but I challenge him to give us his impressions on the sort of population that Australia should have. </PARA>
<PARA> Ultimately, if we were to have a choice most Australians would come down in favour of population growth coming from the expansion of existing Australian families. Recently I spoke on this in the House, when I said that there were many positive disincentives to families to have children today, which was most unfortunate; that we should be looking at encouraging families to have more children; and that our economic policies should be aimed at doing that. The plain fact is that in the current economic climate it is very difficult for people to choose to have more families when there is strong pressure exerted on both the husband and wife to actually go out and work just to maintain the lifestyles to which they are accustomed. </PARA>
<PARA> The item that I want to concentrate on tonight is the 1989-90 annual report of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. It is called Review '90. I enjoyed reading this report. Since I became a member of parliament, I have had extensive dealings with the Department on a local level. Almost 12 months ago now it established a branch office in Southport, on the Gold Coast. We enjoy a very good working relationship with that office and I would like to compliment particularly the manager of that office, Mr John Cameron, for the cooperation we receive from him when we ask for it. I also want to say publicly that I have found the Queensland manager, Mr Dario Castello, to be very helpful on the occasions we have been in contact with him, and I congratulate him on his relocation to Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) was interjecting when the honourable member for Calwell was speaking. We do not have a problem with the Department. On balance, in my dealings with the Department so far, I would have to say it is probably one of the more efficient Federal bureaucracies. But, as the honourable member for Dundas was saying, we do have some problems with the Government's handling of this matter, and particularly with the handling of the portfolio by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand). </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the effect that it has on my electorate, I was particularly interested in the report's dealings with what it calls `overstayers'. It is rather like the reference in the report to `innocent illegals', which the honourable member for Calwell was talking about. I take `overstayers' to be some sort of euphemism for illegal immigrants. By virtue of my electorate's nature-it is an attractive environment and tourist area, with a very fluid population-it has more than its share of these so-called overstayers. These illegal immigrants take jobs, and jobs are pretty scarce in most places around Australia at the moment, and I suspect that very few of these illegal immigrants actually pay taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> The report estimates that at 30 April 1990 there were 90,000 overstayers, or illegals, which represents a very substantial increase-50 per cent-over the July 1989 estimate. But some estimates have gone even beyond this. A suggestion is being floated around that the number of illegal immigrants may now be closer to 150,000. It is rather staggering to think that in the eight months between July 1989 and April 1990 the number of student overstayers increased by 78 per cent, temporary residents by 40 per cent and visitors by 32 per cent. Some 68 per cent of those people had been overstaying for more than six months. The main countries of citizenship for the overstayer population were the United Kingdom, Malaysia, Fiji, Indonesia, the United States, the Philippines, China, Korea and Thailand. </PARA>
<PARA> The Immigration Department has made considerable efforts to detect these illegal immigrants, but in a big country like Australia it is pretty hard to find them most of the time. I have often felt that the Immigration Department was running around trying to plug leaks, only to find that each time it managed to plug a leak in one spot a leak sprang up in another spot. We need a concerted effort on the part of the Government in this area. I do not entirely accept the assurances of the honourable member for Calwell that we have yet reached anything like the optimum in terms of an effort to overcome this problem in that most of the evidence points to the fact that the number of illegals or overstayers is still growing. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Government's response to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations entitled Illegal entrants in Australia: Balancing control and compassion, which the honourable member for Calwell spoke about, the Government has acknowledged that the increased number of illegal immigrants is a serious problem which must be met with firm and resolute action. We in the Opposition entirely agree with that, and agree further with the response when it states:</PARA>
<PARA>The challenge is not to reach or maintain a balance. Illegal entrants have broken Australia's immigration law; most have done so deliberately in the ill-advised expectation that at the end of the day they will be permitted to stay. Any perception that such a prize will continue as a reward for law-breaking and that chances of being able to remain improve with length of overstay is misplaced. </PARA>
<PARA>This is one of our concerns about the temporary entry visas which have been given to the People's Republic of China students. There is a very real chance that they will be given some indication that, given time and over time, they will have a greater chance of being able to stay. Our position on this is very clear: come the end of another three years, unless on a case by case basis they can put forward reasons why they ought to be able to stay or if in the meantime they have not qualified, they will have to go back. There is no sense, at least from our point of view, that the length of time that they are being given here is the thin edge of the wedge. That needs to be made perfectly clear. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's proposals that illegal entrants whose applications to stay are unsuccessful should not face any period of exclusion from Australia are also, as far as I am concerned, quite unacceptable. That cannot be allowed to happen. I believe that the honourable member for Dundas was quite instrumental in the fact that five of the nine active members of the Committee dissented from aspects of its report, and this is also a telling factor to be kept in mind when reviewing its recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime, we have to deal with the problem of stopping illegal immigrants from working here. This has been a real concern of mine for some time, because it is a particular problem for the tourism sector with which my electorate is concerned. I said in this place last year that there are several methods that I believe we can use to stop illegals working in Australia if we are really serious about it. </PARA>
<PARA> The first thing that we should be doing is denying illegal immigrants access to a tax file number. It is fairly obvious to anyone who looks into it that people can in fact access tax file numbers without a great deal of difficulty. The problem, it seems to me, is with the actual application form, which has several deficiencies. The documents that one has to present when one applies for a tax file number are easy to obtain. That is a problem that I believe needs to be addressed seriously by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Another factor that I raised was that the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) procedures could be tightened up to make sure that those using the facilities are legal residents or Australian citizens. But to my knowledge there has been no serious attempt by the staff at the CES to ascertain that the people using their services are in those categories. Another thing that illegals can get easy access to, and which opens all sorts of other doors, is a driver's licence. I believe-and Queensland is going down this track-licences should be issued only to those who are legal residents or citizens or are entitled to have them. </PARA>
<PARA> It is vital that simple measures be taken to ensure that illegal immigrants cannot find employment easily. When I spoke on the tabling of the report of the Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations, I went into this matter in detail. I wrote to the Minister and he has responded positively in some respects. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe another thing that we should be doing in this matter is launching a public awareness campaign aimed at pointing out to the community the problem that we have with illegal immigrants and making people aware of the implications of harbouring or aiding and abetting these people. That should be extended to employers, who should be made perfectly aware of the fact that, while it is not obligatory to ask whether an employee is working legally, they are in effect aiding an illegal act by employing them. Whether this public awareness campaign takes the form of a television campaign or some other form, we need to tell people at large about the seriousness of the situation that is created by overstayers and raise the public's awareness of the issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I could go on at some length about the Government's performance of the handling of immigration. I would have gone on to cite Imam Sheikh Hilaly's situation as an example of the bad handling of this particular matter, but I will not be able to because I will run out of time. I mention finally that the annual report deals with the immigration records and information system, IRIS, a computerised visa processing facility, and the travel immigration processing system, TRIPS, which is a new entry control system for airports. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me great pleasure to speak on the 1989-90 annual report of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. I worked as a consultant to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs from 1985 to 1987. During that time the Government adopted two changes to its general policy which are reflected in this annual report. First, it determined that the previous policy of cutting immigration intake when the Australian economy entered a cyclical downturn was inappropriate. In the past, such cuts had been made to the program in the belief that migrants took jobs and made unemployment worse. The cuts made to migration programs during the cyclical downturns in 1961, 1974 and 1982 may have made these downturns even worse. In any case, it was felt that a buoyant migration program, comprising people who are on average younger and better skilled than the domestic population, was good for the economic development of a country which is still sparsely populated and requires a larger infrastructure to be developed-which is my quick response to the question of the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, it was felt that the political method of ministerial discretion that was applied to all migration cases-at least in theory-was not suitable for such a large program as was to develop that now involves up to 140,000 people each year. As a result, moves were initiated to codify migration policy. This came to fruition under a subsequent Minister in December 1989 and produced a vast body of regulations and the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations, the first of whose reports we are debating cognately tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> Five years later, we find a migration program which is larger than-almost double-that of the mid-1980s and one which is governed not by ministerial fiat but by a regulatory regime similar to that operating in, say, the Department of Social Security. The program volume is no longer influenced by the cyclical motion of the Australian economy and the Minister no longer carries an extraordinary volume of paperwork, which in the case of the Minister that I worked for actually reached 13 briefcases at its peak and which he carried everywhere with him. </PARA>
<PARA> It has recently been shown in a study by the Bureau of Immigration Research that, during the last 15 years of incorporating these changes to policy, immigration has had a favourable impact on Australia's aggregate and per capita standard of living. It seems that a decent rate of population growth, to which immigration contributes substantially in the case of Australia, stimulates the level of economic activity and reduces the level of unemployment which would have otherwise prevailed. The resultant faster rate of growth in total output also causes a faster rate of adoption of new technology, bringing further benefits in the form of higher productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> The report also states that if the population grows much above 1 1/2 or 1 3/4 per cent per annum, the advantages of economic output tend to recede with an overcommitment to infrastructure and some crowding in urban facilities. All that sounds a bit dry, but I thought it was worth getting on the record. It means, in short, that immigration at the level we are presently running it accounts for an improvement in living standards for those who are still here and those who come in. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other ways in which the immigration program benefits our well-being. The current program being biased in favour of applicants who are relatively young and well qualified makes a strong contribution to economic development. The injection of youth also slows down to some degree the ageing of the population and the consequent drain on welfare and the tax bill that future generations of Australians will face. </PARA>
<PARA> The selection of skilled applicants also carries other benefits. Immigration can be used as a tool for filling limited term shortages in specific sectors of the work force, thereby reducing damaging distortions and wage fluctuations, or it can be used as a general method of building the aggregate level of skills available to the economy as a whole. Some of these skills may be new ones which were previously unavailable to us. We have tried to build up the business migration program to incorporate business skills, particularly the availability to make economic connections with the region to our north, which is the fastest growing section of the world economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Some questions have been raised, some of them this evening, about the character of the business migration program. Many of these I will leave unanswered since one of our parliamentary committees is presently undertaking a review of the business migration program that should produce answers to these questions. I note in passing that the business migration program has produced an inflow of capital into the Australian economy. The last figures I was able to get were for the same year as the Immigration Department's annual review of 1989-90. It stated that the inflow of capital associated with this program amounted to $1.7 billion. Even if there are other distortions involved in the program, we should recall that there is a substantial inflow of money which goes along with it. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect of the immigration program which appeals to me personally very much is the multicultural society which has resulted from the program. We are now a much more cosmopolitan society than we were even 20 years ago, and the inflow of migrants in the contemporary immigration program over the last six or seven years has contributed to an even further diversity, particularly as this intake has involved more people from the Asian-Pacific region. We are all familiar with the delights this has produced for Australian cuisine. It is not just the cuisine; it is the capacity to trade with and realise the market potential for our products in the Asia-Pacific region, much of which is quite different to the culture which we have imported from Europe. I have had occasion to mention before persons exporting exotic foodstuffs, that is, exotic by our standards but quite standard fair in the Asian market. </PARA>
<PARA> The result has been that my seat of Adelaide is now very much a multicultural seat with quite diverse ethnic communities who have quite different problems to those of the Anglo-Celtic majority and who require different kinds of resolutions to their problems. For example, I have an Islamic community in Adelaide which worships at the oldest mosque in the country. Immediately tensions built up in the Gulf they contacted me and asked what the chances were of greater discrimination against Islamic people resulting from the United Nation's operation in the Gulf. I ensured that some extra measures were undertaken with respect to both their residences and their place of worship. As is well-known, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) wrote them a letter on the subject. As it turned out, these safeguards seemed to be unnecessary, but I am sure they were greatly comforted by them at the time. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, we also have a very vibrant Jewish community in the seat of Adelaide which over the last few years has come to see itself as something of an ethnic community contributing to multicultural society which, in the first instance, was not its natural tendency. There is a flourishing liberal synagogue in the middle of my seat. I am going to visit it very shortly to attend a function which they have organised. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, our older ethnic communities need to be remembered. Only yesterday I had the pleasure of turning the first sod, as they say, at a hostel for part of our ethnic specific aged care program involving Polish-speaking Australians who came here in the 1940s and 1950s and who have contributed greatly to the development of Australia and find that they want to use Polish in their older years in their place of residence, which in this case is going to be a 40-bed hostel. </PARA>
<PARA> Our newer communities contribute in rather different ways. The Vietnamese Christian community, which has grown very rapidly in Adelaide, as in other parts of the country, has recently blessed the ground that it will use for its own ethnic community centre which is going to incorporate not only tennis courts but also a stadium for soccer, which sport they are very keen on playing. </PARA>
<PARA> Another of our recent communities is the Chinese who, legend has it, are only interested in commerce and restaurants. This is totally untrue. The Chairman of the migrant resource centre in Adelaide is Ron Tan, a Singaporean Chinese. A Hong Kong Chinese person is on the Ethnic Affairs Commission. Only yesterday I had the privilege of watching the dragon boat races at the ethnic fair at Elder Park when one of the Chinese dragon boats sank, to everyone's great delight. </PARA>
<PARA> Immigration is an issue which occasions about 50 per cent of visits to my electorate office in Sefton Park. A whole variety of people seek the assistance of myself, as the local member. Since the codification of the migration regulations, to which I have already referred, the amount of assistance that a local member of parliament can actually offer to constituents tends to be rather more limited than might have been the case previously. Ministerial representations are no longer as effective since the Minister himself is rather tied up by the regulations which have been designed to restrict the areas of ministerial discretion. There is an expanded review process now in place which is, again, going to be subject to investigation by the Migration Regulations Committee. Later this year I hope we will be able to debate how effective the review process is in overseeing the way in which the code is applied. </PARA>
<PARA> This evening I would like to mention a few cases that have come to my attention which seem to me to be problematic in so far as the codification of migration regulations is concerned. The ones that have occasioned most problems are those involving change of status because it seems that, all too frequently, people who visit Australia and intend to return to their country of origin change their mind because they are offered permanent employment or because they fall in love with an Australian and want to stay. A number of instances have come to my attention which I have had to deal with, some of which seem to have been resolved by the code in perhaps, if not the wrong way, at least an unnecessarily round-about way. </PARA>
<PARA> One young couple were engaged to be married. She was told that she would have to return to England in order to apply for permanent residency in Australia. However, if they had been in a de facto relationship-in which their religious beliefs did not permit them to be, which is most unusual in this day and age as I am sure you would realise, even from your illustrious position, Mr Deputy Speaker-he would have been invited to sponsor her, as his de facto wife, to remain in Australia permanently. It seemed odd that these factors could not be taken into account, or the fact that she was in permanent employment in a position where her services were greatly valued and not easily replaced; that they were both taxpayers; and that the chances of her application for permanent residency-when made from England, to which she had returned at great cost-being refused, since she was the fiancee of an Australian citizen, were negligible. So we were all put to great trouble, expense and disruption in order for this lady to comply with the code, which is very difficult to get around because there is so little discretion built into it. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that this requirement is in place to prevent rorting and queue jumping. I have come across the odd case of people trying to rort and queue jump but, nonetheless, I have come across many more cases of people who want to settle legitimately in this country and who find it difficult to get around the code, particularly when it relates to change of status when in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I have also met with distressed relatives of people who wish to visit Australia temporarily-say for a wedding or a funeral-and who come from countries to which there is supposed to be a great risk of them not returning. They have had their applications rejected. In most instances, I or my staff have been able to go to officials and get the situation reversed so that they are able to come here and attend a wedding or a funeral and leave. It seems to me unfortunate that the code should be too rigid in that respect and I think we need to pay careful attention to the review of the review process which the Committee will undertake in a couple of months. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to mention the case-because it has a happy ending-of a Ukrainian family. An Australian Ukrainian had been trying to get some of his family out of the Ukraine for years. His first application 15 years ago was successful as far as Australia was concerned, but it was rejected by the Soviet Government, which refused the family an exit visa. So they were forced to remain in Kiev. Last year the Soviet Government finally granted the family an exit visa but then it looked as though, under the codified rules that we had, they could not get an import visa to come to Australia. So for years they had been unable to leave the Soviet Union, although we would have them, but when the Soviet Union said that they could leave we would not let them in because we had changed our rules. There is a happy ending to this story as it was determined that the family constituted a special circumstance. The family is on its way to Australia and I look forward to a slivovitz-or whatever the Ukrainians in Adelaide drink-when the family reaches Australia. </PARA>

<PARA> I will return to the two instances that I started talking about. In general, the two changes that have been made and, I believe, incorporated into policy over the last five years have been, firstly, the expansion of the program. The expansion of the program has been a great success and recognition of this is the fact that it is now supported by the Opposition, which had periodically made various criticisms of it. The odd wrinkle occurs-which the shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), chose to criticise very strongly-and it is incumbent upon us, as legislators, to iron these out. So far that has been accomplished successfully. </PARA>
<PARA> The other facet of the change involves codification of the rules. I have already expressed some reservations about the way in which this has been incorporated. My own taste would have been for a retention of a higher degree of ministerial discretion. But, in the absence of that, it is very important that we get the review process correct and I look forward very much to the Migration Regulations Committee undertaking a review of the review process later this year. </PARA>

He referred to a very difficult immigration case that he had encountered concerning a family trying to emigrate from Russia. The family was eligible to come here and finally got its exit visa from Russia only to find that our rules had changed and it could not come in.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry, Mr Deputy Speaker; I was so carried away that I did not realise that the honourable member for Gippsland was out of order. This is something which we all need to know because we all have special circumstance cases, but the present rigid circumstances do not allow any special circumstance. We all know of quite horrendous cases under these new regulations about which we are told, no matter how far we take them, that nothing can be done-there are no special circumstances. The only special circumstance that I know of applies under section 64U of the Migration Legislation Amendment Act, to which the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) refers in the ministerial statement which we are debating. Under that section he can, in cases of an extreme compassionate nature, make a decision contrary to the regulations. He has to report the decision, and the details of the case, to Parliament. He has done it once since this Act has been in effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to know about the special circumstance to which the honourable member for Adelaide refers. I think we all need to know about it. We need to know the basis for us to make our cases to the Minister. Perhaps this is a case which the Minister means to report to Parliament next week or later this week. I want to know about it. I do not put down the case to which the honourable member refers-I am sure it is a very special circumstance. But the problem with the regulations and the regime, and the problem which the Minister has promised to address but has not addressed since he has put down his statement, is those special circumstances. I want to talk about two types of cases tonight. The first type is the special circumstance which is not allowed for now. Terrible cases have come before me as a result of it. I have managed to resolve some with success, but others I have not. The other type of special circumstance is when the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs messes it up for the applicant. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is very appropriate that we are having this debate tonight. I was a member of the Joint Committee on Migration Regulations that looked at the first lot of migration regulations. I was part of the Parliament that put a condition into the Migration Legislation Amendment Act and refused to give carte blanche to the then Minister with his migration regulations. I was part of the Parliament which put a time limit on the Act and required regulations to be finalised and put before the Parliament for scrutiny by a certain time. I have to say that the outcome was quite unsatisfactory as far as I was concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> I do understand why the new regime came into effect and I do understand why it was necessary to look at a codification. I cannot understand why the Government insisted on following the timetable it did in a quite bloody-minded fashion. I was there every step of the way and saw it, including in the Migration Regulations Committee. I do not understand how Minister Hand could make his statement in May 1990 about things that had to happen back then, and for them still not to have happened. In this country the matter of immigration is a bipartisan one. We have a basic agreement about the objectives of our migration policies and our migration program, but every opposition must always have the right to point out the flaws to government. </PARA>
<PARA> In referring to the Minister's May 1990 statement, I find his statement very intriguing. This, of course, is not the Minister who brought in the Act-that was the honourable Mick Young-nor the Minister who brought in the regulations-that was Senator Robert Ray-but the present Minister, the Hon. Gerry Hand. Thus we have three different Ministers involved. I say just this in order to point out that the Minister who currently has carriage of this matter is not the man who was responsible for either the Act or the regulations. But he is the man responsible for looking at how they have both worked. He says in this statement:</PARA>
<PARA>The introduction of so large a body of Regulations under the amended legislation-</PARA>
<PARA>amended by the Parliament-</PARA>
<PARA>in a much compressed time frame compared to what was originally intended-</PARA>
<PARA>and I put a very big question mark over that-</PARA>
<PARA>was required by the Migration Legislation Amendment Act. This resulted in a lack of clarity, and, in a number of cases, unintended consequences. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government came to the Parliament asking for carte blanche on its regulations. It came in and said, `We are going to change the immigration system totally and we are no longer going to do it by the previous code of practice. We are going to do it under regulations. The regulations are mentioned in this Act, but we are not going to tell you what is in them'. We said, `No. We are not going to accept a total rewriting of Australia's migration system without knowing what is happening'. So a time limit was put on the Act. Those regulations had to be introduced by a certain time or the Act was inoperative. I therefore do not understand what the Minister means by a `much compressed time frame'. </PARA>
<PARA> We kept on being promised the regulations. We saw draft after draft of them, every one incomplete. The time was compressed in the end because the Government was months behind its own timetable for the delivery of those regulations to Parliament. So when it says the time frame was much compressed compared with what was originally intended, it should realise that that compression was not imposed on the Government but was a compression that it brought on itself. When that situation arose, the Opposition said to the Government, `We will agree to an extension of the deadline for the regulations. Get them right. It is terribly important because it is such a fundamental change. We will agree to an extension'. </PARA>
<PARA> The deadline was 19 November 1989. We were due to have an election by July 1990. As it happened, we had one in early March 1990 and Parliament did not sit in 1990 prior to the election. I believe that the reason the Government would not agree to an extension of the deadline until closer to when the election was due was that it wanted to keep its options open for an early election-if that was what it chose-and it simply could not determine what would be an appropriate extension date. In the event of an election prior to the Act coming into effect there was always a chance that the Government would lose, in which case a very different situation would have arisen. The Minister was bound and determined to have his regime in place before the end of 1989. </PARA>

It was totally political and totally self-oriented with a much compressed time frame compared with what was originally intended because of political and administrative considerations, not for any reason other than that. The Government had an offer of total cooperation from the Opposition to get the regulations right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another problem with that haste-and one that was pointed out with deep and real concern by members who were interested in this-was the haste of the introduction of those regulations. One very big question mark and concern that was raised over them was the difficulty that the staff of the Department would have in administering them-staff both within Australia and overseas. The Migration Regulations Committee sought information about the training that would be given to staff, both in Australia and overseas, so that the staff could properly advise people applying to migrate here. The answer we got, whilst I am sure it was very well intentioned, was pathetic. It was very clear that it was not possible to give proper training in the time available. I state that because one of the great concerns that I want to raise tonight is the incorrect advice that is being given even now to people who seek advice on their status, either within the country whilst holding one form of visa, or overseas when they are applying to get a visa. Warnings of this possibility were given to the Government. In the Minister's statement he says:</PARA>
<PARA>Codification means that policies are clearly specified in criteria and people are clear on their entitlements and obligations. </PARA>
<PARA>I raise the question: clear to whom? It is not clear to many departmental officers, it is not clear to many departmental applicants and, frankly, it is anything but clear to virtually every member of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Having been a member of the Migration Regulations Committee and in the privileged position of having seen all the draft regulations well before they were tabled, and being able to study them with departmental officers, I went back to my electorate office and said to my staff, `When these new regulations come into effect you will not give anyone any advice about immigration, because you will not be able to understand them-they are too complex. Also, you will not take verbal advice from the Department. The only advice we will pass on to any constituent is advice we get in writing from the Department'. How right I was! With the best will in the world Department of immigration officers are giving advice to people which is wrong. They believe it to be right when they give it, the recipient believes it to be right, the recipient proceeds on it, and, in every case that has come before me where this has happened, by the time the person comes to me he or she is illegal and about to be deported. Yet that person has done what the Department told him or her to do. </PARA>
<PARA> One case involved an American in Australia on a visitor's visa. He had no reason to try to be illegal-he had special skills, he could have migrated if he wanted to. He came here just to see Australia, but met an Australian woman and fell in love. They wanted to marry, but did not do so before contacting the Department. He informed the Department's officers as to when his visitor's visa would expire-which was some six weeks after the contact-and was told that provided he applied by a certain date for permanent residency he would be all right. This man followed the Department's advice to the letter. He went into the Department on that date and asked for the form he had to fill in, but he was illegal when he walked into that office because he had been given incorrect advice. He had married by then. When this man produced his visa and gave his story, the reply was, `You're illegal. Get out of the country, buster'. </PARA>
<PARA> He went off to his solicitor, who contacted the Department and said, `We need time to look at this. Please give us a couple of weeks'. The Department set the date for his departure as 23 December 1990. The couple contacted me the week before. The solicitor had looked at the case. Clearly under the regulations the fellow was illegal. The fact that he followed departmental advice was neither here nor there-the regulations do not allow for that. He had no reason to do the wrong thing; if he had followed the right procedure he would have got permanent residency. He said, `I will go', because if it got to the point of a deportation order, it would be years before he could apply to come back. If the applicant left the country, he could apply to come back in six months. He was newly married-it was wonderful stuff!</PARA>
<PARA> When I contacted the Department and said, `Why is it 23 December?', I was told, `Because that is the date'. I said, `But why 23 December? Why not the 26th? Why cannot he have Christmas with his wife?' I was told, `Because that is the date'. I asked, `Is there any reason it cannot be another date?' And the answer was, `That is the date'. So I telephoned Canberra, and he got Christmas with his wife. That little Hitler in the office up in Brisbane was sitting there saying to me, `That is the date'. There was no justification for that at all. But that is what he told the applicant and, by God, he was not going to let that applicant get another day. That is the situation that these regulations have brought on us. </PARA>
<PARA> I only have a couple of minutes left. The Minister refers to two categories of people that must be distinguished-those people who become illegal quite innocently and unintentionally through ignorance of proper procedures, and those who have explored every loophole of the regulations. I have no sympathy with the second group and neither has the Opposition. But there is a third category-it is those who become innocently and unintentionally illegal through following the Department's directions. I have cited one instance here tonight and there have been others. This situation has to be urgently addressed. The Minister foreshadowed a Bill in May 1990, but it has not happened yet. He cannot just say, `I am going to bring in some legislation'. He has to move with some urgency to find the loosening up of the system that is essential. In the meantime, I look forward with great interest to receiving information as to how I can help the sort of people I have referred to tonight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened with some interest to the contributions made by honourable members to this debate. There are a number of things that need to be said about immigration in general and some things that need to be said about it in particular. In general, it is easy for honourable members opposite to point to mistakes made in connection with problems of administration. Indeed, if we look at the problem that bedevils the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, we will see that this financial year it will have well over a million applications of various sorts from people wanting to immigrate to Australia or come to Australia. As to those who want to immigrate, it will be saying no to nine out of 10 of those who apply. Given the range, the diversity and the number of applications, it is inevitable that, in that process, mistakes will be made. That was inevitable even before Parliament effectively abolished the concept of ministerial discretion and moved to the adoption of the code.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suppose that at that stage it would have been possible for the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs-if it had followed the sorts of views of my colleague the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan)-to have said, `Well, we'll put everything on hold until we get it right'. But that would be a position which would be supported by the honourable member or anybody else. </PARA>
<PARA> We have an Opposition which continually berates the Government for not cutting back in areas of the Public Service. Day after day, we hear the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), saying to the people of Australia, `This Government must make further cutbacks in the public sector'. It is all right for the shadow Minister for immigration and ethnic affairs, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), to smile, but if he is supporting his colleagues he ought to get up and tell us in which areas of this Department he would be cutting back in terms of day to day administration and where he believes that will make the system more effective. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say for myself that I still believe that, until such time as we bring back a much greater extent of ministerial discretion, many of these problems will continue to bedevil us. Given the nature and variety of the problems that the Department has to deal with, we cannot have a situation in which we have a department virtually geared to saying no nine times out of 10 without getting considerable areas of injustice within the framework of that situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have heard of the sort of instant case that the honourable member for Moncrieff has mentioned. Every honourable member is aware of cases where the simple answer to that situation is an exercise in ministerial discretion. While I was Minister for immigration, I had a large number of applications from honourable members on both sides of the House, and let me say this: in all of those applications, I never found an honourable member who was out to rort or abuse the system. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CH4">Mr HOLDING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Parliament decided that. I personally believe that one of the answers that ought to be adopted at this stage is to go back to a greater degree of ministerial discretion, because we cannot implement a code and expect that, in the great variety of human circumstances which are dealt with throughout the whole area of immigration, it will cover that situation. By their very nature, the legal processes and the checks and balances which the Government has endeavoured to put in place will take some time to sort out and, in the course of that, it will be inevitable that injustices will occur. I have been there when injustices do occur.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I get a little tired of being part of the minority which started off to make up a majority report about the standards that we apply towards illegal immigrants. I do not support illegal immigrants. We know that many of them are able to survive in the community by virtue of the fact that they are working for below-award wages, often in situations of great exploitation. Many honourable members of this Parliament are fully aware of situations in their own electorates where that is occurring. But when has there been an occasion when an employer taking advantage of that situation, knowing that he is employing someone who is an illegal immigrant, is charged in respect of that act?</PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that the majority of the committee on immigration regulations recommended was, of course, that those provisions be strengthened. We cannot have it both ways. All the concentration in terms of illegal immigrants, when we are talking about the non-innocent illegals, tends to be directed against illegals per se. But the great majority of those illegals on the records of the Department can survive in Australia only because they are employed, and in the great majority of cases they are employed by people who know they are illegal and are prepared to employ them because they can do so knowing that, whatever conditions apply, whatever wages they pay, they will not be subject to any kind of challenge. One of the quick ways of dealing with that problem is, of course, to make it perfectly clear that employers in that situation who adopt that attitude are not going to be ignored. </PARA>
<PARA> The other area that I believe ought to be looked at by this Government and by the Parliament is in respect of Australia's very commendable record in terms of its treatment of refugee applications. But we are in a situation in which I believe there are many refugees who ought to be deserving of the sympathy and the response of this Government but who find themselves in a situation in which their applications cannot be easily processed. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give an example of three groups whose situation almost on a daily basis is in peril. Whether or not the individual applicant meets the criteria of refugee status would be a matter for subsequent determination, but I believe there are groups or communities which are at risk. Take for example those Afghans who have left Afghanistan, many of whom are highly educated and many of whom are at the moment simply living under very difficult conditions in places like Pakistan, who have relatives in Australia and who would make very suitable immigrants to Australia. They cannot go back to Afghanistan because there is still virtually a civil war going on and many of the mines that were laid during the Soviet occupation are still there. They cannot go back because their lives would be in peril. Yet, because they are in Pakistan, living under difficult or impossible situations, their applications for refugee status are not being processed, in my view, in the way in which they should be. </PARA>
<PARA> The other obvious group is, of course, the Lebanese. One only has to talk about the situation in Beirut. There really has to be a process which, in my view, enables those people there who are on a daily basis at risk-not for any particular political or religious philosophy they have got-to be considered in a special category as being potential refugees. </PARA>
<PARA> Equally, I think, we ought to be looking at the current situation of Russian Jewry. There has been a long tradition of anti-semitic attitudes in Russia. During the period of a fairly tough communist regime, it was possible for a centralised state with an adequate police force to keep those kinds of traditional attitudes at bay. But in this new situation, as the Soviet Government wrestles with its own future, many of those old attitudes and traditional sentiments are coming to the fore, so that in particular parts of the Soviet Union-not necessarily generally, but in certain towns and in certain areas-the Jewish community and individual Jews, for no other reason than that they are Jews, are at risk and are in peril. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is necessary and desirable that the Australian immigration process have due regard to those sorts of problems. It is not just a question of waiting until we have an imposing number of dead to say, `This is the group that we are going to treat as refugees'. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that if one looks at the history of immigration into Australia, with all the difficulties and all the faults, the system under all governments has been one which, in terms of its ultimate achievement at the end of the day, all members of this Parliament can feel proud about because of the kind of multicultural society that we have produced. However, we have to be vigilant and continue to see that this process operates to produce justice in individual cases, and that individual problems and the range and diversity of the human condition which create those situations are dealt with sympathetically. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the category of ministerial discretion is far too narrow. It is absurd to say that a Minister who exercises his discretion has to report back to the Parliament. I believe that the quick and easy way of dealing with a number of problems that are brought to the Minister's attention enables him to exercise that discretion properly and effectively without feeling that somehow or other he is taking this great codified model and putting it at threat. Sure, we can have the judicial tribunal; sure, we can have these other processes-but there are situations which come to mind where Ministers ought to exercise their discretion. </PARA>
<PARA> I remember one very simple case when I was Minister. A family from Lebanon had been approved to come to Australia. They had to have their medical tests. They had five children and the smallest child, then aged about three, had a very mild case of Down's syndrome. What was the departmental response? Straight down the line: `The adults and the others can come and you can leave this child behind in Beirut'. Frankly, if any parents were prepared to leave their child in that sort of situation in Beirut, we would not want them. That case was a simple exercise of ministerial discretion. If the same situation arises today, why should the Minister not have the same capacity to exercise that discretion without having to report it to this Parliament as if it were a major event? This Parliament has more than enough processes to deal with any abuse at any level going on within the immigration system. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that, during the time of a variety of Ministers from all political parties, a serious challenge has never been mounted on that basis. I believe that the approach taken, of trying to codify the situation and abolish ministerial discretion, means that we are going to have many more administrative problems than we need have. I believe that in any review one does not have to abolish some of the structures that have been created which make for effective due processing, but I believe that there is such a variety of problems that we ought to, as a Parliament, be looking seriously at the reintroduction of ministerial discretion without the nonsense of saying that Ministers can exercise discretion at every level in this Parliament and they are answerable to this Parliament. Where a Minister says, `I am going to exercise ministerial discretion on the basis of information put before me'-and it does not matter if it comes from another member of this House or where it comes from-if he believes it is appropriate, then he is answerable, in the final analysis, to this Parliament for any abuse or any mistake that he makes.</PARA>
<PARA> That being the case, in looking at this whole question of how we make the system more effective we ought to look at that aspect. But by and large, I believe the immigration portfolio and the Ministers involved in it have made it work. Australia can be part of the system, but there are actions there that need to be rectified. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset of my contribution on the Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill of 1991, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>That all words after ``That'' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA> ``whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) is of the opinion that the very existence of the Discretionary Grants Scheme and the Generic Technologies Scheme, administered by the Industry Research and Development Board, attests to the Government's failure to carry out necessary economic reforms which has resulted in:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the incapacity of Australia's economy to derive the full benefits of technological innovation;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the high cost of capital and general economic conditions which have compromised industry investment, especially in technology-related business strategies; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the inability of small start-up companies to gain access to suitable private capital backing or industry support at the early stages of product development; and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) notes that the extension of these schemes until 1994, which the Bill proposes, is further evidence of the Government's failure in this regard''. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bill before the House bears on a number of matters, including: the extension of the Government's industry related research and development programs-the discretionary grants scheme and the generic technology scheme; the provision of legislative backing for the national procurement and development program, as well as adding certain prescriptions to its granting authority; and other changes to the Science and Industry Research Act which affect the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation's ability to accept donations up to a threshold of $1m without seeking ministerial approval. </PARA>
<PARA> More technical matters dealt with in the Bill provide for low level drafting related alterations to the National Measurement Act 1960, the Export Market Development Grants Act, the Patents Act and the Industry, Technology and Commerce Amendment Act. In summary, leaving aside many of the technical aspects of the legislation, the Bill fundamentally affects the two research and development initiatives which are conducted by the Industry Research and Development Board (IRDB). </PARA>
<PARA> Consequently, this evening my comments will necessarily focus upon the Government's request contained in the legislation to extend these two research and development initiatives. The discretionary grants scheme and the generic technology scheme are adjuncts of the Government's industry policy. Both have as their objective the provision of assistance for the creation of potentially commercially significant technologies. They are targeted to the provision of assistance to small companies, often start-up companies, which do not possess a taxation liability and therefore are unable to claim under the 150 per cent research and development taxation incentive scheme. Such small companies, for instance, might well be those whose profit stream has been drained owing to investment outlays prior to product development. </PARA>
<PARA> The difference between the schemes is that one, the discretionary grants scheme, is untargeted in respect of the field of applicants; the other, the generic technologies grants scheme, seeks applicants from prespecified, defined priority technology areas. The former scheme is also more demanding than the latter on its applicants in respect of its commercial expectations. The discretionary grants scheme requires a more commercially driven technology development strategy than the generic grants scheme-that is, it focuses on company product development; emphasises the creation of proprietary knowledge; requires, therefore, relatively firm commercialisation strategies; and demands of applicants that they fund 50 per cent of project costs or more. </PARA>
<PARA> The generic technology grants scheme, ostensibly at least, is more orientated to the creation of non-proprietary knowledge-that is, it is directed more towards the support of precompetitive research. The scheme is designed to target significant research opportunities as defined by administrative selection procedures in predetermined priority research areas, the priority areas being biotechnology, waste management, information technologies, communications technology and new materials. </PARA>
<PARA> Waste management was inserted by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) during the last election campaign. No additional funding was granted to support it. It just made the scheme split its grants five ways instead of four. It is for this reason that the generic technology project costs on average around 80 to 90 per cent of scheme funds. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition reluctantly supports legislation to extend the life of these schemes. It does not do so on the basis of the integrity of the efforts of the Industry Research and Development Board in operating the schemes. I consider the responsibility given to the board to allocate resources in matters such as to be a profoundly onerous one. The coalition's reservations stem, rather, from its belief that resource allocation activities such as this cannot be effectively carried by administrative mechanisms. Ideally, this is not a process I would like to see government involved in at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The recent publicity given to the potential problem of conflicts of interest arising from the operation of the scheme indicate the sorts of difficulties into which administrative decision-making processes of this kind can stray. Mr Deputy Speaker, you have been especially active in this arena, and I know that you have expressed certain concerns publicly regarding the administration of the schemes by the Industry Research and Development Board. I hope, however, that the forthcoming responses by the Minister to questions on notice that I have recently submitted will put beyond doubt the conduct of the operation of the IRDB's various schemes. On the basis of current information, I have no reason to doubt the integrity of the efforts made by the IRDB board and its various committees in respect of grant allocations. </PARA>
<PARA> I can understand the sorts of tensions that the IRDB's judgments on the appropriateness of certain grant applications could give rise to. Notwithstanding this, I do anticipate a speedy and comprehensive response by the Minister to the further questions I have directed to him regarding the operation of the conflict of interest guidelines applying to the board. I know that you, Mr Deputy Speaker, especially amongst all members of this House, will be particularly anxious to know of the Minister's answers to the questions I have placed on notice which, in turn, follow your particular questions to the Minister of recent days. </PARA>
<PARA> I also add that the very existence of the schemes conducted by the IRDB attest to the deeper weaknesses in the economy which mitigate against a self-sustaining innovation process. Essentially, the schemes operate to provide support for innovative technologies which are unable to obtain sufficient capital backing from either manufacturers or other sources of investment finance. Regrettably, I accept the necessity in the current economic circumstances for such government-based initiatives to exist. The schemes conducted by the IRDB reveal the inadequate development of Australia's manufacturing sector and the virtual absence of venture capital in the country. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of debate on science and technology matters, the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean) has often accused the coalition of placing too great an emphasis on market conditions in regard to science and technology policy. This accusation reveals the Minister's naive perspective on the nature of the technological innovation process and its relationship to other forces at work in the economy. The Minister would like to present himself to the Australian Labor Party factions as one of the new breed of interventionists. His perspective on the portfolio for which he has responsibility is, regrettably, driven by his personal political agenda. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer (Mr Keating) no doubt would agree with this analysis of the Minister's conduct of his portfolio, even if the Minister for Resources does not or pretends not to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister's handling of the portfolio is not informed by an objective analysis of the interconnections between his portfolio and others. It is not informed by an appreciation of the linkages which must exist between research and development and other forces which should be operating in the economy if technology is to be effectively commercialised. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Science and Technology frequently talks about the commitment of the Government to commercialising research; talk is cheap and talk itself will not bring about commercialisation. It is not just a question of talking in some rhetorical manner about technology transfer and its potential to reshape the industrial sector and boost competitiveness. We had enough of this science and technology hype from the former Minister for science, the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones). </PARA>
<PARA> Many will recall the vision of an industrial landscape dotted by a profusion of sunrise industries that was offered up in the past. The capacity of an economy to mobilise its technological resources is tightly bound to its efficiency of performance; the level of industrial and manufacturing activity; the extent to which companies have developed technology strategies and have embarked on a technology acquisition investment program; the capabilities of management; and the confidence in the investment market. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia needs to retain and build upon its scientific and technological skill base; it needs to invigorate the various research processes at work in the public sector research community; and it needs to ensure that the structure and the physical resources which underpin those resources are adequate to the task. But the other hard policy work must also be carried out.</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of commercialisation issues, it is necessary to ensure that the market processes which are at the heart of effective technology transfer strategies are in place. Sadly, under this government, science and technology rhetoric headed off in one direction and economic policy in the other. It has been the inability to intertwine the two, to allow the technological transfer processes to feed off economic activity, which explains the need to extend the schemes that the House is currently debating. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent years much has been said of the importance for this country's future of building a more knowledge intensive, high value-added industrial manufacturing base; but the Government, through its own economic practices, has denied itself the very opportunity to realise that future. Generally, the existence of specific programs of the type included in this Bill-namely, the discretionary grants scheme and the generic technologies grant scheme-attest to governmental failure to address adequately key structural economic concerns. These concerns impede industry's capacity to respond rationally to market signals emanating from either public or private sector research and development activities. </PARA>
<PARA> As a passing example of the very real impact of these issues, take the case of ICI Australia Ltd, a high technology company. In an address to the Sydney Institute on 20 February this year, the company's Chief Executive, Michael Deeley, made clear the impact of broader economic issues on the capital-intensive, technology-intensive, high value-added industrial base of Australia-and ICI is certainly a high-tech industry. It was pushing into the internationally traded sector in areas such as advanced ceramics, scientific instruments and diagnostics. But added costs, brought about by the Government's failure to act on an array of interlocking micro-reform issues, have crippled its potential to continue the development of its high technology, traded goods production capabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> I would commend Mr Deeley's speech to the House. It is a timely and salient reminder of the interconnection between a country's broad economic performance and its capacity to build value-added knowledge-intensive industries. If we cannot get the economic signals right for established industries, one can well appreciate the problems facing small high-tech start-up companies or other innovators trying to gain a footing in the marketplace. Regardless of this important observation, however, as the current economic environment becomes less hostile to the development of technology-related business strategies, it will be necessary to give some reserved, tacit support for programs such as the discretionary grants and generic technology grants schemes. It is a situation the nation would rather not be in at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's technology transfer processes have been gravely inactive by comparison with overseas economies. As such, potentially innovative product developments have been lost to foreign companies under licence or, at best, developed by way of joint ventures. The persistent failure of manufacturers to commercialise intellectual property emerging from our nation's research effort is a function of a variety of concerns. Change in the rates of technology transfer will not be significantly altered until overall economic conditions are conducive to promoting conventional, competitively driven sources of change. That is the simple, inescapable truth that seems lost on too many members of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The schemes under discussion tonight will have only marginal impact on rates of research and development take-up in relation to these other sources of market driven change. But, given the economic circumstances the Government has engineered, a marginal impact is better than no impact at all. Given this, the schemes must be seen for what they are; that is, compensatory measures to mask the hostile effects of the Government's own economic policies on the commercialisation process. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be understood that the creation of intellectual property in itself is a vastly less expensive process than is its further product development and marketing stages. These latter stages of research and development are therefore directly influenced concerns arising from the cost and availability of capital; rates of capital stock replacement within the manufacturing sector; cash flow; company size and managerial expertise; input costs in production processes; barriers to entry to markets; and the relative efficiencies of supply and transport networks. To be more specific, the wholesale taxation system impacts disproportionately upon emerging high technology manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA> Other prevailing macro- and micro-economic policy settings present profound obstacles to further investment and militate against innovative product development strategies. A more suitable investment climate, for instance, in hand with the abolition of the capital gains tax, would create a larger pool of venture capital for investment in high technology start-up companies than has been achieved by way of the contrived, failed schemes of the past, such as the management and investment companies scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> It is, then, no use promoting policy initiatives in regard to technology transfer issues in the absence of an appreciation of, firstly, the general complexity of the invasion process itself and, secondly, the critical need to ensure interaction between product development strategies and the marketplace. Anyone with any exposure to small technology-intensive companies will realise their sensitivity to matters such as those I have mentioned previously. </PARA>
<PARA> The critical stage of their development is as they try to size up their product and/or move up the pace of production in order to seize a greater share of the market. This is the stage at which they need to access equity involvement from other manufacturers, source new capital, meet enhanced distribution costs and so forth. This can be the most vulnerable period in a firm's life and this is the point at which economy problems bear down heavily on the technology transfer process. </PARA>
<PARA> In other economies overseas, the mature venture capital industry provides support, both indirect financial support and other investment infrastructure-management, distribution advice and so on-or else this is the time when larger manufacturers suck up the innovation within their own product development strategies. What happens in Australia? Cash flow problems at this stage in product development often drive companies to the wall, or else overseas industries move in and capture the benefits of Australia's intellectual property. Innovation is not just about the creation of more technology with potential commercial application; it is a much longer process than this. It is a process which is profoundly determined by the nation's economic circumstances and its manufacturing capabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Increasingly, then, the debate over the commercial potential of Australia's scientific and technological capabilities is focusing on the mainstream economic issues. On their own, Australia's scientists and engineers cannot bring about the wider circumstances required to build an internationally oriented, competitive, knowledge-intensive industrial future. They can provide us with the raw skills and the necessary technologies; they can make greater efforts to tailor their research to viable areas of commercial application-and I will say more on this shortly-but they cannot work the wider economic transformation necessary to restructure the economy. That is the great responsibility of government. </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding this, if governments, by virtue of the prevailing economic circumstances, are forced to actively encourage industry-related research and development to some small degree, they must do so with considerable care. I have tried to explain in my earlier comments the complexity of the innovation process which leads to product development. In this context, I would express my concern with the direction of the generic technology grants scheme as an effective structure for capturing the commercial benefits of technological developments. </PARA>
<PARA> If Australia is to make a fist of commercialisation, it will need to work towards building a much more commercially oriented technological development program as well as addressing the economic concerns I have highlighted. The public research sector is coming to realise this simple truth. If the Government's intention is to encourage industrial research and development which is internationally competitive and has significant commercial application, I am curious as to how this is achievable under the current structure of the generic technology scheme. A prioritised, strategic research and development grants scheme, while admirable for its social role, tends to lack the hard-nosed commercial orientation for a scheme masquerading under an industry-related research and development program. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned earlier that the generic technology scheme was ostensibly geared to support for pre-competitive research. Yet a reading of the press releases emanating from the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce concerning the current round of grant offers is characterised by a rhetorically strong market driven approach to assessing grant applicants. Moreover, I find that the latest inclusion of waste management in the list of priority areas has broken with the funding position of the other priority areas. It will fund projects up to 50 per cent alone. This priority area is therefore seeking to require applicants to design solid commercial linkages prior to approaching the IRDB. It is taking the direction of the discretionary grants scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> Is it going to be a pacesetter for the rest of the generic technologies schemes? There is good reason to suspect that there is some internal confusion within the Government's ranks as to precisely the role and function of the generic technologies grants schemes. Is it to be market-driven or technology-driven? Is it about the creation of socially useful knowledge? Or is it meant to be an instrument of industry policy and an exercise in the creation of proprietary which has commercial application?</PARA>
<PARA> If the generic technologies scheme is intended to function so as to provide a lead in industry development role, it should perhaps take a lead from the discretionary grants scheme and become more of a general purpose scheme. Better still, it should be absorbed within that scheme. Such a program could then send stronger signals to the research sector, both private and public, of the urgency of building up business strategies about technology development programs. </PARA>
<PARA> Technology development processes must integrate business principles at the earliest stages of planning if they are to succeed in the commercial world. This is a lesson which innovators and researchers seeking entry into commercial markets must learn. In order to support the development of these commercial strategies, I would envisage more effective use being made of the National Industry Extension Service. This industry extension service has in its network the means of providing small companies and innovators with sound managerial and commercial advice in respect of their innovative product developments. </PARA>
<PARA> It is this perspective which will drive the coalition's policy development in respect of these schemes. Generally, the coalition finds itself in the invidious position this evening of being forced to support a scheme, the existence of which demonstrates the very weaknesses which currently characterise the national economy. I would hope that the economic circumstances which make the scheme necessary are only short-lived-as short-lived, one might hope, as the life of the current Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill 1991. Until his very last observation, until the blemish of that last remark, which was very disappointing, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) gave a very thoughtful and considered presentation on this matter. I appreciate the spirit in which he did that. In spite of the fact that he is proposing an amendment with a view to substituting alternatives, in effect what he had to say was in support of both the legislation and the Government's position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To a large extent I think we all recognise that we are embarking upon a new era where, on both sides of the Parliament, there is a general recognition that Australia has not been a mature country in respect of research and development or in its attitude towards education and all that flows from applying the intellect. Australia has been a country which has, for one reason or another, developed tremendous innovative skills. The old saying, `She'll be right, Jack', stems from the fact that no matter what the problem, in some way or other our people would come up with an answer to it. </PARA>
<PARA> As has been demonstrated in any number of international forums, we have been a successful country intellectually. There is a list as long as your arm of good ideas which have been thought up in Australia. What we have not been good at is taking our ideas and transforming them into commercial applications from which we could derive wealth. We have not invested further in that process of taking ideas by turning them into products that the world wants to buy. We have been one of the poorer performers by the standards of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in educating ourselves for so many years. Australia was very near the bottom of the OECD table in terms of commitment to education. The application of research funding was left totally-and I think the word `totally' is just about right-to the government sector in the form of organisations such as the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), universities, and other academic institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the very disappointing aspects was that the commercial sector and business management in Australia had no real understanding of the potential of applying investment in the field of research and development. We have had a very short term investment strategy at most. I saw an interesting series of articles published in the Australian Financial Review just before Christmas where the writer, and I forget who it was, drew the conclusion that one of the key strengths in the Japanese economy was that the industrial operations in particular were owned by management and investment companies on behalf of shareholders, which, in some ways, were similar to our own superannuation funds-investment operations which were prepared to take a long term view and make judgments about managerial performance in the long term. In Australia we have had the attitude whereby every quarter the company reports come out, the stock market responds, and people look over management's shoulders. Our management has been totally short term in its thinking, and has not been prepared to apply funding in this direction. </PARA>
<PARA> I remember that within the Government just two or three years ago there was quite a strong internal debate about whether we should apply more funds for public sector research, or whether we should in fact encourage further private sector research with the 150 per cent tax deduction. We have continued to maintain the 150 per cent incentive. Fortunately now there seems to be some response, but not without the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) having to take this issue to the top of his own agenda in his policy speech in March last year when he referred to the need for Australia to become the clever country. At the same time he announced a very substantial increase in government commitment to research and development funding through the centres of excellence and the rest of the program. Of course, that is extended in this legislation which is aimed more at the commercialisation of good ideas. </PARA>
<PARA> I said at the start of my contribution that this is virtually a `start again' position. It is true to say that apart from organisations such as the CSIRO, the universities, and some of those directed institutions in the public field, there has been very little success. It is not an accident that we quite proudly wander around the world proclaiming our farmers as the world's most efficient and advanced. When one looks at the application of CSIRO research funds over the last 20 years, one sees that the CSIRO has given a particularly strong commitment to research in the agriculture sphere. It is one of the areas where in fact we have had a continuing program of long term investment in research. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of that research in agriculture there have been advances in soil and plant productivity, product development, marketing and all of those sorts of aspects. Farmers have been committed, through their marketing authorities, to the spending of money on research and development in their own industries. Yet this has not been a general practice across the economy. That is not only cause for disappointment but it is also reason for some confidence that the country is starting to wake up to itself. It is starting to demand of government that if the private sector is not prepared to do something-it should be, but if it is not-it ought to be done in joint venture with the public sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Gippsland said that there is an evolutionary stage, especially in the field of new technology and small businesses trying to develop an idea. The honourable member correctly referred to a small business, having developed an idea, having proved there is a market for the product, and perhaps even having produced working prototypes that create a demand, finding that it then faces the need for capital to expand and someone in the operation with the necessary skill to give advice on the application of the venture capital. The honourable member referred to the National Industry Extension Service as such a body for that kind of advice. I do not take issue with that.</PARA>
<PARA> I make the point, which I am sure the honourable member would have done if he had had time, that the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC) has been one of the few banking institutions in Australia to have a progressive attitude towards investment in that kind of venture capital. A browse through the annual report of the AIDC shows considerable success in sunrise technologies, but it is nowhere near enough. </PARA>
<PARA> The banking sector has much to answer for on the appalling state of the commercialisation of Australian ideas. I am not indulging now in kicking the banks because of the actions of the cowboys in recent years. The honourable member for Gippsland is right when he says that in many growing businesses the necessary expertise does not exist in banking finance, market development and those sorts of activities. The expertise lies in the development of ideas and their application. </PARA>
<PARA> Many small businesses do not know where to go to obtain such expertise. The first place they go is down to the bank and the first person whom they talk to is generally the local bank manager. However, that person has never been trained by the banks to have any interest or expertise in encouraging equity partners and forward and broad thinking. So the very institutions which over many decades ought to have been able to take a long term view and which ought to have had a commitment to training their own advisory staff on these sorts of profitable prospects do not possess the necessary expertise. </PARA>
<PARA> The banking sector is now wising up to this. The banking sector now understands that the commercial lending market is pretty tight and that it can no longer go down the entrepreneurial road. So the only place it can really go for long term profitability is quality investment in quality ideas and in quality people who can carry those ideas through. So while the superannuation investment companies and the banks turn their minds more to this kind of innovation, stimulated by these kinds of activities on the part of the Government and the attraction of the 150 per cent tax deduction, there will be a broader and more enlightened approach towards these principles of returns from R and D. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or his pessimism, about the fact that the commercial market might be waking up to this. My feedback is that it is happening now. Contrary to the popular view purveyed by the Opposition that somehow industry is looking for the free market to make all these decisions for it, I was heartened to read a recent report by the Centre for International Research on Communication and Information Technologies (CIRCIT), which showed that Australian business management is looking for direction from government and the opportunity to participate in joint venture activities with government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the strong leads that have been shown-and it came up during Question Time today-has been the decision by the Government to use its purchasing power to inject more confidence into the Australian product and the Australian capital base and development process. I use as an example the decision taken two or three years ago to supply the Royal Australian Navy with new submarines and then subsequently with frigates and the process that the Government undertook to decide who should get the contract. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government told the international community that if it wanted to win a Government contract worth $4 billion or $5 billion, we would no longer be interested in buying it off the shelf as an overseas purchase, which was the practice which prevailed prior to the Hawke Government's coming into office. The Government said that it wanted the project undertaken in Australia with maximum Australian content, technology transfer and participation in the global network. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather than the sort of response that one might have expected, we had a tremendously positive response. Earlier during Question Time today, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) referred to the submarine contract, the Australian content of which is 75 per cent. We asked only for 65 per cent when we originally called for tenders for the project. However, through the process of demanding input and involvement we have seen information technology transfers and we are now participating at the strong end of the process. </PARA>
<PARA> That lead by the Government will continue in future contracts in fields such as telecommunications, broadcasting infrastructure and transport infrastructure. As we move into new fields of technology and performance equipment, Australia will pick up more of this base. Australia has now turned the corner. </PARA>
<PARA> We do have a balance of payments problem, which essentially is the washout of decades of neglect in education and research and development. However, we are now determined to be a clever country. We are now determined to ensure that an appropriate share of the national savings pool goes into investment in the future. We are now coming to grips with the fact that we are part of the international community. We are no longer a country with fences around its borders. If we are to relate to the world, we have to do so on its terms. We are determined to no longer be at the bottom of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) table of comparisons on education and research and development. </PARA>
<PARA> Contrary to the pessimism of the honourable member for Gippsland, I think even in these quite difficult times there is a lot of scope for optimism about where these issues are going now. Business management is taking the lead. We are seeing the responses to these initiatives and the interaction between the development of ideas and the commercialisation of the product in the marketplace. In other words, we are getting smarter about it. That is a long process. We will not change that situation overnight, but we have to pound away. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to finish my contribution with one little bouquet, and that is for the former Minister for Science, the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), because I think in his last six months or so as a Minister in the previous Hawke Government he devoted an enormous amount of time and energy and did a lot of lobbying to convince the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and senior economic Ministers that Australia did have to get serious about research and development and that, if industry was not going to do it, we had to go back to public sector leadership. As I said, the direct result of that was the announcement by the Prime Minister in his policy speech of the decision that Australia would become the clever country one way or the other, and the substantial increase in funding for research and development has come from that. I believe that the honourable member for Lalor was responsible for that turning point. In many years' time, he may look back upon his contribution to parliamentary life and decide that that was his biggest win. I give him that little bouquet by way of a passing contribution. I support the Bill before the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When introducing the Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill, the Government said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>This continuing support demonstrates to the business community the Government's determination to encourage innovation in industry as a basis for enhanced competitiveness and strength. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government also said:</PARA>
<PARA>These schemes have been under way since the mid-1980s and have contributed to a marked increase in our industry research and development. </PARA>
<PARA>What is indisputable is that this Bill will cost the taxpayer money. Therefore let us look at just how effective the measures which have been in effect since the mid-1980s have really been. Let us look at the history of innovation or, to use another phrase, technology take-up, in Australia. Let us look at how we compare with our overseas competitors, look at the results of the specific exercise of the Government picking winners, look at some of the real reasons that technology take-up in this country has been so bad-and there is a lot of evidence to demonstrate that it is bad-and look at what measures ought to be taken to provide meaningful encouragement to industry to assist it in innovation, enhanced competitiveness and greater strength. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the worldwide experience, we see that historically productivity growth, innovation and technology have been most important in modern times. But the world's most successful exporters show little similarity in their domestic market conditions. Some have quite low taxation regimes; some have quite high taxation regimes. Some have a small population and some have a large population. There is very little similarity in those sorts of profiles. What is needed-and it is apparent in all of them-is a management culture that intuitively looks at the domestic market as part of a potential world market. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, in 1989 Australia ranked twentieth out of 23 in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in terms of `outward orientation'. This was caused by protection, an anti-competitive environment and, unfortunately, many monopolies. The key problems are management attitudes and our general economic environment, which during the last eight years has been structured very substantially by the current Treasurer (Mr Keating). </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of the lessons of the 1980s. We are faced with a long process of transformation. We start from a long way behind. We need to restructure our economy quite dramatically and we have to understand that we are a small economy on the edge of the world amidst rapid global change in trade patterns. The cost of new technology is astronomical. I have cited in this place before the case of a company called Texas Instruments which went into manufacturing personal computers and after a matter of months got out of the business having lost $180m. </PARA>
<PARA> Overseas countries have heavy government support for research and development, but in this country government support for research and development is actually declining. Some industries and technologies are, of course, of particular strategic importance. By this I mean, for example, the areas of design and process control. But in the last two years this Government has all but killed off many of our core industries and in the last six months we have seen many unique companies in this country go to the wall. International cooperative relationships are vital for knowledge. Unfortunately, a lack of consistency of government decision making and therefore a lack of confidence in Australian business has scared off many potential collaborators. Our market share, in Asia in particular and for technology or innovation intensive products in general, is declining. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike that in other small OECD countries, Australian industry has not developed strength in specialised areas of high value added industry. The cost of export market entry places severe demands on the resources of small firms and there is a high risk factor. We have many small firms in this country. When we look at how we need to build structural competitiveness, we realise that our national system of innovation infrastructure is weak. We have few strong industry clusters and very poor networks. We have had some outstanding technical developments and successes in Australia, as the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) mentioned, but there is a limit to how much innovation push can achieve on its own. Overall it has not worked here, so perhaps we need to look at adopting major technology more, but certainly we must keep up the funding. </PARA>
<PARA> The economic benefits of innovation arise from the diffusion of that innovation and new technology throughout the economy rather than isolated innovation, and that is why we should not be picking winners. There are unlikely to be high returns from publicly supported research and development unless there is a strong and dispersed demand for improved performance in general from the commercial sector. In new technology in particular, the pull from that commercial sector needs to be very strong. </PARA>
<PARA> We must acknowledge, of course, the changing trends around us. Quality and low costs were always important in manufacture, but now we need to add to those flexibility. In addition to that, of course, not only do we face that low cost equation but also we are looking at a shorter product cycle and we are looking not just at the economies of scale but at economies of scope. Grants or other direct government handouts are not the answer to our urgent need for innovation and technology take-up. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a poor history of take-up by Australian business of these critical activities. We have been dogged by short term views. We see only a domestic market, and financial institutions' short term profit need has become overwhelming. Inflation, interest rates, government regulation, lack of competition and inconsistent government policy have become almost institutionalised under the Hawke-Keating regime. We have developed a culture of speculative investment and not direct investment, and that has to change. </PARA>
<PARA> If we can tackle some of these problems, we will do much more good than just distributing a few million dollars in handouts under schemes such as those proposed in this Bill. A survey in 1988 showed that of 6,000 firms in Australia only 33 per cent-a third-had acquired or planned to acquire technology. That was primarily for expansion of their capacity. There was very little planning for replacement of existing equipment. Therefore, what we are building in this country is a very hard core of ageing equipment. Over 60 per cent of those companies were not investing nor planning to invest in new technology. Anecdotal evidence would suggest that that situation has got a heck of a lot worse in the last 18 months, particularly in the last six months. </PARA>
<PARA> If we compare ourselves with overseas, Australia has only half of the investment rate in technology of the United States of America-and we wonder why we do badly. We are significantly behind Canada, a country that in many ways is comparable to this country. We are appallingly poor versus Japan or Europe. We have that special problem of large numbers of small firms. There are many obstacles blocking our way to implementing innovation and new technology in Australia. Government handouts perpetuate many of the problems, but they do not actually fix them. For example, our problems include lack of skilled personnel and the interrelated economic difficulties that I have already mentioned. There is a lack of commitment to training from the schools sector upwards. </PARA>
<PARA> Entrenched organisational and management problems and attitudes are endemic in all but a few of our companies. Australia's geographical, cultural and commercial isolation from the manufacturing heartland is a problem. Canada has a big manufacturing heartland right next door in America. If it wants some support it is just a short stone's throw away. Here, we are very isolated. Those sorts of problems are not overcome by the financial drop in the bucket provided under this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Our poor industrial relations practices mean a low return on any investment in technology. We can only work it for a part of the day and we find that we still have to man up to the sorts of levels that we had before we installed the technology anyway. Our accounting techniques and investment strategies, even the way we handle the books, are all outdated. We all know the saying, `Smoking is hazardous to your health'. I suggest that there is a view held by many in the commercial community that `Australian accounting practices are hazardous to your wealth'. </PARA>
<PARA> Playing with numbers and shuffling bits of paper does not resolve the core problems. Australian industry is underinvesting relative to its competitors. Of course, we have some unique problems, but so do most other countries. We also have some unique advantages here. </PARA>
<PARA> Innovation and technology are part of a total scenario. It is that larger canvas that needs to be addressed. I am sorry to say that this Bill that we are looking at tonight is but a mere sideshow: it just does not address the substantive issues that we have troubling us in this country. I believe that the measures proposed in the Bill are but a drop in the ocean compared with what really needs to be done to stimulate the economy of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Instead of literally trying to pick winning ideas from amongst the firms asking for handouts under the grants for industry research and development scheme and various other schemes, why is the Government not providing that greater and more meaningful help? For example, we should be looking to reduce tax on the inputs going into our export industries. We should be reducing overall rates of tax for companies so that they do not have to hand away their profits and can reinvest in research and development. We should be reducing personal rates of tax to return some incentive to all Australians to work harder and to save more. Why is the Government not cutting the cost of doing business, not only to the client companies of these schemes-these schemes that are proposed in this Bill-but to all Australian business by delivering waterfront reform, by implementing land transport reform, by getting on with the industrial relations reform, by sorting out that terrible and disgraceful trans-Tasman shipping rort situation, by getting on with the building of the third Sydney runway instead of prevaricating, and delivering real communication cost reductions instead of creating a monstercom duopoly? We all know what the inevitable result of that charade will be. The list is almost endless. The Government has been told countless times. When we get the statement from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) tomorrow we will get a lot of dressing, but I doubt whether we will get too much substance. </PARA>
<PARA> The bottom line is that the measures in this Bill may do some good to some companies, and thus Australia may derive some overall benefit. However, the substance is that it is just tinkering at the edges. The Government should be tackling the big issues which would have a significant impact for the better by encouraging innovation across the board. Until that happens, this country will continue to go down the economic gurgler at an alarming rate. The Government's role is to provide long term investment in research, in education and in human capital. It must educate management as well as the unions and it must assist with overseas marketing intelligence. Its role is not to pick winners by bringing a particular product or a particular process to market or the indirect funding of that with taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA> As my colleague the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran) has already indicated, the coalition will support the Bill so that industry is not suddenly left high and dry; but we have proposed an amendment. This is consistent with the position that we took on the export market development grants scheme and the computer bounty scheme. We believe that industry must know where it stands. </PARA>
<PARA> Pending the introduction of proper micro-economic and taxation measures, we will support the continuation of the scheme until the expiration dates currently published. However, industry should be aware that we will not commit ourselves to the further continuation of these schemes after those dates. Such measures should by then be superfluous, because the introduction of the measures I have outlined tonight by a coalition government will deliver an immeasurably better business climate and deliver it to Australian industry across the board. That, of course, is what this Government should be doing right now and, in particular, tomorrow. The fact that it has not done so and will not do so means that it will stand condemned in the eyes of the world, stand condemned in the eyes of Australian business and stand condemned in the eyes of Australian electors; and they will not forget. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to have the opportunity to rise this evening to speak on the Industry, Technology and Commerce Legislation Amendment Bill because it certainly does provide for a continuation of the Government's commitment to research and development, contrary to what my colleagues opposite might suggest. One particular area that I would like to pick up initially is in relation to the national procurement development program (NPDP) agreement. I am particularly pleased to see that it has been included in this Bill. In my view, it is a very important part of this Bill because of the effects it has on a lot of our individual electorates as far as government purchasing is concerned. It is also important because I understand that it has been expanded to include the States and Territories. I think that will assist in a lot of ways.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The national procurement development program has now been expanded to formally include participation of the States and territories, as I have mentioned. The national program builds on the success of the initial Commonwealth program which was established in 1987. The program actually uses government purchasing leverage to assist the development of local industry capability. In my own electorate, where we have a very large military base-which I have mentioned previously in this place; I have mentioned it quite often-my local development corporation, the West Moreton Regional Development Corporation, has used every opportunity in that area to ensure that local businesses get their fair share of government purchases from such government establishments as a military base. </PARA>
<PARA> Local businesses are moving very dramatically and taking every opportunity they can to expand in that area. The NPDP provides for cooperation between the parties in financial support, administration and promotion of the program. The States and Territories have actually committed some $2m to the program's cooperation in the first year, while Commonwealth funding will be $7.2m and $7.4m respectively for the first and second years. The grants-based scheme supports research, development, trialing and demonstration of innovative Australian products relevant to the future procurement requirements of these government bodies in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The products must also promise sustainable competitive advantage in international markets. Because the government purchasing market is large, and because government purchasing agencies recognise leading edge users of technology intensive products, this market provides a strong domestic base for the development of technology intensive industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Government procurement can also act as a powerful catalyst to product acceptance on domestic and export markets. Government assistance, with trialing and demonstration, helps support Australian technology firms through pre-production and market development phases that can present them with major problems. The program, of course, has been well received by industry and government purchasing agencies alike. Fifty-six products have actually been funded, to a total value of $16.9m, since the start of that program.</PARA>
<PARA> I have been very pleased to be associated with a number of committees in this place and we have been able to move around the different areas and look at what has been done in many of our research areas. We are certainly a clever country, when we see all of the things that our scientists do in many fields, particularly those in the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). I draw the attention of the House to the fact that this Bill will extend to CSIRO the ability to accept gifts of $1m without reference to the Minister. I think that is important and it will certainly help people in the CSIRO. When one considers the way that that organisation is structured now, it is an innovative way of assisting scientists to develop new products. I think we should all be very proud of our scientists in many fields. Emphasis has also been put on science in education, hence research and development opportunities have been provided. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that we take every opportunity we can so that we can call ourselves the clever country. Of course, many of our well-educated scientists are clever. We have often been criticised for not giving these people every opportunity, but they certainly have great opportunities in Australia and the Government is very committed to assisting them in every way it can. We often hear honourable members opposite knocking the Government on various policy aspects. I think if Australia is going to continue to be the clever country-that is probably a better way of putting it-and expand our opportunities we really do need to take advantage of every opportunity and to be innovative and supportive of one another.</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to my own local development corporation, which I talked about before. It has really developed over the last couple of years. It has been innovative and has taken every opportunity it can to expand. Even though we are experiencing tough times, it amazes me that I see reports in my local newspaper which suggest that things are expanding in our area when other areas are having all sorts of problems. I pat the local chairman and manager of the organisation on the back for the opportunities they have taken. As I mentioned before, only last Friday, the Air Force base held a breakfast-unfortunately, I could not get home in time to go to it-and got over 100 local business people there to explain to them the opportunities available to them in taking advantage of government contracts. That comes back to the point I mentioned earlier: it is important to take advantage of every opportunity. In order to expand, we must not only research and develop our ideas but also take the opportunity to market those ideas. As a member of parliament I have had the opportunity to visit areas where sometimes there seems to be a stopgap between the research and development of ideas and the marketing of those ideas.</PARA>
<PARA> I pick up a point which the honourable member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) made before about the ability to finance projects. A lot of businesses seem to run into difficulty in ensuring that adequate finance is obtained-either through the existing banking systems that we have today or even through joint ventures. Certainly, we need to look more towards joint ventures. Perhaps even some of our enterprising banks or finance companies need to start looking at expanding into that area and actually going into the joint ventures themselves-I understand that that happens in some European countries-so that finance is involved as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, workers' participation in the decision making process is extremely important; for instance, having workers included on the boards of various companies enables them to see how the companies operate. I know that that sort of process operates in Scandinavian countries. It gives workers a greater opportunity to actually see what happens in the decision making process, rather than locking the workers out of it. Instead of trying to keep our workers in the dark, so to speak, we should be involving them more in the decision making process to ensure that they understand why companies have to make the decisions they do. Quite often, it is the chap from the shop floor who can have a very important input into what a particular business should be doing as far as developing various ideas. I do not think we always use the great abilities that we have in our work force. People may be sitting behind a desk, making decisions and drawing up plans, but there is nothing like hands-on experience.</PARA>
<PARA> I think industry must look further and, instead of taking the opportunity to knock the workers, particularly in tough times when we always seem to turn around and say, `Oh well, we'll just have to cut someone's wages', perhaps we should have a good talk to the workers. We should be saying, `How can we help? Have you people got any good ideas?' because, generally speaking, many workers have the right ideas. I think industry could go a long way by looking at the models which have already been suggested by the Australian Council of Trade Unions through its Australia Reconstructed proposals and the like. We need to involve all Australians in expanding Australia and we need to take every opportunity we can to develop our products and the intelligence of our people, because I believe we are a clever nation. I see young people today in the various schools that I have the opportunity to visit and I know which areas they wish to be expanded. In the science and engineering fields, which they speak about, we really have a great future ahead of us as long as we can ensure that we use the greatest resource we have. Of course, that is our people. </PARA>
<PARA> They have a lot to offer and it is essential that we take every opportunity to make sure that we do not waste their skills or give them disincentives, rather than active incentives, to progress. It is always a great tragedy when our people have to move offshore in order to expand their opportunities-although I do not see anything really wrong with them moving offshore from time to time to get experience, broaden their horizons and bring back to Australia the opportunities that arise overseas. One can often learn a lot from one's neighbours and that is an important part of the learning process.</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill before us-whilst it does not change anything dramatically-certainly extends our commitment to research and development. I am pleased to see that the Opposition, although reluctantly, is prepared to accept it-even though its amendment is probably more of a stumbling block than a real, innovative idea. This Bill is a continuation of the Government's commitment to research and development and to assisting industry in every way we can. I hope that future Opposition speakers will be more enthusiastic in their contributions than they have been tonight in saying that they reluctantly support the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned before the opportunities we have in the area of government purchases. That is an important point I wanted to home in on because I do not think we always take every opportunity available to us in that area. I think that is one way in which our local industries can expand and, at the same time, actually generate some industries and develop some products which they can push on the export market. They do need that assistance and I hope that, with that continued support, they will take the opportunity. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SJ4">Mr TUCKEY</NAME><ELECTORATE>(O'Connor)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.30)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Recently the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) was incorrectly reported with regard to some remarks he made about the future of company tax. Notwithstanding a published correction, the Australian Labor Party went into a frenzy of accusations-most of which were erroneous-regarding the outcome of any reduction in company tax. In fact, it wanted to paint companies as being groups of people who make huge profits and therefore hurt other people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have long held the view that, with few exceptions, company tax has never been a tax upon the institution of a company, but a tax upon the consumers of the goods or services such a company provides. I have consequently always corresponded with those who urged the increase of company tax to inform them of this fact. My reasoning is based on a simple, much publicised fact which is simply that companies declare profit or dividend after tax. Because they must end up with sufficient surplus to pay dividends to their shareholders, companies simply factor income tax into their cost structure and pass it on to consumers of their goods or services. </PARA>
<PARA> If the company is an exporter, then the consumer, who then has a discretion as to where he buys his goods around the world, sometimes refuses to pay the resulting price, thus denying that company and Australia valuable exports and the resulting jobs-which is hardly a desirable outcome. </PARA>
<PARA> In last Thursday's Australian Financial Review this principle was further proved when a correspondent discussed the tax regime on fuel products. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Petroleum Institute, and the Prices Surveillance Authority, State and Federal, say taxes are 39.7c a litre. </PARA>
<PARA>Oil companies concede that company taxes added makes the overall figure 70c in the dollar at the pump. </PARA>
<PARA>That clearly indicates that the oil companies see their company taxes as being passed on to consumers. However, I have now been joined in my position by the eminent economist and columnist Padraic, otherwise known as Paddy McGuinness, who has written an article entitled `This tax business is poor company' in the 30 November issue of the Australian. I would like to quote some of the things he had to say. First, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Research into the incidence of taxation in Australia is not as yet highly developed. But it is a fact that the greater part of company taxes is not paid by companies at all, but by the purchasers of the goods and services produced by companies. To a greater or lesser degree, company income tax is passed on to other companies and, directly or indirectly, to consumers. </PARA>
<PARA>In a later part of the article he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Like sales taxes, tariffs and excise taxes, company taxes are therefore really taxes on consumers-and, as such, they hit the poorest members of the community hardest. To the extent that they do not, they hit small business (always facing a highly competitive market) and exporters. Why then do we insist on the levying of company taxes?</PARA>
<PARA>In another part he said:</PARA>
<PARA>But it means that it is totally senseless, in the name of hitting the rich and helping the poor, to increase rates of company tax. Moreover, such is the complexity of the company tax system and deductions for costs incurred (borrowings, depreciation on capital investments, etc) that enormous resources are devoted to minimising the total tax burdens on companies so that they do not have to share the advantages of their market power with the Tax Office. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course he is simply pointing out there the cost and the waste that goes with trying to avoid a tax that may be better not applied. He went to say:</PARA>
<PARA>So the question has to be asked, why bother to tax companies at all? If we had a comprehensive goods and services tax, together with an effective scale of personal income taxes, it is quite clear that no one would be able to avoid paying their share of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA>In another part of the article he said:</PARA>
<PARA>As Professor John Fairbairn pointed out in a paper published already last week by the Economic Planning Advisory Council-</PARA>
<PARA>the Government's own body-</PARA>
<PARA>the existing tax system produces a bias against investment in business, fixed assets and stocks, especially in inflationary circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on with a lot of other remarks. </PARA>
<PARA> I just point out that it is time that the Parliament, the Government and the Leader of the Opposition further progressed this situation. If the Government's present imputation system were reversed, and instead of taxing companies and passing the tax benefit to shareholders, it did not tax the companies but taxed any distribution of profit made in any way, it would be the investor who got the profit-the shareholder is the profit taker, not the company, because the company only sees tax as part of its cost of production-and we would have a system where the business community could get on with developing and creating jobs and when it paid a profit, the profit would be taxed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I bring to the attention of this House the plight of the people of the southern Sudan, which has been substantially overlooked with the world preoccupied with other events. I have been shaken from my own relative ignorance on the subject by two constituents in Adelaide, Ben Yengi and Mariano Ngor, both of whom are from the Sudan and who are working to improve knowledge of the sufferings of their people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since winning independence from Britain in 1956, the Sudan has been wracked by internal conflict for all but 11 years between 1972 and 1983. This is perhaps hardly surprising in a country that is so diverse and that had been previously ruled by a colonial power that had used divide-and-conquer tactics.</PARA>
<PARA> The current bout of turmoil stems from the abrogation in 1983 of the Addis Ababa accords, which in 1972 had laid the basis for an uneasy truce between the north and south of the country. The north is populated predominantly by Arabs and adherents of Islam, and the south by African people who are either Christian or of more traditional faiths. </PARA>
<PARA> The abrogation of the 1972 accords, coupled with the imposition by the national government of Islamic law, has introduced a very difficult situation for the peoples of the southern Sudan. Non-Muslims have become virtual non-citizens and, despite their adherence to alternative faiths, have become subject to the full force of a religion-based legal system which, as we know, prescribes rather severe penalties which range from amputation for petty theft to stoning for adultery. If non-Muslims managed not to stray from the path of righteousness, they were nonetheless vulnerable to enslavement, state-sanctioned violence and persecution. </PARA>
<PARA> There has also been a rather ferocious crack-down on the intelligentsia in Khartoum. Its prisons appear to be full of trade unionists, politicians, doctors, lawyers and academics. Understandably, these developments have led to the development of political instability and the formation of the Sudan People's Liberation Movement (SPLM), which is not intent on seeking secession for the southern Sudan, but for a more democratic and representative form of government in Khartoum. Unfortunately, there has been extensive fighting between the Government and the SPLM since 1983. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that Khartoum has waged a particularly vigorous war against the southerners, and I suppose we might expect that from a government which has been armed by Saddam Hussein and Muammar Gadaffi and which sprang to the support of Baghdad when it invaded Kuwait. Here, of course, it was in particularly bad company with the Palestine Liberation Organisation, Yemen, North Korea and eventually King Hussein of Jordan. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been fairly well documented cases of quite savage repression waged against the people of the southern Sudan, notably in March 1987 when the Government attempted to undermine support for the SPLM by orchestrating what appears to have been a deliberate massacre of the Dinka ethnic group by rival Arabic ethnic groups. It is reported that more than 1,000 people were murdered in the town of Dhein, situated in the central warring position between the north and the south. The Government, currently headed by Lieutenant-General Omer Hassan al Bashir, has also appeared to be resisting any efforts to provide emergency relief for those people in the southern part of the Sudan who are subject to this repression. There have been reports in the European press of bombing to disrupt the provision of emergency relief. </PARA>
<PARA> The substantial population disruption that has occurred as a result has led to large exoduses of people from the southern part of the Sudan to Ethiopia, Kenya, Zaire, Uganda and even elsewhere within the Sudan. It is a measure of the disaster that has been befallen these poor people that they have had to flee to areas which are also economic bread basket cases. They flee war and persecution as well as the famines which have been produced by droughts that have gone alongside these disruptions. Between 1988-89 as many as half a million people may have starved to death in a very extensive famine which, unlike that which occurred in Ethiopia a few years earlier, has not really attracted the attention of the world or of pop concerts. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention this issue as a tribute to my friends and constituents in Adelaide who have raised the matter with me, and I ask honourable members that they might note in the list of very sad cases, which I am afraid is very long, the cause of the people of the southern Sudan. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to pay tribute to a fine Australian who died in Mackay about two weeks ago. I say `a fine Australian' because he had a heritage which stemmed from the Solomon Islands, being one of the group of people we call Kanakas. His heritage goes right back to the early days of the blackbirding of 1873 when his grandfather was kidnapped and brought to Australia to work in the cane lands, it being the understanding at that time that only black people were worthy to work the cane and the white man could not do it. So from that humble origin, we have a class of people who are the ex-Solomon Islanders, called Kanakas, who have greatly enriched the heritage and traditions of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The person to whom I am paying tribute tonight, Noel Fatnowna, whose grandfather came to Mackay in 1873, not only served the community of Mackay but also served his fellow countrymen in such a way that he was held to be one of the community leaders of Mackay. I hold here a book which was written by him, Fragments of a Lost Heritage. It goes right through the history of the blackbirding to the repatriation of these people in the late 1800s, and it then relates how some of them came back voluntarily into the same areas as their parents had worked and settled in that region. These people never regarded themselves as second-class citizens; they always regarded themselves as being products of a very fine tradition, a very fine heritage that had been built up over the hundreds of years in the Solomon Islands. Today there would be thousands of these people within the Dawson electorate itself, let alone those other cane areas that they settled in at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> Noel Fatnowna was indeed a fine man. In fact, he was so enriched with his own culture that in 1973, just 100 years after his grandfather had come to Australia after being blackbirded, he went back to the Solomon Islands to try to find his own roots. In actual fact, this book, Fragments of a Lost Heritage, is very similar to the book Roots, in which the American African went back to try to find his beginnings. But it is such a pity that Noel, who was struck off in life at the early age of 61, was not allowed to fulfil his dreams and be given the retirement in Mackay that he would have dreamt of, because he had in mind writing a follow-up book to Fragments of a Lost Heritage. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to pay tribute to Noel Fatnowna's community service. I have mentioned that he was so interested in his culture, that he went back to the Solomon Islands in 1973. At the time of his death he was still working with the ambulance service in Mackay, with the community and within the church that he loved. It is a mark of the respect in which he was held not only by the ambulance service but also by the whole community that for his funeral service over 700 people turned up at the church; it was overfilled and people were spread out right through the hall next door. People who were there paying tribute to him were not only the community leaders who thought so much of him but also present, for instance, were the whole ambulance service, the police, the fire services and the church members with whom he was associated. All those attendant groups and individuals at his funeral paid tribute to a fine chap. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, it was only about five weeks ago that Noel saw me in the company of others in a bid to try to retain the ambulance services in Queensland in the manner in which they had been operating. In other words, the Mackay region was an independent service not associated with others, and was held together by 26,000 subscribers. Incidentally, one of the reasons Noel was so well known was that he was the collector of funds so often for this service. He was trying to keep the ambulance service as it has been instead of its passing to a central authority. In respect of the work that this man did for the ambulance service, I would like to think that the Queensland Premier and also the Minister responsible would look at this issue very carefully before implementing any change. </PARA>
<PARA> I just wish to pay this tribute and I think it is fitting that we should do it from the Parliament House of Australia because he was a man so deeply associated with it. I would also like to pay my respects by mentioning his wife, Minnie, and pass on honourable members' sad regrets at his passing to his children and also grandchildren. He was a fine Australian; he enriched Australian culture in the manner in which he became associated with it; and I pay those respects to him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Seymour-the lot of them. I think I have visited every location in the last five years, and the Committee always gets this contribution. I was therefore very disappointed today to read an article in the Australian about a defence housing project at Watsonia in Victoria. This project for 420 homes was approved or recommended by the Public Works Committee in May 1990. The statements contained in the article are truly outrageous. They consist of the usual claims that are made when racist elements are involved in any of these matters. The article talks about lowering housing prices, and one person referred to the development as `dog box stuff'. This is pure prejudice and ignorance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Anyone who has seen the plans put up for the Watsonia project and, indeed, any of the projects that the Defence Housing Authority is engaged in will know that most certainly it is not dog box stuff. My Committee very carefully examined the proposed development before recommending approval to Parliament. The development was designed by independent town planners and includes, as I said, 420 homes. There are homes and townhouses, and half of them will be sold off to the public. This is very much the Defence approach to housing projects at the moment. No longer are we going to have ghettos of defence personnel together; they will be integrated and are being integrated into the community.</PARA>
<PARA> This particular project is dotted with landscaped parks. It has a community centre and also a lake, which has been developed in conjunction with the drainage system there, I must say, and it also has a bike track. In fact, projects put to the Committee are always more sensitive to the environment and have more open space given to them than developments in general. I remember particularly this project because there was a stand of trees that some people were very concerned about. I did not think that they were anything great. In fact, I thought that it might have been better if they had come down, and I thought that they would soon come down. But so sensitive was the Defence Housing Authority, that it agreed to leave this not very attractive clump of trees there, and that contributed another open space to this development. </PARA>
<PARA> We had, during the hearing, representations from a pony club, and I see in the article today that the pony club is in it again. In my area, if I had a pony club whose land had been leased from the army at a peppercorn rent, I would not like to move either. But the Defence Housing Authority has agreed to give a very generous resettlement package to the pony club, and I really do not see why it is complaining about it at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The article goes on to talk about undesirable elements being brought in. I would like to say that these `undesirable elements' are the defence personnel who not only at any time are prepared to fight and defend this country and the liberties that we all enjoy, but as well are the personnel now coming back from the Gulf for whom we are having welcoming parades. Yet they are being referred to in this article or by some people dealing with the Watsonia project as `undesirable elements'. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, I visited all the defence housing accommodation in Australia. What the housing that people have had to put up with in the past is quite scandalous. Why should our defence personnel be expected to put up with second class housing? We call on these people, as we have recently done in relation to the Gulf, to do their duty for Australia. Why should defence personnel be put up in second class housing? I believe the Heidelberg Council will be considering this project this week and I hope that good sense will prevail and it will be approved. </PARA>

Union bid to save car jobs'. That reminds me of the saying that necessity is the mother of invention. The article states:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, there is something about no-strike contracts, as the honourable member for Higgins said. It is one of his platforms. On page 5 of the Herald-Sun, the headline reads, `Car harmony bid'. The article states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Car industry unions have proposed that workers sign peace pacts to help manufacturers survive. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> `It is now time for others in the industry to stop bleating about the tariff and asking `what is the Government doing for us?' and start saying `what can we do for ourselves, the industry and Australia?' '' Mr Ayres said. </PARA>
<PARA>That is good stuff; I agree with it all. The Daily Telegraph Mirror in Sydney had a similar story entitled, `Unions offer to save car industry'. This newspaper even gave the issue a mention in the editorial which mentioned the possibility of:</PARA>
<PARA>a uniquely Australian car for sale here and overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> No doubt manufacturers will permit themselves a wry smile in the latter suggestion. </PARA>
<PARA>Why would they not? I would like to know where John Halfpenny was when the SPC Ltd workers offered a radical plan to save their jobs. What did he say?-`No way, let them lose their jobs'. But now we find that SPC got its radical plan and it has had a 47 per cent productivity increase through workers and management getting together with our policy of voluntary employment agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> Today in the matter of public importance, the Opposition raised the problem of the waterfront and the transport industry. The Government did not quite like that. The unions of the waterfront and the transport industry could not care less about productivity or about the exporters of this country. They are prepared to commit industrial rape on those farmers in my electorate and right around Australia who are making wealth for this country. When are the unions going to get the message that Australians have to work together for productivity, for the betterment of this country, instead of taking the narrow-minded action which makes them so inefficient and our exporters pay so dearly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to refer to a couple of events which occurred in my electorate two Saturdays ago which reflect the heritage and significance of the area. In particular, I refer to the centenary of the Wentworthville Public School which a huge crowd of people attended and which was notable because it gave an opportunity for us all to reflect back on 100 years of public education in that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That event was a tribute to the principal of the school, Mr Harry Hyland, and the School Centenary Committee who worked so well to ensure a large crowd of past and present students attended. One lady who came to the ceremony attended the school in 1912, which is a pretty substantial achievement. She has seen a great deal of history in the making as she has watched the progression of the community there. I pay tribute to all those associated with that particular school centenary event which was well attended and a major achievement in our community. </PARA>
<PARA> On that same day in the adjoining suburb of Toongabbie, there was a ceremony to mark the Irish uprising which occurred at Constitution Hill in Toongabbie in 1804. That was also a very important ceremony because it commemorated one of those special events in Australian history, perhaps comparable with something like the Eureka Stockade, which really helped to set much of the early colonial flavour that the colony enjoyed. </PARA>
<PARA> This Irish point is a valid one because we did have His Excellency the Ambassador attend the ceremony and also Professor Patrick O'Farrell, who gave a very interesting address to all those assembled for the commemoration of the Irish uprising on that day. He pointed out some of the difficulties that were experienced in the early colony. It was particularly interesting for many of us whose ancestors were Irish. As Professor O'Farrell said on this occasion, they were really made an offer they could not in all conscience refuse-an invitation to visit Australia-in those early days. </PARA>
<PARA> Those ceremonies are significant for a number of reasons, but in particular tonight I refer to the fact that where the ceremony was held on Constitution Hill in Toongabbie is probably one of the highest points in the whole of the Sydney metropolitan area. It is a very steep hill and from there one gets a panoramic view of the whole of the city of Sydney, right back to the bridge and the harbour. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention these things because at the moment this particular land is leased from the Water Board as public recreation space. That particular lease has only a couple of years to run and there is a lot of concern in the local community that the land might be sold off and public use denied at the end of the lease the Water Board has entered into. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the history of the site at Constitution Hill along with Vinegar Hill in the western part of Sydney represent important landmarks in Australia's colonial history. They should be permanently retained as publicly available, publicly dedicated parkland. The land should be properly treated as the significant heritage item it is and it should be ensured that it retains its public ownership. The people of the Toongabbie-Wentworthville area can then have the opportunity to enjoy this land not only on the occasion of the ceremony they hold each year to mark this particular anniversary, but at other times as well. </PARA>
<PARA> I know this issue is of concern to the people who organise the Irish uprising ceremony on that day. The chairman of the committee, Peter Whiteoak; the secretary, Alderman Elaine Evans; and the many other people who turn up are determined to ensure that the New South Wales Government, as requested, takes a proper stance so that when this lease arrangement that the Water Board has over this heritage site comes up for reconsideration, the site will be made available to the people of the local community for their enjoyment. </PARA>
<PARA> I say in passing that these things are important because later this year Toongabbie celebrates a unique event. It is the third-oldest settlement in the original colony of New South Wales. In October, another special event to commemorate that is being held. A special weekend of activities is planned by the same committee and I think it would be a fitting gesture for the future of the site to be identified at that time. </PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1734" SPEAKER="Keating The Hon P.J." NAMEID="NH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="CORIO" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr Keating</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> 1. Part III of the Financial Corporations Act 1974 gives the Reserve Bank the power to collect statistics from corporations subject to the Act.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The information collected under the Financial Corporations (Statistics) Regulations dated 18 May 1984 varies for the different categories of corporations. For building societies it includes aggregated statistics on lending and borrowing, selected liabilities, assets, interest rates and selected maturity dissection of borrowings.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The Act requires that statistics prepared by corporations under Part III be verified by a statutory declaration made by a senior officer of the corporation.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The Act relates to financial corporations which engage in the borrowing and lending of money in a major way and whose assets exceed $1 million. Certain classes of corporations are exempt from the legislation, including public authorities, authorised banks, terminating building societies, friendly or benefit societies, medical benefits organisations, life and general insurance companies and trustee companies.</PARA>
<PARA> 2 &amp;3. My Department is not informed about the liquidity or viability of financial corporations as a matter of course. There is, however, a close working relationship between the Treasury and the Reserve Bank and the Bank keeps it informed of developments relevant to the stability of the financial system. Moreover, the Secretary to the Treasury, as a member of the Reserve Bank Board, receives such information as is provided to other Board members arising from the Bank's surveillance of the financial system.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. I am informed that the Reserve Board receives regular reports on developments affecting the bank and non-bank sectors of the finance industry, and that the information relates to the operations of industry sectors, groups of organisations in a single group and individual entities.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. (a) Yes, as (i) and (ii);</PARA>
<PARA> (b) (c) Yes, as (i) and (ii);</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Yes, as an individual entity but from a corporation entitled Countrywide Building Society.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) Yes, as an individual entity but from a corporation entitled Commercial Credit Co-operative Limited.</PARA>
<PARA> (f) Yes, but predominantly building societies in the Group (there are other financial intermediaries).</PARA>
<PARA> 6. I am informed that the Reserve Bank had some discussions about the operations of the Farrow Group with the responsible State authorities. (See responses to parts 9 and 10). These discussions arose from concerns evident in sections of the market.</PARA>
<PARA> 7. The Governor of the Reserve Bank and I regularly discuss economic and financial developments. These discussions may include problems in particular parts of the financial system if the Governor or I believe that to be appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA> 8. The Governor and I discuss the state of the economy on a regular basis and we talk face to face or by telephone whenever particular matters warrant it.</PARA>
<PARA> 9. The Bank has told me that it had been generally aware for some time that the Farrow Group of building societies was exposed to a higher-than-normal operating risk because of its high rate of growth, its exposures to the commercial property sector, and its interest rate policy. Such information as was available to the Reserve Bank, however, was not an adequate basis on which to make considered judgements about the societies' viability.</PARA>
<PARA> 10, 11, 12. I did not know of the financial difficulties of the Farrow group of building societies prior to the release of a statement by the Victorian Treasurer on 13 February 1990 concerning Pyramid Building Society.</PARA>
<PARA> The only advice received by my office prior to 13 February 1990 was a minute dated 12 February which referred to an article on Pyramid that had appeared in the Sunday Herald on 11 February which stated that there had been small net withdrawals from the Society.</PARA>
<PARA> That advice could not be considered knowledge of Pyramid's difficulties. In the event the minute was not drawn to my attention as it was not considered such a serious issue at the time.</PARA>
<PARA> 13. The Reserve Bank has informed me that it had discussions with Victorian Government officials on a number of occasions:</PARA>
<PARA> - on 12 and 13 February 1990-talks initiated by Victorian Office of Management and Budget in relation to its concerns about the risk of a run on Pyramid Building Society and its inquiry about the RBA's policy on liquidity support for building societies.</PARA>
<PARA> - On 15 and 20 February 1990-talks with Victorian Registrar of Co-operative Financial Institutions, initiated by RBA, to inquire about Farrow's efforts to arrange additional lines of support.</PARA>
<PARA> - On 21 February 1990-talks initiated by Victorian Office of Management and Budget to mention Farrow's liquidity difficulties and problems of securing support from banks.</PARA>
<PARA> 14. I understand the Farrow Group had discussions with various financial institutions about possible lines of credit. The Reserve Bank has told me it was not party to any such discussions but it made known to banks and to the Victorian Government its longstanding and on-going policy of willingness to provide necessary liquidity support to banks which choose to lend to well-managed and viable non-bank financial institutions.</PARA>
<PARA> 15. Not applicable; as indicated in the response to part 14, the Reserve Bank did not give its support to the provision of a line of credit to the Farrow Group.</PARA>
<PARA> 16. The Reserve Bank informs me it did not meet with the Victorian Government in late March or early April 1990. There were, however, numerous discussions between various representatives of the Bank and the Victorian Government during the period from February to June 1990. These were primarily to keep the Bank informed of events as they developed; the Bank did not offer the advice mentioned in the question. I did not participate in any of the Reserve Bank's discussions.</PARA>
<PARA> 17. Not applicable (refer to the response to part 16).</PARA>
<PARA> 18. The Reserve Bank has informed me it did not receive a copy of an audit report by Day, Neilson, Jenkins and Johns; it did receive a copy of Price Waterhouse's summary of its review of the Farrow Corporation Limited group.</PARA>
<PARA> 19. The question is based on an incorrect premise. The Reserve Bank did not see the first document referred to. It neither accepted nor rejected the latter.</PARA>
<PARA> 20. The Reserve Bank does not have the power to intervene in the operations or management of non-bank financial institutions. Its long-standing policy is not to provide financial support to financial institutions it does not supervise.</PARA>
<PARA> 21. I am informed that Farrow Corporation did not make application to become a bank. However, in January 1990, Farrow Corporation indicated to the Reserve Bank an intention to seek a banking licence in the medium term (3-5 years) if certain State legislative restrictions on its activities were not removed. The Bank offered no advice on its equity level, accounts or management arrangements. On 11 May 1990, an officer of Farrow Corporation arranged for Mr Farrow to meet with the Chief of Financial System Division of the Bank on 24 May, purportedly to discuss the possibility of a banking authority. The appointment was cancelled by Mr Farrow on 23 May.</PARA>
<PARA> 22. No. Part IV was seen as providing reserve powers over financial corporations to be used, if necessary, for monetary policy, rather than prudential supervision, purposes. The powers were broadly equivalent to those applicable to banks covered in the Banking Act. Monetary policy no longer relies on these powers in the Banking Act but is exercised through open market operations. Recourse to Part IV of the Financial Corporations Act is not, therefore, relevant.</PARA>
<PARA> I would add that Part IV powers, even if involved, would be deficient for prudential supervision purposes. The Part does not contain provisions relating to the financial stability of corporations, or the protection of depositors; nor does it contain requirements for ensuring standards of financial soundness and the prudent operations of non-bank financial institutions.</PARA>
<PARA> 23. Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> 24. Except for deposits with the Commonwealth Bank, depositors' funds held by authorised banks are not guaranteed by the Commonwealth against loss.</PARA>
<PARA> 25. No. The Banking Act imposes on the Reserve Bank certain responsibilities in relation to the protection of bank depositors.</PARA>
<PARA> 26. Apart from financial securities which the Commonwealth itself has on issue (eg Government bonds, Treasury notes), the Commonwealth does not guarantee ``forms of deposit investment''. Commonwealth guarantees do, however, apply to the liabilities and/or borrowings of some specific entities. Of these, only the Commonwealth Bank and the Australian Industry Development Corporation (AIDC) accept at call deposits from the public. Other entities whose liabilities or borrowings are underwritten to varying degrees by the Government include AUSTRADE, the Australian Wheat Board and the Australian Wool Corporation. Individual borrowings by some other statutory authorities and government owned bodies may also be guaranteed by the Commonwealth. Such borrowings could involve the issue of financial securities in which the public may invest.</PARA>
<PARA> 27. I have regular discussions about economic and financial developments with both the Reserve Bank Governor and the Secretary to the Treasury. There have however been no particular discussions concerning the state of Victorian building societies.</PARA>
<PARA> 28. I receive many requests for meetings during the course of a year, but there is no record of any such contact with the Farrow Corporation in 1990.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No, it is not a fact. Humanitarian and development assistance to South Africans disadvantaged by apartheid and to representative black groups of up to $17 million over the next three years was announced in May 1990. No new funding was committed to this program during Mr Mandela's visit to Australia late last year.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The Australian Government has long accepted the practical reality that the ANC is foremost amongst the authentic black leadership of South Africa. We have refrained, however, from recognising the ANC as the sole and legitimate representative of the black majority as, despite the support that is obviously commanded by the ANC, other groups such as the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) and Inkatha have a claim to represent elements of black opinion in South Africa.</PARA>
<PARA> Other groups have in the past benefited from Australian Government assistance under the SAPSA program and will continue to do so depending on compliance with SAPSA guidelines and the availability of funds. $2 million has already been set aside over the next three years for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) (i) Provisos on the assistance fall within the existing SAPSA program guidelines, copies of which are available in the Parliamentary Library or from the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QE4">Mr Beddall</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) There are at least three manufacturers of synthetic fur fabric in Australia. In addition there are numerous manufacturers of knitted pile fabric which is considered a close substitute to synthetic fur fabric.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) I am unable to give a definitive answer as quality is a characteristic which requires subjective judgement.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Tariff Concession Orders are granted where Customs is satisfied that goods serving similar functions are not produced or are not capable of being produced in Australia in the normal course of business.</PARA>
<PARA> Locally produced goods are considered to serve similar functions to imported goods if they compete or have the potential to compete in the market place.</PARA>
<PARA> It is the degree of competition, not the quality of the products, which determines whether a Tariff Concession Order is granted. The onus is on the applicant to show there is no competition with locally produced goods.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) UNESCO Financial Regulations require that once the General Conference has adopted the budget, the Director-General shall ask member states to remit one half of their contributions for the two-year financial period. At the end of the first calender year of the two-year financial period the Director-General asks member states to remit the other half of their contributions for the financial period. Contributions are due in full within 30 days of the receipt of the Director-General's request for payment or on the first day of the year to which they relate, whichever is the later. As of 1 January of the following year the unpaid balance of contributions is considered one year in arrears.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) See 1.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Australia's contribution to UNESCO in 1990 was $5,451,006. Allowing for currency fluctuations and a small overpayment in 1990 (credited to the 1991 payment), a similar contribution will be made in 1991.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) In past years Australia has paid its contribution in January of the year in which it is due. However, for domestic budgetary reasons the 1991 contribution has been delayed until July 1991.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) No. See (1) above for an explanation of financial procedures. As Australia's 1991 contribution will be paid in July 1991 it will not be in arrears.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Of the ten major contributors Japan (assessed contribution for 1990 US$29,280,898) and Brazil (US$3,721,928) are the only member states that have not paid their contributions for 1990 and are therefore in arrears. As at 31 August 1990, the date of the last consolidated report on the status of collection of contributions, Brazil owed US$3,142,907 in contributions due before 1990.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) The drug fenoterol hydrobromide (Berotec is the brand name) was deleted from the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme as a result of a recommendation to that effect by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee (PBAC).</PARA>
<PARA> The data which the PBAC considered prior to making its recommendation did include the results of two New Zealand studies which indicated an increase in mortality associated with the use of fenoterol.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to its continued availability on the market, the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (which makes recommendations in relation to marketing approval) did not recommend withdrawal but, instead, that use of fenoterol should be limited to patients with mild to moderate asthma. The matter of availability of drugs with or without prescription is one for State drug scheduling committees.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The 1990-91 Budget provided for a reduction in outlays on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) of $148.6m due to the introduction of the $2.50 pensioner charge and associated safety net arrangements, with an offsetting increase of $169.4m in Social Security pension payments. The estimated full year effect of these changes in 1991-92 was $323.2m and $291.8m respectively. These figures are published on pages 3.11 and 3.15 of Budget Paper No 1.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) It is not yet possible to indicate the actual savings being achieved in the PBS. As a result of the usual delays associated with submission and processing of pharmacists claims for payments under the PBS and the short term distortion in payment trends resulting from the substantial hoarding of prescription drugs by pensioners prior to the introduction of the $2.50 charge, analysis of several months of claims payment data will be required before there is a reasonable basis to review the estimated savings.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> 1 (a) &amp;(b) The Australian and New Zealand (ANZ) supplies policy aims to maximise opportunities for ANZ suppliers to compete for Commonwealth business on the basis of value for money. The policy is explained in Commonwealth Procurement Guideline No. 12. Amongst other things, the ANZ supplies policy encourages Commonwealth buyers to consider the advantages which ANZ suppliers can offer over their offshore counterparts. The policy does not, however, automatically reward suppliers because their products are of ANZ origin, nor does it discriminate on the basis of ownership of a supplier. Under the current policy, there are therefore no local content requirements which must be met by suppliers to the Government.</PARA>
<PARA> Contracts for purchases for which Requests for Tender were issued before 1 November 1989, however, continue to finality in accordance with the previous policy, which gave a margin of preference to ANZ content. In contracts established under that policy, contractors are obliged by contract conditions to maintain at least the levels claimed in their tenders for the life of the contract.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) A `supplier list' is a register of known suppliers of goods and services. Its function is to provide buyers with information about suppliers of goods and services which they buy regularly.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (b) A `panel contract list' is a list of suppliers selected to supply certain goods and/or services to the Commonwealth. Its function is to provide buyers with a list of suppliers that have been selected to supply certain goods and/or services to the Commonwealth at agreed prices and conditions.</PARA>
<PARA> 3 (a) (i) Suppliers may apply to buying agencies to be included in any registers of suppliers which the agencies may maintain.</PARA>
<PARA> 3 (a) (ii) A supplier must offer its goods and/or services in response to a Request for Offer or similar. If the goods and/or services are determined (see response to 3 (c) (ii)) to provide value-for-money options for the Commonwealth, the supplier is included in the panel.</PARA>
<PARA> 3 (b) The main benefit to common use `panel contract' suppliers is direct access to Commonwealth agencies and other approved users on the basis that their goods and/or services have been evaluated as offering value for money. They are thus generally able to avoid further detailed and complex technical evaluations. In addition, each agency subject to the Audit Act and Finance Regulations is required to use `common use contracts' arranged or approved by the Department of Administrative Services where they meet the agency's needs. Other benefits include free marketing to Commonwealth agencies through the Period Contract Awareness Service (PCAS), and the distinction of having been awarded a Government contract.</PARA>
<PARA> 3 (c) (ii) See response to 3 (a) (i).</PARA>
<PARA> 3 (c) (ii) To be selected on a `panel contract' a supplier must satisfy the requirements of the Commonwealth and demonstrate that the goods and/or services offered are value-for-money options for the Commonwealth. The evaluation methodology and evaluation criteria used to assess value for money vary for each list but should be published at the time offers are sought.</PARA>
<PARA> 4 Under the previous policy, local content was calculated, on a `build-down' basis, by deducting from the total net tender price:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the value of imported components and materials from third countries (i.e. not from Australia or New Zealand);</PARA>
<PARA> (b) selling, distribution and installation expenses; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) pre-tax net profit margin.</PARA>
<PARA> Despite this approach, some reliance on `build-up' analysis remained unavoidable when ANZ content claims needed verifying.</PARA>
<PARA> There are several large contracts for computer equipment which have not yet expired and to which these procedures still apply. For example, a comprehensive audit of small computer systems supplied under a number of Commonwealth contracts (including PE40, the `common-use panel contract' for the supply of small computing systems) is presently being undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA> 5 See response to 1.</PARA>
<PARA> 6 As Kambrook is a supplier under PE40, the local content of Kambrook's personal computer range is presently being audited. However, the audit is incomplete at this time and it would be inappropriate to pre-empt its outcome. Kambrook has not claimed 50 to 60 per cent local content for its personal computer products.</PARA>
