<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Treasurer. I refer the Treasurer to the fact that, with the approval of Mr Bannon, the State Government Insurance Commission of South Australia faces outlays of anything up to $520m, or one-third of its assets, on one single project and that the South Australian State Government has been forced to establish an inquiry into the SGIC. Is the Treasurer aware of this additional aspect of the crisis in South Australia's finances and will the Commonwealth Government, in the interests of national financial stability, participate with the South Australian Government on how best to resolve South Australia's financial problems?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think that South Australia has a financial problem of crisis proportions. That was the honourable member's claim-as he claimed last week about the possible collapse of the bank, with scant regard to the interests of the depositors, many of whom would be his constituents. The fact of the matter is that the South Australian Government has done the sensible thing and told the public about the problems and then said how it is going to repair them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition continues to ask these questions as though the problems of a State are the problems of the Commonwealth Government-that is, the Constitution does not exist; constitutional responsibilities do not exist. There is a manic attempt to try to sheet back to this Government the problems of various State banks and State instrumentalities. The fact of the matter is that not one dollar--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Treasurer aware of comments by the newly appointed Secretary to the Treasury, Mr Tony Cole, that it is nonsense to suggest that a consumption tax would have a significant impact on net savings in Australia? What are the Government's intentions on this matter?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did see Mr Cole's remarks and he is entirely correct when he makes this key point. A lot of people argue for a consumption tax on the basis that it would have a significant impact on net savings in Australia. I think that is just nonsense. Who has been arguing that the consumption tax will have a major impact on savings in Australia? It has been the Opposition. Mr Cole is saying that marginal rates of tax cannot be reduced to promote savings with a fully compensated consumption tax. That is what he is saying. I have said it and now he has said it. As I have told the House on a number of occasions, a fully compensated consumption tax at about 15 per cent reduces the Budget surplus by about $2 billion. This was all said rather nicely by a former Secretary to the Treasury, John Stone. In an article in the Australian Financial Review in May 1990, he had this to say--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Do you always accept them too?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those opposite should just listen to what he had to say, because the logic is impeccable. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The reason why imposing, say, a 15 per cent VAT and cutting the higher income tax rate would increase national savings is essentially that, if that were all you did, after-tax incomes would become more unequal. People on higher after-tax incomes do generally save more of them and there would be more such people after such a change.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the thing would be made unequal. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>But if we are to raise our national savings by making after-tax incomes more unequal, we do not need a consumption tax to do so. We could take just one example-merely reduce the upper limit on the present zero rate income tax bracket and use the potentially very large revenue gain from that to cut the top rates. Indeed, it is precisely because the consumption tax-cum-income tax cutting proposals are recognised as inegalitarian that all of them include various associated measures for compensating those adversely affected by them. The problem then is the more perfectly you compensate those adversely affected, the more egalitarian you render the overall final outcome and hence the less you succeed in enhancing national savings.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he is saying that the very basis of the argument that national savings can be dealt with by a consumption tax, designed simply to make the tax system more unequal, therefore promoting lower tax rates for the wealthy so they save more, is phoney in that it can all be done without a consumption tax by just cutting the top marginal rate. John Stone goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>If you compensate them, all you do is make it egalitarian and it does not work as a savings mechanism.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, he has blown the whole shabby Opposition case out of the water. That case was basically to have an uncompensated consumption tax-a sleight of hand to rip the top marginal rate down by making low income people carry the burden of a low compensated consumption tax.</PARA>
<PARA> The other thing Mr Cole said is that the tax is efficient. In coverage it is, but not in collection. The gallows were also efficient-and what point does that prove? The point is: why do we need a consumption tax-another huge tax base in the tax system, with outlays at mid-to-early 1970s levels? In the same article, the former Secretary to the Treasury, Mr Stone, says:</PARA>
<PARA>There remains the argument that in any case our politicians cannot be trusted with such a powerful new tax as the VAT.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the political system would spend the money. When we looked at a consumption tax in 1985 we were still bringing outlays down from the horrific levels that the coalition parties had left us with. By 1990 we had taken outlays to the lowest levels since the Whitlam Government took office. Why would we need a consumption tax in the tax system now?</PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Opposition made this statement in an article which Michelle Grattan wrote in 1989. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I personally think we will need to spell out a reasonable amount of detail. We need to put a credible integrated economic strategy. That will involve a certain amount of detail, quite a lot of education and marketing . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Listen to this one:</PARA>
<PARA>I have always had a disposition to giving as much information as possible. It's a personal trademark.</PARA>
<PARA>Here we are now with the Leader of the Opposition talking about a 15 per cent consumption tax, but he will not nominate the numbers; he will not say whether it is fully compensated or not compensated; he will not say what things are being covered by it; he will not say that a 15 per cent consumption tax adds seven percentage points to the price system-that is, seven percentage points to inflation-and he will not tell us how he wants to take that out of ongoing inflation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously I would speak for every member of this House when I say on behalf of the Government that there is nothing that Australia wants more than that the Gulf war should end now by Iraq withdrawing from Kuwait in accordance with the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Iraqi proposal that was put forward on Friday night gave no clear sign at all that Iraq is prepared to do that. Indeed, the proposal was hedged with many conditions, some of which have never been heard of before. The overwhelming reaction of the international community is quite clear; that is, it has rejected this proposal as a basis for resolving the Gulf crisis. It is quite possible that the proposal was made merely as a propaganda attempt to forestall what are considered to be imminent allied land operations against Iraq's army in and around Kuwait.</PARA>
<PARA> But if the leader of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, is genuine about seeking an end to the war, he must stop playing with words in the way he has been. When and if Saddam Hussein makes concrete moves to withdraw from Kuwait and to implement the relevant United Nations resolutions, the allies will respond positively to that.</PARA>
<PARA> May I say that we welcome efforts by all nations, including the Soviet Union and Iran, to convince Iraq to abide by the Security Council's resolutions. Certainly, we will be watching very closely the talks that are being held today in Moscow between President Gorbachev and the Foreign Minister of Iraq, Aziz.</PARA>
<PARA> Like everyone else, we would hope that the recent proposal of Iraq may be some sign that Iraq is beginning to understand that it has no choice but to withdraw from Kuwait and that the sooner it does so, the better for its own people and for the rest of the world. But if the Iraqis do understand that, they must also realise what they have to do to save Iraq from even greater calamity. It is not complex; it is very simple. It was spelled out by the United Nations Security Council on the very day that Iraq invaded Kuwait over six months ago. They must withdraw from Kuwait immediately and unconditionally.</PARA>
<PARA> I repeat: it is the hope of the Australian Government, and I am sure of this Parliament and of the Australian people, that Saddam Hussein will come to understand that quickly and will act in accordance with that requirement of the United Nations. If he does that, the war can cease forthwith.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleague the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services and I are conducting a major program of integrated policy review and reform. The national health strategy is examining the financing and delivery of health care into the next century; a housing strategy is looking at the housing needs and opportunities for Australians; the aged care review is examining directions for reform of aged care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Among other issues, those policy reviews will help us to address one of the most serious economic and social policy issues facing Australia-the rapidly increasing proportion of aged people in Australia. That involves coordination of housing policy, home and community care approaches, residential care for the aged, medical care financing, hospital financing and income security policies.</PARA>
<PARA> Governments will need to design our home care systems to respond to a particular urban form and housing types, and a particular configuration of health services. Governments will need to continue to target residential aged care facilities to people who cannot be adequately cared for in their homes and will need our hospitals to be used for the intensive treatment for which they are designed. At each point we will need to consider the interaction of care arrangements with Medicare and private health insurance, and all that will be done against the background of Australia having-by international standards-relatively low levels of retirement incomes, because the public sector has guaranteed access to essential services.</PARA>
<PARA> Our policy reviews provide an opportunity to integrate policy development across four separate Federal-State ministerial councils-health, welfare, housing and planning Ministers-and the Special Premiers Conference gives the opportunity to ensure administrative arrangements are designed to support, and not hinder, that integrated policy.</PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to inform the House that the housing and planning Ministers conferences will meet again in March, and the housing Ministers in early September, to consider our policy directions and the administrative arrangements necessary to support these policies. The health and welfare Ministers councils will be meeting in Adelaide in late March to consider the direction of policy and administrative reform. I expect they will agree to a further meeting later in the year to settle reports for the November Special Premiers Conference.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member also asked me about alternative approaches. The Leader of the Opposition last Friday proposed two alternatives as examples rather than policies. Firstly, he proposed that hospitals ought to go back to the States and, secondly, he suggested the Commonwealth should convert its hospital funding to the States into health vouchers. The Leader of the Opposition has, if I may say so, again grabbed the glib solution. Let me spoil his approach with a few facts. Firstly, the Commonwealth runs no hospital, except for the repatriation hospitals, which we are negotiating with the States to integrate into State systems. Hand over the hospitals? The hospitals are already a State responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Commonwealth has one overriding policy objective in its hospital funding arrangements with the States: that there are adequate levels of universal free public care available. Thirdly, a health voucher system simply cannot work. If it operates to limit expenditures, it will be incapable of responding to the needs of individuals. For example, it could provide $2,000 a year worth of care, but what does the cancer sufferer who needs $20,000 worth of care do? Or a voucher could provide cover for particular procedures-for example, one hip replacement at age 70, another at 75. What does the person who needs both hips do if he requires that operation at age 69? On the other hand, a voucher could guarantee to a person all the care he needs, but a voucher would simply mean the removal of the cap on the Commonwealth funding of hospital services.</PARA>
<PARA> I raise these issues because in a sense there have been several precedents on the part of the Leader of the Opposition to simply mention a word, to throw off an idea and to show no capacity to substantively argue the point. His proposal to get the Commonwealth out of hospitals can only mean the abolition of the requirement for the States to provide free public hospital care. If that is the case, he should come clean and say so. His proposal for health vouchers can only mean converting all health care to uncontrolled fee for service with no control on additional charges by the providers.</PARA>
<PARA> The people of Australia have a few questions for the Leader of the Opposition. Who would get free hospital care and who would have to pay? How much would they have to pay? If aged care is to move to a voucher system, what will the very sick and the very frail do? If there are special bonus vouchers available only to pensioners, why should Australians keep trying to save for superannuation?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question that was addressed to me by the Deputy Leader of the National Party is one that he knows is currently before the Government. Over the last few weeks there has been considerable attention given to the competing merit or otherwise of a number of methodologies to achieve resource security. The Government has indicated that it believes resource security is an integral part of ensuring that our second largest manufacturing industry, that is, timber and paper products, is able to invest with confidence in the future. I take this opportunity of indicating how little understood the concept is. It ought not to be seen to be somehow inconsistent with or antagonistic to proper environmental standards, for example. They remain a fundamental threshold objective before some degree of resource security is reached.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The issues are very complex. Government Ministers have met on a number of occasions. The Prime Minister has indicated that in the event of any particular proposals coming before Government they will be given expeditious attention.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="729" SPEAKER="Blewett The Hon N." NAMEID="VE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BONYTHON" MINISTERIAL="TRADE AND OVERSEAS DEVELOPMENT" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VE4">Dr BLEWETT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Kennedy knows, the returns to Australian grain growers have been very seriously undermined by the massive export subsidies being paid overseas, particularly by the European Community and the United States (US). No-one seriously suggests that Australia should be, or indeed could afford to be, a participant in this high stakes trade combat. Instead, the best solution for this country and other agricultural fair traders continues to be working to secure substantial reductions in export subsidies through the Uruguay Round.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, the European Community's refusal to consider serious reform of its agricultural protection has to date blocked the Uruguay Round. Its continued heavy use of export subsidies has sparked the present export subsidy war between the United States and the European Community. United States export subsidies on wheat sales under the export enhancement program (EEP) have totalled almost $US2.9 billion since 1985, accounting annually for up to 65 per cent of US wheat exports.</PARA>
<PARA> Substantial pressure in the United States for more aggressive use of the export enhancement program due to its deteriorating market conditions, a desire to counter the European Community subsidies and its judgment of the state of the Uruguay Round negotiations have meant that the export enhancement subsidies on wheat in late 1990 and early 1991 show a four-fold increase over the previous year and average between $US40 and $US45 per tonne of wheat.</PARA>
<PARA> Over the past month substantial export subsidies have been offered on large purchases of US wheat to markets of great interest to this country: Egypt, over 730,000 tonnes at an average bonus of around $US49 a tonne; the Soviet Union, 1.5 million tonnes at an average bonus of around $US42 per tonne. Ministers in this Government have raised Australia's concerns over the use of the export enhancement program with the United States Administration and with members of Congress on numerous occasions. We have continued to urge the United States to abandon the export enhancement program or, at the very least, target it so as to avoid damage to the markets of unsubsidised exporters such as Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> In working with its fair trade allies in the Cairns Group to minimise European Community export subsidies, the US should avoid tactics which damage fair traders in agriculture. In recent weeks, my colleague the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and I have written jointly to the US Secretary of Agriculture objecting to the United States Administration's request to Congress to remove the $425m annual ceiling on EEP spending.</PARA>
<PARA> Later this week I will be meeting with our ambassador to Washington, Ambassador Cook, and I will be asking him personally to pursue the widespread representations we have already made, both with the administration and with Congress. Australia is not prepared to remain silent whilst its farmers are victims of this iniquitous transatlantic trade war. Nothing so undermines the excellent relations between our two countries than the damage inflicted on our farmers and our economy by the use of an accelerating export enhancement program.</PARA>
<PARA> We will continue our intensive efforts in the Uruguay Round to reduce export subsidies. In the meantime we will continue to protest strongly that if the export subsidies war cannot be halted now, action must be taken to ensure that Australia's unsubsidised exporters are not caught up in this war.</PARA>

Given the Government's failure to meet its stated targets on waterfront reform and the lack of confidence expressed by the Australian Peak Shippers Association in Senator Collins's abilities to deliver, does the Prime Minister's establishment of a high level ministerial working group to speed up waterfront reform indicate that the Prime Minister shares this lack of confidence in Senator Collins? Will the Prime Minister then accept Senator Collins's resignation on 6 May this year, which he will have to offer in keeping with his promise made last year?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="730" SPEAKER="Hawke The Hon R.J.L." NAMEID="YD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WILLS" MINISTERIAL="THE PRIME MINISTER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have considerable confidence in the abilities and the commitment and the capacity to achieve results of Senator Collins. The people opposite seem to think that all we have to do in this area is shoot from the lip-which is what they have been doing for about eight years-and we get results that way. They should know what the realities are from the very long period they spent in government. They were in office for all that time from 1949 to 1972 and from 1975 to 1983.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The structures of the waterfront in Australia today in terms of attitudes and practices have arisen out of more than 30 years of Opposition members' actions when in government. They did nothing. They did nothing to face what was a tragedy for this country. I acknowledge that it has been a tragedy; there was a coincidence of interests between employers on the waterfront and unions. Both had attitudes which were obviously not entirely attuned to the interests of this country. But they built up over more than 30 years of the Opposition's time in government. And the Opposition has the hide now to say that all we have got to do is get the gun out and the situation can be rectified.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Collins has had the attitude that there are problems that need rectification. He has spent countless hours talking with the employers on the waterfront, the port authorities and the trade unions. If those opposite are really interested in seeing results-and I think they probably do not want to see results-they will not be disappointed in the relatively near future in the significant further results that will be achieved. They should know already that in regard to a number of ports, changes have already been made; for example, productivity increases of very considerable amounts have been achieved in grain handling. The reason why we had a meeting of senior Ministers is that Senator Collins believed that he should share with us the difficulties that he was encountering and to get our view as to what may be the appropriate course to try to accelerate the rate of reform. Out of those discussions, which will be followed up, I believe that during this year Australia will see very significant improvements on the waterfront-something achievable only under this Government. The record of the Opposition should lead it to be silent on this matter and leave to those with competence the very difficult task of improving the performance of the Australian waterfront. It is something that needs to be done. It was not done in all that time in which the previous government was in office. It can only be achieved, as it will be, under this Labor Government.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="731" SPEAKER="Kerin The Hon J.C." NAMEID="QH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WERRIWA" MINISTERIAL="PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QH4">Mr KERIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first point to make is that the Government is deeply concerned about the situation for farmers and graziers throughout Australia, and the wool industry debate in Cabinet and what has been going on over the last few months, of course, has brought this home to all people. As my colleague the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development has just pointed out, Australia's primary producers face a world in which there is production subsidisation, in which there are barriers to access and then, on top of that, there is export subsidisation. That is why we have been so assiduous in trying to get progress in the Uruguay Round.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australia and New Zealand produce a higher proportion of their agricultural commodities for world markets than any other countries in the world-and, in Australia's case, it is a broader range of products. So we are particularly exposed on world markets and it needs to be understood that, when one is putting up to 95 per cent of some commodities on world markets, domestic policy issues affect the ultimate income situation of those commodities very little indeed.</PARA>
<PARA> The world situation we face at present particularly hits wheat and grains, dairy, beef, some horticulture and, of interest to the honourable member for Hinkler, sugar. With wool, the problems fundamentally stem from the fact that demand at the previous fixed minimum price was insufficient to clear any more than about half of the clip and, if one measures the composition of the total farm income downturn, wool and wheat will explain about 90 per cent of that downturn.</PARA>
<PARA> Domestically, of course, there is a lot of emphasis from various people on the exchange rate and interest rates. I think one correction that people need to keep in mind is that with some commodities, the trade weighted index gives one a far greater understanding of what exchange rate situation some commodities face. For example, for wool the trade weighted index is far more relevant than the United States rate. On interest rates-this is a matter of general macro-economic management-we are now looking at about 16.25 per cent for commercial rates. Bill rates and professional rates are now down about six points from a year ago. If we look at the structure of some farm debt, up to half of that is on commercial bills, and we are looking at about a 12 per cent rate plus margin at present-and we are heading for a lower inflation rate.</PARA>
<PARA> The economic slowdown, or recession, that we have at present will certainly benefit exporters first, but of course for those primary producers that are dependent on the domestic market this is not so. A lot of farmers face a tough situation with respect to interest rates, but it needs to be remembered that on average interest makes up only about 11 to 14 per cent of farm costs. A lot of farmers have benefited from high interest rates but at the other end of the scale, where people are attracting a premium because of risk, anything up to 22 per cent has been visited on these people and they are in a totally different situation from those at the other end of the scale.</PARA>
<PARA> As to what the Government can and cannot do about this, rural counselling or, at the private level, the farm assessment service and the rural adjustment scheme are all measures under scrutiny at present by the Cabinet, as are submissions on the wheat industry and the farm income situation in general. As part of this process of consultation, the structural adjustment committee of Cabinet will be meeting with the National Farmers Federation and the Grains Council of Australia after Question Time.</PARA>

If I could find the culprits, I would give them a good kick in the backside, or more. I know that those opposite have long practised the approach of guilt by association or jumping to conclusions.

<PARA> I will not go into the details of what happened in Cabinet. I can say that it was an interesting discussion which kept us all awake and lively.

That was what moved them all. They had a common commitment to trying to get the best policies. Obviously, in this regard there can be differences of emphasis, just as there are among those opposite whenever they get around, which is very rarely, to the question of considering policies. I was proud to be able to preside over a Cabinet which showed its absolute commitment to trying to ensure that it got together the best possible range of policies. I believe that, as a result of that commitment, this Parliament and this country will see a very positive result from that cooperative approach on 12 March.</PARA>

The shadow Minister for industrial relations was at it again with another one of his. A recent theme has been to dump the holiday annual leave loading and now to go back to a 40-hour week; that is, the only way to deal with these things is to cut remuneration further, even though we have had a 10 per cent reduction in unit labour costs since 1983; even though the wage share in gross domestic product (GDP) is at postwar levels; and even though the best way of doing all of these things is to lift productivity rather than cut real wages. The coalition has no idea about the notion of productivity. Even though it mouths the notion that wages should be linked to productivity, the fact is that productivity in this country has been at about the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development average and nobody will take a 2 1/2 per cent wage increase in the face of an inflation rate of 6 to 7 per cent, which it well knows.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> The question of income tax powers between the States and the Commonwealth has been on the public agenda for about half a century, since 1942. Instead of these off-the-top-of-the-head observations that characterised the Leader of the Opposition at the weekend, we on this side of the House last year said to the States, `Look, it is sensible to look at this issue of relations between us, the various areas of responsibilities'. We are looking at the question of vertical fiscal imbalance. Discussions are going on.</PARA>
<PARA> In the whole of the period leading up to that Premiers Conference, when I had a range of discussions individually and collectively with the Premiers, not once did any of them raise the possibility of income tax going back to the States. It is not surprising. For a period of some seven years they had the opportunity under the legislation to impose State income tax. They did not take advantage of that legislative opportunity to do it. I had discussions with them last year, we have set out the processes of further analysis and discussions, and not once has any of the Premiers raised it. But the Leader of the Opposition is purporting to make some significant contribution to public debate by saying, `Well, I would think about giving income tax powers back to the States'.</PARA>
<PARA> This is a pathetic denial of the responsibility that a Leader of the Opposition has to make sensible, thoughtful, thought-through contributions to the debate. He has been pathetically inadequate, certainly according to his own standards of not saying anything before he thinks it through. Rather than this increasingly laughable call upon me to seek the resignation of the Treasurer, as though it is some contribution to the public debate or some discharge of the Leader of the Opposition's responsibility, why does he not get down and do what he should do-think through policies in detail and put them up for public debate? Until he does that, he will not be listened to seriously either by the Government or the people of this country.</PARA>

Today the Sports Drug Agency Act comes into effect, and I am pleased to announce that the Chairman of the board of the Agency will be Professor Peter Baume, known to many members of this House for his great interest in medicine and education. The Deputy Chair will be Dr Ken Fitch, who is a member of the International Olympic Committee's medical commission. Another two members of the board both have legal and educational experience: Reverend Brother Bob Wallace, who is deputy principal of Waverley College, and Miss Tricia Kavanagh, who is a barrister from Sydney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The combination of backgrounds include education, medicine and law, and I think the expertise that will go into making this board will be able to implement satisfactorily the policies outlined by this Government and agreed to by the House in the formation of the Sports Drug Agency. Its role, I remind the House, is to look primarily at drug testing amongst athletes. About 2,000 tests will be conducted this year. The Agency's Budget is about $2m. It will also, of course, have a very important education role, and I know that the Chairman and the members of the board will have the trust of this House.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with a measure of sadness that I stand here today to address this House on this matter of public importance. The House may recall that in another matter of public importance in November I suggested that the Government change economic policy to stem the collapse of the small business sector. The Government did not take this advice, and the devastation of the decision it has made is reflected in a 57 per cent increase in bankruptcies over the December quarter. That is another 3,117 small firms, individuals and sole proprietors that have been forced into bankruptcy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the June quarter of 1990, bankruptcies increased nationally by 26 per cent. In the next quarter, the September quarter, they increased by 30 per cent. Topping that up, in the last set of figures, for December, there was a whopping increase of 56 per cent. I do not see an additional 3,000 bankruptcies in just three months as something to gloat about. These figures do not tell the full story. They do not include the substantial number of small business people who just find the going too tough, close their doors and walk away. Indeed, the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) himself admitted that the situation was far worse than the official figures showed. I quote from what the Minister had to say:</PARA>
<PARA> I would like to re-iterate that bankruptcies themselves are not a true indication of how business is operating. Many people, rather than go bankrupt, actually close the business down; they liquidate. </PARA>
<PARA> To use bankruptcies as a method of determining business wealth is just not looking at the whole picture. </PARA>
<PARA>In the Minister's own words, the number of small business bankruptcy closures are far more substantial than the official figures indicate. </PARA>
<PARA> The other indicators of what we are seeing in the small business sector and of what we are starting to see in the Australian economy are reflected in a whole range of areas. We have increases in unemployment-rapidly spiralling unemployment. The January figure shows that some 767,700 people are unemployed. That is up some 27,000 since December. It means that an additional 1,000 people a day-not per week, but per day-are joining the unemployment queue. In the last six months, the number of people thrown onto the unemployment queue has leapt by 126,000. Job vacancies are still falling; they have fallen by 8 per cent during January. </PARA>
<PARA> The second casualty has been apprentices. This Government talks about training, about the need to get more people trained, yet the very sector that it is trying to protect, the very sector that it put the training levy in for, is starting to go down the tube-and rapidly. Today's Australian Financial Review carried the heading, `Apprentices join the jobless queue as recession takes toll'. The Minister ought to be ashamed of himself. He is destroying the very thing that he set out to improve-training. He is starting to destroy trade training in this country. Consumer spending is also well down, and that is an indication of what is happening. </PARA>
<PARA> Small business in Australia has had to contend with a decline in consumer spending, high inflation and taxation. We will remember the Government's bringing forward of taxation measures. I mentioned the burden of the training levy. It has also had to contend with industrial relations problems and a whole range of other matters. The President of the Small Business Combined Association of New South Wales had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Whilst this, the present Federal Government maintains its present economic policy, the outlook for small business is extraordinarily grim. </PARA>
<PARA>There is not light at the end of the tunnel at the moment, there is not sign of a turn around. </PARA>
<PARA>Economic recovery traditionally begins in the small business sector, it's the one that can move quickest, it's the one that can take the opportunity fastest. </PARA>
<PARA>So the whole indicator of the turnaround will come through a revival of small business. </PARA>
<PARA>It has been confirmed by Mr Brian Bevan of the Retail Traders Association, who said:</PARA>
<PARA>I don't see a real improvement in the retail sector through at least the first half of 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>I think . . . we're really in the lap of the gods. </PARA>
<PARA>With the spiral in the bankruptcy figures, and what has been going on, it was very interesting to note the comment of Senator Tate. When speaking on the last round of bankruptcy figures, he said, `It was a good result'. Just wait for this one: the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs reckoned it was a good result because it showed that the rate of increase in bankruptcies was slowing. Can anyone believe that from a Minister who is so out of touch? As I mentioned, I do not call over 3,000 additional bankruptcies in three months something to gloat about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, what do they indicate? On the weekend when I was home and had a chance to reflect on what the newspapers were saying, I noted on the front page of the West Australian-and, Mr Deputy Speaker, being a Western Australian, you may have noted this-a picture of a ship sinking off my electorate, off the coast of Albany. The caption said that the ship had struck a reef and was going down bow first. The interesting thing is that this ship has a lot to do with the Australian economy-the ship struck a reef in calm waters. In the same way, Australia has hit its troubled times when there has been strong growth in the rest of the world, but we sank our own ship.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The sad thing is that the crew and the captain have abandoned the ship, left it to its own fate, in exactly the same way as this Government has abandoned this country and abandoned the economy.

He does not give a damn about what is happening in this country. As my colleague the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher) will indicate later, there are some really true, close to home examples of the real pain and the real hurt in Australia, out there on the farms and out there in the factories.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government is hoping to turn all this around in an economic statement-in a statement the Prime Minister is hoping will be his last chance to turn it all around. The Prime Minister ought to start having a look at where Australia is heading. I would like to quote something very interesting as to how competitive Australia is. It is a list of rankings taken from the World Competitors' Report. Among industrialised countries, countries which are in front of us, those that beat us in the stakes and have been better at what they are doing-and there is a whole string of them-are the United Kingdom (UK), Austria, the Netherlands, Norway, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Canada, Germany, the United States, Switzerland and Japan. They are all far better than we are; they are all far more competitive. But, worse, the newly industrialised countries of Thailand, Malaysia, Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore also beat the pants off us. </PARA>
<PARA> With the bankruptcy figures, the fall in consumer spending and that sort of ranking, it is about time the Prime Minister heeded the warnings that the marketplace is starting to send out. We are like that ship; we are going down the tube very rapidly. And what is the Prime Minister doing? Like Nero, he fiddles while we are burning. He is doing nothing about it. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RI4">Mr PROSSER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And the Prime Minister. I would now like to outline the sorts of things that we need to do in this country to turn this situation around. It is interesting that my colleague the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) recently said that we ought to look at what needs to be done in this country to turn the situation around. He pointed out that as we are in such deep crisis we may need to look at the return to a 40-hour week. Once again, he raised the very valid point of the 17 1/2 per cent loading and what that is doing to the competitive nature of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have some figures in regard to the average hours worked per week in non-agricultural activities. For the average hours worked per week in Australia the figure is 34.5 hours. In France it is 38.9; West Germany, 40.7; Japan, 40.6; and the UK, 42.6. The small business sector, the self-employed people, in Australia work on average 50 hours per week. In France the figure is 54.5; West Germany, 56.8; Japan, 51.8; and the UK, 50.6. No wonder we are not competitive. No wonder we do not measure up any more. We do not work enough hours. We are not competitive, not because of the hourly rate, but simply because we do not work long enough. </PARA>
<PARA> The workers in the Shepparton factory proved that they really had more care and desire to save this country than did the unions and the Prime Minister. During this whole period of the decline in the hours worked in Australia, the real decline in the competitive nature of Australia went down the tube under one man, and it is still going down the tube under the same man-the Prime Minister. When he was the leader of the Australian Council of Trade Unions he zapped the competitiveness of this country and gave it away and decided not to do too much about it. </PARA>
<PARA> What do we need to do? It is crunch time. It is time we decided that we want to save our country. What does the Government need to do to revitalise the tattered small business sector? Firstly, it should heed the call of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and introduce a comprehensive mini-Budget, a mini-Budget which restores incentive and profitability to small business. What we need is a healthy, stable and predictable economy, an economy in which firms can make sensible long term investment decisions with confidence. </PARA>
<PARA> I have mentioned structural reform. We need to be able to clean up the waterfront, reform the transport system and introduce real competition into communications. We need to cut government spending, particularly in the bureaucracy. In industrial relations-the very area where we have an enormous opportunity to turn this country around-as my colleague has quite rightly pointed out, the Government does not want to acknowledge the problem and the unions do not want to acknowledge the problem. I quite often hear it said out there in the marketplace, `Look, we're feeling the pain but where's the gain?'. It is only the Opposition that up to date has been really giving major leadership on all of these issues. It is nothing for my colleague the honourable member for Bennelong to say, `If we want to save this country we have to work longer'. But at least he has had the guts to make that call. The workers of Shepparton proved that they can see it. Why cannot this out-of-touch Government see the real problems that we are experiencing in this country?</PARA>

If we could reintroduce some of the points my colleague mentioned, including the area of our enterprise agreements, into the workplace, very quickly we would start to see a major turnaround in the industrial productivity of this country. In that competitiveness scoreboard the goal of the Government has to be to get very close to the top of that scoreboard.

<PARA> I return to the story of the sinking ship. The Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the captain of the Titanic have a lot in common. The captain of the Titanic believed that his ship would never sink and that it was invincible. We have a Treasurer who, like the captain of the Titanic, believed that the Australian economy was invincible and that it would not sink. In exactly the same way as the captain of the Titanic, the Treasurer will find out the hard way that this country is going down the gurgler very rapidly. The Minister for Small Business and Customs, as part of that Government, has abandoned the only sector of the business community that can help turn around the economy. The Minister has abandoned the small business sector and this Government has abandoned the Australian people. It is about time the Government started to heed the warnings. As the Leader of the Opposition said, if the Government wants to make these hard decisions, we will back it, we will help the Government implement those decisions, because we have a real concern for where this country is going. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QE4">Mr BEDDALL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The figure for the December quarter was a total bankruptcy figure. If Opposition members want to listen, they will learn. If Opposition members want to interject, that is fine, but let us take a comparative analysis. In 1982-83-the last recession this country faced-the percentage of business bankruptcies, as per the total, was 46.3 per cent. In 1989-90 the percentage of business bankruptcies as against total bankruptcies was 34.6 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately, since 1972, there has been an increasing proportion of personal bankruptcies. The shadow Minister failed to differentiate between business bankruptcies and total bankruptcies. The Government is concerned to find ways to address the issues of bankruptcy and the cause of bankruptcy. I assume that the Opposition wants to know the cause of bankruptcy. The best people to tell us are the people who went bankrupt. Obviously that is where we should go for the information. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the annual report of the Attorney-General's Department people who went bankrupt were asked what was the major cause. Although people do not have a propensity to blame themselves, they gave the following reasons for why they went bankrupt: firstly, 24.5 per cent blamed lack of business skills and ability as a major reason; secondly, lack of capital; and, thirdly, 17 per cent blamed economic conditions. The honourable member for Forrest should have a copy of the report-he was furnished with one. </PARA>
<PARA> What does one do about the problems facing small business? The answer is to try to address the fundamental issue. The issue has been identified, and honourable members have been interjecting about a parliamentary inquiry. Honourable members should not forget that we waited 90 years for an inquiry into small business. It has been 20 years since the Wiltshire committee of inquiry into small business and we waited 90 years until a parliamentary inquiry was commissioned by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Opposition was in government it never did anything about the matter except talk in platitudes. This is the second matter of public importance brought forward by the honourable member for Forrest and not once has he actually given any policy parameters for the small business community. He spoke about sinking ships, the farm sector and everything else except small business. He had better start talking about small business, although he does not really understand it. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure the honourable member for Forrest accepts the proposition that there are 750,000 small businesses in this country. </PARA>

<PARA> As I said before, and as the shadow Minister said in his speech, the bankruptcy rate does not give an indication of the problems facing small business, because it is not a true reflection of the situation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Forrest asked when we would see the change. I will detail some of the changes now taking place. It is universally recognised that the fundamental problem facing the small business sector is lack of management skill. The Government has tried to address the issues through a various range of State and Commonwealth Government programs. As the shadow Minister is fully aware, on 19 December, for the first time, all Commonwealth and State Ministers representing small business interests came together at a meeting here in Canberra and agreed on an action program. That meeting was extremely successful.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for O'Connor keeps interjecting about instant solutions. There are no instant solutions. If we just react to the problem by looking for the instant solution and trying to find quick fixes, we will not be able to find the medium and long term solutions for the small business community. We are a free market economy which has rises and troughs. If we do not address those issues, whenever we have a downturn we will have these structural problems. The Government has been trying to address those structural problems through an information and awareness program aimed at enabling the small business community to find out where to go for help. That situation never existed in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Opposition members interjecting-</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="QE4">Mr BEDDALL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable members opposite keep interjecting. I failed to interject during the shadow Minister's speech because there was nothing worth interjecting on. The Opposition's concern is that this Government must have a cohesive policy for the small business community. The Government's policy is recognised by the small business community. In the second annual forum of the small business community, 90 organisations came together and put forward to me, as Minister for small business, their concerns and priorities. That has never happened before. This approach is a cohesive approach.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The information and awareness program was established to try to educate the small business community through the service providers. There are a lot of good State government run programs. What Opposition members do not understand, because they will not listen, is that most small business is not aware that these programs exist, because there is no knowledge base available to it to find that information. The national information and awareness program shows the small business community how to find information. </PARA>
<PARA> It is necessary to address who is in contact with the small business community. As I said in the last debate, for those running a small business, three people are fundamental to the effectiveness of small business: the bank manager, the accountant and the lawyer. When the Bureau of Industry Economics did a survey asking small business proprietors whether they were ever told that small business help was available from their bank manager, only 60 per cent responded positively. When asked whether they knew where that information could be obtained, only one per cent responded positively. So we have the fundamental problem that the information and services available through the States are not reaching people in need. That is why small businesses that go bankrupt are saying that a lack of business ability is causing them to go bankrupt. They acknowledge it themselves. </PARA>

We will be picking out six groups of small businesses to bring them together in a critical mass so they have enough volume to export. This will be one of the great innovations that will take place under this Government, because many small businesses would like to get involved in bigger markets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As we all know, small business is still the most innovative sector of our economy, and it will always be so. Only last Thursday I attended a function sponsored by the Business Review Weekly and Price Waterhouse Associates Pty Ltd in Melbourne that was headed up `Miracle workers: how 50 private companies are powering through the recession'. These are small businesses. What they have been able to do is take the opportunities that are available. Some of these companies-and the leading company ironically was from the honourable member's own State, a computer software company that has had over 3,000 per cent growth in the last five years-are performing. Not all small business is doing it tough. Some small business is; some small business is facing the challenge. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are trying to do is put into place a set of policies that enable all small businesses to face that challenge. But we will always have failures. If we go back to the premise of this debate, we were talking about bankruptcies. In the boom years, there were huge numbers of bankruptcies. We will always get that because not everybody can succeed; some people fail. That is the reality of life. Do honourable members opposite really advocate that every single person who starts a small business be guaranteed by a government-obviously honourable members opposite think their Government-and that they have the right to succeed? Is that the premise of honourable members opposite? If it is, I think it is quite absurd. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, as I have said and in terms of the growing problem that has been acknowledged by this Government, we are in a recession. What we have to do is make sure that recession is as short as possible and that the least possible harm is felt by the business community. That is why the Government has instituted over the last 12 months a 6 per cent drop in the interest rate and a significant drop in the inflation rate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable members continually interject because they have nothing to offer this debate. We are saying that this issue, the issue of bankruptcy, is only a small part of the picture. As I have said right from the start, all the solutions that we are working for in the small business sector are medium to long term. There is no quick fix with the small business sector. This country is in recession. When we come out of recession, the small business community, as we all know, will be the first to respond. But if we forget the lessons we are now learning in this recession, when the next recession comes-as it will , because it goes through a cycle-there will be no gain as a result of our pain now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is what honourable members opposite are asking: where is the gain? The gain is in the learning mechanism where we actually find out what we are going to be able to do for the small business community to enable it to grow and to prosper. It has always been my firm conviction that the small business community is the best place in our society to let our economy grow. Small to medium sized enterprise is the most innovative. It is the sector in our society that quickly adapts to change. </PARA>
<PARA> I advocate to people to read about this issue in the Business Review Weekly because we are seeing great growth in Australian industry, and that is in computer software. Three of the top 10 growing companies in this country are computer software companies that are exporting. That is occurring because those companies started off small, are flexible and are able to meet demand in the market. In the future we have to enable all small businesses to get into that growth pattern. We have to address the fundamental issue of availability of capital to the small business sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The Industry Commission inquiry has been commissioned by the Treasurer (Mr Keating). One of the features of that inquiry is the special reference to the availability of capital to the small business sector. It is vital. Our small business sector is, and has been, starved of capital and the capital it can get is overpriced. That is what we have to address. Those issues are medium to long term. As we progress those issues, we will come up with solutions that will make small business more prosperous in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The rural crisis has finally captured the attention of the national media at least 12 months after this Government's failed monetary policies have cut so deeply into country Australia. The impact of sustained high interest rates, massive domestic costs, outdated work practices and corrupt international trading in the agricultural industries is well documented. The human hardship-even, some believe, the threat to a complete culture-and the forecasts of continuing balance of trade deficits are all reasons for major concern for Australia's living standards, as well as for our economic well-being. Caught up in the middle of all of these circumstances is the small business sector, a sector that accounts for 40 per cent of the Australian work force and offers this nation the best opportunity for innovation and a counter to the emerging high unemployment statistics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Government has not given a strong representative voice to the small business sector. It has pandered to large unions, large business and government employer groups, which have dominated policy decision making. Small business does not receive the consideration and input into policy changes which it is entitled to. The Beddall report-the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology-adequately documented the impediments and the immediate and long term changes necessary to capture the positives in the small business sector. These can be easily identified. Small business is more resilient, it is more mobile, it is quick to seize business opportunities, and it has a capacity to respond to changing community and service requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government needs to look seriously at why the reported 50,000 small business closures occurred this financial year. The recent Ibis report confirmed that one in six small and large businesses will be affected, and not just the undercapitalised niche operators. It is no longer an option for this Government to blame poor business management, as the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall) has, when such businesses are facing more duplication of services from governments at Federal, State and local levels, over-regulation and greater costs associated with employing and retrenching people. </PARA>
<PARA> In rural Australia small business is essential to the survival of towns and the servicing of agriculture. Towns can support a diversity of small business where often a large national operation will not consider initial establishment or will find difficulty maintaining viability. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Government prepares its March industry statement, it surely recognises that it cannot afford to miss the opportunity to implement policies that it has failed to come to grips with over its term in government. It has to recognise that, in its desperate attempt to hide from the average wage and salary earner the appalling state of our economy, it has built up an overseas debt that will bleed generations to come. </PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of a capital gains tax and the assets test have guaranteed that, rather than encouraging investment in productive industry, the Government has promoted private housing as the only safe tax haven and investment vehicle. The stupidity of these social and economic policies has contributed to the downturn in business activity and bankruptcy. </PARA>
<PARA> Last Friday night I met in Warracknabeal with a concerned group of business people, community leaders and farmers. Unanimously, two factors were defined as being major causes of our economic decline. First was the impact of interest rates, as has already been covered by my colleague the honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser). However, I also point to the discrimination by the banking sector against the small operator. Small business does not calculate its margins by the average cost of funds, but by the difference between the bill rate for deposits and its overdraft rate. As is the case with farmers, small business margins are not given the same competitive advantage as those of large corporations. </PARA>
<PARA> Many financial institutions are now insisting on property as security for loans to small borrowers. Few are being allowed to use cash flow as a basis for borrowing. A recent report by the Australian Chamber of Manufactures has indicated that in the case of 98 per cent of small business bank charges are higher since deregulation and not one small business in a recent survey reported more competitive and cheaper rates. </PARA>
<PARA> The second issue I wish to mention concerns outdated and inflexible work practices. This Government, as a matter of urgency, has to provide new incentive for business in Australia and put a stop to the debilitating lack of confidence that is strangling rural Australia. In my electorate of Mallee-and no doubt it is the same across Australia-many businesses employing over 100 people have disappeared during the term of the Hawke Government. Longstanding machinery and motor vehicle dealerships have closed. No-one is exempt; Toyota, Ford and General Motors Holden's Ltd agencies have closed. Abattoirs are closing due to the impact of outrageous inspection charges designed only to fund a burgeoning bureaucracy. Small engineering firms servicing the rural sector have gone into receivership as well as large numbers of retailers. The Mildura Chamber of Commerce has told me that it is the most difficult time in the last 35 years and, if not halted, the downturn will be far greater than predicted. Yet the Minister talks of the level of bankruptcies. What about those thousands of small businesses that have just closed their doors and walked away?</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) advises me that the employment situation has deteriorated rapidly. In the September quarter, compared with the same quarter in 1989, there was a 27 per cent decline in job vacancies, there was a 50 per cent decline in December and a similar and increasing trend in January. Unemployment today is up to three times higher in rural Australia, particularly amongst the 15- to 19-year-olds. The CES also tells me that, despite the fruit picking season in the Sunraysia, it is not calling on any labour from outside the region as local people are organising jobs directly with the growers. It is obvious, therefore, that come March and April, unemployment figures, particularly in rural areas, will escalate. Traineeships are being cancelled, as are planned clerical traineeship courses, and no apprenticeship vacancies are being lodged. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the following letter I have received from a young, progressive and innovative Australian company, which has matched it with the large agricultural manufacturing industries, answers many questions. Why stay in business; why start up a new business; and why employ people? I read this letter to the House:</PARA>
<PARA>During the past three years we have successfully competed with the agricultural manufacturing industry and have had a significant impact on the Australian market.We have just commenced to explore export markets. </PARA>
<PARA>However like most Australian particularly Victorian small businesses it is now a battle for survival. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me acquaint you with a few facts . . . </PARA>
<PARA>During 1989/90 our turnover was $8.5m and in March 1990 we were employing a total of 80 employees. Government charges on our payroll which was $1.4m for the year was as follows. </PARA>
<PARA>A. Payroll Tax...$72,000</PARA>
<PARA>B. Workcare...$45,000</PARA>
<PARA>C. Compulsory Super...$60,000</PARA>
<PARA>Today one month into the new financial year, we are heading downhill. Currently we have 65 employees . . . projected turnover for 1990/91 of $7.7m. </PARA>
<PARA>Note, less employees and less turnover compared to 1989/90, but what has happened to government charges-increased government charges on our anticipated payroll of $1.2m for this year will be:</PARA>
<PARA>A. Payroll Tax...$84,000 (Up $12,000)</PARA>
<PARA>B. Workcare...$74,000 (Up $33,000</PARA>
<PARA>C. Compulsory Super...$60,000 (No change)</PARA>
<PARA>D. Training Guarantee Levy $12,000 (New charge but this company will spend in excess of this amount)</PARA>
<PARA>In respect to Workcare we have been unable to get a satisfactory response as to why and how our levy has increased. Why can't governments legislate for private companies to cover workers compensation and dismantle this large bureaucratic inefficient department. </PARA>
<PARA>On superannuation. Why should the employer have to pay for the future welfare of his employees on retirement? Who pays for the employers superannuation-himself. </PARA>
<PARA>On the 17 1/2% annual leave loading = $14,000. This loading is a national disgrace-the original intent has been lost, it has flowed through to most awards and is now a bonus to an employee to go on leave why?</PARA>
<PARA>Uncertainty in the market place and crippling government charges and a savage increase in land tax, I have to ask you where is the incentive for Australians to start up and develop a business?</PARA>
<PARA>This Government has to deliver tax relief to small business. It has to deliver clear policy directions to restore confidence and renewed vitality to the small business sector. I say to the Minister at the table: the report produced by the Minister when he was Chairman of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Technology and Science called Small Business in Australia: Challenges, Problems and Opportunities was hailed as far-sighted and generally regarded as sound by Australia's 750,000 small businesses. I ask him and senior Ministers to respond. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Forrest (Mr Prosser) spoke for 15 minutes earlier this afternoon on this matter of public importance-the first one for the week from the Opposition-and he said nothing; not a thing. He laid it on large and long about his bankruptcy fetish. He cited bankruptcy figure after bankruptcy figure-his fetish is second to none in this House-and interspersed that with a few general lines about the economy, not one of which, I might add, was even original. Not once did the honourable member for Forrest say anything new. Not once did the honourable member say anything that sounded remotely like a program or policy. Not once did he offer up anything that could well be taken as a shadow of an initiative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today's matter of public importance-the fear, the loathing, the hatred, the interjection and the whole lot coming from the other side of the House towards the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall)-is simply for one reason and one reason alone; that is, the Minister is stealing the Liberal and National Party's constituency and the shadow Minister can do, and is doing, absolutely nothing about it. The Minister for Small Business and Customs is stealing their constituency for one reason and one reason alone; that is, he is doing something about small business in a sound, constructive way through program after program. Those opposite did nothing about that while they were in government. They did not even think about it. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality is that the Liberal and National parties in this place, in government for so long in the postwar years, continued, and are continuing-as evidenced by the shadow Minister's lack of policies and initiatives-to take the small business constituency for granted. They snubbed their nose at small business year after year, shadow ministry after shadow ministry, and now they have woken up. All the fear and loathing is quite simply about the fact that the honourable member for Rankin, the Minister for Small Business, is stealing their constituency and stealing it thunderously quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me on that basis add to what the Minister had to say about the bankruptcy figures-the fetish of the honourable member for Forrest. There are some 750,000 small businesses in Australia, of which a quarter are incorporated. Of the non-incorporated businesses, 3,000 went bankrupt in the last financial year-0.5 of one per cent. That is, 0.5 of one per cent of non-incorporated businesses went bankrupt. Much has been made by the Opposition of the 1990 annual report on bankruptcy for the financial year 1989-90. As the Minister pointed out-I will reiterate it, and honourable members can bet their life that we will keep on doing so-the figures actually show a reversal since 1972-73 in the ratio of business to non-business bankruptcies, with non-business bankruptcies now outnumbering those business bankruptcies by almost 2 : 1. </PARA>
<PARA> What the shadow Minister fails to acknowledge, will not live up to, will not face, and yet again ran from here in the chamber today-and I call on the press to grill him about this-is that the proportions, the ratios, have changed, and changed substantially. His fetish does not allow him to get that far. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister also mentioned, according to that 1990 bankruptcy report, the lack of business ability, acumen, training and experience is given as the major cause of business bankruptcy. The other major reasons are the lack of sufficient initial working capital and economic conditions, including competition, price cutting and increases in charges and overhead expenses. </PARA>
<PARA> The second speaker from the Opposition, the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher), displaying the weakness of the Opposition's case, spoke glowingly about the Beddall report, the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology entitled Small Business in Australia: Challenges, Problems and Opportunities. No-one from the other side of the House ever initiated a Beddall-type report in government or on the back bench. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, the Beddall inquiry found that the problems in small business were a lack of management skills, the availability of capital, the burden of business regulation, fragmentation and limited market power. The list reads almost like a duplicate of the annual report that the Opposition claims is ammunition for it. Everyone else is talking about the problems, acknowledging the problems and doing something about them. What is the Opposition, in the form of the shadow Minister, doing? The shadow Minister is talking up his bankruptcy fetish. He is not doing anything else-not one other thing. He is just talking up bankruptcies. He has not given an original thought, certainly not a coherent thought, that in any way, shape or form emulates either the Beddall report or the annual report of the Attorney-General's Department. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is time that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) replaced the shadow Minister for small business. To point out just how insincere those on the other side of the House are about this, I point to what the reaction to the Minister's administration so far has been. I cite a Real Estate Institute press release of November, which indicated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we are delighted to see that finally the unique problems of small business are being recognised. </PARA>
<PARA>The Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia-supposedly the Opposition's heartland, which it treated with contempt and left behind well over a decade ago-believes that the Minister is handling the future management of the sector very well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will be a long time before that question is ever posed about the honourable member for Forrest or anybody else on his side in relation to the small business question or anything else. The Minister has some ideas about the matter; he has had them since he was the Chairman of the Committee. The honourable member for Forrest is still struggling to understand the basic bankruptcy figures. That is his problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All we have heard today from the Opposition is another boring repetition about how bad the economy is. The economy is in recession. The Government has acknowledged it. Indeed, a good deal of the Western world is in recession. The Americans are struggling; the British are struggling; the Canadians have problems; and Japan is expecting a slow-down. There is an international recession of sorts. How big and how wide it is, only time will tell. The problems that we in Australia are facing may be unique at industry levels-and this Government is trying to do something about those problems-but on a broad economic front we are certainly not alone. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind those opposite that, in getting the macro-economics right, the small business community will be the first to benefit. Compared to a year earlier, in the six months to December imports were 4.2 per cent lower, exports were 8 per cent higher, manufactured exports were 13 per cent higher and the current account deficit was 28 per cent lower- all this in a policy setting of fiscal policy and surplus, substantial falls in real unit wage costs, which the Treasurer (Mr Keating) outlined in Question Time today, and the flexible operation of monetary policy, while keeping our overall monetary policy conditions necessarily firm. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the big picture and that represents the long term view for the benefit of small business in this country. The shadow Minister sat at the table gawking about the need for an instant solution. After the honourable member for Forrest had spoken, the Minister highlighted the interrelationship of small business with bankers and lawyers, and one interjector from the other side said, `They're all broke too'. </PARA>
<PARA> What a sustained intellectual input we have from the Opposition. The statistics do not bear that interjection out. The Opposition's policies are non-existent. Its priorities mean that small business is at the bottom of the heap. Before members of the Opposition come in here proclaiming the virtues of liberalism and the National Party as it relates to small business, they should take a good look at their own history and what is being done in terms of the Beddall report-from the Chairman of the Committee at the time and now as Minister-and have a good look at this Government's economic policies. They should not come back here with the audacity to say nothing or come back without a constructive policy, because the small business community will continue to laugh at them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition supports the Appropriation Bill (No. 3), which was introduced towards the end of last week by the Government. This is an extra Appropriation Bill to cover urgent payments resulting from Australia's involvement in the Gulf conflict. The Bill seeks appropriation for $234.1m on two items. The first is $181.4m for payment by the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce to meet national interest insurance claims associated with Iraq's defaults on payments for wheat. Secondly, it provides for $52.7m for the Department of Defence to meet equipment and stores expenditure associated with the deployment of elements of the Defence Force to the Persian Gulf.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said, the Opposition supports the Bill in a manner consistent with our support for Australia's commitment to the Gulf force and the application of sanctions against Iraq last August following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. There is no doubt that the application of those sanctions, as well as the commitment of some Australian Defence Force personnel to the Persian Gulf, imposes pain on the Australian community. The application of the sanctions has imposed significant economic pain, which I shall refer to a little later, and there is no doubt that having Australian Defence Force personnel in the Persian Gulf creates a great deal of anxiety for the families of people left behind in Australia and also broader anxiety amongst the wider Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, we on this side of the House support the Government, because we believe the Government, despite the pain involved with those decisions, has made decisions in concert with other Western nations-and indeed some nations beyond the Western world-in the long term interests of a more stable international community and to the long term economic benefit of our own people and the people of the world in general. I think it illustrates a point that perhaps in this Parliament we do not make often enough-that not everything in our society is governed entirely by money. Sometimes there are considerations which stretch beyond short term economic or pecuniary interests, and this is a case in point. </PARA>
<PARA> The action has imposed on us, as I said, some costs in an economic sense, and some pain in a physical and emotional sense, but the reason we are bearing that pain is that it is in the long term interests of our people and the rest of the world to get Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait, to liberate Kuwait and ultimately to ensure that the stability of that very delicate and important part of the world is finally restored. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the details of this legislation are concerned, I will start off by saying something about the $181m which is being paid to meet national interest insurance claims as a result of Iraq's defaults on payments for wheat. </PARA>
<PARA> Iraq has been among our top five export markets for wheat since 1986-87. It was the largest market for Australian wheat in 1989-90. It is interesting to reflect on the fact that wheat exports to Iraq, before sanctions were imposed, represented about 10 per cent of our total wheat exports. In 1988-89 Australia exported $293m worth of wheat to Iraq and in 1989-90 we increased those exports very substantially to $392m. Obviously, the loss of the Iraqi market, as it represented 10 per cent of all our wheat exports, was a very significant blow to the Australian wheat industry and to wheat growers, who, for that reason and for a range of other reasons, are suffering very difficult times. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August last year the Australian Wheat Board had sold, in total, about $600m worth of wheat to Iraq on credit, and that particular credit was covered by the terms of the national interest export insurance scheme. The scheme covers exactly 80 per cent of the value of the wheat, which amounts to $480m. However, it is worth remembering that payment of that full $600m by Iraq was not expected to come all in one week or one month at one given time; it was to be spread over a period of two years. Clearly, from an Australian point of view, technically we cannot say at this stage that Iraq has defaulted on all of the $600m payment which we are hoping for-I was going to say `which we are expecting', but I should say `which we are hoping for'. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4G4">Mr DOWNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel says, we are not holding our breath. However, the final payments of that $600m are not due until August 1992, and I am sure that the Minister would be the first to agree that a lot will happen in that part of the world between now and August 1992. So it is very difficult to predict whether any or some of that money will be paid. It seems unlikely, however, that all of it will be paid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Government has a very clear obligation to fulfil those payments under the terms of the national interest export insurance provisions. So the $181.4m which is presently being sought, and to which this side of the House will agree, is to cover the claims on likely defaults to the end of May this year. Only an extreme optimist-and I must say that I have not met such an optimist-would suppose that Iraq will meet its payments before May. I do not think there is any question of that. Therefore, it is appropriate for the Government to provide the money to meet the insurance payouts. We on this side of the House would expect more costs further down the line and we would anticipate the inclusion of appropriations in this year's Budget to cover subsequent defaulting by Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to remind the House that at the time of the Budget last year-which was in August, subsequent to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait-I put out a press release pointing out that the Budget made no provision whatsoever for payments of this kind and that it struck us on this side of the House as being highly unlikely that-at least over the next six to 12 months-very much of the money owing to Australia by Iraq for wheat exports would be received in Australia. I was disappointed that the Government had made no commitment for that money in its Budget calculations. Had it done so, obviously its Budget estimates would have been more accurate than they have turned out to be. Indeed, in a total sense the Government's Budget estimates-as Government members themselves admit-have turned out to be completely inaccurate. In any case, it was disappointing that the Government did not take this particular issue into account at the time of the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make one further point on that account, to the effect that following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the introduction of sanctions some money was paid by the Iraqis to Australia via bank accounts in the United States (US). Because of the way the Americans had applied those sanctions that money was frozen in those bank accounts in the United States, even though it was money paid to Australia by Iraq. I put out a press release in, I think, about September pointing to the fact that this money was frozen in those accounts and I urged the Australian Government to make representations to the United States Government to get that money, which was owing to Australian wheat growers, released from those accounts in New York. Subsequently, I believe the Australian Government did make those representations but I understand that to this very day there is about $2.9m frozen in those accounts in New York. I take this opportunity to urge the United States Administration to release this money, which is money owing to Australian wheat growers. From the allies' point of view, there is no benefit to Iraq or to the war effort, and there is no benefit to the whole debate of getting Iraq out of Kuwait, in holding that Australian money frozen in bank accounts in New York. I very much hope that the American Administration listens to our pleas. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the broader issues of wheat and the implications for the Australian wheat market as a result of the Gulf war and Iraq's invasion of Kuwait-which of course represented the start of the Gulf war. There is no doubt that it has come at a very bad time, and I mentioned that point earlier. Our wheat growers are on their knees for three reasons: firstly, they have been confronted with an inexorable increase in costs; secondly, in the last year there was a world overproduction of wheat-in particular, a bumper harvest in the whole of the northern hemisphere from China to Canada-and, thirdly, the Australian wheat growers have been hit very severely by the policy of both the United States Administration and, particularly, that of the European Community of paying export subsidies to try to gain greater market share. Those three things have all come at once and, as a result, they have reduced the earnings of Australian wheat growers certainly to negligible levels and, in some cases, to negative levels. I know that that is a very major worry for all honourable members who have wheat growers living within their electorates. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth remembering that until 1987-88 Australia was the sole supplier of wheat to Kuwait. This earned us about $13m in 1987-88. We lost the whole of that market in 1988-89 when the United States began selling wheat to Kuwait at heavily subsidised prices. As things have turned out, that has been rather ironic. When sanctions were introduced in August 1990 we hoped very much that the United States Administration would cease its policy-as the European Community should have done-of subsidising wheat exports, on the grounds that we as a country had suffered particularly as a result of those sanctions because we used to sell Iraq about 50 per cent of its wheat. </PARA>
<PARA> The United States Administration, despite the fact that it knew only too well that we had borne the bulk of the pain over sanctions-at least as far as wheat is concerned-showed no inclination to respond favourably to that proposition. Indeed, I must say that on 20 January I was alarmed to learn from the Australian Wheat Board that Egypt had bought 400,000 tonnes of wheat from the United States at, I believe, a price of $US64 a tonne. That was only made possible by an export enhancement program subsidy from the United States Administration of $US46.50 per tonne. That sale figure of $US64 per tonne compares with the already depressed price of about $US120 per tonne that Australia is getting at the moment for its wheat. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not pretending that the United States, through the use of the export enhancement program, will take over the whole of the Egyptian market, but sales of this sort have two effects. Firstly, as Egypt is now Australia's biggest market in the Middle East, those sorts of sales obviously drive us, to some extent, out of that market and therefore our market share is reduced; but, secondly, sales of that kind-whether they are to Egypt, Algeria or wherever-depress the international price for wheat and therefore depress earnings for Australian wheat growers. As I have said already, although Australian wheat growers have suffered very much as a result of the imposition of sanctions and although they have borne the bulk of the burden for those sanctions which were imposed against Iraq, the United States Administration, very much to my disappointment, has gone ahead with the export enhancement program, thereby making the problems for our Australian wheat growers still worse. I repeat: we on this side of the House would like both the United States Administration and the European Community, which are the biggest sinners in this respect, to desist from paying export subsidies for wheat, at least until the Gulf war is over-but of course we would like them to desist for all time. </PARA>
<PARA> Problems in the United States have abounded. As far as agricultural export subsidies are concerned, although only by coincidence, since the invasion by Kuwait of Iraq an agricultural appropriations Bill has been introduced into the United States Congress which seeks to lift very substantially the $US425m ceiling on subsidies for agriculture. If that Bill successfully passes through the Congress and receives the presidential signature, that will very severely exacerbate the trade war, particularly in the area of grains, between the United States and the European Community. </PARA>
<PARA> If that happens, once more Australian wheat growers will be the biggest losers. That is something that we have to try to persuade the Americans not to persist with, and we have to try in particular to point out to both congressmen and to the United States Administration that such a Bill, if passed, would be inimical to the best of relationships between our two countries. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that Australia needs to make it perfectly clear to the United States as well as to the European Community-and perhaps in this respect I could single out Britain-that the post-war reconstruction of the Middle East should not be to the long term exclusion of Australia from Middle East markets which it has lost as a result of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the introduction of sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said already, prior to the invasion of Kuwait we supplied Iraq with 50 per cent of its wheat imports and the Iraqi and Egyptian markets together absorbed about one-third of our total wheat exports. I have to say to the House that I am concerned that in the post-war reconstruction phase Europe and the United States could take two views. The first is that Iraq has been devastated and a number of the economies of the Middle East have been severely affected by sanctions and by the war, and consequently we all have to do as much as we can to restore those economies. I think that is a natural enough view to hold. </PARA>
<PARA> But, in the process of restoring those economies, my concern is that the Europeans and Americans may say that they will sell those economies subsidised wheat and perhaps other agricultural products, which would help them reduce some of the surpluses they have and would also achieve the goal of providing cheap food to that part of the world. The consequence of that, from our point of view, will not just be to depress international prices for wheat still further, which would be tragic enough, but to exclude us to a very large extent from markets which were so vastly important to our wheat industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I want that point to be well and truly noted by the House. I think all Australians need to be aware of that real danger. I am not suggesting that the Americans and Europeans have planned to do that, but I want to make sure that they know that the Australian Parliament is concerned that they could consider doing that. Certainly it would be extremely unfriendly in the context of the Gulf conflict for them to pursue such a policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the other temptation that would fall before the Europeans and Americans is that they may wish to restore their relationships with a number of countries of the Middle East and, in particular, to restore their political relations with Iraq in whatever form the Iraqi administration may take once the Gulf war is completed. They may feel that selling them cheap wheat will help to restore their political relationships. Again, I very much hope that they will desist from taking that view, because obviously it would not help. Whilst it may help restore their relationship with Iraq, it will not help their relationship with Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope very much that those particular issues, amongst the myriad of other issues that have to be considered in the context of post-war reconstruction, will be properly thought through by our own Government. I hope that the Minister at the table, the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, will take that message to the Government and that when the Government finishes putting together the list of priorities for the Australian contribution to the post-war reconstruction process, which I happen to know that it is drawing up, the issue of our regaining the markets we had prior to the Gulf war is on the agenda-indeed, is not just on the agenda but is a very significant agenda item. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been disappointed that, at least publicly, the Government has made no comment on a proposal we put forward that it should seek agreement with the United States and the Europeans right away so that the sort of scenario I have described does not occur. I hope it reconsiders that. It may have done it without making any public announcement. If it has, I am glad; if not, I would hope that it gets on with it and gets on with it very soon. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would just like to say something about the defence component of this Budget. It provides $52.7m for the Department of Defence to meet equipment and stores expenditure associated with the deployment of elements of the Defence Force to the Persian Gulf. We on this side of the House would like to hear from the Minister in the conclusion of the debate whether he believes this $52.7m represents the true and final account for defence. Our view is that the appropriations for defence are likely to have to be much higher than this when all the bills come in, but we would be interested to hear what the Government's view is. It may be that it feels that the $52.7m is all it needs just for the time being. However, I think it is important that it tell us as soon as possible what the total bill is going to be. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, we should make the point that this whole exercise-that is, the Australian military involvement in the Persian Gulf, which we on this side of the House have very strongly supported without any reservation-has shown, however, a lack of readiness on the part of the Australian defence forces to take part in this type of operation. It has drawn into question the Government's defence policy as a whole-in particular the report of the Dibb Review of Australia's Defence Capabilities, which admittedly is not the Government's own policy, and the White Paper which was built on the foundation of the Dibb report. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that the Government was arguing at the time both of the Dibb report and of the Defence White Paper was that we were living in a pretty stable part of the world and that in fact the world was becoming an increasingly stable place so we need not get too worried about defence issues. It created I suppose more than anything else a climate that defence was something we did not have to worry about very much. That was very much the atmosphere of the Dibb report and the White Paper. </PARA>
<PARA> We argued at that time that defence is one of those expenditures it is important to maintain at an appropriate level because the unexpected is always likely to arise. That is the history of mankind-that is, the one thing we can expect is the unexpected. We never know what sort of international conflict or crisis may emerge and involve the Australian Defence Force. Who would have expected at the time of the White Paper in 1987 that there would be this kind of confrontation in the Persian Gulf? Certainly the authors of the White Paper did not. I accept that if one sits down and reads the White Paper very carefully, one finds that there is what I would describe as the Government's `get out' clause. But the fact is that the whole thrust of the White Paper is about building a fortress Australia. That is not all it is about, but that is the basic thrust of it. </PARA>
<PARA> The concern we had at the time, and still have, is that we need to ensure that we have a Defence Force which takes proper account of our alliances and that also takes proper account of contingencies that may occur quite unexpectedly either within or beyond our region. The Government inevitably claims, because the White Paper has some weasel words about these things, that it has covered everything. I know the argument backwards; I have heard it a thousand times. The Minister at the table is trying to promote the argument as best he can right now. </PARA>

<PARA> The fact there were so few Australian ships that could be used effectively to assist in this multinational force in the Persian Gulf bears witness to the fact that our defence structure, our force structure, is one that has really been built up with the old fortress Australia concept to the foremost of the Government's mind, and the broader issues of where our defence interests may also lie have been subsumed by those earlier considerations. </PARA>

We appreciate it is a very expensive piece of legislation which has come about as a result of our support for sanctions, and also our support for the multilateral force in the Gulf through the provision of some Australian Defence Force personnel.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1990-91 proposes to make moneys available to meet in part the direct costs of the Australian Government involvement in the Gulf conflict. The expenditure which is set out in the Bill is $52.7m, which is a direct cost of the war, and there is an additional allocation of $181.4m as part of the costs of amounts defaulted upon by Iraq in credit sales by the Australian Wheat Board.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although I opposed the decision to send Australian troops into combat in the Gulf, I made it clear in my speech to the Parliament on the Government's resolution at that time that, the forces having been committed, I did not support bringing them home unilaterally. Of course, we cannot have ships and military personnel in the area without appropriate funding resources. Hence, there is no contradiction between my original position and the position I hold in relation to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I do want to take the opportunity, however, to raise a number of issues which arise from the need for this Bill and the continuing dreadful situation which exists today in the Gulf region. We know, from information provided by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) and information contained in this Bill, that the direct additional military cost of the Gulf war to Australia is estimated to be in the vicinity of $100m for a full year. Of course, such a figure estimates only the direct military cost and does not estimate the share of the global financial burden arising out of this war which must inevitably, and eventually, be met by Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I have sought estimates of the real costs of this war to Australia and to the world, but I have found the task of obtaining such information to be extremely difficult either because governments are reluctant to provide information on the projected costs of wars or because-and I think this is more generally the case-the information is simply not available, the necessary work not having been done to estimate such costs. I can see no reason, however, in circumstances such as the Gulf war, why in a democratic country we are not entitled to make informed choices about policy options available to us, and I believe an account of such costs and benefits should be made in advance. </PARA>
<PARA> Some people will say that war is not like that, that it does not lend itself to impact statements and cost-benefit analyses as a precondition to war or as a preliminary step before a war policy is adopted. Certainly, in approaching our defence budget we do exactly that: we weigh up the threat, and on the basis of the risk at any particular time we make decisions to allocate resources to defence priorities. Of course, if and when one is attacked, or our country is `in imminent threat'-to use the words from the Australian Labor Party's policy-one obviously does not have the opportunity to be able to undertake such an exercise in cost-benefit analysis. But in circumstances where Australia, or the world community, is planning a military campaign it is possible to draw up a balance sheet taking into account the costs in monetary terms and the benefits in such terms of the proposed military campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> This is exactly the sort of exercise that some countries, for example, have undertaken in relation to their policy on the use of their nuclear weapons. After the most rigorous and careful analysis, they have made a decision or judgment that nuclear weapons should not be used in a first strike circumstance because of the cost of using such weapons in terms of the damage to the standing of the country as a civilised power, in terms of the environment and the damage that would be caused thereto, in terms of the killing and mutilation of civilians, and in terms of the impact of causing medium powers to increase their lust for nuclear weapons. Those costs, it has been adjudged, would be greater than the benefit to be achieved if nuclear weapons were used in a first strike capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> All of such costs can be calculated or estimated and, whilst I particularly dislike the idea of reducing human costs to such economic terms, the exercise in my view is worth while in demonstrating the costliness and, in most cases, the futility of war. As I said, much of the information to make an informed judgment about the cost of this particular war to Australia is just not available, but from the information that is available I know we can calculate some of the cost to Australia of our contribution, of our involvement in the war, of our symbolic-rather than significant-military involvement. </PARA>
<PARA> What we do know about Australia's involvement is that the sanctions, the war and the blockade costs will be, in military terms, approximately an extra $100m per year. I might say I agree with the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer)-not that I do that very often-that this estimate may well blow out as the campaign develops and as the bills come in. I think we will probably find it will be somewhat substantially more than that estimate. </PARA>
<PARA> We have certainly now suffered trade costs of around $600m in defaulted Iraqi wheat payments, and I am told we are likely also to suffer costs of between $400m and $500m in forgone wheat sales and other sales to Iraq. When one takes into account the fact that there are likely to be dramatic and permanent changes in trade arrangements in the Middle East and that Australia may well lose traditional markets once and for all, then the cost in trade terms could be very much greater than that. Of course, Australia also sells a range of other products to Gulf countries, and obviously whilst this war is in progress and those economies are being destroyed we are losing huge amounts of money on that particular trade. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to that, we will have to bear the cost for many years to come of repatriation of the military personnel who are there in our ships, and of the medical teams that we have there. I have been told that the cost could be at least $10m, if not more, over the period of time that people will be the beneficiaries of the repatriation system. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost to the Australian economy also needs to be taken into account. There is no doubt that as a result of the effect of this war on world trade Australia will suffer a decline not only in its trade, as I have mentioned, but also in terms of the confidence within the Australian economy and in terms of investment plans. I think we will see a deepening of the recession as a result of this war. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there is the Australian share of the cost of relocating, feeding and supporting the refugees who inevitably in their millions will need to be assisted as a result of this war. There will be the cost of rebuilding the Gulf states, to mention nothing of the Australian share of the cost of cleaning up the environment in the area, which will be very significant. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view, the cost of Australia's contributions to international relief funds is never enough, but finally, and sadly, we will have to make such contributions. Then, of course, there are the costs associated with any deaths of Australian personnel or injuries to Australian personnel. We all certainly hope that there will be none, but in a situation like this, I imagine it is unlikely that that will be the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The above does not take into account any massive military losses if one of our ships were to be hit by a missile. There may be far more involved in the costs of this war but I have deliberately sought to restrict estimated costs to those more tangible costs and those more directly impacting on Australia. If we look at the costs in world terms, the picture becomes even blacker. What will be the damage to the environment and just what will be the cost of repairing the damage to the environment which is arising out of this war? I have not seen any estimates of that figure yet, but clearly it will be a huge amount. Even accepting, as I do, that this environmental vandalism is overwhelmingly on the side of Saddam Hussein and the Iraqis, the world will still be left with the bill for cleaning it up, and it will be a cost of the war. This environmental vandalism, sadly, is something that I think the whole world will have to come to terms with. We will all have to bear a share of the cost of the cleaning up exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, I find it repugnant to talk about lives and economics in the same context, but we cannot avoid the fact that lives lost amount to costs and the world will have to account for the costs of deaths or destroyed and shattered lives in Iraq, Kuwait, Israel, et cetera. To the international community, the cost of supporting refugees will be enormous, to say nothing of the subsidiary costs of resettling those refugees and the costs to the individuals themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there is the cost of the damage to the world economy and the loss of trade, the loss of tourism, and lost production and productive capacity. It was only years after the Vietnam war that people in the United States and Australia began to realise the damage that was done, particularly to the US economy, through the Vietnam years, and, more recently, the damage that was done to the world economy through the US economic policies at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we must consider the cost of repatriation of hundreds of thousands of troops who see service in this war. In the richer Western countries this will show itself for a long time on the budgets of the particular countries such as the US, Britain, Australia, et cetera. In all of the countries concerned, however, there will be massive psychological damage to surviving soldiers and other service personnel. In the countries of the Gulf the psychological damage done to civilians will be enormous. Again, we are only now becoming more aware of the huge cost of such psychological damage which arose from the Vietnam war. Thousands of veterans never re-established their lives or readjusted to civvy street. Occasional traumatic illustrations of this, such as Vietnam veterans, particularly in the US, undertaking massacres, are only really the more obvious tip of the iceberg. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there is the damage to the physical environment of Iraq, Kuwait, Jordan, Israel, et cetera, which eventually will be measured in billions of dollars. It is quite fair to say that Iraq and Kuwait physically will never be the same again. </PARA>
<PARA> In passing, I want to mention the glee with which certain corporations are waiting in the wings to profit from the rebuilding of these shattered countries and their economies. No doubt some of them are the same companies that supplied the weapons of destruction to Hussein and the allies. This seems to me a bit like digging a giant hole only to fill it in for a huge profit. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, there is the cost in terms of damage to the world order: distrust and hatred by Arabs towards the West, and the impact on the Muslim world-which, incidentally, surrounds Australia-in Indonesia and Malaysia. To us as a nation this cost is one which has not had enough attention paid to it to date. </PARA>
<PARA> This list is hardly exhaustive and is certainly not extensive, but I believe that every member of parliament would agree that the cost of this war will be truly frightening when all the bills are in and all the accounts have been paid. I believe that it is not an exaggeration to say that it is quite likely that we will see a bill of around $250 billion for the total cost of this war-a truly horrendously huge amount of money when we take into account the fact that most of it will have been wasted in this conflict to put down Saddam Hussein. I say `wasted' not in terms of outcomes but in terms of the better things that could have been done with this amount of money towards a new world order. It is certainly the case that with that sort of money we could have bought an enormous amount of improved standards of living, improved education, improved medical services and famine relief for people in both the Gulf region and other parts of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by simply saying something about the current situation in the Gulf. I believe that the next 48 hours may well be crucial in determining whether there will be a ground war, with the horrendous consequences of that. I do not believe that anybody wants a ground war if we can find an appropriate solution. I certainly welcome the apparent softening in the rhetoric contained in the recent statement from Iraq indicating Iraq's willingness to withdraw from Kuwait. Whilst the setting of conditions as outlined in the statement is unacceptable, the statement is a significant indication that Saddam Hussein might now accept that negotiation is a better way to resolve the problems of the Middle East. I certainly hope that is the case. Full scale negotiations should now be undertaken with a view to resolving this conflict prior to the commencement of any ground offensive, with implementation of a cease-fire as soon as it is clear that Iraq will withdraw from Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA> I am hopeful, as any person of goodwill would be, that the discussions that are going on between Iran, the USSR and Iraq will bear some fruit and will see a development with which we can all associate in a hope that this carnage can be ended at the earliest possible time. I think that it would be in Australia's interest if the Australian Government promoted and supported any peace initiatives that come out of those talks. I certainly believe that Australia, having been part of the UN resolutions from the outset as a supporter and then as one of the 28 countries that supplied military equipment in support of the allied push to rid Kuwait of the Iraqis, is well placed to be able to involve itself in and take part in any promotion of peace initiatives at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope from the bottom of my heart that over the next 48 hours some breakthrough will occur which will enable that to happen. It would be a tremendous thing for the world if a ground war in that part of the world could be avoided. I am sure every member of the House hopes that that will be the case. I certainly believe that if there was goodwill contained in the statement from Iraq, that can be teased out by the USSR and the Iranians over the next 24 hours or so. We should then have a clearer picture of what the hopes of peace will be arising out of that process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1990-91, which essentially deals with payments to the Australian Wheat Board arising out of the Gulf trade sanctions, loss of sales of wheat parcels and additional costs to the Commonwealth arising out of our commitment to the Middle East.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I noted with interest the comments by the honourable member for Makin (Mr Duncan). In one sense, he has walked through a minefield because he has taken a leading role in South Australia in the peace movement and in opposition to the war. However, I give the honourable member credit for saying that this should not lead to a sudden, unilateral withdrawal of the forces and that while the forces are in the Middle East they should be adequately funded. While acknowledging his comments on that, I take exception to his passing comment on, in part, Vietnam that the United States undertook massacres, or words to that effect. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DG4">Mr TIM FISCHER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Vietcong and National Vietnamese Army elements committed a horrific massacre in the city of Hue during the Tet offensive. I may have misunderstood the honourable member, and I will give him the benefit of the doubt in that regard-because war is hell. That is now once again absolutely apparent from all that is happening in the Middle East. But there is a job to be done. The Liberal Party and the National Party of Australia have indicated their strong support for the commitment, the task at hand, to liberate Kuwait. In undertaking that task, we must ensure that adequate resources are provided to facilitate the earliest possible completion of the objective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has to be said that it will not be a cheap task. Our commitment is of some consequence, and I reject those who would say that it has been just a token commitment. It is a substantial commitment, given Australia's population and defence resources. Let me remind the House of what that commitment involves. HMAS Brisbane and HMAS Sydney have now been joined by HMAS Westralia. HMAS Success is currently in Singapore but en route back to Australia as part of its rotation. There is also a medical team in the Gulf on the USNS Comfort, a magnificent 45,000 tonne hospital ship, which has its role to play. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also a clearance diving team and a number of Australian Army, Royal Australian Air Force and Royal Australian Navy officers in different related logistical support, exchange and liaison roles in the Middle East. On 21 January the total commitment was around 850 personnel. I understand the total commitment now, in numerical terms, is around 760. We must ensure adequate funding of that resource. Of course, the legislation before the House provides an additional appropriation to the Department of Defence of $52,659,000. </PARA>
<PARA> So in response to the invasion by Iraq of Kuwait-the invasion mounted by President Saddam Hussein on 2 August 1990-Parliament is meeting this day to pick up on yet more of the ramifications arising out of that invasion. As to providing these additional resources, when I visited the Middle East over Christmas I found, to the extent that I could monitor matters during the course of my visit over several days, a frugal attitude to the expenditure of moneys associated with the Australian effort. The personnel, particularly those on HMAS Sydney and HMAS Brisbane, had a job to do, and they were going about that job but not in a wasteful way. </PARA>
<PARA> The same could be said of the logistical support group and others, although it is very difficult to run a war effort and maintain a commitment without spending money and sometimes having to spend more than one would otherwise spend. I was impressed by the sensible, straight up approach of the Navy's commitment. I again take this opportunity to commend its efforts. One night I walked back to my overnight location in a particular port city rather than take a Navy vehicle because it was a good thing to do, on the one hand, and it reduced the cost at a very minor level, on the other hand. </PARA>
<PARA> We must adequately fund this quite substantial commitment by Australia to the Middle East war, and we are approving this funding through the legislation. It goes without saying that my sincere hope is that the job will be done as soon as possible; the objective will be achieved; Kuwait will be liberated; and all Australians involved, including the exchange officers in the desert with British units-some from Deniliquin and Seymour-will safely return home with the accolade of having done the job in the best Anzac tradition, whether they be, as they primarily are, members of the Navy or the small numbers of the Air Force and the Army who are in the Middle East for Australia at this time. I salute their efforts and we wish them well. </PARA>
<PARA> The second dimension of the legislation relates to the Australian Wheat Board and the payments to the Australian Wheat Board to be authorised by this Bill, including an additional $181,411,000, as indicated by the Minister, to be paid by the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce to meet insurance claims associated with defaults by Iraq on credit sales by the Australian Wheat Board. Those sales were insured under the national interest provisions of the Australian Trade Commission Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Gulf War could not have come at a worse time for the rural economy. Wheat, rice and a number of other industries have had their sales programs and markets wrecked by yet another ramification arising from the Gulf war. I remind the House that there is an element in Australia that says, `So what? Maybe Australia in the 1990s does not need to rely heavily on our rural sector'. In dealing with that comment, I quote from the third edition of Agriculture in the Australian Economy, edited by D.B. Williams, page 50, chapter 4:</PARA>
<PARA>The role of agriculture in the Australian economy has changed markedly over the last century. Between the 1860s and the 1940s agricultural contributed between 20 and 30 per cent of Australia's total output. However, in more recent years the rural sector's contribution to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has fallen to around 4 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> While agriculture's contribution to national output has fallen, it continues to make a major contribution to Australia's total exports. In 1988-89, for example, the rural sector's share of merchandise exports (which excludes services) was 34.8 per cent. The performance of the sector is also of importance from an economy-wide perspective because changes in the level of agricultural output can lead to significant short-term changes in the level of total economic activity. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the basis of the submission by the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher) on the matter of public importance. The basis of my submission to the House is that the whole level of economic activity will suffer greatly, as it has already but even more so over the next 12 months, as a consequence of the rural economic crisis and the collapse in commodity prices for so many of our rural industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation has been greatly exacerbated by the impact of the Gulf trade sanctions. Whilst I support the Gulf trade sanctions-they were part of the equation as we tried to head off war and reach a solution through diplomacy-I must say they have come at a great cost. Last week the honourable member for Mallee asked the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) whether he would adhere to his commitment that no one sector would bear the brunt of the costs arising from these trade sanctions. The Prime Minister used carefully chosen words, because we are yet to hear the full detail and extent of compensation which will be afforded the Australian Wheat Board, the Rice Marketing Board and the boards of the other industries which have directly suffered as a consequence of these Gulf trade sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the House that I welcome this particular Bill which provides the first tranche of payments under the insurance arrangements associated with the national interest to the Australian Wheat Board. I point out to the House, to the wheatgrowers and to the nation that these payments represent less than half of the sales to Iraq, which have been effectively destroyed by the Gulf trade sanctions. In any event, those payments are going to be made over three years, which will further add to the difficulties of the Australian Wheat Board. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst one could argue that Iraq would normally be paying over a period of time anyhow, we are going to suffer for a long while into the future regardless of when the Gulf war finishes. This compensation and even additional and expedited compensation will not necessarily retrieve the situation. There will be a whole new ball game in terms of trading arrangements with the Middle East after the completion of the Gulf war. </PARA>
<PARA> I particularly want to issue a warning that we in Australia will be watching the United States very closely in regard to its formulation of any food aid plans to the Middle East in the immediate aftermath of the Gulf war. I fully support the alliance and all its efforts in the Gulf war. However, I am concerned that in the aftermath, agreements could be entered into very quickly which, by virtue of comprehensive food aid plans, would effectively further destroy legitimate markets for the Australian Wheat Board. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not rule out the fact that there may well be a need for food aid. However, I will be closely monitoring special arrangements for heavily subsidised trading by the United States and others with the Middle East to the exclusion of Australia. We have had enough of heavily subsidised sales. For example, the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Dr Blewett) dealt in the House today with the United States highly subsidised sales to Egypt. I say to the United States, `We are your ally in terms of the military role in the Middle East, and Australia deserves a fair go in the arrangements which will arise in the aftermath of the Gulf war, especially in relation to trade with the Middle East'. I appeal for that fair go and I say again that we will indeed monitor very closely all of those arrangements which might be drawn up. Hopefully we will reach that phase without too much delay, but that phase will not be entered into until the Gulf war is completed. </PARA>
<PARA> A direct element associated with Appropriation Bill (No. 3) is the desperate situation of so many wheatgrowers across Australia. They are on the verge of having to finalise decisions with regard to their plantings for this calendar year 1991. They have projections of returns and first payments which are well below the cost of production. I look forward to attending meetings later on today and later this week with representatives from the wheat industry to further discuss their submissions on these matters. There is an entitlement to framework assistance with regard to the plight of the wheat industry, the wool industry and other rural industries. Such initiatives as the abolition of sales tax and the reduction of fuel tax as part of a goods and services tax (GST) package are of high priority in the thinking of the Liberal and National parties, which believe these measures would achieve a great deal. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area of concern is Australian trade sanctions on South Africa. I would like to see the Commonwealth process speeded up so that particularly those trade sanctions affecting full scale resumption of wheat trade are lifted and trade can resume. This should be done as recognition of the real progress and the courageous steps being taken by President de Klerk in South Africa. I accept that the process of dismantling apartheid has a long way to go, nevertheless there has been progress which ought to be recognised. If not recognised, that progress will be endangered as President de Klerk must deal with the extreme right wing in South Africa, which is made up of entrenched and powerful elements. He has had the courage to stand up to them. Let us have the courage to afford him some reward for going down that path by proceeding in a priority way with the lifting of those trade sanctions. That would afford in a very sensible way a direct boost to the Australian Wheat Board, which needs every market it can find. In the best year last decade, wheat sales from Australia to South Africa reached some $55m. Each dollar counts and each $1m counts a great deal in returns to wheatgrowers in this critical year. </PARA>
<PARA> I appeal to the Government to think again about its priorities and to the Foreign Minister, Senator Gareth Evans, to think again. We are going to reach a stage where we will be playing cricket with South Africa before we can export our wheat to South Africa. What type of priority is that, especially in this time of severe rural crisis? Whilst I welcome the progress towards lifting the sporting restrictions, I do not see that that should come before a resumption of trade, especially as South Africa is in a severe drought, that has allowed for a special parcel of one-off arrangements to be made between Australia and South Africa in relation to wheat. We still do not have the full scale trading arrangements that we need or should have. I for one will not be going to any cricket match involving any South African cricket team, either in Australia or South Africa, until we have the right to trade wheat and other rural commodities with South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition supports the legislation in its two fundamental aspects: the additional funding for the Department of Defence in respect of our commitment and the national interest payments in respect of the insurance arrangements. We hope that it will not be too much longer before these objectives are achieved. We hope that the Australian contingent in the Middle East will return safely to Australia with a job well done. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As honourable members are aware, the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) seeks from the Parliament the sum of $234.1m for purposes related to the current crisis in the Middle East. Those purposes are clear and relatively straightforward, as outlined in the Bill's explanatory memorandum.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the present time, the allied response to Iraq's unilateral decision to annex Kuwait is occupying centre stage in the international arena. This is hardly surprising given the political effort that has gone into gaining United Nations support for the anti-Saddam coalition and given the obvious danger to world security that potentially exists in the escalation of that conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, as has happened so often throughout history, situations such as the Middle East crisis provide an excellent opportunity to some of the less scrupulous members of the world community to contemplate forms of action which in more normal circumstances might not be countenanced. With the attention of the Government's media network and the public in general firmly diverted to the trouble spot in question, and with political considerations and short term alliances influencing the responses of nations, it can be a perfect time for tough action to be taken by countries which do not have an overly strong regard for human rights or the rule of law. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the more notable historical examples of wider problems being used as a cover for dark political deeds include the Soviet's 1956 invasion of Hungary, which was accomplished during the height of the Suez crisis, and the Warsaw Pact countries' 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia, which occurred whilst the Vietnam war was entering a particularly nasty period. The two main reasons for the Bill have been well covered, particularly by the previous speaker, the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), and others. </PARA>
<PARA> Today it is my intention to take advantage of the Standing Orders to say a few words about some of the less than salubrious political events which are occurring at the present time under the cover of the Middle East crisis, and to remind the House that there are many migrant members of the Australian community who right now fear for the safety and future of relatives and friends whom they have left behind in the countries in question. I would also like to remind the House that in my constituency alone there are 110 different ethnic groups and some 60 national tongues spoken. These migrant members of our community wrongly believe that because of the Gulf crisis no-one cares what is happening in their homeland. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that most honourable members would agree with me when I say it is no coincidence that Soviet leader Gorbachev's glasnost and perestroika program has come to a shuddering halt as the situation in the Gulf has deteriorated. We have all known for some time of the displeasure which has been building up in the upper echelons of the conservative establishment and the military towards the break-up of the Stalinist central management, but we have also known that the chronic financial problems of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) have forced the leadership to continue dialogue with the West and, therefore, maintain a reasonably moderate line. </PARA>
<PARA> The Gulf crisis and particularly the need by the West for Soviet compliance in the passing of the United Nations Security Council resolution 660 has therefore come as a godsend to the Soviet leadership. They have been able to use the circumstances to place enormous political and military pressure on the-in their opinion-errant Baltic states who, by virtue of factual history and democratic usage of the fundamental right of self-determination, have been moving headlong into seceding from the union. In fact, all of the signs are now present of a return to traditional hardline Kremlim rule, albeit of a more subtle nature, with its disinformation firmly back on the agenda and the troops once again out of the barracks. </PARA>
<PARA> At the present time, the Baltic states are existing in a perilous situation. Soviet troops have taken up positions in the republics, particularly Lithuania, and they have not been backward in showing the people the power of the Soviet gun. There have been one or two notable massacres, and there is every indication that a complete Soviet coup may be on the agenda. As the Soviets have hardened their attitude under the cover of the Gulf crisis, their lead has been passed on to the communist rulers and their mates in Yugoslavia, who have been locked in political battle with the non-communist leaderships of at least four of the republics but particularly of the republics of Croatia and Slovenia. </PARA>
<PARA> In common with the events in the USSR, the jousting between conservatives and non-communists has only recently become serious as the Gulf war has erupted. Again that is not surprising. Like the USSR, Yugoslavia is faced with massive financial imbalances and it needs the patronage of the West in order to hope to escape its problems. It is also caught in the position of becoming isolated as its previous communist neighbours are turning towards democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the Gulf war began, simmering discontent between the Serbian backed communist central government and the republics-with their democratically elected governments, I might add-of Croatia and Slovenia has reached fever pitch. Honourable members may recall, in fact, that we reached the stage two weeks ago where Serbian troops were massed on the Croatian border, following the refusal by Croatian President Dr Franjo Tudjman to obey an order by the Yugoslav President that all Croatian police reservists must be disarmed and demobbed. At that time civil war seemed inevitable, with Italy warning the Serbian leadership that it would intervene on the side of Croatia, and Slovenia also pledging support. Once that crisis was solved, another emerged and currently exists over the central government's attempts to arrest the Croatian Defence Minister on a charge that is vehemently denied by the Croatian-Slovenian leadership as being a political set-up-and the world will see it as a set-up. To say the least, the situation is very dangerous. </PARA>
<PARA> Another place that is very dangerous at this time, of course, is the island of Sri Lanka, although I regard it as being in a different situation to the Baltic states and Yugoslavia. In the case of those two countries, the world has been aware of the pressures that have been building up and there has been in the past support for those people suffering. In my opinion, that has not been the case in Sri Lanka. In fact, I must say that, under the cover of the Gulf crisis, the apparent genocide in that country has appeared to move up a notch, and again the world is ignoring the cry of the minority Tamil people. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst there may be a question of rights and wrongs on both sides which I am willing to go along with, obviously Western powers should be playing a greater part in calling for a cease-fire and looking for a peaceful solution and settlement in that very, very unhappy country. As with the situation in the Baltic states and Yugoslavia, the conflict in Sri Lanka centres around a minority group which is seeking self-determination. The only difference between their situation and the takeover of Kuwait of course is that the state of Kuwait already existed. Very little of those problems has been reported in the Australian press, unfortunately, and of course, as I said when I started off my speech today, that is due partly to the cover-up caused by the Gulf crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately I am of the opinion that the world's trouble spots-and particularly the three spots that I have mentioned-do not get sufficient publicity in the press-and I suspect much of the foreign press is similar although, as I said before, this is particularly understandable because of the present crisis. I can appreciate the feelings of constituents from countries such as Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Croatia, Slovenia and Montenegra when they tell me that they feel that the West has ignored them. When they come to me and tell me of the plight in their homeland, they say they are very sympathetic towards and supportive of the Government's action in Kuwait, but what has the Australian Government done over the past three to four years in relation to the disgusting situation in their homeland, particularly in the case of Sri Lanka? Unfortunately I do not have an answer for them. </PARA>
<PARA> Admittedly, of course, our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has shown his concern for the situation in Sri Lanka in this House on numerous occasions, but he seems to be at this particular time a voice in the wilderness. Hopefully at some time in the future world leaders will take up the cudgels and call for a world conference, because it is obvious to me that the present government in Sri Lanka is not about to call in anybody from the outside to investigate its actions. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said before, there are obviously questions of rights and wrongs on both sides. It is only recently that the Government of that unfortunate island allowed anybody into the northern section to find out what was actually happening. Incidentally, two days prior to their first foray into the Tamil homeland in Sri Lanka the Government bombed the hospital at Jaffna. Claims by the Tamil minority that that had been happening over the years have now been given more attention. I am of the opinion that a cover-up has been occurring in that country. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Australian public that this House has been blind to the events which are occurring under the cover of the Gulf crisis. I ask honourable members to keep in their minds other trouble spots in the world and to assure our immigrants that we share their concerns, see the difficulties ahead for them and give them some hope. As a migrant to this country, my first allegiance is to the country in which I now reside. I understand the concerns of migrants in this country. Of course they are interested in what is happening in their homeland. That is not to say that they are all going to rush over there and take up arms, or take up arms in this country. In regard to any ethnic group which intended to take up arms in this country to help their fellow citizens in their homeland, I would not only discourage them but also not give them my support. Appropriation Bill (No. 3) has the support of all honourable members in the House and I recommend it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to speak during the debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1990-91, and, particularly, on the additional expenditure for the Department of Defence arising from the conflict in the Middle East. The Government has approved additional funds of $68.882m in 1990-91 to cover the immediate costs; of this, $52.659m is being sought under Appropriation Bill (No. 3); the remainder, $16.2m for 1990-91, will be sought through the normal Additional Estimates processes. The Government anticipates a further $27.475m spread over the following two years-$23.6m in 1991-92 and $3.9m in 1992-93. These amounts are for equipment and stores expenditure associated with the deployment of elements of the Australian Defence Force to the Middle East.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to address a few comments on this aspect. Australian Defence Industries Pty Ltd (ADI) is a corporate structure which is 100 per cent owned by the Federal Government. Part of it is situated in the electorate of Bendigo. My understanding is that some of the components of the vessels serving in the Middle East at the moment-some of the weapons and weapons systems being used by Australian forces in the Middle East-were wholly or partly made or serviced at the Bendigo ADI factory. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the ADI complex at Bendigo is a very important part of our defence establishments. I read with great interest on 30 November 1990 a letter to employees by the Managing Director of Australian Defence Industries Pty Ltd, which had the support and approval of the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) and also the Chief of the Defence Force, General Gration. That letter set out a statement of restructuring objectives for Australian Defence Industries Pty Ltd. Amongst those restructuring objectives were the closure of the Maribyrnong facility and the fact that the Bendigo facility will become the centre of ADI's heavy engineering business. The capabilities are currently split between Maribyrnong and Bendigo and they will be consolidated at Bendigo into one integrated heavy engineering facility which will be the best of its kind in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment there are 552 employees at the Maribyrnong ADI facility. I understand that the retrenchments from that plant will be staged over a period of time to enable the heavy engineering facility at the Maribyrnong plant to be consolidated at the Bendigo ADI plant. I am pleased that the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean) is at the table at the moment. He would be aware of the magnificent facility in Bendigo and the quality of the work that that organisation has produced for the Department of Defence and for the heavy engineering market in Australia and overseas. I am sure that he would support the consolidation of ADI at Bendigo and the closure of Maribyrnong at the earliest opportunity to ensure that the efficiency and productivity of the ADI plant at Bendigo are further elevated to the highest level to enable it to compete on world markets. </PARA>
<PARA> I will outline the difficulty that I have with what is happening at the moment. On 8 June 1989 the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) visited Australian Defence Industries at Bendigo. The Bendigo Advertiser-that well-known paper in the Bendigo district-reported him making the following comments about the factory and the Anzac frigate project:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hawke said he was proud as he walked around the ordnance factory-</PARA>
<PARA>as it was called; now the ADI-</PARA>
<PARA>of the way in which the factory now functioned as a competitive and strong industry. He said he would like to be as sure of the next Melbourne or Bendigo cup winner as he was of the factory's chance of picking up a large slice of the new ANZAC class frigate contract. It was a far cry, he said, from the outmoded, uncompetitive set-up the previous Liberal government had tried to sell off six years ago. </PARA>
<PARA>There was also a statement at about the same time from the then Minister for Defence, the present Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley), and the then member for Bendigo, Mr Brumby, that the establishment of ADI and the retrenchment of 67 employees at that time would make Bendigo commercially viable and enable the factory to win major contracts on the submarine and Anzac frigate projects. </PARA>
<PARA> There was also a statement on 21 July 1989 from Mr D. Kennedy, MLA, the State Labor member for Bendigo West, claiming that ADI Bendigo stood to win up to $200m worth of contracts over 10 years from the Anzac frigate project. There was also a statement from the former member for Bendigo on 15 August 1989 that he believed that the Anzac ship project could be worth up to $200m to Bendigo over the next 10 years. Mr Brumby went on to state that recent Government changes to the structure of operations at the Bendigo facility-designed to improve long term competitiveness and efficiency-would improve the prospects for gaining the maximum possible work from the project. </PARA>
<PARA> The former Minister for Defence, as I have said, similarly made a statement that the restructured work force-in fact, the retrenchment of 67 employees-would make the Bendigo ADI factory commercially viable and there would be no need for any further retrenchments. Then came the announcement by ADI on 25 January 1991 that it proposed to make up to 177 Bendigo employees of Australian Defence Industries Ltd redundant by the end of the year. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy Speaker, is it any wonder that the employees of Australian Defence Industries at Bendigo feel that the Government has betrayed them, after the statements by the Prime Minister, the former Federal member, the former Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley, and the State member for Bendigo West?</PARA>
<PARA> There was also a statement by a former colleague of mine, the State Industry and Economic Planning Minister, Mr David White, that, as a result of the announcement on 30 November by Australian Defence Industries, Bendigo could develop into a world-class heavy engineering centre. The Minister said that his Department had started discussions with Australian Defence Industries on the use of ADI land at Ravenswood, south of Bendigo, which would be suitable for an ammunition manufacturing plant employing about 400 people. He also said that his Department would encourage ADI to move much of its operation to Bendigo. </PARA>
<PARA> Is it any wonder that the employees of the Australian Defence Industries plant at Bendigo are upset and feel they have been betrayed by the Government when it was announced on 25 January 1991 that up to 177 Bendigo employees would be made redundant by the end of the year, particularly after hearing all the statements from the Prime Minister right through to the Minister for Defence and down to the local members, as well as a State Minister?</PARA>
<PARA> I refer the House to the 1990 annual report of Australian Defence Industries. At page 7 of that document ADI management further spelt out that the Maribyrnong facility of ADI will close and the heavy engineering capability will be moved to Bendigo. The land will be redeveloped for light industrial and residential purposes. I assure you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that that land is particularly valuable and will be highly sought after for light industrial and residential purposes. It is very close to Melbourne and will command a very attractive price. </PARA>
<PARA> The report goes on to say that the Bendigo facility will become the company's heavy engineering centre. It is quite clearly spelt out in the 1990 report of Australian Defence Industries at page 11, under the heading `Weapons and Engineering', and a turnover of $113.2m, that the Maribyrnong, Melbourne, facility is a heavy engineering facility with forging, gun barrel and heavy machining capabilities. The report states that the Bendigo, Victoria, factory is also a heavy engineering facility with major machining capabilities. These are all directed towards ordnance componentry and they have been manufacturing ordnance products for many years. But it is quite obvious, even from the annual report of ADI, that both Maribyrnong and Bendigo are undertaking work of a very similar nature and it would not be difficult to consolidate all those activities at ADI's plant in Bendigo. In fact, the report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Barrels are forged, rough-machined and auto-frettaged at Maribyrnong and finish machined at Bendigo.</PARA>
<PARA>That seems to be a fairly laborious and inefficient way of doing it. Perhaps the experts can prove me wrong, but certainly there appears to be a duplication of the work that is done at Maribyrnong and Bendigo. The more expeditiously the closure of Maribyrnong occurs and the consolidation with Bendigo ADI is performed the sooner it will lead to greater productivity and efficiency at the ADI plant at Bendigo. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also concerned about Australia's future commitment to the defence manufacturing capability. I wonder whether the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray, believes that it is wise to diminish the level of employment in Australia's defence industries at a time when we are in a world situation of conflict and Australia's forces, through their naval vessels being in the Middle East, are serving overseas. I pose that question very seriously to the Minister for Defence. Does he believe that there should be a diminished level of employment at this time?</PARA>
<PARA> The things that have caused great concern to the employees of Australian Defence Industries at Bendigo have been that the plant has had a rather turbulent period over the last two to three years and the employees have been endeavouring to cooperate with management right throughout to ensure that the efficiency and productivity of the ADI plant at Bendigo are maintained at a high level. They have asked to be consulted on the changes to the structure of the ADI plant at Bendigo so that they can be involved in the processes of working out where any possible efficiencies and productivity improvements can be made. If there is a need for redundancies to be made, they wish to be involved in the consultation process which may lead to some of those employees taking redundancy payments and exiting from that plant. But it is important that the people on the shop floor have the opportunity to have that input into the restructuring of the ADI at Bendigo. </PARA>
<PARA> I am particularly anxious to pursue the consolidation of the ADI at Bendigo and to see the closure of the ADI Maribyrnong plant as quickly as possible to enable that consolidation to take place and the efficiency of the ADI plant to be put at the highest possible level so it can compete for export contracts and also broaden its scope of activity in the heavy engineering field. </PARA>
<PARA> The opportunity to speak on the Appropriation Bill has provided me with the chance to set out just where I feel Australian defence construction should be heading. I will be forwarding my comments to the Minister for Defence for his consideration. I ask the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe), who is now at the table, to ensure that the Minister has these matters brought to this attention because I believe they are important to Australia's defence capability. As we know, it is important that we have the expertise and the skills in this country to provide for our own defence. The Opposition does not oppose the measures contained in the Bill and I thank the House for the opportunity to make some comments on it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to comment on three issues in relation to Appropriation Bill (No. 3). The first is about the Bill itself. The justification for the Bill is quite clear: it relates to extra advances to the Minister for Finance so that expenditure associated with the conflict in the Gulf can be paid for. The major part of the expenditure is for payment of insurance claims associated with defaults by Iraq on credit sales by the Australian Wheat Board which were insured through the Export Finance and Insurance Division. That appropriation is for $181m. That is an example of the problem that exists in many developing countries of the default on debts which they have incurred during the last decade. This is a particular kind of default, of course, associated with a country which was experiencing an embargo, entirely appropriately, on its trade, but it is a cost that Australia has to bear as a result of that embargo and it is quite a substantial cost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other part of the Bill is for nearly $53m for extra equipment and stores for the Department of Defence, associated with the deployment of our three ships in the Gulf. It is quite understandable that an additional appropriation should have been made to cover that. It was not inevitable, by the way, that that appropriation would have been made. The British defence vote, for example, was reduced last week by 3 per cent in real terms, despite the fact that Britain's involvement in the Gulf conflict is much greater than Australia's. Nevertheless, the fact that there is an additional requirement on the Department of Defence caused by our participation makes its request for this additional appropriation quite understandable. </PARA>
<PARA> Both those allocations illustrate the costs of a conflict like this. They are relatively small costs compared with those that other major participants are bearing, but it is true that one of the major costs of war is the increased defence expenditure that results, which obviously, in many countries, and perhaps in Australia as well, leads to lower expenditure on higher priority economic and social outlays. But, as well as that, in this case it causes us a loss through non-payment for our wheat. That is a loss that is being experienced by many developing countries, and by industrialised countries too.</PARA>
<PARA> That leads on to the second issue that I want to mention. This Bill does not include an allocation for the increase in humanitarian aid which Australia has decided to give in the Gulf. I understand that that allocation can come through what is normal in the financial year-that is, what would normally be Appropriation Bills Nos 3 and 4, which no doubt will be Appropriation Bills Nos 4 and 5 this year. In those Appropriation Bills, supplementary expenditure which has been decided on during the year is presented to Parliament for passage; I expect that the grants that have already been promised for refugees of the Gulf conflict, to the Red Cross to support its humanitarian work in the Gulf and other humanitarian purposes related to the Gulf war will be allocated. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that that additional aid expenditure come through an additional appropriation, as has happened in the case of defence, rather than simply through a reshuffling of expenditure within the aid vote. The aid vote has been reduced in recent years-though not in the last financial year, and I congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) on that outcome-but it is important that we reverse the decline of recent years and that we build up that vote when it is warranted. This is absolutely clearly a case where that increase is entirely warranted. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand from the Minister for Trade and Overseas Negotiations (Dr Blewett) that he expects more funds will be needed to cope with humanitarian work needed in the Gulf. So we can expect that additional announcements beyond the $5m already announced will be made in due course, and I hope that all those additional items of outlays will be funded in Appropriation Bill (No. 4). </PARA>
<PARA> It is very important that we recognise that not only Western countries that are involved directly in the conflict but also developing countries which are not supplying troops, ships or equipment in the Gulf are paying a cost for this war. For example, a number of the countries to which Australia gives aid are suffering substantial economic problems as a result of the Gulf war. That, of course, most obviously is experienced through increased petroleum prices, and the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths), who is at the table, is familiar with the problems of that for Australia. But many countries are having to pay more for their petrol as a result of the Gulf war, and that is a particular drain on the resources of developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, a number of the developing countries have had some of their citizens working in the Gulf as employees of people there; there is a major loss of remittances from those expatriates working in the Gulf. Countries that have experienced that include particularly the Philippines, Bangladesh, Pakistan and Sri Lanka, all countries to which Australia gives aid. As well as those losses of remittances-and in some countries they are a major loss-there are losses of exports to Iraq, which is a major cost for some of those countries. It would be a fine thing if we could build up our aid to some of those countries to help offset the costs of the war they are experiencing. Several of those countries have groups of donors who meet; they will be asking for additional funds. It would be good if Australia could respond compassionately to those requests. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point I want to mention is the recent statement by the Iraqi Government offering to withdraw from Kuwait on certain conditions. That statement as it stands clearly does not provide a basis for a solution to the conflict, because it is conditional and those conditions are not acceptable in any sense to the allies. But it is a significant concession by Iraq that for the first time it has begun to talk about withdrawing from Kuwait. That offer seems to me to be akin to an ambit claim, the kind of claim which is made by parties to industrial conflict in Australia when they ask for a larger wage increase than they expect to get. If it is of that kind, then it provides a basis for the beginning of negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> I think there is a strong case for the countries that are involved in trying to drive Iraq out of Kuwait to seize this opportunity and begin negotiations. Such negotiations would not require a cease-fire. A cease-fire would only be responsibly put in place when it was absolutely clear that Iraq was about to begin withdrawing. I am not suggesting that there should be a cease-fire at this point, but I am suggesting-and I am supporting what the United Nations Secretary-General has said-that the fact that Iraq is now talking about withdrawing from Kuwait under certain conditions is a step forward, that we should recognise that and that we should begin negotiations with them. </PARA>
<PARA> It is possible that the visit by the Iraqi foreign Minister to Moscow will provide, in a sense, a proxy for those negotiations in the next day or two; I am sure we all hope that the Soviet Union will be able to push Iraq further in the direction of an unconditional withdrawal. Perhaps that will be sufficient, but it is quite likely that it will not be sufficient. If it is not, then concerted negotiations under the chairmanship of the United Nations Secretary-General could, I believe, responsibly begin. When it is clear that Iraq is committed to withdrawing, then a cease-fire would be possible. I am sure everyone wants that outcome; let us seize this opportunity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I start to comment on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1990-91, which is before us today, I will make a couple of remarks about the contribution of the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) to this debate. One can say about the honourable member that he always mounts a very logical argument, and he raised two points which are worthy of consideration. The first refers to supplementary financial allocations in other areas, particularly those affecting the refugee situation and other aspects of international compassion. I agree with him on those points, but of course I understand the realism of the situation; I understand that the Government is faced with budgetary considerations in lots of areas. I merely point out to the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) and indeed to other Ministers in the Government the logic of the honourable member's argument and I hope that they will take it on board as they look at other priorities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point the honourable member raised was in relation to the cease-fire, and I will come back to that when I make some comments on that aspect of the debate. I refer the House to what the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) said in his second reading speech. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA>This Government has played an active role in support of the United Nations' sanctions and that role has not been without cost. </PARA>
<PARA>Today we are in this House debating an appropriation Bill which makes those points and makes them in the light of the financial reality. Today I would like to comment on both aspects of the Bill, firstly, in terms of the defence implications, and, secondly, in terms of what is loosely called the wheat debt. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, with regard to the defence implications, it seems to me that it is very easy for us to sit back in the relative comfort of this Parliament and say that the personal commitment and professionalism of our Australian Defence Force men and women will get us through this and other operational commitments. That is clearly untrue and it is only part of a much wider picture. </PARA>
<PARA> For too long our Defence Force has suffered from a syndrome which I would term financial stretch-in other words, a syndrome of doing more with less. That is difficult enough in a peacetime environment, free from live operational commitment; however, it is nigh on impossible in operational circumstances such as those in which we find ourselves in the Gulf today. Let us be blunt about it: we are meeting those commitments by the seat of the Australian Defence Force's operational and financial pants. </PARA>
<PARA> On 4 December the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said in this place that Australia is to play an increasing naval role in an international force area defence system requiring medium to long range surface-to-air missile systems, a real-time operational data transfer capability, and an effective self-defence gun and close-in weapons system capacity. To satisfy that, what do we have in the Royal Australian Navy inventory at present?</PARA>
<PARA> In a nutshell, we have seven ships-three guided missile destroyers and four guided missile frigates. In fact, the real story is far more telling. According to public reports, of the four frigates we have one in refit, HMAS Canberra, whose close-in weapons system has been borrowed by the destroyer HMAS Brisbane, which is in the northern Gulf region and which has also borrowed one of the close-in weapons systems from a new frigate that is being built in Williamstown dockyard. Of the three destroyers, only Brisbane is currently fitted with the close-in weapons system needed to be fully effective in the most likely high risk operational settings. Of the other two, HMAS Hobart is in refit and, as I understand it, HMAS Perth was fitted for, but not with, this capability during its recent self-maintenance period. In other words, we have three frigates-HMAS Sydney, HMAS Darwin and HMAS Adelaide-and a destroyer, the Brisbane, fully operational at this point for operational service in the high risk environment of the Gulf, and only then by borrowing and begging from other assets. Not only must that put undue pressure on the individual ships and crews, but I would also suggest that it does not augur well for our operational longevity in a protracted conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, whilst we have the most modern naval Seahawk helicopters involved in the force, I am informed that almost all of the Australian spares for those aircraft were afloat in the force until recently and that several of those aircraft at the naval air station at Nowra are operationally constrained as a result of items being, once again, borrowed to make sure that that force operates. </PARA>
<PARA> I therefore go much further than the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) did on 4 December when, in reply to the Prime Minister's statement on the Gulf, he talked of defence policy limitations. Indeed, the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) said in that debate that we persist with defence on the cheap while we understandably want to play with the big boys internationally. Demonstrably, we do that under very real resource difficulties. It is therefore incumbent, both on the Government and on this Opposition, not only to recognise it rhetorically but also to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA> In the debate on 5 December in this place I said:</PARA>
<PARA>At the very least, in the short term I hope that the Government can see its way clear to recognise this financially by supplementing budgetary allocations. To ask the Department of Defence to bear the resource ramifications of increased rates of operational effort in the Gulf within current allocations is not only unrealistic but it is patently inequitable and arguably immoral. Professionalism of our Defence Force personnel alone will not suffice. Resource deficiencies need to be recognised; more importantly, they need to be reversed and they need to be reversed quickly. </PARA>
<PARA>Hence today's appropriation Bill, which of course has this Opposition's fullest support. I agree with what the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) said earlier in this debate about our need to watch that those supplementary allocations are not used unnecessarily by this Government and to make sure that the Government is kept accountable in terms of the $100m or thereabouts per annum which is inherent in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I also take the opportunity at this point to reject-and reject categorically-what the honourable member for Makin (Mr Duncan) said about our token commitment in the Gulf. I agree entirely with what the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) said: it is not a token commitment; it is a substantial commitment, and it is a commitment of which we in this place and the other place, and indeed everybody across this nation, should all be justifiably proud. I was delighted when I heard what the honourable member for Fraser had to say on that particular point. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, I would like to highlight something else that the honourable member for Mayo said about the need for a defence strategy review. As many of us in this place would know, the Leader of the Opposition recently announced the defence strategy review-a review which I wholeheartedly support. It is something upon which I think this particular Government falls down very badly. I think the Gulf war is already showing the inadequacies of the Government's 1987 White Paper on the defence of Australia, particularly in terms of self-reliance. Whilst I might disagree in part with what the honourable member for Mayo said about `fortress Australia', nevertheless the point he makes is very valid and I think it highlights that the areas of primary strategic importance for this nation are, indeed, not shown clearly in the Defence White Paper. </PARA>
<PARA> I also take the opportunity at this point in the debate to pay tribute, as indeed a number of other speakers have done, to all those in the Defence Force involved in the Gulf and to those in the ship's companies of HMAS Darwin, HMAS Adelaide and HMAS Success, which have already been part of the earlier deployment, and of HMAS Brisbane, HMAS Sydney and HMAS Westralia, presently in the Gulf region. I also pay tribute to our exchange personnel. Somewhere in the region of 30 exchange personnel are serving with the United States, British and Canadian forces in that area. I also pay tribute to the medical teams and the logistic teams in that area of conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> With the indulgence of the House, I also would like to pay particular tribute to one man. That one man as of next month will have served 45 years in the Royal Australian Navy, for the last six years as the Chief of Naval Staff. Vice-Admiral Mike Hudson will be retiring on 8 March, and I take the opportunity in the House today to pay tribute to him for the contribution he has made not only to the Royal Australian Navy over a very long period of time but particularly for his very smooth administration and command of the naval forces in the lead-up to and the ongoing commitment in the Gulf. I think that Vice-Admiral Hudson is owed a debt of gratitude both from this House and from the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> In the few minutes available to me to conclude this speech, I would now like to turn to the question of the wheat debt. I refer to what I said in this place on 22 January, again in the context of the Gulf debate. I said:</PARA>
<PARA>I simply make the point to the House that there are serious ongoing domestic economic issues to be addressed also and we should not let these be shrouded unduly by the international ramifications of this war. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, in debating the legislation before us today we have to consider that very point. As the honourable member for Farrer said in his contribution to this debate, the Gulf situation could not have come at a worse time for the rural sector. I agree entirely with what he had to say on that point. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Wheat Board last year predicted that wheat prices would fall by somewhere in the region of 26 per cent this year in reaction to huge crops overseas, to a high priced Australian dollar and, of course, to the uncertainties created by the Iraqi crisis. Also, on something else that was raised by a number of speakers, the United States export enhancement program, or EEP, which is being used by the US to push subsidised grain onto world markets, has contributed to a slide in world prices. I notice that President Bush has a request before Congress to lift the spending cap on EEP, currently set at somewhere in the region of $US425m, to $US900m this year and $US1.2 billion in 1992. Clearly, that is very unattractive for the Australian wheat grower indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> I also would like to refer the House to something that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) said in August of last year. He said that the Government believed that Iraq would honour its debts for wheat sold and delivered on credit terms and that it would continue to buy wheat once sanctions were lifted. How ironic it is that today we should be considering a piece of legislation which indeed refutes in many ways what the Minister was saying only five months ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Some suggest that Australia's support for the United Nations trade embargo on Iraq could cost $1 billion in lost sales and possible defaults on credit sales. Indeed, Iraq is the second largest buyer of Australian wheat. The wheat export industry is worth about $2.2 billion per year and, as is reflected in this legislation, Australia is owed somewhere in excess of $600m as a result of the Iraqi conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Melbourne Age on 26 January this year an article by journalist Sheena MacLean was headed, `Wheat farmers hit by cross-fire on two fronts'. I quote in part from that article:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia's embattled wheat growers, hit hard by the Gulf war, are also the victims of a second deadly war, only this war doesn't make the television news, and the aggressor is the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> Wheat producers, who have already lost their second-biggest market, Iraq-worth about $A256 million a year and with a question-mark hanging over $600 million of wheat bought by Iraq on credit-are suffering shell shock in a growing trade war between the US and Europe. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, that trade war has been mentioned by many of the earlier speakers in this debate. She goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The US raised the stakes this week-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the week of 21 January-</PARA>
<PARA>with the announcement that it will seek more money from Congress to subsidise wheat and other exports, a move that has been criticised by the Australian Government. Already, in the first three months of its marketing year, the US has allocated $A260 million to export subsidies, half its total for the year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Americans argue that the subsidies are aimed at pressuring the European Community to re-examine its policy of propping up inefficient farmers, but the non-subsidised exporters such as Australia are crippled in the cross-fire. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OJ4">Mr TAYLOR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. On the one hand, we find that the subsidy war has continued unabated for the past four months, pushing world wheat prices to new lows. We find, for example, that the US has just completed a big sale of half a million tonnes to the Soviet Union at $A92 a tonne with a $A50 subsidy. On the other hand, we find Australian growers, facing their lowest returns in 50 years, are receiving about $A120 a tonne, the world market price, which barely covers production costs. European producers are guaranteed $A351 a tonne, and the US target price guarantees American growers at least $A187 a tonne.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Very reasonably, the industry fears that the US-European Community trade battle will leave it in such a weakened state that it will be unable to recover. It is also concerned that a prolonged war in the Gulf could close off trade to the Middle East, which makes up half of Australia's total wheat export market, as I said before, of about 11.3 million tonnes. </PARA>
<PARA>The Vice-President of the Grains Council of Australia went a bit further and was a bit stronger when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>There are risks in so far as the United States may well use the end of the war, and the period of reconstruction afterwards . . . They won't be popular when the war is over and they may well try to smooth the way with some pretty cheap grain. </PARA>
<PARA> The Middle East is our biggest market, and the presence of the US in the Gulf could have a severe impact on Australian trade. It is a matter of grave concern to us that the whole Middle Eastern trading patterns can be grossly upset by this, and we will be the losers. I agree with the honourable member for Farrer when he says that all Australia needs in relation to wheat exports is a fair go. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too rise in support of Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1990-91. I bear in mind-as previous speakers have acknowledged-that it is an Appropriation Bill in which specific amounts are being expended for problems that we have experienced since the Budget was introduced. I am pleased that the Opposition is fully supporting the Bill, because I believe it certainly needs immediate passage through both Houses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the same time, having listened to previous speakers, I will not go into a full commitment and reiterate my view on the Gulf crisis. We have already had the opportunity of two full day sittings in this Parliament when that debate occurred. I would like to put on record once again my commitment to the resolutions that this Government put up in support of the United Nations, and my admiration also-and on behalf of my community-for the wonderful work being done by our men and women in very trying circumstances. Also I wish to express my support and my heartfelt feeling for my constituents who have family involved overseas, and from whom they have heard very little since the Gulf crisis started. </PARA>
<PARA> I am mindful not only of the hostilities, but of the fact that the hostilities have moved from the front page of our minds-not our media, but our minds-the problems that our communities at large are experiencing. These are the problems I wish to bring before the House through the debate on this Appropriation Bill. They have been brought to my mind as the member for Prospect in the State of New South Wales in the last six months particularly. Specifically, I want to deal with unemployment. On recent statistics -the figures available to me in December of last year-I found that, of some 704,000 who are unemployed, over 209,000 were unemployed in New South Wales but, more particularly, over 15,200 were in my electorate of Fairfield, which also covers part of Liverpool. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, whilst we are looking at the passage of this Bill and the appropriation expenditure, we must remind ourselves also that unemployment is obviously a very serious problem within Australia. I believe, after examining those statistics, that it is especially serious in my electorate. In the last six months the overall unemployment rate in our Fairfield area has fluctuated between a high of 12.2 per cent in July 1990 and its current level of 11.7 per cent, reaching a low of 8.8 per cent in November just gone. The impact of these unemployment estimates has been so keenly felt by welfare agencies within my electorate that I believe that we must continue to have the matter brought before this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> On 14 November last year the Australian newspaper reported that the President of the Australian Council of Social Service (ACOSS), Ms Merle Mitchell, stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Welfare agencies were under great strain as families bore the brunt of the increase in the jobless. </PARA>
<PARA>Ms Mitchell went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>We've got substantial numbers of people who are now being retrenched. The problem can be reflected very much in the way the emergency relief agencies are all reporting that they are unable to continue . . . to cope with the increase in demand for assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, in the last couple of months, I have had a number of my constituents come to me in my Fairfield electorate office desperately looking for help. They have been turned away because welfare agencies do not have the money to assist them in their area of need. The agencies do not have the capacity to deal with the huge numbers of people now coming before them. </PARA>
<PARA> I recollect that our Sunday Telegraph in New South Wales on 9 September last year ran a story about unemployment in Sydney's west and said that suburbs in and around my Prospect electorate had `the fastest growing dole queues in NSW'. In that article the Mayor of the City of Fairfield, Alderman Lawrence White, said that the population of Cabramatta, which forms part of my electorate:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . had become used to being near the bottom of the dole scrap heap. We are the sort of area that suffers the effect of any downturn in the economy before anywhere else. </PARA>
<PARA>I think we should also realise that the City of Fairfield has the highest number of overseas born residents. This is information I am continually bringing before this Parliament, and I wish to do it again, because in 1986 the census showed us that some 70,529 people who were born overseas were in my electorate. That has now increased by one-third, and we see it continuing to grow. Fairfield's overall population in 1986 was 157,850, which was an increase of 30.54 per cent since 1981. It is also now estimated, following the continuation of this growth, that the projected population has increased by some 4 per cent every year since 1986. In June of last year the estimated population of our city was in excess of 180,000 and continually growing. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only have migrants continued to increase the population, but our area-indeed all of Prospect-now has a very high youth population. Consequently, my electorate's population consists largely of two sectors that are the worst affected by unemployment-youth and migrants. The Age reported on 12 January of this year:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the sharpest decline in jobs has been among the young. </PARA>
<PARA>Male teenagers have been the hardest hit. Migrants also, as always, are having difficulty finding employment. In the six months to December 1990, unemployment rates in New South Wales-and Australia-for people born outside Australia rose steadily. In July 1990 in New South Wales the migrant unemployment rate was 7.405 per cent, and by December it had risen to 8.145 per cent. Nationally the rate rose from 7.654 per cent in July to 8.940 per cent in December. Clearly, non-English speaking people and youth are the populations now being so badly affected by unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of this Australians, and particularly the people in my electorate, need federally funded employment and training programs. Our youth must continue to be encouraged to remain at school and to take the benefit of the education that is available to them. It is this Hawke Labor Government that has done so much for the youth of Australia. For instance, as reported in the Sydney Morning Herald on 3 October last year-and certainly I have no problem with repeating this:</PARA>
<PARA>The Federal Government's introduction of a compulsory training levy on July 1st led to 45 per cent of firms reporting increased training expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA>More than 90 per cent of firms had at least some training program in place in the September quarter, which led the Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, Mr Phillip Holt, to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Despite the gloomy picture, manufacturers are trying to improve their own lot via training. Expenditure on research and development also increased defying flat expenditure on plant and equipment. </PARA>
<PARA>This is good news. It is good news for blue collar workers and those involved in the manufacturing industry, which many of my constituents are. However, many blue collar workers are bearing the brunt of the job market collapse, according to an article on 12 January this year in the Age:</PARA>
<PARA>Detailed statistics for the labour market in November show the greatest increase in unemployment-and the greatest fall in employment-has been among young men who work with their hands, especially in the construction industry, manufacturing, mining and commerce. </PARA>
<PARA>According also to the Sydney Morning Herald of 7 September 1990:</PARA>
<PARA>The quarterly survey of industrial trends conducted by the Confederation of Australian Industry and Westpac found manufacturing employers at their most pessimistic since the 1982-83 recession. More than 60 per cent of respondent companies were operating at below normal capacity and the proportion of manufacturers expecting a reduction in orders was the highest since September 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> We have found that employers are now being encouraged to keep on apprentices and trainees to ensure that economic recovery is not impeded by skill shortages. In my opinion, it has also reinforced the importance of our federally funded training programs such as we have in operation with Skillshare and Job Club. </PARA>
<PARA> On 27 November last I had the opportunity of attending an official graduation ceremony of participants in the Wesley Mission's Effect Employment Skillshare project in Fairfield. There were 38 graduates in that first session. Those 38 graduates came from Fiji, India, the Philippines, Laos, El Salvador, Syria, Iran, China, Vietnam, Macedonia, Chile, Cambodia, Thursday Island, Iraq, Armenia, Uruguay, and, of course, we had a couple of Australians. I was very pleased to be part of that graduation and to be involved to see what previously had to those people been a hopeless case-an opportunity of graduating with some skills. When I was speaking to the graduates at the end of the ceremony I found that the majority of them were long term unemployed. Some had been out of work for nearly seven years, but until we introduced the Skillshare programs they did not have the confidence to be involved and to participate. In graduating from those particular courses-sewing, English, employment, general labouring and advanced English-those people were presented with certificates, resumes and calling cards with their names and a brief outline of their skills printed on them. They then became assisted graduates to go into the work force. </PARA>
<PARA> Since opening in July of last year that one particular skill program, Effect Employment, has assisted over 400 people within my electorate. Eighty per cent, I am proud to say in this House, have now found employment or have gone on to further education. The purpose of our Skillshare programs is to help people who have been unemployed for a long period, particularly those from non-English speaking backgrounds. They also help our older unemployed workers and our disadvantaged people who have for a long time been out of the work force. We look also at assisting our youth who are having problems at the moment finding work. </PARA>
<PARA> The Skillshare program revolves around the concept of cooperation with local communities to ensure that the training participants receive a relevant requirement of what is available in the labour market. Since its introduction in 1988 that particular program has received strong support from the community groups, from employers and certainly from the unemployed people Australia-wide. It has successfully helped many people make the transition from long term unemployment to work or further training. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, I am proud to say, two other Skillshare projects in addition to Effect Employment in my electorate. They are Mission Employment, which is also based in Fairfield, and Cabramatta Skillshare, based in Cabramatta. We hope that another Cabramatta Skillshare project presently being made available in Bonnyrigg will experience the same success as those already in operation have achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout Australia in 1989 we had some 358 Skillshare projects operating. They assisted over 60,000 people. In 1990 we saw an increase in those projects, but most particularly we saw a range of enhancements to Skillshare being introduced in that Budget year. That was to help target marginal groups of the long term unemployed of whom I have spoken. One such benefit which I was very pleased to see come into operation was the operating hours to assist those women who are perhaps disadvantaged by being unable to arrange child-care in the daytime but are able to organise evening child-care. We now have courses available at night to assist those women to be retrained and to give them confidence to go back into the work force. We also have in existence an extension of the child-care fee assistance for sole parents participating in any Skillshare activity. I think that these are the things about which we should stand up and be proud. They need to be repeated over and over again. </PARA>
<PARA> Skillshare literacy resource officers have now been made available also to many Skillshare projects to help participants who need to improve their literacy, numeracy and/or their English language skills prior to entering the work force or, as I have stated in cases that I have given as an example here tonight, prior to even attempting training. </PARA>
<PARA> Another innovative scheme in operation on which I am pleased to report is Job Clubs. That has been funded by the Job Search training program. It is located with the Skillshare projects and is certainly very effective in its operation. The Job Club itself is a three-week course. It is designed again to assist the unemployed people in acquiring skills to secure employment. It allows them and teaches them how to do an interview, how to use the telephone, how to dress and how to answer questions on that interview. It also requires participants to attend job interviews and shows them where to start looking for work. </PARA>
<PARA> The continuing success of community based labour market programs such as Skillshare and Job Club have proven that the Australian community can make a positive contribution towards assisting unemployed people in obtaining employment and learning to cope with unemployment. I am proud to say that community groups in particular have shown that they can provide effective assistance to unemployed people in informal, innovative but, most particularly, cost-effective ways. One of the most pleasing and most significant features of the Skillshare program of which I have spoken is that it operates as a partnership between the community and government. It provides a much needed service for many Australian job seekers. </PARA>
<PARA> Many people go through life thinking they have no notable skills. Programs such as Skillshare and Job Club show these people that they do have skills; they have never been given the opportunities in which to find them. With unemployment levels as high as they are, and as Australia is currently experiencing, programs such as Skillshare are to be encouraged and supported, not only morally but financially. If Australia is to emerge from this recession retaining the tag of the clever country, we must invest more in our human resources, do everything in our power to help ease our current unemployment levels and increase training in our labour force. </PARA>
<PARA> With the limited time left to me, I again, in commending this Bill to the House, compliment our servicemen and women, and appeal that sanity will prevail, but most particularly, that we as a country will stand united in the resolution that has been passed by this Parliament in support of the United Nations. We cannot, as I have said before, bow down to tyranny. We must learn by our past histories. We must learn from the 1930s, as I have said in this House during the debate on the Gulf war. We must aid and assist when we are called on to do so, even though, as many members have repeated in this House, it may be limited. I believe that we have given a lot considering our population and our country. I support the Government. I support the Bill before the House. Let us hope that eventually we will see peace in the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight's debate gives us an opportunity to select a variety of topics with which to deal. There is one I want to touch on in my speech this evening. Since 1980, with the exception of 1985, the Treasury has been issuing papers entitled `Tax expenditure statements'. At first they were included in the Budget papers. More recently they have been issued as separate publications. Last year the 1990 statement was made available in December of that year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In these statements the Treasury has attempted to measure the amount of income tax forgone as a consequence of what it calls tax expenditures. It has defined these expenditures as provisions of the tax system which are considered to be deviations from `the normal taxation structure' which reduce or increase the amount of taxation which would otherwise have been collected. This normal taxation structure is sometimes described as the benchmark or the underlying tax base. </PARA>
<PARA> Treasury enumerates these features of the tax structure which it includes in the benchmark. Having done so, it estimates the cost to revenue of the deviations from its chosen benchmark. However, in defining this benchmark, it does not explain adequately the conceptual basis upon which certain design features of the tax system are regarded as elements of the normal taxation system while others are not. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1989 statement, when dealing with the conceptual issues, the Treasury stated that the principal criterion of the benchmark design is that it should represent neutral taxation treatment of similarly placed activities or classes of taxpayers. If it is accepted that the burden of taxation should be imposed on taxpayers in accordance with their capacity to pay, neutral taxation treatment of similarly placed activities or classes of taxpayers can only be achieved with adjustments for differing capacities to pay being incorporated into the benchmark. </PARA>
<PARA> To ensure that tax expenditure analysis remains relevant, it may be necessary to temper the goal of an ideal tax benchmark, but the necessity to do so should not be used as an excuse for the arbitrary inclusion or exclusion of certain features of the tax structure from the benchmark. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia, individuals and corporations are taxed on the basis that they are legal entities. We also impose a tax liability on some other income earning or profit making structures as if they were legal entities. The Treasury uses a different underlying tax base when estimating the cost to revenue of tax expenditures incurred on account of individuals, and another when estimating the cost of such expenditures incurred on account of companies. </PARA>
<PARA> Consistent with the approach used in Canada and the United States of America (USA), the Treasury argues that the benchmark `should not deviate dramatically from the public perception of the current taxation system'. But it needs to be remembered that the public perception of a tax system can be much influenced by the manner in which it is explained to the public by those who design or administer it. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been the practice in Australia for the progressive personal income tax system to be promoted as a stepped rate structure with a tax-free threshold incorporated as a zero rate step. But it would, for example, be possible to change perceptions about that system by promoting it as one based on a flat rate tax. If this were to be done, the same tax outcomes as result from a stepped rate tax structure could be achieved by the use of rebates to create a tax-free threshold and provide other relief from any additional burden, which would otherwise result from the application of a flat rate. Any liability in excess of an average rate of tax greater than the flat rate could be characterised as a surcharge. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting that in its 1982-83 statement to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure the Treasury acknowledged:</PARA>
<PARA>It could even be argued that the rate structure itself, being progressive, departs from a normal `structure' and provides some assistance to those on lower income . . .</PARA>
<PARA>But it does not go on to say what in this context it regards as the normal rate. In light of this, one might well ask what is considered due to the Commissioner of Taxation. Is it in fact tax at the top marginal rate with deviations from this amount, including the value of the tax-free threshold being considered to be tax expenditure?</PARA>
<PARA> The choice of the flat rate to be regarded as a design feature of the normal taxation structure can be based on: firstly, the top marginal rate of income tax; secondly, the marginal rate of tax paid by a taxpayer with income equal to average weekly earnings; thirdly, the average rate of tax paid by a taxpayer with income equal to average weekly earnings; fourthly, the flat rate of tax payable by companies; or, fifthly, an arbitrary determination. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the public perception of the tax system can be so easily changed without changing the system itself, such perceptions in themselves are an insufficient basis for defining the normal tax structure or the benchmark. So also is the use of tax rebates or other forms of tax relief which are alternative to expenditure programs. In its submission of May 1982 to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure, the Treasury said:</PARA>
<PARA>The aims of identifying tax expenditures should be to include in the budget the cost of special taxation provisions which can, in most cases, be considered as alternatives to direct expenditure programs rather than to attempt to define some ideal taxation system and show deviation from it. </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasury definition of the normal tax base, to the extent it relies on the definition of tax expenditures, is confused. The definition of these expenditures is neither exclusive nor exhaustive. This is so because Treasury's list of tax expenditures does not include all items which are alternative to direct expenditure programs, nor does it exclude items which would not normally be regarded as alternatives to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Many allowances, benefits and pensions could just as easily be delivered to tax paying recipients by means of tax rebates. Similarly, elements of the design features of an agreed normal tax base as well as deviations from it could be just as easily delivered by means of allowances, benefits or pensions. The mere existence of alternative means of adjusting after-tax disposable income provides no justification for excluding such adjustments from the design features of the normal tax base. It is also an insufficient reason for treating them as tax expenditures if delivered by means of tax rebates rather than by means of expenditure programs. There is no justification for excluding features from the underlying tax base simply because the same result could be achieved through a direct expenditure program. </PARA>
<PARA> Treasury's view is that the aim of the tax expenditure statements should be `to provide information and not to indulge in an academic exercise of defining an ideal tax system'. While we should be aiming for an ideal tax system, there is no need for the measurement of tax expenditures to be contingent on the achievement of that ideal. But if that measurement is to be meaningful and useful it is essential that Treasury makes clear what it regards as the design features of the underlying tax system as it exists today. </PARA>
<PARA> In spite of the difficulties involved, defining the design features of the currently used underlying tax base should be done in a credible way by identifying the principles on which tax burdens are imposed. I believe that the fundamental principle consistent with the public perception of our tax system is that it should impose its burdens on the basis of capacity to pay. When tax concessions are used to encourage or discourage economic or even social behaviour as an alternative to direct expenditure programs, they are properly included in the tax expenditure statements. But tax concessions included in the tax structure to implement one or more of the principles on which tax burdens are imposed should be included in the benchmark and should not be regarded as tax expenditures. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, direct expenditure programs used as alternatives to tax concessions should be regarded as design features of the tax system by being characterised as tax credits when paid to taxpayers, even if paid directly to them and not through the tax system. Treasury, in measuring tax expenditures, treats the tax-free threshold as being a design feature of the tax system. It is reasonable to assume that it has done this to acknowledge the appropriateness of exempting from tax a subsistence income. I believe this is a proper approach. </PARA>
<PARA> However, Treasury treats the Medicare levy exemption available to non-residents as a deviation from the resident/non-resident benchmark resulting in a tax expenditure. This revenue loss should be offset by treating the lower tax threshold applied to non-residents as a deviation from the same benchmark. Even though Treasury is developing its conceptual approach to the identification and quantification of tax expenditures to a significant degree, it followed the lead of Canada and the USA. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the dinner break I was speaking about the tax expenditure statement issued by the Treasury. Even though the Treasury in developing its conceptual approach to the identification and quantification of tax expenditures did to a significant degree follow the lead of Canada and the United States, it chose not to include the spouse rebate as a design feature of the Australian tax system. Presumably it would also choose not to include other capacity to pay rebates made available to taxpayers. Even though only a portion of the taxpaying population may be eligible for these rebates at any one time, they are available to all in the event that their reduced capacity to pay under similar circumstances warrants it. The Treasury's explanation of this design of the normal taxation structure provides no explanation of the rationale of its design features.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In its 1988 tax expenditure statement, Treasury acknowledged that modification of the liability of taxpayers according to their dependant care responsibilities is a defensible design feature of the tax system. In spite of this acknowledgment, Treasury still persists in deeming that tax expenditures arise when taxpayers' liabilities are modified for this reason. It adopts the same view with regard to rebates to assist taxpayers in meeting social expenditures which would otherwise be met by the Government on their account. </PARA>
<PARA> By treating the spouse rebate and all other capacity to pay rebates as taxation expenditures, the Treasury appears to make the inappropriate assumption that the capacity to pay tax is purely a function of income. As mentioned earlier in my speech, in the 1989 tax expenditure statement Treasury stated that the principal criterion of the benchmark design is that it should represent neutral taxation treatment of similarly placed activities or classes of taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in applying this principle, Treasury has created certain anomalies. An examination of the benchmark design included in the 1989 tax expenditure statement, and again in the 1990 tax expenditure statement, shows that the benchmark includes, among other features, the legislated progressive personal income tax rate scale, including the tax-free threshold, but it excludes dependant care and personal social responsibility rebates. Treasury therefore considers single taxpayers, married taxpayers, taxpayers with dependent spouses and married taxpayers with dependent spouses and children, as well as taxpayers who have no health insurance or make no provision for retirement as compared with those who do, as being similarly placed classes of taxpayers. This confirms the fact that Treasury considers that capacity to pay tax is purely a function of income and does not consider the cost of accepting certain social responsibilities, such as the care of dependants, as a reduction of the capacity to pay tax inherent in the underlying tax structure.</PARA>
<PARA> Further evidence of the arbitrary decisions which have gone into construction of the income tax benchmark is found in the treatment of non-resident taxpayers. In the 1988 tax expenditure statement, Treasury stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The separate income tax rate scale applicable to non-residents . . . is taken as part of the benchmark structure, as are design features, such as dividend withholding tax and interest withholding tax, which apply to non-residents generally. </PARA>
<PARA>What possible conceptual reason could exist for including the zero tax-free threshold and three separate tax scales for non-resident Australian taxpayers in the benchmark? The tax-free threshold is part of the normal benchmark. The fact that non-resident individual taxpayers do not qualify for the tax-free threshold should be brought into account as a negative tax expenditure resulting in increased revenue collection. Unless this deviation can be justified on capacity to pay grounds, which I dispute, it should not be regarded as a feature of the tax benchmark, nor should the significant deviation from the legislative progressive rate scales resulting from the imposition of withholding tax at the rate of 10 per cent on interest, 15 per cent and sometimes 30 per cent on unfranked dividends paid to non-resident individual taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of various anomalies which exist in the current definition of the tax benchmark, there exists within the benchmark framework at least six separate tax regimes: firstly, the taxation of corporations based on a flat rate applied to the first dollar and then to the last; secondly, taxation of individual residents based on legislated progressive tax rates with a tax-free threshold; thirdly, taxation of individual minor residents based on the legislated progressive tax rates with a lower tax-free threshold than for taxpayers at their majority; fourthly, taxation of the interest income of individual non-residents at the rate of 10 per cent on the first dollar; fifthly, the taxation of unfranked dividend income on individual non-residents; and sixthly, taxation of other income of non-resident individuals at the corporate rate on the first dollar to the last dollar. </PARA>
<PARA> Though it deals with what it calls conceptual issues, Treasury fails to identify a coherent set of principles on which it bases its description of the tax benchmark. The corollary of this is that its definition of tax expenditures is also not based on a coherent set of principles. In my opinion, fairness and equity within the taxation system should be the prime criteria in establishing the taxation benchmark, and one of the key determinants in establishing fairness and equity is acknowledgment of the principle of capacity to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> Capacity to pay is a function not only of the taxpayer's income alone but also of the individual's assumption of dependant care costs and the costs of meeting social responsibilities, which, were it not for the support of the taxpayer, would become the responsibility of government. The Treasury has already acknowledged that there exists a conceptual basis for including the effect of the cost of dependant care on capacity to pay. In the 1982-83 Budget Papers, Treasury posed the question:</PARA>
<PARA>Is a rebate for a dependant a tax expenditure? Assistance could be provided by direct expenditure, as are allowances for dependant children now. On the other hand it might be regarded as no more than a means of adjusting the tax base to measure `capacity to pay'. </PARA>
<PARA>In my opinion, adjustments to capacity to pay based upon the taxpayer's acceptance of social responsibilities which, but for the taxpayer would be the responsibility of the Government, should be part of the tax benchmark. </PARA>
<PARA> In a truly fair system these features of the tax benchmark should make full allowance for the impact on capacity to pay of a taxpayer meeting these responsibilities. A neutral tax system would not penalise those who are self-reliant or those who relieve the Government of dependant care responsibilities. Under present arrangements the allowances provided, whether viewed as part of the tax benchmark or as deviations from it, involving tax expenditures are but token gestures. The price of self-reliance is now a punishing one. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the definition of the personal income tax benchmark should be revised so as to fully acknowledge that the income tax system is based on capacity to pay and the policy objective of rewarding rather than penalising individuals and families seeking self-reliance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a consequence of the war in the Gulf, this Appropriation Bill (No. 3) seeks funds totalling $234.1m to meet additional defence costs and the costs of various insurance claims associated with default by Iraq on credit sales of wheat by the Australian Wheat Board which were insured under the national interest provisions of the Australian Trade Commission Act. Funds allocated to the Department of Defence amount to $52.7m and this is to cover existing costs of deployment of Australian defence forces to the Gulf, the provision of stores and the fitting of additional equipment and also the cost of extra training and exercises which were conducted to bring our ships to a full state of readiness before they reached the Gulf.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) said in his second reading speech, the total supplementation for defence costs associated with the Gulf deployment amounts to $68.9m in 1990-91 with the balance of $16.2m to be included in additional estimates. As the Gulf war is prolonged Australia will necessarily incur additional costs, its participation with United Nations forces in the Gulf requiring further appropriations from the Consolidated Revenue Fund. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be said again and again that the Gulf conflict is not one of our choosing. Two facts are abundantly clear: there is war in the Gulf because Iraq invaded Kuwait, and there is war in the Gulf because Iraq has rejected the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council which are supported by every civilised nation on earth. Saddam Hussein has had half a year to stop his aggression and to withdraw from Kuwait. The United Nations sought to remove him peacefully by sanctions and by diplomacy. All the while, he prepared for war. The world could not stand back and watch a little nation being conquered, raped and looted. </PARA>
<PARA> This war is a just war. It is a war that will determine the sort of world in which we wish to live. The defeat of Saddam Hussein and his forces will be a warning to other potential aggressors that aggression will be challenged by force, with devastating consequences for the aggressor. To indicate otherwise would be cowardice on the part of the United Nations. The prospects for world peace had never looked so bright up until 1 August 1990. It was the first time since 1945 that there were genuine prospects for peace. The invasion of 2 August put all that to an end. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that if the United Nations had responded to the invasion of Kuwait simply with condemnation of Iraq and sanctions only, then the opportunity of establishing a more secure world would have been lost. The self-styled peace movement should be aware of this. It is they who demand that the United Nations withdraw its forces from the Gulf and abandon Kuwait. It is they who consistently refuse to denounce the barbarism and aggression of Iraq. The anti-American and anti-Western vitriol coming from the peace movement shows the so-called peace movement for what it truly is. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give honourable members a few examples. On the night of 12 February, 12 allied planes struck a military bunker in Baghdad. The bunker was a military target-a command and control centre that fed instructions directly to the Iraqi war machine. The bunker was painted and camouflaged to avoid detection. The walls of the bunker were 2.7 to 4.5 metres thick. These are not the specifications of a civilian shelter, but rather a hardened military bunker. </PARA>
<PARA> This bunker contained a large number of civilians. Honourable members may well ask: why were civilians present in such a military target? The answer must surely be: obviously someone told them to go there. As a result of the air attack of 12 February, a number of civilians perished. The allies had no reason to believe any civilians would be present in the bunker. The United States and its allies have not and will not target civilian facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> But, as a result of the air attack, the so-called peace movement and its supporters proceeded to curse the United States over the death of the civilians. They ignore the fact that it is Saddam Hussein who has shown complete contempt for the sanctity of life and who has demonstrated that he is prepared to risk the lives of countless civilians. The so-called peace movement ignores the fact that after Saddam invaded Kuwait, he placed civilian hostages during November and December last year at military sites for use as human shields. In response to this outrage against innocent human beings, the so-called peace movement was silent. Saddam has placed prisoners of war at military sites in flagrant disregard of the Geneva Convention. Again the self-styled peace movement is silent. </PARA>
<PARA> Captured Iraqi troops report that Saddam has roving bands of execution squads who shoot deserters. Again, the peace movement is silent. During the Iraq-Iran war, more than one million casualties were caused as a result of Saddam's invasion of Iran. Again, the peace movement was silent. Saddam has located command and control centres on top of schools and public buildings. He has positioned tanks and artillery beside private homes and villages. He has located military equipment near archaeological sites. In one instance, two MiG21 aircraft were parked near Ziggurat pyramid-the oldest multi-storeyed religious shrine in existence. This pyramid is located in Ur-reportedly the birthplace of Abraham, and the oldest continuously occupied city in the world.</PARA>
<PARA> With complete contempt for the environment, Saddam has released vast quantities of oil into the Gulf waters, destroying wildlife and threatening human water supplies. Again, the self-styled peace movement is silent. Scud missiles have been launched against innocent civilians in Saudi Arabia and Israel-Moslem and Jew alike. Again the self-styled peace movement is silent. </PARA>
<PARA> These conscious acts of barbarism are the product of an evil administration that has gassed its own Kurdish citizens and inflicted incalculable suffering on its own people-the people of Iraq. Few people realise that during the 1980s Iraq spent approximately one-third of its gross national product preparing for war. We may well ask why. Was it simply to gain the ascendancy over Iran? Did Saddam build up the fourth largest army in the world simply to conquer Kuwait, or did he have other grotesque ambitions? Perhaps he wanted to seize the major portion of the oil producing areas in the region and, using the oil revenue, build Iraq into a military superpower enabling him to lead a Babylonian empire with the ultimate objective of removing Israel from the face of the earth. </PARA>
<PARA> What kind of peace do the self-styled peace activists wish to bring about? Is it the peace that Saddam Hussein has brought to the Kurdish people and to the people of the Middle East? Does their version of peace reject outright the collective considered decisions of the United Nations on how this war can be brought to an end? Until satisfactory answers are forthcoming, the peace movement may readily be seen as simply a collection of anti-Western activists sprinkled with a few genuine pacifists. </PARA>
<PARA> The world may be assured that the United Nations forces will pursue their objectives, and these are set out in 12 resolutions of the United Nations Security Council. They may be summarised as follows: firstly, Iraq's entire forces must leave Kuwait immediately; secondly, the legitimate government of Kuwait must be restored; and thirdly, peace and security in the region must be restored. </PARA>
<PARA> When the war is over, the United Nations will have an enormous challenge to bring about some lasting and equitable solutions to the problems in the region. This challenge may even be greater than the war itself. However, when the war is over, the first task will be the restoration and the rebuilding of Kuwait. Achieving the peace and security of the region should then be a paramount task for the United Nations. This will require much patience and statesmanship. It will also require from the nations of the Middle East a final acceptance of the fact that the United Nations will use force to defeat aggression. </PARA>
<PARA> The manner in which the United Nations conducts the post-war Middle East peace process will have profound implications for the prospects of regional stability elsewhere in the world, particularly in the south Asian and South East Asian region. If the United Nations can succeed in providing a political framework for a peaceful resolution of many of the unresolved disputes in the Middle East, then the prospects for continuing stability in the south Asian and South East Asian regions will be enhanced. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the Middle East, the south Asian and South East Asian regions are the most volatile and potentially dangerous in the world. Many nations in these regions are engaged in massive rearmament programs. Both India and Pakistan are spending enormous sums of money on their rearmament programs. The Indian Navy has just decided to acquire eight more Soviet type 877 submarines. Thailand proposes a major increase in power-projection capability and the ability to conduct blue water amphibious operations. This year Malaysia proposes to purchase four submarines. It will be the first time that the Malaysian Navy has secured submarines. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of Asian countries are watching with concern the build-up of China's naval forces in the South China Sea. The February 1991 issue of the Asia-Pacific Defence Reporter claims in an article by defence reporter, Michael Richardson, that the Chinese Navy has 92 conventional submarines and a nuclear ballistic missile submarine. The Chinese Navy also has 18 destroyers, 37 frigates, 58 major amphibious craft, three ocean support ships, eight submarine support ships and numerous other offensive assets, including naval bombers armed with cruise missiles. </PARA>
<PARA> In a recently published study for the Singapore Institute on the growth of Chinese naval power, Tai Ming Cheung, a defence correspondent based in Hong Kong, concluded that over the next decade Chinese naval planners will concentrate on building major warships equipped with guided missiles and defence electronic hardware. Chinese naval policy will then shift to construction of several light aircraft carriers, as well as the acquisition of vertical take-off aircraft and naval ships to form carrier task forces. </PARA>
<PARA> The build up of the Chinese Navy, widely reported outside Australia, has increased tension in the South East Asian region, particularly in relation to the unresolved dispute over the Spratly Islands. In 1988, Chinese naval forces seized by force of arms several of the disputed Spratly Islands from Vietnam. These islands are of strategic importance because they are in the path of vital maritime trade routes leading to Japan. Furthermore, it is thought the region has extensive reserves of offshore oil and natural gas. Other nations claim ownership of these islands, including the Philippines, Taiwan and Malaysia. </PARA>
<PARA> The possibility of Malaysian military action in a contest for the Spratlys would, in one respect, involve Australia. Malaysia is a partner with Australia in the five-power defence arrangements which provide, amongst other things, for a consultative process to take place between the partners before a military commitment is made in the defence of all or any of the partners. I believe that Australia should examine very carefully the commitment of each of its partners to the Gulf war to gauge the continuing value of the five-power defence arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that the 1987 Defence White Paper states that the Australian Government has sought to `strengthen the commonality of strategic interests between Australia and the countries of South East Asia'. In December 1989 the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) said:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia needs to develop more substantial linkages with its neighbours. We need to . . . become a significant partner to the region, an accepted and natural participant in regional affairs. Already the economic, political, military and the other links developing between the South-East Asian countries can be seen as networks of connective tissue binding the nations of the region together. </PARA>
<PARA>These are laudable objectives. However, although the Australian Government continues to support the five-power defence arrangements, I repeat that I believe the time has come for the partners in the five-power defence arrangements to reassess not only their defence obligations to each other but also the extent to which they should respond to the collective security imperatives of the United Nations. The fact is that both the Malaysian armed forces and the Singapore armed forces are quite able to defend Malaysia and Singapore by themselves. However, the events in the Gulf conflict raise the question as to their commitment to other security imperatives. </PARA>
<PARA> The five-power defence arrangements are one of three security treaties involving Australia. These are ANZUS, the joint declaration of principles with Papua New Guinea and the five-power defence arrangements. The joint declaration of principles and the five-power defence arrangements impose special responsibilities on Australia because it is the most capable military partner in these treaties. Whilst each partner can decide for itself what military contribution it can make in the discharge of its responsibilities under these treaties, it is obvious that the joint declaration of principles and the five-power defence arrangements place greater reliance on the political and psychological forces of the treaties than on developing and maintaining a military capability to enforce the objectives of both of those treaties. That is why the time has come to redefine the obligations and objectives of both of these treaties. Treaties which enunciate realistically the security goals of the existing partners to Australia's regional treaties will make a far better contribution to regional confidence than what currently exists. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said repeatedly in this House that the defence of Australia and its people is a primary and most fundamental responsibility of any Australian government. During debates in this House I have consistently called for increased defence expenditure, particularly to accelerate the acquisition of an increased naval capability. The honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) was right when he outlined, in alarming detail, the small number of ships of the Royal Australian Navy capable of immediate operational deployment. If the call for increased defence capability is not heeded, Australia will find it increasingly difficult to maintain its role as a strong co-guardian of the peace and security of this region. </PARA>
<PARA> I join with other speakers in extending a message of greeting to Australian defence personnel serving in the Gulf. They are assured of the support of the Australian Parliament and the overwhelming majority of people in Australia. We know that they will remain steadfast in their duties until the mission to free Kuwait has been accomplished. I also join with the honourable member for Groom in extending congratulations to Vice Admiral Hudson, the Chief of Naval Staff, on his contribution to the defence of Australia. I understand that he retires on 8 March and he goes from his long service to the Royal Australian Navy with the thanks of the people of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure to follow the very good contribution to this debate by the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), who used his usual very strong style to present his case. I think he represented a view which would be very similar to the views of most Australians. He was perceptive in drawing attention to a number of very relevant points. One of these emerged in his concluding remarks-the need for additional defence expenditure, particularly in the Royal Australian Navy, something for which I could find a great deal of support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He commenced his remarks with criticisms of the so-called peace movement that presented its case in Canberra in recent weeks and through the media over the last few months. I join with him in these criticisms because we experienced, in the special debate that was held in this House to discuss the Gulf crisis and Australia's involvement in the war, some extraordinary scenes. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most extraordinary things that we witnessed was the unbelievable hypocrisy from those who sat in the gallery and outside the front doors of this building. The hypocrisy came in a number of forms. The honourable member for Herbert has mentioned some of them. One that he did not mention was the fact that on every occasion that somebody debating the Gulf war in this House mentioned Iraq or President Saddam Hussein there was no comment from the gallery- although, as we recall, the gallery was making plenty of comments on that day and you, Mr Speaker, had great difficulty in controlling the House. </PARA>
<PARA> But every time George Bush's name or the United States was mentioned there were hisses and jeers from those gathered in the gallery. That in itself tells a story of hypocrisy among those who had gathered outside the building and in this chamber. In addition, we did not find any of those protesters camped outside the Iraq Embassy hissing, jeering and booing at Iraqi officials and telling them of their concern about Iraq's involvement and its initiation of this crisis in the Gulf. During those two days here in Canberra there was plenty of evidence of hypocrisy. </PARA>
<PARA> No doubt many of those who came to Canberra to express their concerns were genuine peace loving and peacenik-type people who had proper concerns. But I do believe those who showed themselves publicly, who appeared on television and made interruptions and interjections in this House, did their cause a great deal of harm because it boosted the morale and resolve of members of this House to support the United Nations resolution and our involvement in the Gulf. I had not intended to commence with those few remarks, but I thought it was proper to follow up on the contribution of the honourable member for Herbert. </PARA>
<PARA> As the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer) has highlighted in his initial contribution on our behalf earlier today, the Opposition supports Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1990-91. There are two aspects to the Bill. Firstly, compensation is to be paid by the Government, through one of its agencies, for wheat growers who have suffered financial losses as a result of the trade sanctions against Iraq. The second aspect of the Bill is to provide additional outlays of finance for our defence forces to enable them to carry on with their activities in the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA> I will deal with the first of these two aspects first and talk about the wheat compensation. I am very pleased that the Government, through its official agency, has decided to provide additional funding to compensate wheat growers for their financial losses as a result of the Gulf crisis because there is no doubt whatsoever that the words of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in October last year, when he said that no one Australian, or group of Australians, should shoulder a greater burden of these trade sanctions than another, are very true. This is a situation which, if it costs anybody, must cost all Australians equally. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, as is the nature of so much of our export trade, the immediate cost of any trade sanctions against a country, for whatever reason, tends to fall upon our farmers because they are so much involved in producing export income for Australia and they are the first ones to suffer when a sanction is imposed. In this case, roughly $600m worth of wheat has been sold and delivered to Iraq. Payment has yet to be received and, because of the trade sanctions and the freezing of Iraq's bank accounts throughout the world, none of that money has been forthcoming from Iraq to Australia's wheat growers. As a consequence of that Australian wheat growers have faced a crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister's commitment in October last year alleviates a great deal of that crisis and, particularly as we pass this legislation tonight, cash will flow into the pockets of wheat growers throughout Australia. The benefit of that is threefold; firstly, the extra cash that this House will be appropriating tonight will put confidence into the wheat industry, confidence which is very much needed at a very serious time in our rural industries and, secondly, it will assist wheat growers with cash flow problems. Many honourable members will remember that wheat growers at this time are not only suffering a loss of cash but also they are faced with having to find funds to continue either with a crop for the 1991 year or some form of rural activity to generate some income for themselves. In order to do that they need cash and they have a major cash flow problem. This legislation will help a little along the way to giving them enough resources to plant a crop for this season. </PARA>
<PARA> The other benefit of these funds is that they will assist wheat growers with their borrowings. Any bank would be concerned with any of its farmer clients at present, but to have a fresh injection of much-needed cash will assist many of the banks in ensuring that they can continue to provide operating finance to their wheat-growing customers so they can get through this year and the years ahead as this recession bites deeper. </PARA>
<PARA> The other aspect to this-I will be corrected if I am wrong-is that about $400m worth of wheat was contracted for sale in the current calendar year but has not yet been delivered. I think it goes without saying that that sale is in serious jeopardy now. It is most unlikely that we will be able to sell to Iraq our wheat that had been contracted, so wheat growers face another $400m deficiency as a result of the loss of that contracted sale for this year to Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> The money that will be coming to wheat growers is not some sort of generous government handout, as many people would like to try to paint it. What moneys are being appropriated by the Government tonight to go to wheat growers are coming through a scheme designed to ensure that payments are received from countries to which Australia has sold our export pro- ducts. An insurance scheme, run through the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation, which is one of the Government's bodies, ensures payments from those countries to our producers in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth mentioning that this does not ensure all the payments; it ensures only about 80 per cent of the payments from Iraq in this case. The wheat industry is now calling upon the Government to add the other 20 per cent to any compensation package that it may like to put forward in the future. That is a subject which we in this House will have to debate. Both sides are yet to formulate an opinion on it. But it is an issue which is worthy of consideration because wheat farmers are undoubtedly missing out on that extra 20 per cent of those Iraqi sales because of the crisis in the Gulf and the sanctions imposed by the people of Australia, through this Government, against Iraq. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation for wheat growers has become a disaster. Wheat growers' incomes will drop by at least 50 per cent, and in some cases much more than that, over this financial year. There are many reasons for that. We have talked about the sanctions against Iraq. That has contributed to it. The Gulf crisis has contributed to it. But the principal driving factor in all of these substantial reductions in income for wheat growers comes as a result of the massive subsidies that are being paid by the European Community to its farmers and those subsidies being extended in the price that the European Community is offering for the sale of its wheat. It is massively subsidised. </PARA>
<PARA> Equally, the United States of America is responding with other substantial subsidies to its wheat growers to enable them to offer their wheat to the world's markets at much subsidised prices-prices way below the cost of production. In Australia it is recognised that, even though we have probably the most efficient wheat producers in the world, we are not able to match their prices. </PARA>
<PARA> So what we need to do, through the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and diplomatic measures, is continue to pressure the European Community, and subsequently the United States, to remove those subsidies so that our very efficient wheat producers have a future for their industry and every Australian can enjoy the benefits of having that very viable export industry still operating in future. Because if we cannot achieve the removal of those subsidies, the Australian wheat industry will face a very perilous future and every Australian will suffer as a consequence of it. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the very low prices being paid by wheat growers, it is interesting to note that wheat plantings are expected to reduce substantially over the course of this year, to the point where it is predicted that we may not have enough wheat grown this year to fulfil our normal contractual arrangements. Such is the contraction of wheat sowings that are going to be experienced over the next few months. We face a very perilous situation, a situation which will affect the standard of living of every Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point worth making is that the Government has a legitimate argument to accelerate the distribution of funds from growers' equity pools through the wheat pools. Some $600m-odd exists in those equity pools dating back to 1987. I think there is a legitimate argument that suggests that we should accelerate the payment from those pools to wheat growers to tide them over this particularly difficult time so they have cash to continue to operate into the future. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth noting that the debt situation faced by our wheat growers in Australia is very poor indeed. Earlier today we received a briefing from members of the National Farmers Federation; in it they highlighted one of their surveys of farming communities, which has been completed in the last few weeks. It appears that in New South Wales, for example, the average debt for a farmer is around $287,000. The size of that debt was fixed at 30 June 1990, some 7 1/2 months ago. I dare say that that $287,000 average debt in New South Wales is already well and truly over $300,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The farming communities in Australia face a perilous situation. It is not just farmers who will suffer; it will be every rural community. Whether it is in my electorate or other electorates in Australia, every rural community will be facing a massive loss of economic activity, jobs, the closure of small businesses and loss of future opportunities for young people who are brought up in those districts. That is a very sad thing. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment, those communities in rural areas are not looking at the recession that the rest of Australia is experiencing but, from what I have seen, particularly in some of the western areas of New South Wales, are rapidly facing a depression. I put that knowing the seriousness of the word `depression' but realising that, from what I have seen, the situation is getting very desperate indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> Our social welfare organisations are run off their feet. There are 150 per cent increases in demand for marriage counsel- ling services. The social consequences of what is going on in the bush at the present time are very deep and very serious indeed. The Government must be prepared to put more funds into the rural counselling services and towards the rural adjustment schemes and do whatever it can to assist wool growers to get through what is undoubtedly the most difficult time their industry has ever gone through. </PARA>
<PARA> The banks have a very important role to play in all of this. While it is popular to bag the banks at the moment-and some would say justifiably-the banks must recognise that if they and their customers in rural areas are to survive into the future many of those customers will have to be carried over the next 12 to 24 months. Banks will have to face the situation where interest payment holidays will have to be provided to their customers; otherwise, customers with good farms, good managers and plenty of potential in the future will simply go under because they cannot meet their interest repayments. I think the banks have to take a longer term view with many of their customers to ensure that, where a farm is well managed and a property has a viable future down the track without a recession, without a collapse in commodity prices, their customers are supported for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my remarks tonight by going back to the Gulf, which is where I started. About 40 of my constituents are serving under the Australian flag in the Gulf at the present time, the bulk of them being members of the Fleet Air Arm from HMAS Albatross at Nowra. Their families, of course, tonight are sitting at home, missing their husbands and fathers. I have been deeply concerned about this. I have made a number of contacts with the commanding officer of HMAS Albatross to ensure that the families of people who are serving in the Gulf are being adequately looked after and that what can be done is being done. </PARA>
<PARA> I am happy to report to the House that I am very satisfied with the measures that the Navy has undertaken to ensure that the families of our serving personnel in the Gulf are being properly looked after. There are regular coffee mornings. Each squadron has a liaison officer, and if, for example, the wife of someone serving overseas gets up in the morning and cannot get the car to start, the liaison officer can be contacted and either he or someone else will go around and get the car started or take it into town. If there is a problem with a lawnmower, a light bulb or any sort of function that the husband would normally carry out in a house but that cannot be carried out because the husband is overseas serving under our flag, the task can be carried out by fellow naval colleagues at HMAS Albatross. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not just help from within the Navy that is going to those families. I noted in the paper the other day that the Stones Animal Park on the Shoalhaven River also helped. I happened to open the koala section there not so long ago. Unlike the former member for Parramatta, nothing nasty happened to me in the process! The people at Stones Animal Park had a free day for all the families of people serving in the Gulf; the local sub-branch of the Returned Services League of Australia put on lunch; and various speeches of support were given by members of the community to families present at the time. That type of thing is really boosting up the morale of the families back home. </PARA>
<PARA> There are also little acts of generosity. For example, the other night when I was at the Goulburn Soldiers Club at the opening of its new extensions the President came up to me and said, `Two of the members of our club are actually serving in the Gulf. They come from Goulburn and we would like to send them a parcel or gift to help them along their way while they are serving in the Gulf'. The President, an ex-World War II veteran, said, `In my day we really looked forward to a parcel of food, but I guess they are not short of food, as we were in those days. Anyway, we have gone to a lot of trouble to find some appropriate things to send across'. That request is now being dealt with. That type of goodwill, that spirit, is coming from the community. It is not being sought out; people are looking to help rather than being asked to help. That type of thing is a great boost for us and shows the generous nature of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> It also causes us to question the way our future Defence Force policy must be shaped. There is no question in my mind that we must have some reshaping of our Defence Force policy. The honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay) highlighted the need for extra funds, particularly for the Navy. I highlight the need, as I have done constantly since my time in this House, for some type of seagoing air platform for our Navy. Whether it be the coup in Fiji or a whole host of other actions within or outside our region, we have a glaring deficiency in our ability to take an air platform away from Australia and provide air back-up services to our Navy and military forces. We must have some type of seagoing air platform; it could be a helicopter carrier, for example. </PARA>
<PARA> I have also noticed that our Navy is deficient in the type of attack helicopters that the British Royal Navy has. The Royal Navy has helicopters that can launch Exocet missiles 60, 70 or 80 kilometres away from the fleet to provide an advance defence system for its own naval vessels. The helicopters on board our Royal Australian Navy ships do not have that attack capability; they are basically anti-submarine helicopters. I would like to see us make an effort to try to ensure that our Navy's helicopters have the ability to go outside the immediate perimeter of the fleet, to be a forward defence or a forward attack weapon to enable things like Exocet missiles to be launched from many miles away to help protect our fleet when it is in a war zone. That type of thing, I think, is all part of an ongoing role in reshaping Australia's defence strategies for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> I join with other honourable members tonight in wishing all the best to those serving in the Gulf under the Australian flag. I also congratulate Vice-Admiral Mike Hudson on his retirement and his contribution to Australia, particularly the Navy. I think he will be able to retire knowing that he has served his country very well indeed, as those in the Gulf today are serving their country very well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) introduced the Appropriation Bill (No. 3), he made some very pertinent points. He said that the amounts in this Bill were being sought in advance of the Additional Estimates to meet urgent requirements which had arisen as a consequence of the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq on 2 August last year. He went on to say that the repercussions of the invasion, subsequent United Nations sanctions against Iraq and current hostilities in the Gulf to end the illegal occupation of Kuwait will affect Australia for some time to come.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This point has been well canvassed by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp), and I join with him in appealing to the banks to take a very generous, sensitive and sympathetic approach to the many farmers and rural producers who are being affected, firstly, because of Australia's involvement in the war and, secondly, because of the war itself, where countries which have been buyers of our products are not paying and we are simply not able to continue to sell our products there. </PARA>
<PARA> I also place on record my concerns-and those concerns have been expressed today in the media and in this House-with regard to this postwar situation. It could well be that what is being suggested could happen. I am referring to the fact that the United States may use primary products as some sort of healing balm for those affected people in the Gulf area. I understand the need for postwar reconstruction and I totally support measures to that end, but I ask the United States to remember that we are a part of the alliance, that we are a friend of the United States and that it should be very conscious and cognisant of the effect that some of its policies shall have on rural farmers in this nation. If it does not do that, we will have not just Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1990-91, which is bringing forward an amount of $234m to assist our farmers as well as meet stores and other military costs in this war, we will have appropriation Bills Nos 4, 5, 6 and 7 because of the ongoing consequences that must impact so heavily on our farmers if future sales are affected negatively. We may find that not only do we now have a situation where some of these countries are not paying, but also in the future they shall not even need our product because the United States, Britain and others, in their generosity to heal the wounds, will be giving away hundreds and hundreds of thousands of tonnes of wheat and other products which those countries need. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the United States has a special responsibility to us with regard to postwar reconstruction. As we are a friend of that great nation, it needs to take on board the downstream and unintended consequences of its generosity in this area and the consequences for the farmers and, ultimately, the people of Australia. The honourable member for Gilmore made a very important point: that whilst, in the first instance, it is the farmer who is directly affected, ultimately it is the people of Australia who carry the burden-it is the taxpayers of this nation who bear the brunt of the $234m, and so it should be. But that should not blow out to hundreds upon hundreds of millions of dollars because of the future policies of the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to use the freedom afforded to me by the debate on the Appropriation Bill to canvass another area. This issue was reactivated today in Question Time following a question that was asked of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) relating to comments by the newly appointed Secretary to the Treasury, Mr Tony Cole. He made it very clear, and again I use the comments of the Treasurer, that it is nonsense to suggest that a consumption tax would have a significant impact on net savings in Australia. For some months the issue of the consumption tax has irregularly raised its ugly head. Opposition members have floated the issue, run with the issue, developed the issue, and then hidden the issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that Mr Tony Cole's comment today is another nail in the economic policy coffin of the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia because the whole central point of what the Liberals and Nationals have been saying is that a consumption tax, firstly, will significantly increase savings in this country and, secondly, will reduce the tax on exports and thus have a very positive impact on the quantity and, in turn, the quality of products that we sell overseas, thereby obviously having a major influence on the imbalance of trade that has existed and can exist. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Tony Cole is saying that the consumption tax will not be the panacea that the Liberals and Nationals have been looking for; it will not be the panacea to every economic problem besetting our nation. I note that the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) has never gone to any lengths to explain his full proposal. He distinguishes himself quite negatively from previous leaders of the Opposition, for at least they enunciated and explained their policies so that the people of Australia could see the alternatives. But in this instance, we see that it is part of a strategy. It seems to be a part of the Opposition strategy of what one might call perception building-an attempt to create in the minds of the community a belief that in some way it has the answer. </PARA>
<PARA> It reminds me very much of the Bjelke-Petersen era in Queensland when Premier Bjelke-Petersen constantly used the phrase, `Don't you worry about that'. In one way it was a reasonable philosophy and a very effective mechanism for settling people down-to leave it to the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was appealing to apathy and ignorance. I will take up the interjection of the honourable member. One day the history books shall show that in my time as Leader of the Opposition in Queensland against Premier Bjelke-Petersen I went within 3,000 votes of toppling him. But that is for the history books.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I return to my comments. The National Party in Queensland used to make the issue so simple; it used to run with the simplistic-the use of the one-liners and the idea of floating an idea. It seems to me that we now have that approach being adopted by the Hewson Opposition. The Hewson-Fischer myth-I want to tie Mr Fischer in with this-is that a consumption tax is some sort of painless solution for remedying the nation's current account difficulties, firstly, as I said, by boosting the national savings and, secondly, by relieving tax on exports. It is claimed that if we have this massive increase in savings, we will have this great savings pool which can be drawn upon-it will be borrowed upon. I like the idea. I personally believe we ought to be using our superannuation funds in a similar vein. I encourage the idea of having national savings increase and escalate. But the facts are, as Mr Tony Cole and other members of the Government have pointed out, it is nonsense to suggest that that is an automatic consequence of a consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that there is a need for Australian business, Australian workers and Australian families to realise that in 1991 a consumption tax would be a negative, not a plus. We are not quite sure, but it seems that the Liberal-National parties' proposition is to impose a 15 per cent consumption tax. Others have said no, it is only a 12 1/2 per cent consumption tax. At the moment I will run with the 15 per cent. I want to place on the record that, in view of what we have been told by the Opposition, that would be a tax on everything-a tax on food, clothing, services, spare parts, repairs, recreation, sporting activities, cars, equipment-as I said, on everything. It would be a tax on haircuts, school books, safety equipment, life support systems, medicine and medical services and the ambulance. Nothing and no-one would be exempt under the consumption tax proposed by the Liberal-National Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to realise that the Opposition's tax would work in a rather simple way. We would simply pay it every time on every product whenever that product changed hands or moved along the delivery line. I will use the old Bjelke-Petersen approach, because I learned from him in my 15 1/2 years in the State Parliament. It is good to keep things simple, so I will use the example of someone who is having a vehicle repaired because it was involved in an accident. There would be a tax on towing, on the insurance assessment and on the car parts. There would then be a tax on the labour costs and a tax on any new insurance premium. They are the visible costs, but there will be hidden costs as well. There would be a tax even on the fax that is sent to find out where the spare parts that have not turned up are-which is a common, everyday occurrence when one tries to get something fixed nowadays. There would be a tax on the freight and on the cost of delivery of those parts. </PARA>
<PARA> All this would be true not only for the car being repaired following an accident but also for domestic product repairs. It would be true for any service rendered whatsoever. When one considers that-that it includes freight, delivery costs and transportation-one must appreciate very quickly that the effect would be far worse on people living outside metropolitan areas. It would be a tax not only on the product-on every aspect of the movement of that product in the chain-but also on freight costs. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an issue that has been dear to my heart for a long time, because when I was in the State Parliament I wrote to the then Treasurer many times-this is when the Liberals and Nationals were in power-asking that we have sales tax on freight abolished. I have since put that case to the present Treasurer and to the Ministers assisting the Treasurer. The rural task force has also raised the issue, as have most country members representing constituents outside metropolitan areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I was hoping this Government in this term would change the situation. I have been told that the real problem is that it is a bureaucratic nightmare as we have the wholesale sales tax on some products but not on others. But, if that is the case, what will the consumption tax be? It boggles the mind to think this through because there are some 75,000 active players or payers in the wholesale tax arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> For a consumption tax it is estimated that the number of players would be 10 times that. We are talking about 770,000 businesses that would be collecting and responsible for this tax. The bureaucratic nightmare and the administrative costs and dilemma are almost too difficult to comprehend. It would be so because not only would we be talking about the number of players or payers in the wholesale tax arrangements, but also there would be a great increase in the number of products taxed. There are about 3,000 items in any supermarket-for example, household goods, school related goods, clothing and foods. These goods do not attract a sales tax, but under the Liberal-National Party proposals every product would attract tax, because under the Liberals and Nationals there would be no exemptions. </PARA>
<PARA> Those arguing for the scheme keep saying, `But back in 1985 your own Treasurer proposed such a scheme'. To use Mr Tony Cole's term, I would suggest that it is nonsense in this case for proponents to argue that the fact that the Treasurer supported a consumption tax in 1985 is grounds or a basis for a consumption tax in 1991, for the circumstances economically are totally different. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1985 the Budget was $7 billion in deficit. The top marginal tax in 1985 was 60 per cent, and the bottom rate had just shifted from 30 per cent down to 25 per cent. In 1985 there was an effective company tax rate of 78.4 per cent. Not only did one pay tax at the company level; one then paid tax on the dividends disbursed. In 1985 there was virtually no tax on capital gains and fringe benefits. As I said, it is totally different today. In 1991 there is a top personal tax rate of 47 per cent. The top company tax rate is 47 per cent. There is no double taxing on dividends any longer. The bottom tax rate, as from 1 January, has slipped right down to 20 per cent. We now have a higher tax-free threshold. </PARA>
<PARA> There is now a fairer tax system. We now have taxes on capital gains and on certain fringe benefits-and so there should be. There should be a substantiation system, and that is what this Government has introduced. We have a prescribed payments tax system. We have also been able to address and combat many of the tax avoidance and evasion mechanisms and measures. It is just ridiculous-in fact, it is nonsense-for the Opposition to argue that a consumption tax should be supported because it was proposed back in 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point that the Opposition argues is that a consumption tax is a user pays tax, and therefore it is fairer and should be supported. It is a good principle that the user pays, provided that it is strongly attached or linked to another principle: ability to pay. The principle we ought to be espousing here is that the user pays based on the ability to pay. But the Liberal-National Party philosophy of a consumption tax is in fact the Robin Hood philosophy in reverse. It is not robbing the rich to help the poor; it is robbing the poor to benefit the rich. </PARA>
<PARA> When we sit down and work out where this tax will impact, we see that those who will suffer the real casualties shall be the families, the pensioners, those on fixed incomes, those retired people who are not going suddenly to have some boost of income tomorrow, the low income workers and the young people trying to establish their first home. These people will face a tax on everything they buy and every service they seek. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liberals have admitted that the key to their success is increasing private savings. That is why I started this speech by referring to Tony Cole. Central to the Liberal belief is the idea that, if high income earners can be given major tax relief at the income tax level, because they are the natural big savers we will have greater national savings. This is an admission of what they are about. It is an admission that their whole strategy is to reduce the tax burden of the wealthy so that those people can save more. </PARA>
<PARA> Their strategy is to deliver tax cuts at the top end, but the reality is, to use the term used by a previous Liberal leader, that such tax cuts are not possible unless the lower income groups-the pensioners and the families-are not adequately compensated for the higher costs of consumption. That is the whole key from the Opposition's point of view. A Liberal-National government would want to improve the saving capacity of the wealthy, but I reiterate that that can be achieved only if the lower income earners-the families and the pensioners-are burdened with that additional cost. In other words, they are not compensated for a consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us not also forget that if there were to be a Liberal-National government-and let us hope that that is not going to be for a long, long time-it would still need revenue, and if it is going to give a tax cut to the wealthy that generosity has to be borne somewhere or by someone. One way that this can be done is by slashing government outlays. Where the Government has tried to cut down on a million dollars here or there, Opposition members have opposed it. I would suggest that, in light of their efforts in this House, we will not see much action there. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that, if we look at the mathematics of this whole proposal, their system does not work. Their system will mean a greater burden on low income earners; it will mean a slashing of the higher income tax levels to the detriment of those people who are in a lesser position to afford such a burden. It would mean an inflation rate in the first year of almost 14 per cent because it would mean an increase in the consumer price index, of the cost of living, by 7 per cent. Ultimately, it would mean resultant wage pressures. It would mean further rises in the cost of goods because that would no doubt be passed on by those in the retailing sector. There is much evidence to show that a consumption tax does not even generate the additional revenue, savings and advantages that the Liberals and Nationals are saying that it does. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point is that it is dearer to collect. The cost of collecting the present wholesale tax is about 40c in the dollar. As I said, the number of players is only 75,000. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1990-91 is a significant piece of legislation because it gives the House a second opportunity to discuss Australia's involvement in the Middle East war and also to consider what the alternatives in the future may be in the context of the peace process. The Bill seeks appropriations for certain proposed expenditure. We were told by the Government in the very early stages that it presumed that there would be an over-expenditure because of involvement in the war, and now we have a further appropriation of some $170m to achieve that objective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Until the Appropriation Bill was released, the best available data we had on precisely what the costs of the war have been were contained in answers given to questions in the Senate on 12 and 13 February by the Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Ray. The interesting observation I make on that is that the figures he quoted in fact do not add up to the figure now before the House. In fact, there was a shortfall of some $1.4m, but presumably we will find that in future legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, however, a couple of points I would like to make in relation to the lessons we have learned from our naval participation in the Gulf force to the present time. For example, the Opposition noted with some concern-if not a little dismay-the hasty fitting of close-in weapons support systems, namely the Phalanx anti-missile guns, on the warships which were sent to the Gulf. We saw this as evidence of the Government's tardiness in the area of defence procurement. Not until an urgent requirement arose was the work in fact done-work which could have been done in earlier years. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, the dispatch of regular army troops to man the RBS70 surface to air missile system aboard the support ships HMAS Success and Westralia demonstrated the inability of those ships under normal, modern wartime conditions to have sufficient self-defence capability. A missile system designed for use on land, by definition, has problems when used on board ships, but that is precisely the only alternative that the Government had to sending these vessels to the Middle East virtually defenceless from air attack. For that reason it was a stopgap solution. We saw artillerymen in fact being sent to defend naval ships in the Persian Gulf. We only have to continue to hope that the Iraqis continue to keep their best planes next door in Iran, and that they do not actually seek combat in the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to take this opportunity to make a number of observations about the peace which we all, of course, hope to see before too long. The Americans have made the point-as the Secretary of State, Mr Baker, has clearly outlined-that there is a five-point strategy for dealing with the region and its future problems. Those five points basically include, firstly, the establishment of a new security structure dominated by the Gulf nations but in which other countries-notably through the United Nations and the Gulf Cooperation Council-would play a role. The structure, which would not involve a long term ground force, would aim to bring peace and stability to the area. It is believed that Iran, as a major power in the Gulf, and Iraq would have an important contribution to make in that context. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point relates to the cutting of military arsenals in the area. It has been pointed out on numerous occasions that the conventional arsenals of the several Middle Eastern states even dwarf those of most European nations which are members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). In fact, five Middle Eastern countries have more battle tanks than Great Britain or France. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point is providing for the economic reconstruction and recovery of Kuwait and Iraq. The secure and prosperous future everyone wants for the Gulf would have to include, of course, Iraq. The time of reconstruction and recovery would not be the time for revenge. I think it is particularly apt to make the point that the United States President has emphasised that this is not meant to be seen as a war against the Iraqi people. Nevertheless, it is one of the sadnesses of modern war, as was certainly demonstrated in the Second World War, that after the battles have taken place and the final conclusion is reached the victors then usually have to bear the cost of returning the vanquished to some stable economic and social environment. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Second World War we saw the implementation of the famous Marshall Plan, and there is no doubt that there are people now who believe a Marshall Plan type operation will have to be mounted in the Middle East. In that context I would just like to sound, in particular in relation to Australia's national interest, a major cautionary note. It is simply this: if the United States believes that through its restoration program, call it what you will, for the Middle East there is going to be yet another attempt to undercut Australia's rural production-and I refer specifically to the difficulties we already face in relation to our wheat exports, which have been significantly reduced in the Middle East, and which in the case of the Iraqis have not been paid for this season-this could cause us considerable difficulties in the future. There would be difficulties not just for the farming people, who of course are the producers of commodities, whether they be fat lambs or wheat or any other commodity, but for the basic capacity of Australia to pay its way as a nation-because we still depend to a large degree for our balance of payments on the export potential of our rural commodities. </PARA>
<PARA> We face a very real risk, as we have over recent years, of a continuing brawl between the United States on the one side and the European Economic Community (EEC) on the other which has in the past resulted in substantial subsidies being paid by both sides of that agricultural conflict. Countries like Australia, and notably Australia, have suffered grievously as a result. I think it needs to be emphasised-and it is the role of the Government to emphasise it, and to do so now while we are hopefully going through the interregnum between war and peace-to our powerful friends the United States that as one of the first nations in the United Nations to come to the support of the United Nations in this particular Gulf situation it is not unreasonable that our economic well-being and security in the future should be taken into account. It would not be appropriate, therefore, for an ally in war to be treated, effectively, as an enemy in peace in the context of the war we see at the trade level between countries which, regrettably, are all allies of Australia to one degree or another. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, to pass on to a wider context, the other points made by Mr Baker included the need to reduce American dependence on its present energy sources. Of course we all support that when we see that in fact the United States is the world's greatest consumer of fossil fuels. Clearly there is a need for a more comprehensive strategy for conservation, efficiency, development, stockpiling, and use of alternative fuels. So the issues facing the United States in particular, and the Gulf region in general, are of considerable significance. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is not outside the context of this debate tonight to make the point that at this very time we have the Iraqi Foreign Minister in Moscow involved in negotiations with President Gorbachev directed at the possibility of putting some substance to the reports we have heard over the last 24 hours which would suggest that the Iraqis may be prepared to consider meeting the full commitments of the 12 United Nations Security Council resolutions which, in their essence, require the immediate withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait without any preconditions whatsoever. Whether preconditions have been put on the Iraqi statement to date is, of course, a matter for some interpretation. There are others, however, and I suspect I would be one of them, who would take the view from what we have seen over the last six months-and that is how long this war has in fact been in progress-that there has been so much toing and froing by Saddam Hussein that one would have to take precisely what he says with a very large grain of salt. Equally important, what does he really mean?</PARA>
<PARA> It is for that reason that the coalition forces are still proceeding towards the point where the military land offensive may have to commence. But the point needs to be emphasised that that offensive depends at this stage on Saddam Hussein. He can stop it, and he can stop it now. That decision rests absolutely with him. We therefore have to watch over the next few hours to see precisely what comes out of these negotiations in Moscow. Of course we hope that a peaceful settlement can ultimately be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> I should make a further number of points on this particular subject. It has been said that whatever the outcome of this particular Kuwaiti war will be, it must not be seen as a linkage arrangement with other problems in the Middle East, notably the issue of the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. Anyone who has studied the problems of the Middle East over recent decades would have to conclude that at the very essence of many of those problems, possibly the only common link which the Arab nations have, is the belief that there must be a satisfactory outcome to the continuing problem of Palestinian refugees. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is fair to say that most people have passed the stage of entering into the semantic argument as to whether there is such a thing as a Palestinian entity, and whether the Palestinian people should have a homeland of their own. There have been United Nations resolutions on this matter over many years, going back to No. 242. That resolution emphasised the fundamental need for the Israeli boundaries to be internationally accepted, determined and supported, and that is, of course, fundamental to this whole issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Many years ago I wrote an article for the Sydney Morning Herald in which I considered some of the options which may be found in this particular area. I put forward the view that the security and the territorial integrity of Israel is of absolute importance-and I emphasise that fact. It therefore follows that if we are going to have a next door neighbour-call it Palestine or any name we like-which is in a very small piece of land and would probably contain a population somewhere between one million and five million people, it would be fundamental for that nation to be prepared to support a military arrangement which effectively meant that it was demilitarised. The implications of that are of considerable importance. On the one hand, they are clearly important to Israel, and they are also important to Jordan on the other. </PARA>
<PARA> I would hope that if a peaceful settlement can reach the stage of basic negotiation, we will ultimately see Israel and Jordan between them working constructively together, able to work out a means by which the Palestinian people, also involved in the negotiations, will be able to determine the boundaries, the delineations, and the protective arrangements which will be necessary in that area. Perhaps my children will grow up to see a form of confederation which ultimately will include Israel, Jordan as we now know it, and a third entity which would be the Palestinian homeland. Of course, many would disagree with this proposition. I simply put it to them that we have waited so long, and the Palestinian people have waited since 1948. There is a time to address these issues in a constructive way, looking for a way out. </PARA>
<PARA> In the wider context of the Middle East let me say a number of things. The biggest risk we have ever entered into in this current war scenario was that there would not be a clearcut solution. Regrettably, I have to say to the House that I believe that on the balance of probabilities we may well have that situation. Yes, we will achieve the objective ultimately of the United Nations resolutions. Yes, the Iraqi forces will be withdrawn by one means or another from Kuwait. Yes, the Kuwaiti Government will return. On what basis? We have yet to see. I suspect it will not be identical with the basis upon which it left. </PARA>
<PARA> The important thing is that we will still have in Iraq a man who will have the substance of his air force intact, because it will come back from Iran, and who has left his Republican Guards right on the border between Iran and Iraq. Certainly they have taken casualties. We would assume that from the incredible bombing that has taken place over those units over the last few weeks, bombing on a scale never seen by humanity before. Those of us who had the experience in Vietnam have seen what B52s could drop and saw the impact of those bombs. While I have some difficulty understanding what the results of similar bombing would be in the desert because I have never seen the effect of a B52 bomb landing in the desert, I would certainly say that it would have a major psychological effect on the armies that are there. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, quite a considerable part of the Republican Guard-probably at least half or maybe even two-thirds-will still be intact. That can be withdrawn back into Iraq proper. Essentially, therefore, there is the very real possibility that the regime of Saddam Hussein will be more or less intact. Let us never forget that the concepts of democracy, of rule of law, of constitutions, of fairness as we understand it, are not concepts which are endemic to the Arab political environment. Therefore, we are automatically seeing a potential element of instability right from the very beginning. Therefore, while the United States may say-publicly, of course, it must say-that its desire is to remove its military forces, I would go a step further. I think public opinion in Saudi Arabia, the home of Islam, would dictate that non-Islamic forces cannot possibly remain in that part of the world indefinitely. It means that the American presence, such as it may be, will ultimately be of a naval presence with significant air force capability to back it up. </PARA>
<PARA> In the wider context we have other issues. We have the position of Turkey. We have the position of Syria. Above all, over to the east we have the question of the Iranians. There they are after eight years of bloody war-a war, incidentally, they did not start. Iran suffered grievously through that period. It won back, not by force of arms but because Saddam Hussein had no choice, after he saw the United Nations reaction to his attack on Kuwait, but to effectively give back to Iran everything that some half a million Iraqis had died for. We therefore ask that fundamental question: how can public opinion in Iraq continue to support a man and his regime which have taken fathers, grandfathers, sons and daughters and slaughtered them by their hundreds of thousands in a war against Iran? Now they see the massive devastation that has taken place in their towns and villages across Iraq. In Basra for example, we are told that every single road has been destroyed and every bridge has been blown up. Of course, there have been civilian casualties as well. </PARA>
<PARA> One has to ask that question: how can Saddam Hussein turn what we would see in our cultural values to be a disaster scene to his advantage? I will tell honourable members how he will do it. There is only one way. Basically he will say, `The rain of death that came from the skies was given to us by the United States and by their lackeys and their allies elsewhere'. We should not underestimate this, because with all the greatness and all the tradition and all the history of the Islamic world, since 1918 in particular, there is the perception in so much of the Arab world that the West has played with its national interests ultimately to our advantage. Of course, oil has always been seen as the currency for this game of power and prestige-a game, incidentally, which has been played by just as many Arabs as it has been by people who have become wealthy in the West. </PARA>
<PARA> In the whole of that maelstrom of the Middle East, as I said in my opening remarks, we have today the greatest military potential in the world outside of the great powers of the United States and, to a lesser extent now, the Soviet Union. To achieve the capacity to lower that military confrontation is fundamental to achieving any degree of semblance of order. But I put it to the House that when we talk about peace it does not mean the same as what it may mean in the Middle East. Many years ago Tacitus was facing precisely this issue in relation to the Roman attack on Britain. He said in Latin, `Solitudinem faciunt pacem appellant'. That simply meant, `They made it a desert and they called it peace'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1990-91 is to enable the Government to make some additional expenditures in two principal areas-that is, to make a payment through the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation to the wheat industry, which will be paid to the Australian Wheat Board, not to individual farmers as some might suggest; and an additional expenditure on the war in the Middle East. If time permits I might pass some comment on the situation in Iraq, but as a representative of probably the largest wheat growing electorate in Australia and as a wheat grower in my own right, I really wish to talk about the wheat industry as this particular legislation gives me the opportunity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The expenditure today is not some form of Government largesse to the wheat industry. It is a commercial payment under the insurance arrangements that the Government entered into with the wheat industry, and a particular business deal in which the Government has been at pains to substantially lift the premiums. As the Australian Wheat Board points out in its recently released 1989-90 annual report, in 1986-87 the Board was able to insure between 85 per cent and 90 per cent of the value of credit exports for a cost of $10.1m, whereas in 1989-90 the amount of cover the Government was prepared to provide under these particular commercial arrangements was reduced to 80 per cent at a premium cost of $23.3m. </PARA>
<PARA> For the first time in a long while, the Government, as a commercial insurer, having collected large premiums over many years, will meet the cost to date of $181.4m. Considering the devastation in Iraq, were the Iraqi Government or its agencies ever to repay this money-and this is unlikely-that money would not go to the wheat industry but back to the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation. The payment does not represent Government largesse, but the industry could certainly do with the money. However, the payment does not represent the full amount outstanding, which is approximately $800m. The Bill allocates $52.66m in addition to the normal Budget allocation for the Department of Defence. When these sorts of ventures are costed it is not unusual for people to add the normal expenses incurred. I am often surprised to read of the cost of police searches for people lost in the bush. One would think that all those policemen were not working and not getting paid. </PARA>
<PARA> I have heard honourable members talk about the United States freezing money that the Government of Iraq authorised for payment to the Wheat Board. I am not saying the money should not be released; I think it should, but it is about time we put the payment in perspective-it is $2.3m or about 0.3 per cent. It will not help anybody very much in the present situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian wheat industry is a $2.5 billion per annum industry and approximately 85 per cent of wheat production is exported. For many years the Australian wheat industry has been the subject of `orderly' marketing through the Australian Wheat Board. Until 1989 a guaranteed minimum price was fundamental to that orderly marketing arrangement. Over the years the formula by which this was calculated varied and it was properly refined at every alteration. Really and truly, much of the credit that the Wheat Board got over the years was due to the fact that it had a guaranteed minimum price structure. That was much more important to wheat growers than some of the claims by the Wheat Board that it was some sort of specialist marketer, superior to anyone else in the world, particularly private traders. </PARA>
<PARA> Today, many wheat growers, having seen the Wheat Board operate without its guaranteed minimum price, wonder what its specific benefit is. The formula was not a subsidy; it was constructed to follow the market, which it did over the 40-odd years during which the scheme operated. The formula followed the market so well that, notwithstanding an underwriting component guaranteed by government, on only one occasion, in 1986-87, did the Government have to maintain the underwriting commitment. A second occasion would have been the 1990-91 season, which has just concluded. That will have been the most important. </PARA>
<PARA> Put simply, the guaranteed minimum price formula was a moving average formula which took account of three previous actual years and an estimate for the current year. The formula then required the highest of the three actual price years be removed and an average calculated from the other three, but one always had a situation in a falling market where the formula, to some degree, held up the guarantee. Because the Government never guaranteed 100 per cent of that price, there was some leeway and the formula only triggered the underwriting conditions if there was a precipitous fall in the market. But it did allow wheat growers to plant their crops with some certainty on the return. They took enough risks in weather, pests and everything else associated with growing wheat, but on price the wheat growers could make a judgment on expected returns. They could go down to their banks and submit budgets. Sometimes the price was good and sometimes it was bad, but at least the wheat growers had some certainty. In the 1989 legislation the moving average proposal was to be removed. The most outstanding aspect of that situation was that there was no protest at that move by the `industry'. I do not know why it is convenient for governments to put a group of people, usually influenced by bureaucrats they employ, into an office in Canberra and describe them as `the industry'. In this case, Mr McGauchie, who chairs the wheat committee of the Grains Council of Australia, and Mr Eakin and Mr Hooke, who staff that committee-three gentlemen who should have offered their resignation to the wheat industry some time ago and two of whom, Mr Hooke and Mr Eakin, would be receiving outstanding and substantial salaries which they do not earn-are a disgrace, not because they made some stupid or even honest mistake when they negotiated the new Wheat Marketing Act with the Government but because they sold their people out. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not as though they overlooked the matter because as a representative of the Opposition I discussed and negotiated these matters with those gentlemen. I specifically asked them why we were getting a new formula which was nothing more than a ministerial estimate and why they wanted to argue the percentage of that ministerial estimate. Has anyone tried to work out what is an acceptable percentage of a ministerial estimate? If it is 100 per cent, the Minister just lowers the estimate; if it is 50 per cent, he can be generous with it. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time prices were buoyant. Those gentlemen told us that the new ministerial estimate arrangements would give a larger first advance in a rising market. As a wheat grower, I do not care about the first advance in a rising market-I know I am going to get the money-but I am interested in what is going to happen to me when the market crashes, as it did last year. They opted for this new formula because they were either stupid or sufficiently devious-which is the reason I opt for-to do a deal with the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) whereby he provided them with the right to tax their wheat grower constituents 2 per cent of gross so that they could have some money to play with and be important and get taken to lunch by merchant bankers and in return they would not kick up about the Government escaping its responsibilities to offer the wheat industry a guaranteed price. </PARA>
<PARA> The net result is that, in the absence of that formula, wheat growers last year lost, on my calculations, $31 a tonne which they would have received in government subsidy when the price crashed so substantially. It was money they deserved for their commitment to the Government's legislation and the Wheat Board. It would have made a gigantic difference to the Australian economy, because the $300m or $400m paid up-front to wheat growers would have saved the Government $1,500m to $2,000m in unemployment payments, which will be the inevitable consequences of the financial disaster that has hit the wheat industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously the Government wanted out. It had been caught in 1986-87 with a $170m payout, but the suckers in the Grain Council of Australia accommodated it. I have a letter from the Grain Council raising 28 amendments that it wanted made to the legislation. The shadow Minister, who was constantly in touch with the Grain Council, introduced 41 amendments to the legislation-one of which, proposed at the request of the Grain Council, was unconstitutional-and not one of them suggested a reinstatement of the old guaranteed minimum price formula. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that in responding to some of the public remarks I have made on this, Mr Hooke suggested that Senator Panizza and I are doing this to avoid a backlash in our electorates. It is fortunate that I had correspondence with the Grain Council on this matter. It is fortunate that I allocated a considerable amount of time in my speech on that legislation to this matter, in which I not only begged and pointed out that we should have kept the old formula, but also pointed out to the Minister, in response to his remarks in which he showed a bit of sensitivity to what was being done to wheat growers, that his suggestion should be adopted. In his second reading speech, the Minister referred to the 1986-87 situation. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>If such a crisis were to occur again the Government would need to give close consideration to special support arrangements for the industry. </PARA>
<PARA>I attempted in my speech to have that included in the legislation. I did not trust the Minister and this Government to meet that commitment so clearly stated in the second reading speech. I did not trust them to come up with some mechanism to assist the wheat industry when it ran into a brick wall as a result of the United States and European Community battle for market share in the wheat sales around the world. </PARA>
<PARA> To date we have not heard anything from the Government about what it is going to do. Because of the nature of the gross national product formula, were the Government to purely reinstate that formula, it would do nothing for farmers this year. It would pay them $120 a tonne. These are the things we have got to consider. But nobody is to forget that the Grain Council of Australia did not request-even of the Opposition-that it try to reinstate that old formula. </PARA>
<PARA> At one stage, at my urgings, the Council said its preferred position was to have the old formula when the price was falling and the new one when it was going up. Not that that would be possible, and not that we as an opposition would be so stupid as to try to achieve it. The members of the Council are the people who are being paid by wheat growers, by me, to represent our interests with the Government, and they failed us on such a fundamental issue. They did so because they were running around arguing the toss about domestic deregulation, because the legislation had the word `deregulation' in it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Wheat Board's annual report states why the Grain Council would be so interested in protecting the Wheat Board. The Wheat Board pays 40 per cent of the Grain Council's operating costs, some quarter of a million dollars a year. When the Wheat Board says `jump', these characters say `how high?' and it is a disgrace. For Mr Hooke's information, there is no backlash in my electorate. I have got the information on the record, my people understand it and they know who the villains are. That is only part of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other parts of that legislation that concern me. I pay some credit to the Opposition, which said to the Government that if it wanted to further deregulate our constituents, the wheat growers, it was time that the Government demonstrated its bona fides and did something about its own constituents, the trade unions, and deregulated freight and handling and gave the message to the railway unions. The Government did so. It was embarrassed to do it; it did not do it because it wanted to. Nevertheless it did it. It handed the ball to the Australian Wheat Board, which I thought was a fairly good idea at the time. But boy oh boy, has it let the wheat growers of Western Australia down! That is notwithstanding that anywhere one goes in my electorate, road freight is 20 per cent cheaper than rail freight. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has yet to call tenders where alternatives exist. It did call tenders in the non-rail bin areas. One of the past successful tenderers rang me recently and was terribly concerned. He had re-tendered on a road-only area and pointed out to me that the price he tendered in dollars was exactly the same as he had tendered 15 years ago, and he looked like losing the tender. That shows the level of competition that exists in road transport. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to see someone get up after me and talk the sort of rubbish that is put out by the trade unions in the Railway Department that road transport does not pay for the roads. It pays 33 per cent of its revenue in one tax or another. Of course, that tax is not spent on roads, because governments do not bother to spend it on roads. The Government should not blame the road transport industry and say that it does not contribute. As much as 33 per cent of a typical owner-driver's revenue is contributed in one tax or another. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government wants to be the sole regulator and licenser of interstate and national road transport and the owner of its competitor, the rail system. So when the unions get control of all that again and all the rorts and all the rackets are reintroduced, and the Government cannot make a profit, it will up its taxes on the road transport industry to a point where it all looks competitive. That is putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank, and I am determined to see it does not happen. These are the sorts of things we are confronted with in this particular area. </PARA>
<PARA> It is nevertheless interesting to look at the Wheat Board report to find out that since deregulation it has been somewhat successful on the waterfront. I give it credit for that because it stood up to the unions, to the Government and to the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority. In some very limited areas that had success. It actually got manning levels down by 70 per cent. We are told there are no problems out there. The Prime Minister got up today and said that it is all going according to plan. The Government had better speed the process up; it is all supposed to be concluded in a few months, and the Minister has put his job on the line by saying he can do it. </PARA>
<PARA> At least the Wheat Board did something. In its report, it states some other things it would like to do. It says:</PARA>
<PARA>There are other areas which the AWB will continue to explore in order to achieve improved net returns for growers. These areas include continuous operation of loading . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is all mechanised, but we are not allowed to load a ship 24 hours a day. The Prime Minister says we are achieving waterfront reform. What does it cost to have a ship tied up to a wharf going nowhere? It costs a fortune. We wonder why shipping companies of the world put the same premiums on us as they do on going into a war zone. The situation is just so silly. These are just some of things; I could have gone on for another half an hour. The industry is in bad shape and a lot of it is to do with government and regulation. We cannot defeat the situation that exists with the EC-US battle; that is beyond us. I give the Government some credit for its attempt to do so, but the facts are that there are things we do at home and we should be doing them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a debate on the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal report entitled TV violence in Australia. There is a Government response to the report, although I am not sure whether it has been tabled as yet. It is, however, a matter of regret that the Government response-which I have had the advantage of reading, whether or not it has been tabled-tells us nothing about the Government's attitude to violence as portrayed on television.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One would think that the Government would have some philosophy on it, something that could be put into words, but one will read its response to this report in vain if one is looking for some inkling of the Government's thinking on the issue. It is true of course that the Government has accepted the recommendations of the Broadcasting Tribunal, but that really amounts to accepting the proposal to set up a code to govern how the TV channels will handle the question of violence, and it does not amount to anything more than that. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, apart from that there is no clue in the Government's response that shows whether it thinks there is too much violence or what degree of violence it thinks is permissible, how violence should be prevented from being portrayed on television or anything else on that subject. That really is a matter of regret because the whole community would have the advantage, if the Government did express its views on this, of at least seeing how the elected Government saw this particular problem. </PARA>
<PARA> This is, I suppose, one more example of an elected government abrogating responsibility. Over recent years there has been a definite trend in this direction. Governments of all political persuasions have shied away from what they call political interference in favour of what they call independence. It is said that there is virtue in so-called independent or non-political judgments being made about these issues and that, therefore, those judgments and decisions must be made, it seems, by anybody other than an elected government. That in many cases is an abrogation, as I say, of the responsibility that an elected government has to the people, and that responsibility is to make judgments exercising the mandate and the duty that the government has. </PARA>
<PARA> Elected governments are supposed to make these types of judgments on the kind of issue that we are debating tonight, amongst others, and it is no credit to them when they just wash their hands of an issue, as I believe the Government has done in this case, and when such an elected government leaves the decisions to a non-elected body-in this case, the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal-and dresses it up by saying, `Well, of course, it's an independent body which is making judgments and decisions without political interference'. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite all of that, the reality is that we now have a report by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. It recommends self-regulation of the degree to which and the manner in which violence may be presented on television, and it proposes that this be achieved by means of a code with which the television channels will be expected to comply. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe there are a number of things that can be said on this issue. The first is that it should not be assumed that the commercial television channels have been indifferent to the complex issues involved in making judgments about the quantity of violence and the manner in which that violence may be presented on television. At least Channel 9, where I conducted an inspection on this very issue, has the staff and the guidelines to enable sensible decisions to be made about these matters. I have no doubt that the other channels have also put time and effort into making decisions on whether to broadcast violence in any shape or form and, if so, how to do it so that it does not unduly offend public taste. </PARA>
<PARA> The television channels of course, despite this, may not have always produced a satisfactory result in handling the issue of violence and this is probably so for three reasons: firstly, they act under commercial pressures in deciding whether to hold back an item and run the risk that their rivals will broadcast it while they are doing the right thing and putting a censor's blue pencil through it; secondly, until now, of course, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the Special Broadcasting Service have not been subject to the rules and standards imposed on the commercial channels, and the commercial channels must have been tempted on many occasions to broadcast anything that they knew the ABC and the SBS were likely to show with impunity; and thirdly, the commercial channels are forced to act under severe time constraints and make snap decisions which of course may sometimes be wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> The result of all this has been, of course, that the public has remained concerned about the quantity of violence on television and the manner in which it has been presented. Despite this, as I say, we should not approach this issue on the assumption that the channels have been completely indifferent to the issue, because in fact they have not been indifferent to it. So that is the first thing. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thing is that the ABC and the SBS, as I have already referred to in passing, have been free of the restraints and constraints that apply to the commercial stations, both in radio and television, because of the apparently untrammelled independence of those two bodies. However, as the ABC has learnt recently due to its coverage of the Persian Gulf war, there are in fact limits to how much of this independence the public will tolerate when the nation is engaged in a crisis and when the ABC, to take one case, will not even broadcast through Radio Australia messages to our service personnel in a theatre of war until they are persuaded to do so by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and some of his senior Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> So it is pleasing now that the Broadcasting Tribunal has recommended that the ABC and the SBS will in fact be subject to a code, and a code that will be similar to that now accepted by the commercial television channels. It is pleasing that, according to the Government response to the report TV violence in Australia, the ABC and the SBS have now prepared a code along similar lines to that which will apply to the commercial channels to govern how they will portray violence on television. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, while we are at it, we should be noting that it should now be common ground that both ABC radio and television should be subject to most if not all of the same standards as those to which commercial broadcasters are subject. It is a matter of very great concern in sections of the community, and of course in the broadcasting industry, that there is in fact a set of rules which is imposed with some stringency on commercial radio and television and yet that same set of rules is not applied to the ABC, which of course can act with impunity. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendations of the Broadcasting Tribunal in this report are basically threefold. The first recommendation is that there should be self-regulation of the presentation of matters touching on violence as they are presented on television; the second is that that self-regulation is to be implemented by means of a code which the channels will apply; and the third is that the touchstone of this code is to be the test of community standards. </PARA>
<PARA> Flowing from this, the code has now been drawn up and will be released in a few weeks. Here again I regret to say that I must make some criticism, I hope constructive, because I believe it is unfortunate that we are debating this issue without having the code before us. I hope that at some time we will be able to have a debate on whether the code adequately reflects the community standards that we, as elected representatives of that community, are supposed to be promoting. The code of course exists-it is available to some people-but it is not possible to refer to it in the debate tonight because it has not yet been released publicly. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already said that it is unfortunate that the elected Government of this country has not given us a clue as to how it sees these standards that are to be imposed and their implementation. For that reason, the Government's response on this issue is disappointing. </PARA>
<PARA> For my part, I am prepared to put forward the following propositions about violence on television and the way it should be portrayed. The first is that it is unreal to expect that no violence at all will be broadcast. Some crime, for instance, is violent and if the community saw just how violent some of it is, the community may have a better understanding of the monumental task facing police forces and the need, in some cases, for very heavy sentences. In addition to that, the fact is that violence does occur; it is a fact. We should therefore have a presumption that, subject to some exceptions, what happens as a fact within Australia and overseas should be broadcast unless there is a strong reason for not broadcasting it. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, in expressing how violence should be presented on television, the guiding principle, I would suggest, should be that it should not be presented in a gloating way, nor should it be depicted at excessive length or lingered over. Indeed, the Tribunal said much the same in its own proposition in the report, which was in these words:</PARA>
<PARA>Information should not be kept from viewers but news events should not be displayed in a sensational, bizarre or excessively graphic way. </PARA>
<PARA>Thirdly, there is also a case for an outright ban on the presentation of some forms of violence. For instance, material that might reasonably be expected to encourage dangerous imitation of criminal or terrorist behaviour should not be allowed. The public interest is not served at all by showing how to make bombs or elevating violent people into folk heroes like the Irish Republican Army or other terrorist groups when in reality all that is being done is promoting their violent causes. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, I emphasise the importance of advance notice being given to viewers when a television station is about to show material that some viewers may well feel is excessively violent. Fifthly, there must always be particular sensitivity demonstrated about programs which children might see. Children are entitled to be protected no matter what programs adults are to be shown. </PARA>
<PARA> Sixthly-and this is not inconsistent-parents must understand that they have the primary obligation to protect their children and ensure that they are exposed only to constructive and healthy influences. For parents to carry out that responsibility, they need information to enable them to make sensible judgments; so they need advance information on programs and clear and understandable symbols and guides as to how particular programs have been classified. Those are some of the principles that I believe should be applied.</PARA>
<PARA> I hope the code will take all of these matters into account and that the television channels will make a real effort to reflect community standards. They should keep, I would suggest, two things firmly in mind. First, they should always remember that the viewer has the ultimate sanction; that is, the sanction of not watching, of changing channels or of turning the television set off altogether. If the channels do not reflect community standards the community will extract its own price. Secondly, it should be remembered that self-regulation will be accepted so long, and only so long, as it produces results which are consistent with community expectations and which uphold community standards. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, we have now had a thorough investigation by the Tribunal of the issues of violence as portrayed on television. The problem is now to be attempted to be solved and addressed by self-regulation. That self-regulation will be implemented by means of a code which the channels will be expected to comply with. Of course, their compliance will be a matter which, on the renewal of their licences, will be taken into account. One hopes that it will be applied sensibly and constructively to meet this particular area of community concern. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal report on television violence in Australia, at the outset I take issue with a couple of points made by the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown), in particular his claim that the Government has not responded to the issue or put its views forward. The fact is that there was a reference to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to prepare the report in the first place and the Government has identified and supported the various recommendations contained in the Tribunal's report, including the self-regulatory code and the education program that goes with that process. Since the tabling of the report in May last year there has been active support for the commercial television stations and, as the honourable member for Menzies pointed out, for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the Special Broadcasting Service to participate in the development of appropriate standards and ensure the monitoring of those appropriate standards for violence on television. That is something that should be acknowledged by all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For some time there has been much concern in the Australian community about the effects of television violence and associated trauma and the correlation between the depiction of violence on television and the levels of violence within the community. It was with that in mind that in August 1988 the then Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Gareth Evans, referred the matter to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to conduct a major inquiry into the portrayal, depiction and reporting of violence on television under section 18 of the Broadcasting Act. The decision to initiate the inquiry arose out of concern expressed during the Special Premiers Conference on gun control in December 1987 which was, in turn, a response to events such as the Queen Street and Hoddle Street massacres. In the preface of the report, the Chairperson of the Tribunal stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . until the release of our research and the conduct of public conferences, the commercial television industry had not fully addressed or even accepted that the public was concerned by the portrayal of violence on television . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I think there can be no doubt that television stations, operating under the commercial pressures of ratings maximisation, have in the past refused or have been very slow to acknowledge the potential harm of graphic and gratuitous accounts and depictions of violence. But this report, with over 1,000 individuals and organisations making submissions, is indicative of the Australian public's demands for more responsibility from the television licensees when dealing with the issue of violence in areas such as cartoons, advertising, drama, movies, current events and the news. </PARA>
<PARA> There is much evidence on both sides of the debate concerning small screen violence and a causal link with violence in the community. However, there is no doubt that in order to adequately assess this conflicting information one must acknowledge the premise that television is the most persuasive and pervasive channel of communication in the Western world today. It is readily accessible to people of all socio-economic backgrounds-the socially well-adjusted, the educated and those who are vulnerable to its content because of their age or mental instability, which consequently denies them the satisfactory analytical tools to assess the information to which they are being exposed. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many causes of violence in our society but the decision about if or how we use violence in response to our conflicts in our daily lives is greatly determined by the rules, norms or standards of behaviour that we observe in the world around us. It is this issue of learning about the rules of if and when to use violence that leads to concern about learning of violence in the family setting, in the lounge room. It is particularly important in terms of violence affecting children and violence in children's television programs. I will refer to that in more detail later. </PARA>
<PARA> The concern about violence on television stems from the fact that television, while an acknowledged source of entertainment, has a much more subtle role as teacher of norms and socially acceptable behaviour. But this does not always manifest itself positively. For example, I remind the House of Michael Ryan, the Hungerford killer in the United Kingdom who slaughtered 16 people in 1987. Ryan had dressed himself for the part in a Rambo outfit and acted out scenes from that movie as he ran amuck. It was also noted by Hal Hallenstein, the coroner in the trial of Frank Vitkovic, who killed eight people in the Queen Street massacre in Melbourne, that he was also obsessed with the Rambo mentality. </PARA>
<PARA> Further evidence for the need to more closely monitor the levels of television violence was published in the newsletter of the South Australian Council for Children's Film and Television in March 1984. In this case, a 12-year-old boy was admitted to hospital suffering from hysteria after watching a particularly violent movie on television. </PARA>
<PARA> While I acknowledge this to be an extreme example of the effects of violence, there is no doubt in my mind that viewing violence can and does provoke negative psychological responses, and in extreme cases this can manifest in a psychological way and cause a physiological reaction. As a response to these and other examples of detrimental effects of violence on television, the Tribunal, in January 1990, delivered its findings to the then Minister for Transport and Communications, the present Minister for Finance (Mr Willis). It recommended that the censorship option not be extended further, for sound reasons but that, rather, the development of an industry-wide self-regulatory code about violence be implemented and regularly reassessed. The Tribunal's findings indicate that a self-regulatory code will ultimately be of more benefit to maintaining standards relating to the broadcasting of violence than the imposition of hard and fast rules which would, more than likely, be unable to cater for every conceivable scenario. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the self-regulatory code, which will be devised by the commercial television networks themselves, will need to be constantly reviewed in the light of community attitudes and responses to the success of the code. It will be the responsibility of the networks to distribute the code to interested parties and, of course, account for their interpretation of it during licence renewal procedures. Whilst the code itself contains no penalties or policing mechanisms, the Tribunal will review broadcasters' performance in relation to the code during licence renewals or if it has reason to believe the broadcasters are acting with serious or repeated disregard of the code. Ultimately, the Government's acceptance of the Tribunal's proposals requires that editors and management take a more responsible attitude to the sensitivity of the viewing audience. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation in no way encroaches on freedom of speech or interpretation but, rather, recognises the special role the television media have in our Australian community. News and current affairs attract more viewers than any other regular programs. Australians expect comprehensive news and current affairs services early in the evening, which means that news and current affairs staff have to be particularly mindful of the large numbers of children present. In all other early evening programs there are stringent restrictions both on subject matter and the way in which it is treated. By way of contrast, early morning news and current affairs are free to report or analyse any subject as long as they exercise due care. </PARA>
<PARA> It is perhaps worth noting at this point some of the definitions of what constitutes violence on television. Going from the Tribunal's report, the definitions of violence include the use of unlawful or unacceptable physical force against another person, often culminating in injury and involving an exertion of physical strength or the use of weapons. During the course of the inquiry, the expressions of concern about violence on television covered a wide range of issues, including matters of general concern, matters relating to specific instances reported on the news, concern about drama and/or news presentation which imply an overall picture of the world as a violent place, concern about violence in series and feature length films, concern about the use of violence in commercials, aesthetic objection to the way violence is displayed to viewers, concern about the effects of violence on child viewers and concern about the de-sanitisation of viewers by the cumulative effect of programs which may be individually acceptable. There was also a reference to the use of callous or unjust physical and mental force against persons, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly in this whole debate a fundamental concern, on which I and many other members have had representations, is the question of the impact of violence on television on children. One could ask a number of questions about the impact of such programs. Is it really all that funny when Popeye winds up a bulging and tattooed bicep and clobbers Brutus on the mouth? Is Batman truly defending a Christian ethic of peace, love and protection when he biffs, kapows and wallops the Penguin? Is wringing that last tear out of a witness or victim on current affairs programs going to give the viewer more insights to angles on the story?</PARA>
<PARA> A great deal of research has been done on the question of the impact of violence on children and the impact of the impressions of the portrayal of violence on television on children. Suffice it to say that that research, whilst mixed, highlights the fact that there is very strong correlation between the amount of violence that children watch on television and the tendency towards acts of aggression. Indeed, a variety of studies have highlighted this point. </PARA>
<PARA> What is sought, as the Tribunal recommends, is, first of all, a development of the self-regulatory code that relates to the impact that violence portrayals may have on children and, just as importantly, that the education role we all have, particularly parents, ensures that children's needs are addressed. Children's viewing habits and their observation of violence as a whole in terms of their life should be well and truly given parental control. The self-regulatory code in itself will not achieve that. </PARA>
<PARA> The role of parents will be particularly important in that process. The Tribunal has made it clear-and the Government in response to the Tribunal has made very clear-that it is also particularly important that parents and all those with an interest in these issues in the community use the important role and the functions that the Tribunal has to effectively ensure that a monitoring process is carried out. </PARA>
<PARA> The self-regulatory code will only be as good as the television stations' implementation of it and compliance with it, and that will be very important. The most effective way of achieving that is to ensure that members of the public are vigilant in expressing their concerns if television stations do not do the right thing in observing that code. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My good friend the honourable member for Chifley asks what they can do. There are a few very important things that members of the community can do in this regard. First of all, if they find objectionable material-violence particularly-in programs at children's viewing times or if there is stark portrayal of particularly violent actions in news programs, they should complain to the television stations. That is the first thing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, if they are not satisfied and if they see a proliferation in the amount of violence that children particularly are subjected to on television, they should bring those matters to the attention of the Tribunal, because the Tribunal, as has been stated in its report, will regularly monitor the actions of the television stations in meeting those particular targets and objectives. That will be particularly important. In the licence renewal process, the public has a role in bringing these matters to the attention of the Tribunal at every step of the way and ensuring that, if this self-regulation process is seen not to be as effective as we hope it will be, the Tribunal is in a position to deal more decisively with the question of violence on television. </PARA>
<PARA> Based on the range of submissions that most of us have received and the fact that the Tribunal did receive over 1,100 submissions on this issue, that will be welcomed by all. I think it is something that will help to give children what they need. As I have said, there is evidence, based on a number of laboratory tests that have been done both in Australia and overseas, that children who are subjected to a lot of violence in television programs are inclined to act more aggressively than those who are kept removed from that process. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a real challenge not only for the Tribunal and television stations but also for the viewing public at large to play its part in ensuring we effectively monitor and maintain this self-regulatory regime. If that is done, I feel sure the great value of our television, the entertainment perspectives that it offers and the great worth of community education from the television media will be enhanced. If that is not done, we will end up with a poorer community and the potential for greater depictions and greater acts of violence, based on many of the sad cases we have seen in the past. I think that the whole community would seek to have us ensure that does not happen. I trust the self-regulatory role and the code will be successful and I look forward to it being closely monitored as times goes on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! Earlier today the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) asked me two questions concerning committees. The first question was: what access is allowed to the proceedings of committees by a person who is not a member of that committee? When committees take evidence in public or conduct other public proceedings, by definition, other persons, including members, may attend. Standing order 338 relates to members in particular. If a committee meets privately or takes evidence in camera, the only people other than a committee member who may be present are committee staff, advisers and witnesses or, in some cases, other persons the committee may agree to have present.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member's second question was: on what basis can a person who is not a member of a committee reveal publicly details pertaining to meetings of a committee? If meetings or proceedings have been held in public, obviously there is no restriction on the disclosure of proceedings. In other cases, standing order 340 applies. It deals with evidence taken by committees and documents presented to, and proceedings and reports of, committees which have not been reported to the House. Standing order 340 provides effectively that these matters may not be disclosed or published.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to discuss a few issues pertaining to the tabling of the report of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT) entitled TV Violence in Australia. Firstly, in approaching this report I looked at how best to tackle the issues-from the viewpoint of a parent of young children and from the viewpoint of a former policeman who has seen some of the effects that television violence has had on young people, or perhaps as a member of the baby boom generation, which has probably been more exposed than any other generation to the effects of television viewing since television was introduced into Australia in 1956.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The issue of television violence and its effects on viewers-particularly young viewers-has been a subject of much contention over the years. Of course, community concerns are growing as a result of what many people in the community see to be the declining standards of television programming. There is also no doubt that many more Australian children these days are watching more and more television. As a result of watching more television they are absorbing the attitudes of the role models that they view daily and nightly on their television set. These may make bad impressions on their psyche, but it makes the task of measuring those effects very difficult indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> The other day I spoke in the debate on the Crimes (Investigation of Commonwealth Offences) Amendment Bill 1990 and I mentioned some of the community perceptions of the criminal justice system that had been distorted as a result of the programming of a considerable number of American cop shows on television. As I have mentioned, the effects of television violence on viewers are obviously difficult to measure. Often they only become apparent later in life and, of course, are combined with other influences that may occur in individual circumstances. The aims of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal's report were not to analyse the effects of television violence per se, but rather to represent the views that were expressed by the public in relation to the effects of television violence on viewers. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we have to say from the outset that television violence is not solely responsible for violence in the community. It would be wrong to blame the television station programmers for being the major causes of violent conduct in our society. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation has made a statement on television violence which reflects the Marxian view of how that violence arises in the community. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Although the media should not be absolved from their responsibilities, it would be misleading to regard them as the roots of violent behaviour. These are more likely to be found in the frustration engendered by such factors as inequality, social injustice, overcrowding, urbanisation and so on. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, these are the sorts of comments that one would expect from a predominantly Marxian view on the effects of television violence on social behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> There is quite obviously a strong feeling in the community relating to the effects on viewers of violence on television. Therefore, as the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal inquiry found, it warrants further consideration. In fact, in its sampling of opinions, the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal found that up to 25 per cent of the people surveyed considered that television violence was a very important aspect. The Chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, Dierdre O'Connor, stated:</PARA>
<PARA>It is my view that until the release of our research and the conduct of public conferences, the commercial television industry had not fully addressed or even accepted that the public was concerned by the portrayal of violence on television. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the implication of this statement is that there is a need for an objective regulatory body and that television violence has not been addressed in the commercial sector of television broadcasting. As a result, it requires some form of external regulation. The implication is that there is a tendency for the commercial broadcasters' search for profit in television broadcasting to subvert their interest in perhaps regulating more fully violent television programming. </PARA>
<PARA> In the first instance, we must examine the whole question of self-regulation with regard to television stations. Of course, in discussing commercial television stations one also has to ask why the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) should be exempt from any sort of regulatory controls. Here I take issue with the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr Elliott), who, in referring to some of the comments made by the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown), discussed how the Government had taken action in relation to self-regulation. In the statement of the then Minister for Transport and Communications, the present Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), there is an absence of any reference to the inclusion of the ABC and the SBS. I also point out with regard to SBS that in its submission to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, Mr Ken Barton, the Classifications Officer, stated:</PARA>
<PARA>In assessing program content involving violence, consideration is given to numerous factors including: justification by context; degree of explicitness; propensity to alarm, distress or shock; significance in relation to message; social importance of content; and pro-social intent of programs as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on further to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The SBS has found that applying a set of standards to culturally diverse programming for a culturally diverse audience requires care and discretion to ensure that a wide variance in cultural values is not subjected thoughtlessly to an Anglo-Saxon straitjacket. To this end the SBS has developed a policy of keeping censorship edits to an absolute minimum. </PARA>
<PARA>The ABC, in its submission to the Broadcasting Tribunal, stated:</PARA>
<PARA>We do believe . . . that there are roles for various networks, including the ABC, and perhaps a role for the Tribunal also, in increasing the level of awareness of working journalists and other people in the industry as to some of the issues, either by training, use of video, a range of things, and also in schools, and in the broader community. </PARA>
<PARA>As was reported in June last year, David Hill, the Managing Director of the ABC, indicated that:</PARA>
<PARA>The ABC would not be part of any industry wide code on violence to be approved by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> The community expects and deserves standards on television violence to be established. It expects there to be a self-regulatory code of behaviour on the part of commercial and public broadcasters. The findings of the Task Force on Violence commissioned by the United States Attorney-General concluded in September 1984 that:</PARA>
<PARA>The evidence is becoming overwhelming that just as witnessing violence in the home may contribute to normal adults and children learning and acting out violent behaviour, violence on TV and movies may lead to the same result. </PARA>
<PARA>The American Psychological Association recommends that broadcasters, in addition to reducing violence, should provide time for public service messages that would warn viewers about the potentially harmful effects of viewing televised violence. Of course there is a need for the ABT to look-as it has done-at all of these recommendations. Many areas of concern have been raised, both by the honourable member for Menzies and also by the honourable member for Parramatta. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the question of television news. When I was a youngster my family resided in Hong Kong, and on the television news in Hong Kong fairly graphic scenes of violence were broadcast into people's living rooms. I have found that in the last few years similar sorts of levels of violence have been broadcast on the television news in Australia. There have been some very graphic representations. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the problems with regard to the question of violence on television is the relationship between factual violence and fantasy violence. In Volume II of the report entitled Research Findings there is a section devoted to the question of factual violence versus realistic violence in relation to its effect on viewers. In particular, it compared the upset value of the news violence portrayal and video violence portrayal according to various viewer responses. For instance, in relation to fighting portrayed in both sections, 23 per cent of teenagers were found to be upset by fighting in a movie portrayal of violence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw the attention of the House to the problem of the freeze on nursing home beds that was raised in two of my local papers this week. The freeze was lifted just before Christmas, but still there is no resolution of the matter in my electorate having regard to the Wonthaggi Nursing Home and the Kooweerup Memorial Nursing Home. The headline of one article reads, `Nursing delay ``causing deaths'' '. I draw to the attention of this House that there are people in my electorate who have failed to get the proper nursing home care that they well and truly deserved prior to their death.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I inquired of an officer of one of those institutions as to what reasons he could give me for any reduction in his waiting list. He said, `There are those people who die prior to being admitted to our hospital'. With 40 beds in my electorate still empty-unbelievably; absurd as it may be-after nearly 16 months of negotiations between the Federal and State governments, at this stage we are still no closer to resolution of the problem. It is tragic and absurd that this should happen in a nation as wealthy as Australia. Our State and Federal governments cannot agree and in fact argue over the funding of those nursing home beds. </PARA>
<PARA> I realise that there are times when negotiations have to take place, but this is no shock claim presented in the South Gippsland Sentinel Times this week. I have been telling this story for as long as I have been a member of this House. It has been documented by Dr John O'Callaghan, who has written to the Health Department on a number of occasions with exactly the same claims documented as those I am presenting to this House tonight. It behoves this Government at this time to take up this matter with the Victorian Government and resolve it. I know that the Victorian Minister for Health desires a resolution of the matter by the twelfth of next month. </PARA>
<PARA> Many elderly frail people require care. I think 100 people were on the list for Kooweerup Hospital at last call, not to mention all of those on the list for Wonthaggi Hospital. Honourable members should remember that these people have served this country so well, yet we as a cooperative government have been unable to come to a resolution of the matter in regard to these hospitals. Those beds are there. They are partly funded by the community. Enormous capital works have been carried out on behalf of the community, but still the Government says, `We will pay you $86', when the real costs at Kooweerup, I know, are between $105 and $110 per bed. Still the State regional offices do not know at this point how much they are being offered and so cannot communicate that to the hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA> Councillor Duscher, who is the President of the borough of Wonthaggi, stresses that if the Government is incapable of ending the drama it should resign. These people are so angry. I can understand their anger. They have waited and waited upon this Government, and still there has been no resolution. Now for the first time the community of Wonthaggi has revolted against the Hawke Government. If this is the Hawke Government's idea of social justice, it has a long way to go. This is a further failure of the Hawke Government in regard to social justice. It does not care about what is really happening. It has become remote, and it is a tired, sad government. </PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of these people, I say to the Government, `Please enter into the lives of these elderly people and their families on their behalf'. This is a call to the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples). It is time that he acted and moved quickly on behalf of ordinary people in ordinary communities, especially in the electorate of Corinella and in relation to the Kooweerup Memorial Hospital and Wonthaggi Hospital. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise the question of coastal development and access rights of individual Australians to areas of the coast around Australia. In particular, I would like to focus upon two groups of people: fishing people and surfers. I have to confess a vested interest; I am a surfer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been a matter of concern for some time now that, due to development policies being pursued and land ownership practices, certain areas of the coastline, particularly in Western Australia, are being closed to public access by new owners of that property. I refer to two particularly relevant areas: one is a surf break called Durs, north of Yanchep, and the other is Turtles, which is further to the north on Gnaraloo Station, both of which are very good surf breaks and highly prized by surfers. Unfortunately new owners have bought these properties. Incidentally, I add that they are Japanese owners, but I do not want to labour that point. I think it is important to note that these new owners are denying fishing people and surfers rights of access to those areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members in this House would understand that certain fishing and surfing spots, by definition, are scarce commodities in Australia. They are not something that should be closed off by someone who happens to command the hinterland of those areas. Only recently, for example, we saw a group in the Margaret River area oppose a group called Eagles Cliff Developments, which was again an overseas owned company that sought to develop a golf course complex adjacent to the Margaret River surf break. Again, that would have impacted on the access of ordinary people to that area. </PARA>
<PARA> My fundamental objection is neither that there should be some form of ownership nor that there might even be some degree of overseas ownership-although I think more Australian ownership is desirable. The objection I have is to the preoccupation of some developers to have exclusive rights to the coastline. In a country like ours, it is not proper to grant people an exclusive right to the coastline. It is a public resource that should be available to the public in general. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that my colleague the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) takes up that point. If we look at the European and North American experience, we see that they have done the wrong thing. They have allowed parts of their coastline to become exclusive and privately owned, and it is quite wrong. It is very interesting that the new owners of these developments are saying, `Oh well, there is an environmental concern. Therefore, we have to stop access'. In fact, that is a smokescreen to cover their desire simply to close the area off. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that what is needed-and this is essentially the role of State and local government, but I think we have a role to play-is a guarantee of right of access to the coastline right around Australia except for some specific purposes-obviously, for port authorities; secondly, for quarantine purposes; thirdly, for defence purposes; and, fourthly, where it is clearly recognised that something is so environmentally sensitive that access could not be allowed for some specific reasons. Aside from that, we ought to be working towards guaranteeing the right of access to the coastline right around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The question that we have to examine is how we might best manage these areas such as Durs, Turtles or others, particularly some breaks south of Margaret River that are very significant and which I am familiar with-that is, Gas Bay, Grunters and Boodginup, the three of which are excellent surf breaks. Another surf break north of Yallingup called Three Bears again is on private property. So far access has not been threatened, but it is important for State and local authorities to be prepared, by legislation if necessary but maybe by gazetting, to nominate a series of areas like these that the public should have guaranteed right of access to. Thereby, we can have a management plan in place with no environmental degradation. The public will be comfortable knowing that that surfing or fishing spot will remain there. It does not affect the other activity that is intended; it need not affect that whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> What I object to strongly is the notion that just by the right of ownership people can be denied access to the coastline. It is a very important resource. In this country we have been lucky-we have never put an economic rent on it; we have regarded it as a common resource. We should keep it that way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today in this place the honourable members for Forrest (Mr Prosser) and Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher) outlined in the matter of public importance debate the very sorry state of affairs for the 750,000 small businesses across this nation. In particular, they highlighted the dramatic increase in bankruptcy statistics, and the disaster area-and that is not putting too strong a word on it-that is our rural sector today. What did we get in reply from the honourable member for Rankin, the Minister for Small Business and Customs (Mr Beddall)? No more, no less than a personal diatribe attacking the honourable member for Forrest and, most importantly, avoiding at all cost the very real issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would simply say to the Minister that he needs to have a look, for example, at the central business district of the city of Toowoomba in my electorate, and the empty shops, the farm machinery saleyards and the seed merchants in the area to understand the very serious ramifications of the recession of the Treasurer (Mr Keating) we had to have and its impact on small business. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that the Minister is a very rare visitor to those parts of his electorate adjacent to mine on the eastern Darling Downs around Warwick, Allora and Clifton, which should demonstrate to the Minister a similar adverse economic impact and, of course, the rural downturn. However, I suggest to the Minister that he should have a long, hard look at the increasing number of empty shops in the townships on the eastern Darling Downs and see at first hand the growing queues in the local Commonwealth Employment Service offices, as well as listening to the increasing financial problems of the many farmers in my electorate and in his electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> He should see, for example, what has happened to the internationally renowned Toowoomba based Southern Cross Corporation, only a few years ago the city's largest single employer of over 2,000 workers. What do we see in its place today but a struggling company of around 400 workers-high on quality, high on industry and high on commitment, but very short indeed on orders, particularly from the motor vehicle industry, and having in the last couple of weeks, regrettably, retrenched another 40 workers. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to say to this House that I found the Minister's response in this place today at best inadequate, at worst an indictment of his inability to come to grips with the nuances of his portfolio. Minister Beddall needs to lift his game, not merely on the floor of this House, but in the day to day handling of his important and increasingly sensitive portfolio and in his comprehension of the underlying issues. Seemingly he has contracted the Treasurer's impersonal disease of disinterest. That is simply not good enough, and the nation deserves better. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Tonight I wish to raise the issue of the planned F4 tollway which passes through my electorate in western Sydney. I am particularly raising this issue because we recently experienced the spectacle of the State Government of New South Wales proposing to place a toll on the F4 freeway, which currently stretches from Strathfield in the east through to Penrith in the west and has a missing link between May's Hill and Prospect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I raise this matter tonight because we have been subjected to a proposal by the State Government of New South Wales to place a toll on a section of road which was originally constructed and completed and opened in 1982. It was subject to Federal road funding at that time, and it is now going to be the subject of a toll-it is alleged-apparently to pay for the missing link in the road. </PARA>
<PARA> My concern is twofold. Firstly, the residents who live in western Sydney-and there are 1.8 million people who live in that region at the moment-pay an enormous amount in petrol taxes to both State and Commonwealth governments and get a very disproportionate reallocation of those funds back for local roads, including the completion of the F4 freeway. </PARA>
<PARA> Just as significantly tonight, I wish to take strong issue with the State Government's plans to put a toll on a section of road that was actually paid for by the Commonwealth-some of it, as I say, as long ago as 1982, with other sections opened in 1986 and 1988. I want to take the opportunity to call on the Federal Minister for Land Transport (Mr Bob Brown) to ensure that this proposal, which I think is outrageous in anybody's eyes, is not allowed to proceed. The Minister for Land Transport has indicated that he is concerned about the toll booths on the F4 tollway in that they are going to be located on sections of road between James Ruse Drive and Silverwater Road, using the road that was funded under the Australian Bicentennial Road Development (ABRD) program. As the Minister indicated to me, the ABRD Trust Fund Act requires his consent before any State can impose a toll which may affect roads that have been funded under that Act. The State Government has proceeded on the basis of planning to implement this toll on this existing section of road without that approval. </PARA>
<PARA> More recently the Federal Minister and the Department for Transport and Communications have been actively seeking details of this proposal from the New South Wales Roads and Traffic Authority in order that they can properly assess the propriety of the locations of these toll plazas, as they are called, on this section of road. This is a matter of great significance because the plan is to put a toll in place for traffic travelling each way on this section of road. It will have the effect of being an impost of $1.50 every time a car goes backwards and forwards. But just as importantly, and it is an obvious thing, people will seek to get off this toll road and use local roads throughout the area, and that will have a devastating effect on the amenity of the local community. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it would be fair to say that most people would find a government coming along and saying, `We are going to impose a new toll on work done almost a decade ago' pretty unthinkable. The New South Wales Government has been totally oblivious to the objections that have been raised by the Parramatta City Council, the Holroyd City Council, and many other people in the community, to such an extent that until very recently the Deputy Premier of New South Wales had even refused to meet a deputation from concerned citizens objecting to this proposal. He has said in no uncertain terms that, as far as he is concerned, he sees nothing wrong with the State Government of New South Wales putting a toll on a section of road completed and opened and paid for, as I say, in 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had Federal road funding for a long time in this country. It is really breaking new ground for a State government to take upon itself the provision of further construction facilities and to say, `We are going to apply the user pays principle, but we are not just going to apply the user pays principle to what works we do in the future; we are prepared to go back at least a decade, maybe more, in order that we can get whatever revenue we like'. The inconsistency of this is shown when one considers that at the same time a toll is being put on the residents of western Sydney the Gore Hill Freeway is being built at no toll cost at all. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to call upon the Federal Minister to take strong steps to ensure no approval is given to enable the New South Wales Government to impose such a regressive toll on a section of road already completed and paid for by the motorists. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to speak on local issues at this time tonight. The first matter I wish to raise concerns my constituent and good friend Mr Jack Gibson. On 28 August last year Jack, known affectionately around real football circles as `super coach', donated the magnificent sum of $278,611 to the Prince of Wales Hospital Schizophrenic Research Unit. Most honourable members from New South Wales and indeed most honourable members with even a remote interest in rugby league in other parts of Australia would know of Jack Gibson. Those of us who knew of the tragedy of the death of Jack's son Luke are aware that Luke battled with schizophrenia for a long time. Jack and Judy were very supportive of Luke as loving and caring parents. They could not have done more than they did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Jack and his wonderful wife, Judy, helped raise the money for research into schizophrenia at the Prince of Wales Hospital at Randwick, Sydney, and I take the time of the House to commend and thank them on behalf of the Federal Parliament for their efforts and outstanding generosity. Jack and Judy donated $100,854 from the proceeds of Jack's book Played Strong, Done Fine, which of course was dedicated to Luke. To anybody who has not read Jack's book I offer a strong suggestion that they do so, for it is written in Jack's unique style, which has made him one of the most colourful identities in rugby league. </PARA>
<PARA> Another of Jack's innovations, which I believe he learned from his time in the United States, is to auction dollar cheques signed and made out by celebrities. This method raised thousands of dollars for the schizophrenia unit. This year part of that money will go to doctors researching the biological basis of schizophrenia. Another part of the money-about $12,000-will be used to finance a film to make the community more aware about the disease, while similar funding will be donated to the schizophrenia fellowship of New South Wales. Once again, I congratulate Jack on this achievement and I urge other members of this place to support the cause of research into schizophrenia. It is far more widespread than most members of the House realise. Jack Gibson is a fine man and a fine example to us all. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter I draw to the attention of the House tonight is perplexing. In October last year I received a call regarding a tug that had been bought by the Australian Government in Singapore. It would seem that members of the Australian Navy were sent to Singapore by the Royal Australian Navy to bring back to Australia three tugs which the Federal Government had bought from Singapore at a cost to Australian taxpayers of some $3m, presumably at $1m each. </PARA>
<PARA> In mid-October the following incredible saga took place. On their travels back to Australia one of the tug boats, named rather aptly HMAS Bandicoot, broke down when they were still three days out of Darwin. Because the pumps had gone down the crew was without water to drink, or to wash themselves. They then had a further major breakdown en route to Cairns. The tug required new parts. However, when the crew tried to get the necessary parts from the suppliers they were advised that that particular company had closed down. The ever resourceful crew, true to the traditions of the Australian Navy, managed to obtain parts from an alternative supplier and fixed the Bandicoot-HMAS Bandicoot-only to have the tug break down again, this time a couple of days out of Cairns. </PARA>
<PARA> I was duly informed that on this occasion the motor had been damaged beyond repair and the tug needed towing. Whilst in tow the rope snapped, which caused the wire to fly up and it nearly decapitated the crew. It was later discovered that there was 10 tonnes of diesel in the bilges. It goes on and on. I guess, in the few seconds remaining to me, I would like to pose the following questions. Where is HMAS Bandicoot now? What are its prospects for service? But, more importantly, who bought the damn thing and who is going to answer for it? I sincerely hope that at least our Public Accounts Committee will look into this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to report to the House the positive contribution which the Hawke Government has made in opening up opportunities for people with disabilities to play a more central part of life around them by being given effective models of job analysis, training and placement. It is important to note that one cannot bundle all people with disabilities under one category, nor assume that employment programs will open up horizons for them all. Diverse individual potentials require a diversity of options, and in this context I appreciated the tribute of the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) to Mr Jack Gibson.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since the introduction of the Disability Services Act (DSA) a range of services has developed whose primary goal is to obtain jobs in open employment for people with disabilities-not so-called disabled jobs, but jobs out in the open work force-where a person with disabilities, along with a provider, an assistant, who introduces them to the work place and enables them to feel at home in this new context, can be one of the so-called ordinary work force. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very aware of the work done by services such as Work Scope, Epic, Compass, Work Venture and the Red Cross in Brisbane, to name just a few, which have been developing programs, especially in the last three years. I am impressed by how active they have been in locating jobs and providing on-the-job training and support for people with disabilities. Indeed, I was proud to be able to represent the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) last year for the opening of Work Scope, an agency which uses the model of supported individual job programs. I also pay tribute to the Minister in charge of the House at the moment, the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services (Mr Baldwin). </PARA>
<PARA> I have seen how these changes under the DSA, which may seem unremarkable to many people in the community because they simply reflect things which are generally taken for granted, are, in fact, truly revolutionary. It is the very ordinariness, the very simplicity of the basis underlying the changes, which emphasises the revolutionary nature of the programs. It is that ordinariness which is the point. All Australians are being given the opportunity to live the lifestyle option of their choice, including working in the place of their choice. </PARA>
<PARA> The supported and open employment programs initiated under the Disability Services Act are, for a large number of people with disabilities, a diversity of new opportunities and experiences which were once unimagined. I welcome them. First, I welcome the opportunity for real work in the regular work force with the same working conditions as everyone else, not specially created disability jobs. Secondly, I welcome the opportunity to earn a fair award based or productivity based wage and to enjoy both the benefits of a weekly pay packet, with the increased economic independence that that brings, and real leisure, not simply an enforced whiling away of the time. Thirdly, people are given the opportunity to learn new skills, then the opportunity to demonstrate their enthusiasm and ability in the work place, which is vast. Even more significantly, they are given the opportunity to be free of the sheltered conformity of segregated factory style environments and to develop new relationships and make new friends with the wider range of people in the work place and the general community. </PARA>
<PARA> This is the reality that is happening because of legislation which has been passed in this House. It is one of the most effective and the most satisfying applications of legislation which I have been privileged to see. All this was best summed up by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) last year when he spoke at the inaugural Employer of the Year awards. He said that employment means `I can do it; I belong'. Employment says, `I have something to contribute. I can make a difference again'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to read a letter from the Chief Executive Officer of the City of Ballarat, Mr David Peile, to the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe). It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA>Re: COMMONWEALTH REHABILITATION SERVICE (BALLARAT UNIT)</PARA>
<PARA>206 DOVETON STREET SOUTH</PARA>
<PARA>It is with great concern that my council has asked that you be advised that despite a Planning Permit having been applied for and refused, the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service (Ballarat Unit) is proceeding with the development at the above address. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposal involves the relocation of a regional facility, which is currently and correctly located in a Commercial Zone, to a Residential Zone and involves substantial alterations to the existing residence to almost double in size. </PARA>
<PARA>A Permit application was made and was advertised in accordance with the Planning and Environment Act 1987 (Victoria) and was objected to by a number of nearby residents. The grounds of refusal were a totally inadequate provision for car parking and that the use is inappropriate in both its location and zoning. Despite being advised of rights of appeal it is now evident that construction is about to commence in total contradiction of the Planning Scheme requirements and Council's and residents' wishes. </PARA>
<PARA>While the Regional Manager is now attempting to hide behind the shield of the Crown, Council-</PARA>
<PARA>(a) believes that a High Court Case in Western Australia indicates that the Crown should be subject to the same statutory controls as other private entities engaged in the same activity;</PARA>
<PARA>(b) equity and fair play indicates that Council's decision having considered its statutory obligations and the merits of the proposal should be respected;</PARA>
<PARA>(c) there have been previous directions from the Prime Minister that local requirements are to be complied with. </PARA>
<PARA>Council therefore seeks your urgent co-operation in directing that all works should cease forthwith until the development referred to can either comply with the Planning Scheme Provisions or that a more suitable site can be obtained. </PARA>
<PARA>My concern is that the present building housing the rehabilitation service is, quite frankly, totally inadequate and must be expanded and relocated. But it must be relocated to a commercial zone and not a residential zone. The City of Ballarat has a tradition of making sensible planning scheme decisions. It has obviously looked at this in the same light as it has other planning applications. It is the view of the Council that this rehabilitation centre should not be relocated into this particular residential area. The problem is that the tenders have now been called and I ask the Minister to intervene as a matter of urgency. </PARA>
