<TITLE>Petition Against Government Funding of Abortions</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned Australian citizens shows that:</PARA>

<PARA>    About 98 percent of abortions in Australia are performed for non-medical reasons (see SA Health Commission statistics).</PARA>
<PARA>    Post abortion depression is a silent epidemic and is linked with the growing incidence of child abuse by mothers who have previously had abortions.</PARA>
<PARA>    The Australian Government should not fund the killing of future Australian citizens.</PARA>
<PARA>    Mothers with problem pregnancies need positive help to carry their babies to full term.</PARA>

<PARA>  We, the undersigned petitioners, reject the final report of the Brisbane Airport task Force, because it failed in its basic charter to "minimise the impact of aircraft noise on surround communities.</PARA>
<PARA>  It failed to recommend their own conclusions that an extended Cross Runway would "significantly reduce aircraft noise" and that an extended cross runway could operate as the "main or supplementary runway," which, along with the Main Runway would enable 80% or more planes to go in and out over Moreton Bay, as promised.</PARA>
<PARA>  Although it rejected these solutions because the cost would be $105 million, it recommended that a future Parallel Runway be built at a cost of $395 million (today's price) which could escalate to double or more in 15 to 20 years, thus forcing north and southside citizens to suffer increasing aircraft noise with no end in sight.</PARA>
<PARA>  We urgently request that money be made available for an extended Cross Runway as the most cost effective and practical solution to Brisbane Airport noise and safety.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I present the report, incorporating a dissenting report of the Committee, entitled Aboriginal and Islander Electoral Information Service together with a video recording and the minutes of proceedings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BI4">Mr MILES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-As well as presenting the Committee's report today, I have presented a video on the report produced by the Committee and the Parliament's Sound and Vision Office, specifically for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The video deals with those aspects of the report which address ways in which the Aboriginal and Islander Electoral Information Service could be improved to provide better service for those people. The Aboriginal and Islander Electoral Information Service, run by the Australian Electoral Commission, was set up to provide Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in traditional and remote communities with electoral information and education and to encourage their enrolment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  AIEIS differs from other similar programs which preceded it in that it gives responsibility for delivery of electoral information and education to Aboriginal and Islander people themselves. This is done by educating selected community members, called community electoral assistants, as resource people for their own communities. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Aboriginal Electoral Information Service was reviewed by the Australian National University's north Australia research unit in 1987-88. The report of that review--the NARU Report--was referred to the Committee of the thirty-fifth Parliament by Senator Robert Ray, then Minister for Home Affairs. It was referred with expanded terms of references to the Committee of the thirty-sixth Parliament by Senator Nick Bolkus, the Minister for Administrative Services. </PARA>
<PARA>  The work of the Committee has been greatly assisted by those who made submissions, particularly by the contributions of many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people with whom discussions were held in Canberra and during two site inspections in north Queensland and Western Australia. These site inspections were a critical source of information to the inquiry and gave the Committee the opportunity to meet members of Aboriginal and Islander communities and to talk with many people who are served by AIEIS and some of the community electoral assistants who work with AIEIS. The site inspections were undertaken so that the Committee could test out in the field the observations made in submissions. </PARA>
<PARA>  A primary question facing the Committee was whether there is a need for the service being provided. The inquiry has convinced the Committee that such a need does exist. As a group, Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders are electorally disadvantaged. Factors which contributed to this include a lack of general education, restricted access to general electoral education services offered by the AEC and remoteness of location. I think in this regard it is salutary to remember that compulsory enrolment for Aborigines was introduced only in 1983. It is for that reason that there is still a great need to provide assistance to many of the people in isolated areas. Eight years is a short period for people to come to grips with the details of the democratic process. Enrolment for the three levels of Government is confusing for many, let alone the intricacies of different voting systems. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee has therefore recommended that the program be continued. It has also recommended that the program's name be changed to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Electoral Information Service so as to reflect more accurately its target clientele. The objectives of the AIEIS program include both electoral education and enrolment. There has been, to date, a conflict of views within the AEC concerning the relative importance of these objectives. This conflict has affected relations between AIEIS officers and other AEC staff and, in part, hampered the efficient operation of the program. </PARA>
<PARA>  While the Committee certainly endorses the importance of enrolment, it believes that enrolment is only the first step and should be accompanied by education. Accordingly, the Committee has recommended that the Australian Electoral Commission formulate a clear policy giving priority to education and information in the AIEIS program. </PARA>
<PARA>  The conflict over the focus of the program is symptomatic of other problems faced by AIEIS. The Committee noted several deficiencies in the AEC's management of the program which is not conducive to the efficient and effective delivery of the service. AIEIS has been adversely affected by inadequate staffing, insufficient management commitment to the program, vague lines of authority and poor program evaluation. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee has made a comprehensive series of recommendations which address these concerns. These relate to the full and continuous staffing of the program; the demonstration by the AEC management of an appropriately supportive attitude to AIEIS; administrative changes which will establish clear lines of authority and control; and improvements to reporting and accountability mechanisms. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another matter of concern to the Committee is that because of its limited area of operation the AIEIS program is not reaching the majority of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. To ensure access to the service provided by AIEIS for all Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders, the Committee strongly recommends that the Aboriginal and Islander Electoral Information Service be extended to the States now not covered--that is, New South Wales and Victoria--and to urban areas, and that the AEC seek funding for this from the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee is pleased to be able to report that its inquiry has already resulted in some favourable outcomes in respect of the program's expansion. A submission to the Committee by ATSIC prompted the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner) to approach Senator Bolkus concerning the possibility of extending the program. At Senator Bolkus's request the AEC developed and has received budgetary approval for a proposal for an extension of the program and extra funding. Sufficient funding will now be available to employ at least two more field officers. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee would also like to see the program's scope expanded to include information on State and local government and the role of political parties and has made a recommendation to this effect. In moving around and talking to the Aboriginal people I found a tremendous amount of confusion, but also a great willingness on the part of many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders to participate in the democratic process. I must say that I have seen a marked change in the willingness of these Australians to participate in the democratic process from the time I was shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and I think we should encourage it as much as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>  Certain aspects of the way the program operates in the field could also be improved to make electoral information and education more accessible to people. The Committee has recommended that greater emphasis be placed on fostering wider community support for the program and developing greater community participation. Greater use should also be made of visual media such as videos, comics and T-shirts, as these have been identified by Aboriginal and Islander people as valuable educational aids. </PARA>
<PARA>  During the Committee's investigation it heard much about the role played by AIEIS in the conduct of the first ATSIC regional council elections held on 3 November 1990. Many regional returning officers and ATSIC officials told the Committee that AIEIS played a vital role in the success of those elections and that in fact polling could not have gone ahead in many places without the presence and dedication of AIEIS field officers and community electoral assistants. The information, education and enrolment functions of AIEIS were also crucial in preparing people for the elections. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Committee strongly believes that access to electoral information and education is a right of all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Only with the provision of such education and information will they become full participants in the government of this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  In addition, this inquiry impressed upon the Committee that, in places where AIEIS has operated well, there is among Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders a new enthusiasm for democratic processes and an eagerness to participate in them, both as electors and candidates. This has left the Committee in no doubt that the Aboriginal and Islander Electoral Information Service is a worthwhile program. </PARA>
<PARA>  Accordingly, it urges the AEC to address the problems identified in this report and to take steps to improve AIEIS so that it provides all Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders with an efficient and effective electoral information and education enrolment service. The report embodies the unanimous views of the subcommittee comprising myself, Senator Kernot and Senator Beahan. When the report was considered by the full Committee it ran into opposition from two members, Senator Kemp and the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), who have included a dissenting report, the differences being largely due, I believe, to the fact that the hearings and visits appropriately were completed not by the full Committee but by a subcommittee. I move:</PARA>

<PARA>  That this House:</PARA>
<PARA>(1)  having been appalled at the coup in the Soviet Union, congratulates the Soviet people and elected leaders, such as Mr Boris Yeltsin, for their amazing courage in standing against force of arms to resist a return to dictatorship;</PARA>
<PARA>(2)  urges Soviet leaders to continue the reform process which will give freedom and democracy to the Soviet people and a market economy which can maximise the economic potential of the Soviet Union to the benefit of all its people;</PARA>
<PARA>(3)  recognises the pain and stress involved in restructuring the Soviet political and economic systems and urges the West to actively support such change; and</PARA>
<PARA>(4)  further urges the Soviet leadership to free those republics, such as the Baltic States, which have been historically independent, were illegally incorporated and wish to return to the status of independent sovereign nations. </PARA>
<PARA>This notice was given on 22 August this year in the aftermath of the coup which all of us had watched with a great deal of concern, anguish and, of course, in the end with a great deal of pleasure and relief. We all had respect and admiration for the courage of people like Boris Yeltsin and the Soviet people who stood against the force of arms to resist a return to dictatorship. We saw the tanks on the streets; we saw the barricades that were erected; and we noted the tragic loss of life associated with those events. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have seen the pace of economic and political reform in the Soviet Union in the last few months accentuated recently by the radical progress in arms reduction which has been greater than many of us and many analysts could have hoped for as little as two years ago, particularly when we saw the way in which the Soviet Army was behaving, in the Baltic states, in particular, where they occupied with great ferocity so many of the public buildings and places with a view to enforcing the regime. </PARA>
<PARA>  At the time these events were taking place, I offered some words of caution, and I still do. The coup that we saw showed the fragility of the Soviet Union itself. It could have been successful, Mr Deputy Speaker. It was a matter of great concern that, with just a little more force and a little more ruthlessness, and if we had seen in cities like Moscow and Leningrad the same sense of purpose that the regime in China displayed in relation to taking people's lives and using troops hardened in warfare, it may well have been a different outcome. While communism has been abandoned, it is not yet certain, in my view, that democracy as we know it will or can prevail or that the process of reconstruction will not prove to be too awesome a task to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA>  These are some of the notes of caution that I think we have to display ourselves at this time as we watch events still unfolding. At the time of the coup that saw the Soviet Union teetering once again on the brink of totalitarianism, I raised the fear that we could be lulled into a false sense of security because it seemed that the coup had been so resoundingly crushed. I urged vigilance and continued concern. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are two reasons why it is more important now in the harsh reality of the aftermath of those events that we keep these matters in mind. The first is political. The coup attempt was clearly a watershed in the process that began with Gorbachev's accession to power. The leaders of the coup had previously supported the need for economic reform, but they faltered when it came to some of the major obstacles in that process: the growing challenge to the authority of the Communist Party represented by the rise of people such as Boris Yeltsin and the democratically elected mayors of Leningrad, now St Petersburg, and Moscow; and the apparent disintegration of the Soviet state, represented by the secessionist movements in the Baltic republics but also elsewhere in the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA>  The failure of the coup has left the forces of revision in disarray. It needs to be understood that some of the structures of power which they utilise to make their abortive bid still remain--the army and the KGB. The only one that seems to have been seriously attacked at this point in time is the Communist Party. Many of those structures of power are subject to the control of the office of the Mayor of Moscow, Gavriil Popov, and the office of the President of the Russian Federation, Boris Yeltsin. While this may make them appear more benign, the power structures remain. I think this should lead us to treat the situation with some caution. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is still government by decree and the newly formed Anti-Constitutional Activities Committee is consumed with purging government posts of the now banned Communist Party members. Democracy is unlikely to flourish where freedom of speech and association is still not permitted, even if it is by the enemy. Despite the impressive display of unity exhibited during the resistance to the coup, the new leaders have now to show some unity of purpose in grappling with the real dangers posed to their embryonic statehood. The economic crisis, social disorder, ethnic discontent and the national dissolution threaten to consume them before they have even begun the process of reform. </PARA>
<PARA>  In ethnic and political terms, turmoil rages in Central Asia. Protesters are in the streets of Tadzhikistan after the republic's communist dominated Parliament failed to meet opposition demands to replace the newly installed communist President. There is a vicious conflict in Azerbaijan over the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, which lies in the muslim Azerbaijan, but is also claimed by Christian Armenia. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are many new, emerging republics which contain ethnic minorities, and the challenge to each of them is to ensure that the rights of minorities are fully protected. The nationalities question long proved to be a thorn in the side of the old regime and its collapse will invariably mean that the long oppressed minorities will want to reclaim and assert their cultural identity in any new order. It must be assumed that there will be an increased potential for bitter conflict as a result. </PARA>
<PARA>  Surely the single most urgent problem facing the Soviet Union is in relation to its economy. Honourable members will recall that President Gorbachev and the republican leaders were about to sign a new union treaty ceding more control to the republics when the abortive coup was staged. Mr Gorbachev and Mr Yeltsin are now in the process of drawing up a new version of the treaty. All the republics recognise the need to maintain economic ties with Russia, even if they sever political links, and it is perhaps the only way that economic disaster can be averted. </PARA>
<PARA>  Respected economist Grigory Yavlinsky has drafted a 500-day plan which calls for a rapid lifting of price controls, a quick switch to private control of most industries and private individual property. Several of the republics have indicated that they will sign the treaty before October 15. </PARA>
<PARA>  These measures in themselves create enormous upheaval to which no obvious solution presents itself. The success of this radical plan is largely dependent upon ratification by Russia. As yet, Boris Yeltsin--there were some alarming suggestions that he had suffered recent bouts of illness; he is on holidays until later today--has not indicated whether or not Russia will support this move. The task of reconstruction will be made all the more difficult if a consensus cannot be reached on the future political structures and relationships within the new union. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Ukraine, a republic--a matter of some comment and a resolution that I hope to move on another General Business Thursday--has indicated that any political and economic union must not too closely bind it to the Russian Federation. The Ukraine's aspiration for independence is very clear. As a region which produces nearly a quarter of the Soviet Union's food and a quarter of its coal and is responsible for a fifth of its machinery and chemical industries, its role in the current economic and politic negotiations is crucial. It also has nuclear weapons on its territory, although I welcome the comments from its leadership that it would prefer to see those weapons removed. </PARA>
<PARA>  An economic and political treaty which provides for mutual cooperation between the republics is essential, but it is still a long term objective. In the meantime, the Soviet Union faces famine this winter and it has an external debt problem of quite significant proportions. The immediate crisis is still to be diverted, even with the provision of emergency aid by the United States, Japan and the European Community. Each of these states and units has pledged a total of something in the order of $A12 billion worth of food, medical supplies and aid to promote trade and economic activity and technical assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>  This week, over 10,000 delegates--economic officials and senior bankers--will be attending the annual conference of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to discuss, amongst other things, the Soviet Union's need for loans to meet repayments on an $82 billion foreign debt and a huge infusion of capital to convert to a market economy. Academic and financial experts estimate that the Soviet Union will need up to $251 billion over the next 10 years if it is to rescue its economy. I think that demonstrates the enormity of the task that faces the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA>  The problems of the Soviet debt will be further exacerbated because of the collapse of Soviet trade, a big fall in its oil output, the requirement to meet principal and interest repayments of over $10 billion this year, and the withdrawal of short term credit loans by commercial banks. On top of this, there are concerns as to whether the debt will be divided up amongst the constituent republics or treated as a whole. The industrial powers have yet to endorse Moscow's application for full membership of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which would allow the Soviets to borrow from organisations but with G7 backing. The IMF has created a special associate membership for the Soviet Union that will give it access to the Fund's technical expertise without, at this stage, entitling it to loans. The special access will allow Moscow to ask for technical assistance in budget planning, banking, management techniques and information in other fields needed to convert the former communist superpower into a free market economy. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, full membership of the IMF will require key economic data on the Soviet Union to be provided, something which has not been made available for decades. In full membership negotiations this data will have to made available, including information on the size of its gold reserves, before any assessment can be made of the quota of capital to which the Soviet Union would be entitled if it ever moved to full membership. Of course, provision of this data would prove testing for glasnost. The task ahead is daunting and there is no guarantee that it can be achieved. We have no choice but to support actively the change that will bring about democracy for the Soviet peoples and a market economy that can maximise its potential. </PARA>
<PARA>  The final part of this motion relates to the Baltic states and our desire to see their recognition. Happily, in the time that has elapsed since placing this motion on notice the Soviet Union has recognised the independence of the Baltic states. In the aftermath of the coup, Boris Yeltsin announced that the Soviet Federation recognised them as independent states and thus all but assured survival of the three new states as it triggered off a growing wave of international recognition. Australia belatedly recognised the Baltic states on 27 August. The Soviet Union recognised the independence of each of them on 6 September. The three states have since been admitted to the United Nations. The Soviet Union and Estonia reached an agreement in principle earlier this year that Soviet troops would be withdrawn. This accord is the first of its kind to lay down the specifics of a military pull-out from any of the three republics. It is believed that withdrawal could be completed within 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA>  There is great cause for optimism. However, like the Soviet Union, the Baltic states desperately require international assistance. Although the richest of the Soviet republics, their industrial base is still antiquated and in need of support. I could go on to discuss ways and means by which Australia can offer assistance. The Baltic states have problems with populations of minorities, and I think Australia could offer a good deal of advice, because of its own multicultural background, on ways and means of adjusting to this reality. We need also to assist with expertise to ameliorate the serious problems they face in reconstruction. We need to assist in training their work forces and developing trade relations. I certainly hope we can establish consular and full diplomatic relations, which will enable each of those new countries to relate fully to Australia. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It gives me great pleasure to second the motion, Mr Deputy Speaker. This is essentially a motion calling for the reform of the Soviet empire, its democratisation and its dissolution into nation states, and I support it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  My lifetime has witnessed the decline of many Europe-based imperial systems. In fact, I spent much of my youth in the capital of the largest--London--and hardly a year went by without the announcement of another province departing; usually a member of the royal family went and pulled down the flag. Hardly a year went by without reports of battles in distant lands as imperial forces tried to hang on or, more usually, tried to construct a post-imperial structure closer to London's liking. I would have to say that, in retrospect, the British Empire was dismantled in a tolerably civilised way by the historical standards of other empires, including those of the Dutch, the French and the Portuguese. And we are about to make an assessment of the costs of dismembering Moscow's empire. </PARA>
<PARA>  A considerable volume of literature is devoted to the rise and fall of empires, to such an extent that it is nowadays divided into theoretical and methodological categories, with people having different opinions and with controversies raging in academic journals. But the essential story on the rise and fall of empires appears to be this: a state emerges with the power, energy and ambition to dominate its neighbours; it establishes a regional or wider hegemony; it then grows flabby on the fruits of exploitation; its subject peoples revolt; and it then tries to find its way in the world with a lesser status in terms of prestige, power and wealth. This, I think, is what is happening with the Soviets. </PARA>
<PARA>  I first visited the Soviet Union in 1968, and then again in 1973. I would say that it was then at the apex of its imperial power and probably of its wealth, too. In 1979 I made the train journey from Khabarovsk to London, and got off at a number of places in the Soviet Union, including Moscow, where I spent some time at the state university. I must say that at the time the signs of decay were pretty unmistakable, and they had already occasioned widespread debates within the Western specialist literature of Sovietologists about the future of the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA>  This was not just idle academic speculation, because it emerged 10 years ago--that is, in the 1980 presidential election campaign in the United States--as the Republican strategy for defeating the Soviets without resorting to war. What the Republicans intended to do was confront the Soviet empire militarily, particularly on its edges, by supporting subject people's revolts; blockade the economy by depriving the Soviets of access to modern technology and Western capital; and confront them in an arms race in which, if the Soviets tried to match the United States, they would probably go broke. I must say that, whatever my reservations at the time might have been, the strategy worked. </PARA>
<PARA>  By the early 1980s, the Soviet empire in fact comprised three separate parts. The first was the Soviet state proper, which was autocratic, run by the nomenclatura, centrally planned, and had a population that appeared cowed and sullen and an economy that appeared stagnant. The second part was the satellite system that had been acquired, mostly in the 1940s by force majeur, mainly for security reasons and had been created into a system of mini-Stalinist states called the People's Democracies of Eastern Europe. The third component was the broader empire that had been acquired after 1950, in the Third World mostly, which was characterised by loose alliances, such as that with India; military marriages of convenience, such as those with Vietnam and Cuba; subsidised states which had grown up in Africa and the Middle East; and, by the early 1980s, the failing war of conquest in Afghanistan. </PARA>
<PARA>  When the Brezhnev dictatorship, which had lasted for nearly two decades, ended with his death in 1982, it was clear to most Western economic observers that the Soviet empire was overextended and facing decline. This was admitted by the Soviet leadership, however, only in March 1985 when Gorbachev came to power in the Kremlin. To his credit, between 1985 and 1989, Gorbachev undertook a number of reforms which made him Man of the Year in a number of Western places--including Time magazine--without, unfortunately for him, gaining him corresponding popularity status within his own imperial state. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, the reforms were to be welcomed and I think they should be remembered. He cut a number of arms control deals with the West--from his point of view, to save the Soviet budget. He withdrew the Soviet imperium from the Third World, cut subsidies to clients and slowed the massive transfers of Soviet arms to Third World clients--again to save money but with a corresponding benefit to the international system. The full effects of this withdrawal are still being worked out. I had the good fortune to attend the CPA conference in India a couple of weeks ago and it is quite clear that that country has been forced to cut its defence budget as a result of the changed relationship with the Soviet Union and is now having to relate to the IMF financial structure as a result of the absence of effective Soviet subsidies through trade relations. So the full effects of the withdrawal of the Soviet imperium are still being played out--in the Caribbean with Cuba, in South East Asia with Vietnam, in the Indian subcontinent particularly with India, and in the Middle East--and I think most of the effects will prove to be beneficial. </PARA>
<PARA>  In 1989, the Soviets encouraged an acceleration of the process of change and reform in the eastern European people's democracy, so-called, they being the second component of the imperial system. They hoped to see emerge more popular reformist-type socialist regimes, and they put up alternative communist candidates for leadership. But they had seriously underestimated the unpopularity of these mini-Stalinisms. They watched with dismay but, again to Gorbachev's credit, with inactivity as the communist system itself was everywhere swept aside. </PARA>
<PARA>  Domestically, coming back to the imperial state itself, Gorbachev had undertaken the two reforms of perestroika and glasnost with a view to reinvigorating political life and, more importantly, bumping up economic activity in the face of economic stagnation, which had by then been going on for nearly a decade. These reforms failed in the critical tests. Soviet economic output and per capita incomes did not go up with the Gorbachev inspired reforms; they actually declined. By 1990, the Gorbachev leadership faced the critical question of how to continue to reform the Soviet state proper--which was all they had left because it had been shed of its strategic and imperial ambitions. </PARA>
<PARA>  Unfortunately, the story now takes a bad turn. Gorbachev chose to lurch back to the hardliners in the nomenclatura. As I have noted in this chamber on a few occasions over the last year, Gorbachev reverted to repression. In the constituent national republics, notably the Baltic states, he used the world's diversion to the Gulf war to try to reconquer Lithuania and, during the same time, democratically elected politicians were again repressed. Shevardnadze said as much during his resignation speech of last year when he warned that Gorbachev was again reverting to the old hardliners in the nomenclatura, and the possibility of a coup had come into existence. Unfortunately for Gorbachev, however, the five years of reform that he had led were now too strongly in place for him to stop them and, as in the classic French cartoon, he was now shouting, `Wait for me, I'm your leader'. </PARA>
<PARA>  By mid-1991, the cutting edge of change had moved away from the Gorbachev forces, I believe, and had become the constituent national republics which were each demanding freedom from Moscow, which was now represented by Gorbachev. Gorbachev had become the defender of the system. It was, indeed, the proposal to cut a new federal deal by the Treaty of Union which triggered the coup, since the plotters viewed such a deal as a step from which the Soviet Union could not recover--and I think they were probably right. What they underestimated was their own incompetence, as the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) has quite rightly pointed out. </PARA>
<PARA>  Boris Yeltsin, during the abortive coup, symbolised the forces which defeated the coup of 19 to 21 August because by that stage he, in the democratisation of the political process, had displaced Gorbachev--not just because Gorbachev was detained in the Crimea but because Yeltsin was actually a popularly elected politician and because he was the leader of a proper state, the Russian Federation, and not of the Soviet imperial system. As this motion notes--and I agree with it entirely--he displayed enormous courage in confronting the armed forces that he did. At the time, he was not to know the outcome was to be as beneficial as it was, and I might note that so many citizens have come forward in the process of the democratisation of the communist system that one's faith in the basic integrity of human nature has been reasserted. </PARA>
<PARA>  The defeat of the coup has ensured the departure of nation based republics from the Soviet state, although I think the pace and degree of their departure will be determined by the degree to which they were integrated into the Soviet system. The three Baltic states got out pretty easily and pretty quickly, and I am delighted to say that Australia recognised them very early. </PARA>
<PARA>  I personally do not expect the Ukraine to be very far behind. It is a nation of over 50 million people which has been most cruelly treated by the Stalinist system. It has legitimate aspirations to independence which it has declared. It has a referendum coming up in December to ratify this, and as soon as the result is known and the Ukraine meets the formal legal requirements of defined boundaries, a clear population, a government in control, and one capable of undertaking foreign relations, then I for one will be urging the Australian Government to recognise it as soon as possible and to establish diplomatic and trading relations with the Ukraine. </PARA>
<PARA>  The future of the other states, I think, is more difficult to anticipate, and I concur with some of the remarks made by the honourable member for Dundas. It should be borne in mind that the decolonisation processes involved with other European imperial systems have also created difficulties, both in the former colonies and in the former imperial society. I do not believe Australia has fully recovered from its presence in the British imperial system, and the British themselves, 50 years after making the decision to decolonise, are still sending members of the royal family to far-flung places to pull down the flag. </PARA>
<PARA>  Armenia and Azerbaijan, as the honourable member for Dundas has pointed out, have problems of enclaves and territorial difficulties. The five muslim states of Central Asia will have difficulty moving out of the Soviet system because of their low level of economic development and their integration, particularly in the energy distribution system. Moldavia may choose to join with Romania, and Georgia obviously has difficulties with its internal political process, which is leading to civil conflict. I think the Russian Federation under Yeltsin is destined to go its own way eventually, and I hope it does so without traditional Russian-style hegemonic ambitions with respect to its neighbours. This motion rightly congratulates the defeat of the coup, and I support it. </PARA>
<PARA>  I mention three short term difficulties to which I think we ought to pay some attention. First, the huge arsenal that was built up by the Soviet system, which is by and large now surplus to requirements, needs to be looked at very carefully, particularly its nuclear component. I am delighted not only that President Bush made an offer of very rapid demobilisation of nuclear strategic arsenals mutually but also that the Soviet Government quickly acceded to this in a very positive way. Secondly, we should support, I believe, the orderly departure of nations such as the Ukraine from the Soviet state and establish diplomatic and trading relations with them as soon as it becomes possible. </PARA>
<PARA>  Thirdly, we should note that the people, particularly of the Russian Federation, have absolutely no experience whatsoever in the operation of a democratic political system or a free-market economic system, both of which they are trying to establish. As a result, I believe it will be incumbent on the West, for good reasons of strategic self-interest, to provide financial and economic assistance while the Russian Federation in particular makes the transition from its past imperial system to a democratic and market oriented economic and political situation. That is going to encounter obstacles, and economic assistance will ease them through these. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am delighted to note this week that the G7 group of leading industrial nations is putting together a $9 billion economic assistance package. At the Japanese Embassy last night I was assured that the Japanese will be putting up $2.5 billion towards this without any preconditions and without any notice being taken of the claims they make on the famous four islands. This is in recognition of the overall need for the West to ease the transition of the Soviet state from its previous imperial status to one of an ordinary country with which we can all do business in an equitable and friendly manner. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe that we in Australia should be prepared, whatever difficulties we may see ourselves as having economically--and they pale into insignificance compared with the countries we are talking about this morning--to provide whatever assistance we can. Last year we agreed to contribute to the European Bank for reconstruction in eastern Europe. I think things have moved much more quickly since then. The situation is now better and, in some ways, more desperate. The kind of assistance that West Germany gave to East Germany to produce the unified German state is not likely to be available to many of the other territories of the former Soviet imperial system. We have a strategic self-interest in ensuring that this transition is made as easily as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>  I point out that the break-up of the Soviet empire is likely to present new challenges to Australia as agricultural economies such as the Ukraine, the Soviet Union and to some degree India, which have been stifled by their planning system in the past, are likely to become much more productive under a free market system and we are going to have to compete with their products on the international marketplace. Compared with the opportunities and beneficial effects of this change, I believe the economic competition that is going to be offered is of marginal importance. </PARA>
<PARA>  The strategic threat of the last 40 years of generalised and even nuclear war has now been greatly reduced, and democracy has spread to another half billion human beings. I commend this motion, and it gives me great pleasure to have seconded it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am pleased to support this motion before the House today. It is a great opportunity which we as an Australian Parliament have to express our views on matters such as this. This motion was brought into the House on 22 August by the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock)--about three days after the coup attempt occurred. It shows the sort of initiative which he has taken in this regard and his interest in these matters. His initiative has given us an opportunity to debate a topic in a bipartisan way. It is a great opportunity for Australia to express its profound feelings about the fact that the coup was not completed and did not take hold. I think that is something which we as Australians, who live in a territory which has not known any substantial disturbance, do not appreciate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I would like to highlight a few points which are outlined in the motion before the House. Firstly, I would like to dwell on the amazing courage of Boris Yeltsin, which has been mentioned in the motion. Before I do that it would be interesting to look at his background. It fleshes out and gives us a little more appreciation of the nature of the man whom we see as a figure looming very large in the Russian republic. We trust that his health will stand up and that he will continue to be a force for freedom and democracy in that part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA>  Boris Yeltsin has been hailed as a would-be dictator by his enemies and the only true democrat by his friends. He started his life as a gang fighter in the Urals. He got good marks at school in everything except discipline; he got a teacher dismissed for making the pupils bring food for her pig, and he faced up to men who claimed they had the army and the KGB behind them. He was a very strong willed character very early on in life. Obviously, that strength of backbone and the fact that he was a person of independent thought has served the Russian people very well in 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>  Further, we find that basically he had a pretty rough childhood, breaking his nose in one of the many gang fights and losing two fingers when he hit a stolen grenade with a hammer. I am not sure whether he was worried about the same reaction when he decided to stand up to the Soviet Union tanks when they rumbled towards the Russian Parliament in August. Nevertheless, after surviving a grenade attack initiated by himself, we find that as a teenager he threw himself into sport and became a women's volleyball coach before settling down as a civil engineer. </PARA>
<PARA>  That is a very sketchy background to this man whom we now look upon and admire for his amazing courage. The motion is quite right in congratulating him for his amazing courage. We have to recognise that there had been 70 years of an authoritarian, repressive, dictatorial, inhumane system in the Soviet Union and that it had not effectively been broken. On 19 August a coup occurred. The democratically elected President of the Russian republic had to make a choice. Was he going to go forward with his desire for freedom and stand up for democracy or would he have to buckle under?</PARA>
<PARA>  When we remember some of the history of how repressive that regime has been in the Soviet Union, recognising that that system literally starved millions of its own people down in Georgia and the Ukraine at one stage, apart from many other aspects which we know only too well, we admire Boris Yeltsin because he did have the courage to stand up and take on the instigators of the coup. There was one TV program which I vividly remember and in which Yeltsin was standing up and he gave all the body language that, come what may, he was not going to be moved. It was that sort of courage which many of us will remember him for, no matter what his contribution is going to be in the future. </PARA>
<PARA>  It does take tremendous courage in those circumstances, when one's parliament is surrounded by tanks and by people who are willing and ready and have others behind them in another political system ready to give the order to fire and to use their military might to bring down a fledgling democratic system, to stand up to them.  As members of parliament, we should admire the courage shown to us by Boris Yeltsin in this coup. </PARA>
<PARA>  The second part of the motion expresses the hope that there will be a continuing process for freedom and democracy. That is something which we take for granted. Yet, the Soviet Union, which comprises a large surface area of the world--whether we can call it an individual unit is hard to say--has not experienced that sort of freedom for 70 years, has not experienced what it means to go through elections, and in many respects probably does not have the skills nor the resources to handle the freedom which is now available to its people.  We certainly wish the Russian people well in that fledgling start to experiencing true democracy and freedom. It  will be an experience which will go on for many generations. </PARA>
<PARA>  Why do we say this? I believe we say it because we as Australians and as members of an Australian parliament believe that individual people, by experiencing freedom and democracy, get the greatest sense of fulfilment for their own personal lives and for the community in which they live. That is why we believe in freedom and democracy, because it brings a sense of self-fulfilment, self-esteem, of being in the community, of working through ideas together, rather than feeling dominated by people in positions of power. Instead of being spectators or people cringing on the edge of life, people in a democracy are able to be participators. It is this process which is now becoming available to the Soviet people, and all Australians should encourage and do everything within their power to assist those people to reach the fulfilment which we experience in this great country. </PARA>
<PARA>  The third point in the motion is about the pain and stress which will be involved in restructuring the Soviet Union. Indeed, there will be immense pain and immense stress. We only have to think about the social changes which will occur during that process--that an archaic system is being changed into a modern one; that people will realise now that they are not going to be chased at night by secret police and that that fear can be removed. But for many people in Russia that fear is etched on their minds, and it will take years for them to change their attitudes and behaviour into positive attitudes and to begin feeling and experiencing what genuine freedom is all about. It is not something that can happen overnight. We ought not, as the West, expect that technological changes, industrial relations changes, social changes and democratic changes can take place overnight. We need to be patient, we need to be encouraging and we need to be sympathetic to the processes and the difficulties and stresses which will occur. I have great pleasure in supporting the motion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I also wish to support the motion. In so doing, however, there are some emphases I would like to make which are missing from the motion. It is all very well for us to urge various things on the Soviet leaders and on the Soviet people. I join others in congratulating leaders such as Mr Boris Yeltsin on their courage in opposing the coup. It would have been fine if there had been some recognition in this motion of some of the responsibility of the West for its failures with respect to the Soviet Union.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In particular, I will refer to what is almost universally accepted as having brought on the coup--the failure of the West to give any significant aid to President Gorbachev when he went to the meeting of the G7. He put the case very clearly and said, `Look, the situation in the Soviet Union is very serious. There are conservatives who are trying to bring back the old regime. It is essential for us to do something, and I appeal to you to give us that assistance'. Unfortunately President Gorbachev got very little assistance; in fact, he was sent packing and told to go off and bring in more reforms. As a result, the conservatives in the Soviet Union were able to rally their forces and managed to achieve the coup. </PARA>
<PARA>  Fortunately, not only for the Soviet Union but for the whole world, the coup was defeated. I say `fortunately' because one can imagine what might have happened if it had continued and succeeded. In terms of world events what would have happened is almost too difficult to contemplate. A dictatorship of the kind proposed by the coup leaders--if they had the power to impose it--would have resulted in the Soviet Union immediately breaking up into individual republics. We would have had wars everywhere, we would have had attacks on the Baltic states, we would have had crises with the West and we would have had crises in the Third World. It is quite clear in some respects that we do not quite recognise the enormity of events which occurred in terms of the overthrow of that coup. </PARA>
<PARA>  One writer said that he remembers the 1917 revolution being described as the 10 days that shook the world. In some respects the occurrence of the Soviet coup and the overthrow of that coup I believe will be recorded in history as of similar significance in terms of the direction taken by the Soviet peoples and the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will now refer to the second aspect of the motion; that is, encouraging the move towards freedom, democracy and a market economy. Before the coup President Gorbachev was encouraging all of those things. It is all right to encourage those things in theoretical terms and say that this is what is needed. Indeed, there were significant moves towards more freedom through the concept of glasnost, more political participation, and there were some moves towards a market economy. </PARA>
<PARA>  Essentially, the problem faced by the Soviet Union, and indeed the problem it continues to face, is this: how does one transform a huge confederation of states such as the Soviet Union into a market economy? That is easy to say, but if we ask people how this is to be done in terms of either a general theory or a practice, it is a much more difficult situation. While people in the West were urging this transformation, very few were prepared to put down a blueprint as to how that should be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA>  If we look at what has happened with the economies of eastern Europe that have tried to achieve this transformation, we see that very often they have made a stab in the dark. Each of them has tried different ways of achieving this transformation; I do not think any of them have been overwhelmingly successful. Some have put themselves in very difficult positions, such as Poland, which has difficulties with its economy. </PARA>
<PARA>  So it is one thing to say that this transformation should take place; it is another to work out and secure ways in which it should take place. I do not say that this is entirely a responsibility of the West. It is also a responsibility of the thinkers, theoreticians and planners in the Soviet Union. On that score, there is no doubt that they failed dismally. Let us hope that a restructuring of the Soviet economy will be achieved in a quick way and that it will be done in accordance with some blueprint that makes sense. </PARA>
<PARA>  The challenge for the Soviet peoples and the Soviet Union is more than that. At the same time as it is trying to effect this transformation, it has to work out the correct formula in relation to the nationalist ambitions of the various peoples and states that constitute the current Soviet Union. As everyone is aware, a large number of those states now want to be independent nations. This is true of the Ukraine, it is true of Georgia, it is true of a number of others. The question then is: what sort of political structure can there be that somehow keeps a confederation or unity of the Soviet Union and yet allows self-determination and independent nationhood for these countries that wish to have it?</PARA>
<PARA>  These are some of the biggest problems facing the modern world in terms of international relations. It is interesting that while many of us in the West wish for some peaceful outcome, an outcome that somehow keeps together the Soviet Union but also allows for independent states, we have not been too forthcoming with formulas as to how this should take place. I do not know, from the reading I have done and from the studies that are coming out of various institutes around the world, including institutes of international relations, whether much advice has been given to President Gorbachev, for example, about how this is to be done. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Soviet peoples have had to face one crisis after another: the transformation of the old Stalinist system, the transformation of the economy, and now the question of how to have a confederation of states that on the one hand are independent countries to a considerable degree and on the other hand are able to work together. These are the challenges being faced in the Soviet Union at the moment. They are momentous challenges not only for the Soviet peoples but also for the world. If they are not achieved properly, there will be a lot of strife. One issue in relation to achieving this is the protection of the minorities in each of those states. If there are going to be independent states, there will be minorities in each of them. It is not enough for the international community to say, `This is an internal matter'. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Like the other participants from both sides of the chamber in this debate, I begin my remarks by congratulating the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) on his initiative in putting this notice of a motion on the Notice Paper and for giving the Australian Parliament the chance to express its support for the great changes that are going on today in the Soviet Union. I see these great social and economic changes as fundamentally and essentially being a quest for freedom. The upheaval in the Eastern bloc is all about the peoples of those nations and their quest for freedom. I think that once again it demonstrates that one can brutally suppress the human spirit for decades, but one can never truly extinguish it. I believe that is the case because the essence of man, woman and humankind is the quest to be free. To flow on from that, the human quest for all of us is to live in a society of free people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  From my political beliefs, I do not think one can go past the statement of that great nineteenth century British philosopher, John Stuart Mill. To paraphrase the essential political statement about personal and political freedom that he put down in the treatise on Liberty, he said that people should be free to do whatever they want to do providing it does not adversely affect or interfere with anybody else doing exactly the same. For me, that has always been my fundamental tenet in politics when addressing questions of personal and political freedom. In a bipartisan sense, that is why we are supporting this motion. </PARA>
<PARA>  Looking at its first proposition, we were appalled at the coup in the Soviet Union. We congratulate the Soviet people and their elected leaders, such as Mr Boris Yeltsin, for their amazing courage in standing against the force of arms to resist a return to dictatorship in that country. </PARA>
<PARA>  Looking at the second part of the motion, we also urge the Soviet leaders to continue the reform process which will give freedom and democracy to the Soviet people. I do not think one can go past Churchill when considering democracy. Democracy is not perfect; nothing that humankind can devise is perfect. To paraphrase Churchill, he said, curiously, that democracy is the worst system known to man but for all the rest. It is a curious way to talk. Basically, he was recognising the fact that democracy is not perfect, but compared with every other political system yet devised by mankind, it is far superior. </PARA>
<PARA>  We should always remember, when we take for granted the democratic system under which we live in this country, that the fundamental right of all of us is that on a regular periodic basis we can come together and choose who are to form our governments. There are no tanks rolling down the street; there are no Molotov cocktails being thrown in suburban lounge rooms; no-one gets killed; no-one is incarcerated. </PARA>
<PARA>  For my money communism or Marxism, or the practical application of it over the last 70 or 80 years, has been one of the cruelest hoaxes. It has been one of the greatest outrages and it has been one of the most profound tragedies of the twentieth century. It has led to millions of people living in conditions of economic servitude and millions more living in actual incarceration and slavery. It has led to the death of yet millions again under those systems. If one goes back to the fundamental Marxist theory--because theory is all it ever was--Marx predicted the so-called withering away of the state instruments of Government with free men supposedly thereafter living in a system of communal fraternity. </PARA>
<PARA>  I say it was a cruel hoax from the beginning because, like any other millenarian movement, many of them religious-based promising heaven on earth, no such thing was ever envisaged in a practical sense--never mind the excesses of so-called Stalinism. One of the most fascinating things arising out of the changes in the Soviet Union is that documentary evidence is now coming to light that even Lenin never, ever pretended to believe in such nonsense; that, from the beginning, Lenin had in mind the prospect of establishing cynically a totalitarian government by the elite over the masses. Millions have been deprived, downtrodden; they, so labelled by the theorists as the proletarian masses, were seduced--if not duped--by the belief that their position could be improved through a false concept of a class war. Those who were not duped or seduced were bludgeoned into submission or eliminated. </PARA>
<PARA>  This so-called theoretical concept of communism or Marxism has been one of the most profound tragedies of history. It is tremendously encouraging for all of us to see the peoples of the Eastern bloc, who have been subjugated under that system for the last 70-odd years, now throwing it off, and throwing it off so comprehensively. </PARA>
<PARA>  In this motion we urge the Soviet leaders to continue to work towards a market economy which can maximise the economic potential of the Soviet Union to the benefit of all its people. Like democracy, free markets are not perfect, either. Free enterprise is not perfect; it is just that it achieves better outcomes than any other economic system devised by mankind. </PARA>
<PARA>  We should look at the comparisons over the last 50-odd years. Despite all of the anti-United States propaganda that we hear from time to time, look at how the United States economy and the outcomes it has been able to achieve for the vast majority of its people compare with those of the Soviet economy. There is absolutely no comparison. This comparison comes into even sharper relief when one compares the West German economy with the East German economy. Both sides of this nation emerged from World War II in an absolutely appalling condition. Yet over the last 50 years there have been completely different outcomes due to completely different systems. The free market economies have won out every time, hands down. </PARA>
<PARA>  The third part of this motion recognises the pain and stress that will be involved in the restructuring of the communist countries of eastern Europe. I agree with the honourable</PARA>
<PARA>member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous): unless we support them, we cannot just optimistically and enthusiastically talk about the changes that these people are moving towards. They will require financial and economic assistance, and social and economic expertise. That is why this motion is bipartisan. Look at what is now being achieved in East Germany because of the support of the old West Germany. These countries are in a unique position. They have come together as one new Germany. Not every country has the same opportunity. But we in the West will have to support the Eastern bloc as the countries come to grips with these changes in their quest for economic and social freedom. </PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, this motion urges the Soviet leadership to free those republics that have been under the Soviet bloc since World War II. I have said that I believe the essence of mankind is its quest for freedom. The logical extension of that is for mankind to freely associate as a race or as an ethnic group, as an historical nation, in that modern concept that we know as a nation state. </PARA>
<PARA>  I certainly support that last request in this motion. These changes must continue, not only in the Eastern bloc but also in Asia, in Africa and in South America. Hopefully, when they do we can look forward to the world being not only a freer and better place for all of its citizens, but also a much safer one as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-As I sat in my office considering what I would say in relation to this motion currently before the House, the first thought that came to me was the absolute consistency of the old adage, `The glorious uncertainty of politics'. As we have seen recently, both at home and abroad, political climates can change with almost obscene haste. Political icons can be torn down in the twinkling of an eye, and seemingly impossible political scenarios can become a reality virtually overnight. Even so, the changes that have taken place in the USSR over the past few months are of breathtakingly enormous proportions. Such has been the incredible haste of the pace of change in the ex-communist monolith that part (4) of the excellent motion of the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) is now semi-redundant, despite the fact that notice of the motion was given on only 22 August.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I refer to the long awaited and lifelong dream for many Baltic states refugees who fled to Australia in the wake of the shameful German-Soviet annexation--the granting of independence to Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. Notwithstanding this fact, the motion of the honourable member for Dundas deserves wholehearted support in this House. It is a motion which registers our disgust at the reactionary coup that could have hurled the world back into the Cold War had not the Soviet people and leaders such as Boris Yeltsin risked all for the new order. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is also a motion which offers encouragement to the various Soviet leaders to continue the now inevitable push to a market economy, which recognises the stresses and strains which will be felt by the Soviet people during the difficult restructuring process. At the present time, as the coup euphoria dies and the realisation of the hard slog ahead sets in, those are important points which need to be seen to be coming from the West. </PARA>
<PARA>  Although the honourable member for Dundas has not specifically mentioned it, I believe that he has meant to include the majority of the Soviet armed forces in the congratulatory first point of his motion. Obviously, without the support of the Soviet officer corps and their men, the coup would not have been halted and the world would now be mourning another Tiananmen Square-style communist massacre. </PARA>
<PARA>  When one considers the hitherto privileged position of the armed forces in the old communist USSR, the restraint and social responsibility exhibited by the army during the latter stages of the coup was an incredible phenomenon. It was a response which showed in dynamic terms that the flame of freedom, when allowed to flicker, is an incredibly difficult force to extinguish. Although many mocked him for being too slow and too careful, Mikhail Gorbachev deserves much of the credit for the existence of that flame--mainly through his glasnost and perestroika programs. That Gorbachev was criticised for the slow pace of reform and yet faced the reactionary coup demonstrates the enormity of the challenge which he faced all along. </PARA>
<PARA>  The fact is that almost all of us saw the coup coming, such was the discomfort being felt by the Kremlin godfathers. How many of us, however, could visualise the dramatic events of the last night of the coup when the perpetrators bundled themselves into their black limousines to seek their President's forgiveness--a truly amazing occurrence, followed by an even more amazing chain of events in the next few months. It is this chain of latter events which should not be forgotten in our consideration of this motion. </PARA>
<PARA>  As honourable members will appreciate, we are now watching the unravelling of more than 70 years worth of shonky deals and outright land grabs in central and eastern Europe. The threat of a nuclear holocaust may have receded very sharply with this process, begun by the de-Stalinisation of Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, the overthrow of Ceaucescu in Romania, and the reunification of Germany. </PARA>
<PARA>  The threat of less total conflict, however, has not necessarily gone away. Europe is a hotbed of ancient ethnic rivalries, which in many cases have been fuelled by the ravages of war and the arbitrary imposition of national boundaries. The break-up of Yugoslavia stands as an excellent and horrific example of the possible ramifications of the unleashing of those pent up ethnic frustrations. In the power vacuum which has been created by the failure of the coup in the USSR, there has occurred a natural realignment of political strengths along ethnic lines. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the earlier post-war days there was some discussion of the changing of national boundaries, and ethnically based republics were faced with the actual possibility of walking away as independent states. Although much of this earlier emotive talk seems to have settled down, it now must be recognised that the USSR is still in a state of considerable flux. On 24 August the Ukraine announced its decision to operate as an independent state and several other republics are considering their options. </PARA>
<PARA>  To add to the confusion, there is considerable doubt as to the status and role of the central government and the President, Mr Gorbachev, himself. Although those matters will no doubt be sorted out in time, a great deal of goodwill is going to be necessary from all sides. The various players in the USSR will need to understand that, with each defection from the fold, the combined economic might of the United States will be reduced, and this must have strong ramifications on the union's ability to remain as a world superpower. </PARA>
<PARA>  For the West, there are also many and varied challenges. We will need to reward a region that is breaking from its horrific past by ensuring that the progress of reform is given every chance to succeed.  The West will need to be careful that it is not overly harsh in its judgment of the speed of reform, nor too easy in its help so that reform is unnecessarily delayed. Above all else, however remote the possibility, the West must ensure that it does not exacerbate ethnic tensions nor encourage the last vestiges of reactionism to have one last tilt at the reins of power. The honourable member for Dundas has moved a motion that is worthy of bipartisan support in this House. It is an appropriate motion for a most important occurrence in the scheme of things, and I therefore recommend it to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  That this House commend to the Government the introduction of a scheme modelled on the British tax exempt special savings account in order to facilitate both the growth of domestic savings and the encouragement of Australian investment in Australian domestic industry. </PARA>
<PARA>In the financial statement and Budget report of 1990-91 the then British Chancellor of the Exchequer, John Major, introduced into Britain a novel innovation called tax exempt special savings accounts. They were explained in paragraph 4.08 of his Budget statement in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA>Savings</PARA>
<PARA>Tax Exempt Special Savings Accounts will be introduced from 1 January 1991. Individuals will be able to deposit up to #9000 over a five year period. In the first year up to #3000 may be deposited and in subsequent years #1800 (#150 a month), subject to the overall limit. Provided no withdrawal of capital is made during the five years, the interest will be totally exempt from tax. There will be an option to withdraw some interest as it arises, but if capital is withdrawn early, then all the interest will be subject to tax. </PARA>
<PARA>Subsequent to the announcement in the Budget, the tax exempt special savings account scheme was introduced and the British Government published information document IR114 entitled TESSA: Tax Free Interest for Taxpayers. This sets out the key points of the scheme that is now operating, and I will go through the key points one by one so that what is a quite novel idea is explained to the House. </PARA>
<PARA>  Taxpayers are limited to one account. A person can open only one account with either a bank or a building society. No person can hold more than one TESSA account at a time. Husbands and wives can each open separate accounts; one account is held per taxpayer. As the Chancellor said in his Budget Speech, a person can deposit to a maximum of #9,000 over five years--#3,000 in the first year and #1,800 in the second and subsequent years, to the #9,000 maximum. </PARA>
<PARA>  One cannot retain tax exempt status if there is any withdrawal of capital. The scheme envisages access to interest under some circumstances during the period in which funds are held in a TESSA account. However, once capital is touched the special tax exempt status falls away and the account is held simply as an ordinary bank account. </PARA>
<PARA>  The accumulated funds are held tax free at the end of five years. The information brochure gives a number of examples explaining how the system will operate and the like. Later in my speech I will go through examples of tax accounts now operated by various banks and building societies and the kinds of financial benefits that flow to investors in these portfolios. </PARA>
<PARA>  The tax exempt status is preserved on death. I think the important point in terms of arguments about intervention in markets and the like is that the TESSA scheme is market driven. It depends on the economics of the investment industry where funds will be invested. Building societies and banks determine the rate of interest payable, how often the interest will be credited and whether the interest rate will be fixed or variable. In practice, there has been a scramble to invest in TESSA accounts. John Major, in introducing this scheme, called it an opportunity to revive the culture of thrift and to do something about the low domestic rate of savings. </PARA>
<PARA>  In Australia we have the same need to accumulate greater national savings to back up what we would hope would be more investment in our infrastructure and industry. There is a secondary reason, other than the increasing accumulation of savings, which in itself is important. There is also the question of equity, particularly equity for the small wealth holder. At the moment, different forms of holdings of wealth are differentially treated. For example, if one is very wealthy and is able to invest in land or property, to an extent one's wealth holdings are sheltered because even under the capital gains system one is taxed only on the post-inflation earnings. In other words, one discounts the capital gains for inflation and the gain is taxed only after that. The small wealth holder who has $5,000 or $7,000 in a bank pays tax on every dollar of the interest. There is no deduction for the inroads of inflation. So there is a corrosive and unfair difference between the two forms of wealth holding. </PARA>
<PARA>  When we take out the things that are politically unacceptable to deal with, we see that the level playing field is even more distorted. Of course, the one area that is peculiarly exempt, even from capital gains tax, is the family home. I am not suggesting in any way that something should be done about that, but because the family home is tax exempt and because that is where many substantial wealth holders put most of their wealth, the distortions and differences in the tax treatment of small wealth holders and large wealth holders are exaggerated. TESSA is a way of addressing this problem. </PARA>
<PARA>  Most economists would say that there is a real and proper requirement, on a horizontal equity basis, to treat savings in a more appropriate way. It would be too costly to index savings across the board. That is the reason why governments and oppositions have not put that up. If it is costed out, it is seen to be extremely expensive. The equity principle is accepted, but the cost measure is too difficult. The TESSA scheme, however, is beautifully targeted because of its cap of #9,000--translated to Australian dollar terms, its cap of $30,000, similarly structured, might be appropriate--protects the equity interests of small wealth holders and at the same time increases national savings. </PARA>
<PARA>  Has this scheme worked? Certainly it has. In Great Britain there has been a flow of investment funds into TESSA accounts. Rates in those accounts are very competitive. Vivien Goldsmith, the money editor of the Independent on Sunday, said in an article of 20 January 1991:</PARA>
<PARA>The TESSA scramble for funds is sending the rates sky high. It has been very popular. </PARA>
<PARA>Lindsay Cook, an author in the Guardian, said:</PARA>
<PARA>As Tessamania continues, several institutions have this week improved their tax-free accounts or introduced new ones. </PARA>
<PARA>If we go through the press clippings from Britain we can see the comments of financial analysts looking at the various maturity values of TESSA accounts. For example, an investment of #9,000 over five years in, for instance, the Cheltenham and Gloucester Maxi account would mature at a value of #15,153. That is a very substantial gain when we consider that the base capital investment is #9,000 and that the money accumulated is interest free. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am suggesting also that we should be able to consider as a gloss, perhaps, integrating the TESSA scheme with the model Canada has adopted. In Canada, superannuation and investment funds are directed that, if they invest overseas, they have to reinvest a certain component of their funds in commercialising research and development and in small and medium size business in their own country. I am not arguing that institutions should not be left to invest as they see fit, but I do think a proper gloss on this to direct it to targeted investment which will help Australia's industry infrastructure would be appropriate. That would mean adopting an approach, with the flood of money that would go in, which would say that, if fund managers are going to invest, say, 25 per cent of that money offshore, they have an obligation to put at least one per cent or 2 per cent into fund-managed accounts that go towards Australian small business and commercialisation of research and development, where we singularly lack capital and where every effort to attract it has to date been futile. </PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, I do not run away from a good idea, from whatever source it comes. The source of this is the British Conservative Government of John Major--the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, now the British Prime Minister. I believe that the devil sometimes does sing very good songs and I am not prepared to block my ears to them. I believe that this is a creditable and sensible solution. I commend it to the Ministry and members of this House to consider. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) knows my antecedents. I found his final comments interesting but he knows that, given my antecedents, I am going to oppose his motion. I think we should be clear what the motion states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>That this House commend to the Government the introduction of a scheme modelled on the British tax exempt special savings account in order to facilitate both the growth of domestic savings and the encouragement of Australian investment in Australian domestic industry. </PARA>
<PARA>  I accept that the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) has put forward this motion with very good intentions, obviously to try to help the savings situation which we all know is not particularly good. As it happens, we serve together on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. We were in Queensland last week and we discussed this matter briefly en route from point A to point B. I know that the honourable member for Denison was a little surprised when I told him that I was going to oppose his motion. The point that I make up front is that, however well intentioned and well motivated, we have to look at the practicalities and the down side of some of these specially directed initiatives from government. I want to look briefly at the detail of the scheme, explain why I believe that it is not relevant for the Australian situation, and suggest what I think should be done to attack this particular area of concern. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us look at the scheme. I have a copy of the legislation and the regulations from the United Kingdom on the tax exempt special savings accounts, which are known, obviously from the initial letters, as TESSAs. The object of the scheme is set out as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Tax-Exempt Special Savings Accounts (TESSAs) have been introduced from 1 January 1991. Provided certain conditions are met, any interest or bonus payable on such accounts is exempt from income tax. The relief aims to encourage the savings habit, particularly among small investors, and to boost longer-term savings. It is also designed to help non-taxpayers, such as many married women, who under the composite rate tax system before 1991-92 could not reclaim tax accounted for by banks and building societies on their deposit accounts. </PARA>
<PARA>The way that this scheme is meant to operate is as follows: any interest or bonus payable on a deposit account for a period when it is a TESSA is disregarded for all income tax purposes. To be a TESSA an account must satisfy a number of conditions--it must be with a building society or an institution authorised under the Banking Act; it must be identified as a separate TESSA account; it must not be a joint account; it must not be held on behalf of another person; it must not be connected with any other account held by the account holder or any other person; it must be transferable from one society or institution to another; and the account holder must not simultaneously hold another TESSA. An account continues to be a TESSA for five years from the day of its opening or until the account holder's earlier death. A TESSA ceases to be such, firstly, if more than #3,000 is deposited in the TESSA's first 12 months, or more than #1,800 in any of the succeeding periods of 12 months, or more than #9,000 in total and, secondly, if a withdrawal is made which causes the balance to fall below an amount equal to all the sums previously deposited plus the basic rate income tax on previously paid interest or bonus. It goes on for some pages to provide a fair amount of prudential supervision provisions, which I have to say seem to require a quite significant amount of additional bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA>  So what we are essentially talking about is one account per person, for very small amounts, with limited flexibility. This is to overcome a specific problem of small savings in the UK tax rules and to encourage savings among the UK's small savings population, which is much larger than applies here. But there is no mention--although it is in the motion--in the legislation from the UK about encouraging industry investment. There is no information, of course, about the rates to be applied, and one assumes that those would be normal market rates. </PARA>
<PARA>  Why is the scheme not relevant here? As I have said before, I accept the good intent, but it is a contrived scheme. It is the Government saying, `We will have a special little category which has to be specially policed and have special rules and regulations, reporting arrangements and all the rest of it'. So there is bureaucracy there, and we are out there interfering in a small sector of the community. It is more government intervention and it is more bureaucracy. There is no genuine incentive for people to increase their savings by significant amounts, because it is such a small amount. The benefit might, of course, be consolidations of savings for investment. But the banks in this country, certainly at the moment, are not in a position to do that, and they are holding back from a lot of that investment. I suggest that, if the scheme were applied here, it would not directly cause the banks to release lots of large capital into the marketplace for investment. </PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Denison said, `Perhaps we should be saying that there would be conditions. You have to actually allocate it to this small firm or to small business or whatever'. But we are then back into this whole business of picking winners and who gets the money and who does not. </PARA>
<PARA>  So it is an artificial scheme for the less well off, when really I would suggest that the aim should be to make those people a lot better off rather than just putting a bandaid on their present situation. So what should be done? Essentially we should be looking to improve people's income and to provide some incentive. There are two ways of doing that: firstly, we get the economy going, rather than the flat earth policy we have at the moment and, secondly, we reform the tax system. To get the economy going we have to do the things that we on this side of the House have been talking about for some time and which the Government has been talking about but, unfortunately, has not done. We have to have that industrial relations reform and sweep away a lot of the archaic work practices so that we can get some competitiveness into our industry, get some profit and get some earnings up, because it is only when we are profitable and successful that people will be better off--and then they do not need the contrived schemes. </PARA>
<PARA>  We need those micro-economic reforms which everybody talks about but which are coming so slowly. I happened to be at a dinner last night with MIM. The point was made that, for example, in the land transport area we urgently need significant reforms in road and rail. If we look at just the cost of doing business through the waterfront or across the Tasman, we see that we are just not competitive. Privatisation, contracting out and smaller government--that whole range of areas--are the things we do to improve everybody's wealth, rather than singling out one small sector of the community. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is not a question of wanting more government and more public servants, because we already spend far too much on administration. If we look, for example, at just administering the Department of Social Security--just the administration costs of that Department, not what it pays out in benefits--we see that we spend $1.3 billion a year. That is the equivalent of building Parliament House every year. We have to get away from special schemes, the administration, the controls and all the reporting; we have to liberate a lot of the opportunity rather than having more government intervention and more administration. It is an attitude. We have to fix the basic problem, not just make it more comfortable. </PARA>
<PARA>  Governments are not the only ones who care. We care too, and we want to help on these issues, but we have to have proper long term solutions. On the tax front, of course, we have to reduce the tax take. We want to provide some incentive for people. We want to shift the burden from incomes to spending, so that there is some incentive to invest in that business, to work that hour's overtime and to save. We do not want to have special little schemes just for one sector of the community. We have said that we will replace the wholesale sales tax with a goods and services tax so that we have a fairer and more equitable system and so that we get the black economy and those who are rorting. The better off in our society will pay more tax rather than the 10 per cent that they are paying at the moment, because they are the people who spend. And obviously there will be an offsets package. It is better to do that and have a better arrangement for everybody across the board rather than to have a contrived scheme such as the TESSA scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>  In conclusion, I understand that the motion is well motivated. It might be appropriate for the UK, but I would suggest that it is not appropriate here. It is more government intervention and more bureaucracy. The proper route is to improve people's lot overall with all the reforms that I have talked about. We need to restore some pride, some incentive and the standard of living in this country. We have to ease the tax burden for all rather than create another special little category. Regretfully, I urge the House to reject the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I have pleasure in seconding and supporting the proposition put forward by my colleague the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr). Perhaps what is required is to remind the House exactly what is being suggested. The honourable member for Denison is suggesting in this motion that the House recommend to the Government the introduction of a scheme modelled on the British TESSA scheme. But, importantly, the reasons for doing that are to facilitate both the growth of domestic savings and to encourage Australian investment in Australian domestic industry. I hope to have time to get to that latter point, because I think that is the important aspect the honourable member for Aston (Mr Nugent) has overlooked in talking about the scheme's relevance to the Australian situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Indeed, in my speech on this year's Budget I said amongst other things that the Government should give consideration to tax exempt special savings accounts, similar to those operating in the United Kingdom, to mobilise the savings of small investors. So there are a number reasons why we should consider this type of fund, including both the individual interest and the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA>  In this place I have often quoted parts of what I believe to be a fairly important House of Representatives committee report, that is, the report titled Constructing and Restructuring Australia's Public Infrastructure. That report was tabled in November 1987 and the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) played a major role in its compilation. The report highlights the need for Australia to ensure that it looks at infrastructure, not only at providing new infrastructure but also at understanding that infrastructure has a life and will need to be renewed. The challenge for the nation will be to seek proper sources of funding to enable that to occur. </PARA>
<PARA>  That report talks about a scheme that is similar to the British TESSA scheme and has been operational in Japan--the Maruyu scheme, established in 1967 to encourage small savers to invest in government bonds. However, it is interesting that the report also attempts to put that scheme in the cultural context of Japan. I quote from the report as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Japan's rapid post war growth has been financed almost entirely from domestic savings with virtually no net reliance on foreign capital. . . The most striking factor is the array of savings schemes on offer which are tax free up to a certain income level. </PARA>
<PARA>As has been indicated, one of the problems with our present tax environment is that it is so distorted that it penalises Australians' attempts to increase their savings and, even worse, in relation to the savings that small investors might put forward, it works against them in an inequitable fashion because those who have the ability to save larger sums of money are able to enter into a host of schemes offering generous tax breaks. In looking at this scheme, we should try to address some of those inequities in our present tax treatment of savings. </PARA>
<PARA>  I now turn to a point which I have often made about superannuation funds. One has to understand that superannuation funds and a scheme like TESSA would be given tax relief, and because of the tax relief that those funds attract, it should not be too much to expect that, subject to the proper prudential requirements, the funds might at least in part direct their resources to socially responsible investment. It is very important in the present Australian context to look at domestic sources of funding for a whole range of projects, whether they be public infrastructure or the type of industry research and development that is required to place Australia back on its feet.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It is not often that I agree with an idea put forward by the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), especially in view of my recent attack on his preposterous proposal to introduce a wealth tax. However, I support this motion, with some modifications which I will explain. Apart from essential reforms in industrial relations and the restoration of confidence and employment opportunities in Australia, we urgently need the overhaul of the iniquitous taxation system. In particular, we must do something about the appalling level of savings in this community. Domestic savings are a disgrace. The malicious treatment meted out to those who still manage to save is nothing short of a national disgrace. The plundering of people's savings by inflation and through the taxation system has of course encouraged people to spend rather than save. Indeed, it is hard to imagine a system which would do more to undermine the potential wealth creators of a society than that which we have at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Throughout the 1980s we have been virtually forced into an orgy of spending. Unlike Australia, most other developed economies do not treat their citizens with such contempt. In Britain, a person can now open a special TESSA account and receive tax free interest for up to five years. In Japan, many people contribute to economic growth and wealth creation by investing in Maruyu accounts, as mentioned by the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins). In a Maruyu account not only is the interest mainly tax free, but as well deposits of up to $100,000 or $200,000 can be invested securely with no threat to one's social security entitlements. The savings accounts are a basic strength of the Japanese economy. Loans from such funds would, in an Australian instance, be available at interest rates of less than 5 per cent, preferably 4 per cent. Initially, capital would be available for export industries, then for import replacement, and it would then be available to develop Australian owned industries. </PARA>
<PARA>  The major aim of a plan like this is to encourage savings in Australia and simultaneously stimulate the development of particular industries which create wealth and offer genuine employment opportunities. In practical terms, such a scheme could be administered through the Commonwealth Development Bank, although the desire to pick winners--so beloved by the central planners of the twentieth century--must be avoided at all costs. One has only to look at the sorry spectacle of WA Inc., Bannon's State Bank and the debacle of Cain, Jolly and Kirner's destructive socialist fantasies to see what happens when governments attempt to go into business. </PARA>
<PARA>  The misguided disciples of central planning would, in fact, contribute enormously to the future prosperity of Australia if they would only heed the words of one of America's great presidents, Calvin Coolidge, when he asserted in the mid-1920s, `The business of America is business'. He meant precisely that; he did not mean that Uncle Sam should go into business. </PARA>
<PARA>  For the proposals mentioned to be successful, capital invested in such tax exempt accounts must be largely invested in existing businesses that have survived in this hostile environment for at least five years--hopefully 10, 15 or 20 years. Lending would only be on the basis of fixed assets, such as machinery, plant and buildings. This means that, even if a business failed, the fixed assets would always remain. In these circumstances, there would be little, if any, financial loss and minimal risk to any investors. If the Commonwealth Development Bank is used to administer the scheme, all major investment and lending decisions could be made by an independent board of directors with some members nominated by business associations. The new fund should be exempt from all tax and dividend obligations until it is well established. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are told that unemployment is officially at 9.8 per cent, but we all know that in reality it is considerably higher than that. Australia's farmers and small businesses have been devastated by high interest rates ever since increasing government imposts and a deliberately engineered recession were brought into being. It is imperative that something be done immediately to end this haemorrhaging of our business base, our farming families, and the continuing loss of one of Australia's most precious assets--its intellectual property. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let me conclude with an example from my electorate of Dunkley, wherein there is a company which produces crystals for lasers to standards which are widely recognised as world class. Recently, this company established a factory in Singapore, where finance was available at 2 per cent, compared with 16 per cent in Australia at the time. We hear constantly about the level playing field for industries. Such a scheme would be the first step in establishing such a level playing field. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA>  That this House expresses its deep concern at:</PARA>
<PARA>(1)  the continued inflexibility of the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services in the interpretation and implementation of the Disability Services Act;</PARA>
<PARA>(2)  the fact that this implementation policy has led to growing waiting lists for disability services;</PARA>
<PARA>(3)  the claims by the Government that its policy is based on the expressed wishes of disabled persons and their families;</PARA>
<PARA>(4)  the fact that only a small proportion of persons with a disability are receiving a service under the rigid service-type guidelines used in implementing the Disability Services Act;</PARA>
<PARA>(5)  the fact that this Government appears to be demolishing much needed halfway houses and sheltered workshops; and</PARA>
<PARA>(6)  the intransigence of some Departmental officers in reviewing and approving existing services for funding under the Disability Services Act and the authoritarian attitude adopted by some officers in dealing with members of the community. </PARA>
<PARA>This motion, as the House will note, does not seek to condemn the Government, nor does it seek confrontation. Rather, it expresses the deep concern of people with disabilities, their families and service providers at the continued inflexibility of the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services in the interpretation and implementation of the Disability Services Act, the intransigence of some departmental officers in reviewing and approving existing services for funding, and the inconsistency of decision making between State offices of the Department. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Disability Services Act has opened up new options for people with disabilities, and this the Opposition applauds and approves. However, we believe that there is still a need for services such as sheltered workshops, hostels, nursing homes and activity therapy centres to be able to coexist alongside the new services. Yet we still find resistance on the part of the Government to encouraging or continuing these services. </PARA>
<PARA>  We acknowledge that in recent months, because of pressure from parents, service providers and the Opposition, the Government appears to have heeded the call for a rethink on sheltered workshops and other existing services, and has recognised that the transition date of 30 June 1992 will need to be extended. </PARA>
<PARA>  When the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) set up the National Technical Assistance Workshop, he made it clear that he wanted fresh advice on sheltered workshops, not just some more of the thoughts of his Department. </PARA>
<PARA>  At the NTAW workshop held last month at Mount Eliza in Victoria there was overwhelming support from service providers for the concept that sheltered workshops which did meet enhanced consumer outcomes and not just the current minimum outcomes should be eligible for funding under the Disability Services Act. Providers felt that all services should be judged on outcomes. There was a strong call for the Government to set down clearly what are the criteria for eligibility. I understand that Government representatives did advise that in fact the drafting of eligibility criteria was currently in train. There was also a plea for the transition date to be extended. </PARA>
<PARA>  At the same time as this workshop for service providers was taking place, a parent group, Australian Parent Advocacy, was taking its campaign around the country with a central theme that the Government must start listening to parents.  Parents rightly feel that they are not being consulted sufficiently, and are not being involved in the process of change. Yet they are the people who have had the closest involvement with their sons and daughters and who have used their knowledge, skills and energy to establish safe environments to ensure that minimum levels of education and care were set. They are the people who are taking the risks. Their needs must be understood; their voices must be heard; they must be supported. The role of the professionals and bureaucrats should be to facilitate decision making rather than to make those decisions themselves. Parents must be consulted and informed; they must be part of the process. </PARA>
<PARA>  Resolutions passed at the Australian Parent Advocacy annual general meeting, which preceded the campaign, called on the Government to consider uniform guardianship laws for responsible parents right around Australia; recognise that Australian Parent Advocacy is a national parent body, the only one of its kind, and embark on honest inclusion of parents, the primary care givers, in policy development; review its departmental service type guidelines, which are more attuned to Canberra-based ideology than need; realistically assess the growing waiting lists for existing prescribed services; and extend the transition date pending the results of that review and assessment. </PARA>
<PARA>  The APA President, Mrs Mary Walsh, said that her organisation is about families. She continued:</PARA>
<PARA>An intellectual disability is a family disability. We do not expect a greater share of the welfare cake than the next person. In a climate of recession and soaring unemployment that would be unrealistic, but we do expect Canberra to stop dismantling good existing services. We challenge the politicians to face reality. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to assure Mrs Walsh that this is one politician in a group of politicians in the Opposition who wants to face that reality. </PARA>
<PARA>  On her campaign around the country, Mrs Walsh found the following perceptions among parents. Firstly, they realise that the bottom line is a lack of money. There will never be enough, and this could probably get worse when the States accept the responsibility for all services other than employment. Secondly, parents are fed up with having to deal with continually changing departmental staff. Thirdly, there is a concern that unionisation may not be voluntary, and that valuable work options might be lost if unrealistic union demands are allowed to be made. </PARA>
<PARA>  So, once again I say to the Minister that parents of disabled children are desperately worried about what will happen to their children after 30 June next. They need the Minister to spell out clearly whether he intends to fund sheltered workshops and other existing services. Some have already been forced to close down because of lack of commitment and assistance from the Government, even though the Government has promised repeatedly that no service will be closed. </PARA>
<PARA>  I mentioned in the House only last month that one such sheltered workshop which is operated by the Nambucca and district branch of the Challenge Foundation of New South Wales has just suspended its services because it is unable to meet its growing debts. Although the Department was closely involved in the establishment of these services, there has been confusion and conflicting advice on restructuring and reluctance to give financial assistance. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is the position in which sheltered workshops around the country find themselves. The Government is cutting down on funding and backfilling, thus making workshops non-viable. In the case of Nambucca, the Department then had the gall to express concern about the impact of the suspension of operations on the clients and the apparent lack of opportunity for them to make decisions and choices in areas which affect their lives. There are many such sheltered workshops around Australia encountering the same treatment from this Government and the Department. </PARA>
<PARA>  I give another example that was drawn to my attention only this week. The Gilgandra Challenge Foundation, caring for 32 intellectually disabled adults and children, will close at the end of October because of financial problems. It had a total trading deficit of $27,000 last year and a projected deficit of $158,000 this year because of the flow on of award increases in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Department sat on its hands, in spite of consultations and knowledge of Gilgandra's problems. Eventually it offered a bandaid solution of $30,000 to help the organisation through to the end of its financial year, on the condition that it restructure its staff and apply for the 3 per cent superannuation payment available through the Federal Government. It is interesting to note the response by the Department, having made that agreement to give $30,000 on the Friday. On the Saturday, a departmental spokeswoman, Ms Robyn Green, put this comment in the paper:</PARA>
<PARA>We just wanted to know where the $30,000 would be spent. . . I don't think that is unreasonable. </PARA>
<PARA>We also wanted a new projected budget taking the new wages situation into account. </PARA>
<PARA>Then she showed her prejudice by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>I believe the decision to close the service is coming from the Challenge Foundation's head office in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA>She then quite rightly mentioned that Gilgandra did not want to see the organisation closed, nor did the community, but that is what happened. The anger she expresses there I think is a false one, based on a prejudice that the Department knows best and services will abide by what the Department says.</PARA>
<PARA>  What this organisation and many others like it need is security of funding and an ongoing contract. Its spokesman, Mr McCutcheon, said:</PARA>
<PARA>People can't be kept dangling on a string, not knowing if the service will still be there in a week, a month or a year. </PARA>
<PARA>He is angry and frustrated by the failure of Government departments to listen to reason, and that anger is shared right around Australia. The Department cannot understand this, or perhaps it refuses to understand. </PARA>
<PARA>  Because of time limitations, I have time to mention only a few of the examples of the intransigence of departmental officers.  The officers in Western Australia took issue with the views and opinions expressed by the Disabled Workers Union during a recent radio interview. In letter to the union, one officer stated:</PARA>
<PARA>In general you stated that you were opposed to the stance the Commonwealth Government was taking in regard to providing people with disabilities employment options in non-sheltered settings. You also expressed your opposition to people with disabilities having the opportunity for generic union membership. </PARA>
<PARA>The officer continued:</PARA>
<PARA>With regard to your recent comments, it would appear that the Disabled Workers Union is not furthering the Principles and Objectives, and as such calls into question future funding. </PARA>
<PARA>That is blackmail of the worst order. My colleagues and I, in all of our time in this Parliament, cannot remember it being a proper act of government to threaten people with a loss of funding because they criticised the approach of the government of the day. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to give one more recent Queensland example. I quote from a letter that has come into my possession from the Community Living Programme Inc. The main parts state:</PARA>
<PARA>More than that, we were given repeated assurances in a lengthy consultation process that we would receive sufficient funding to enable the program to continue in its present form. </PARA>
<PARA>  We were not aware of the cut to our funding until Friday 16th August six weeks after the end of the last funding period. We were being given interim funding at 1990/91 levels and were advised the reason for the delay was in Head Office, awaiting the Minister's signature. We received the information about the cut via the electoral office of the Member. . . The Department of Community Services, Health and Housing had not advised us in any way of a substantial cut in funding up to that time. </PARA>
<PARA>That meant a reduction in funding of some $50,000 to $60,000 to carry on a service on behalf of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>  I should like to raise yet another matter of concern which is very current and on which once again the Government seems to have set its own agenda without sufficient or meaningful consultation with consumers, carers or service providers. I refer to the consumer focused funding approach which the Government introduced on 1 July this year before its own consultation process had been completed. This approach is in operation in Canada and New Zealand and is not an unqualified success. In fact, it was introduced in those countries as a cost cutting measure. When questioned about this funding approach during Senate Estimates committee hearings last month, the departmental officer admitted that neither the guidelines nor the form of legal contract between the program and the service provider had been finalised. Yet this approach was introduced in July 1991 before consultations had been embarked upon. I understand that it has little support around the country among consumers, carers or service providers and it has not been trialled properly. </PARA>
<PARA>  It would certainly seem that this system is about bureaucratic empowerment rather than consumer empowerment, and that is what social justice is about. It is also seen as the icing on the cake in a series of cost cutting measures by the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services. The motion that we introduced earlier expressed the major concerns of consumers, families and carers. I think these should be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA>  Having listed the concerns of those people, I come back to the remarks that I made at the beginning of my speech. In recent months the Government does appear to have been listening to the people out there, and I reiterate the offer that I have made on many occasions: the coalition would like to work with the Government on a bipartisan basis in setting objectives for the future and ensuring that all people with disabilities receive services appropriate to their needs and aspirations and that there is a choice and diversity of program. </PARA>
<PARA>  I commented at the beginning of this speech that we do not seek confrontation on disability services. I have mentioned the concerns of most of those engaged in providing and receiving those services. The Opposition has made positive suggestions for changes to the Disability Services Act to address those concerns to make the Public Service--the departmental officers--more accountable and responsible. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, I get alarmed by comments which receive wide circulation and which are intended to be spread wider and so cause unnecessary concern and agitation to people with disabilities and their carers. I refer to comments on the marginal effects of the goods and services tax on people with disabilities. In reply to a dorothy dixer in this House on 10 September 1991, the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services made such comments deliberately. His answer was hypothetical. He has no idea or knowledge of the details of the Opposition's proposed goods and services tax and his comments were designed to cause agitation to the Opposition--which they did not--but they caused major concern to those people with disabilities and their carers. His comments were cruel, careless and heartless. Again, one must question his and other Ministers' interpretation of social justice. </PARA>
<PARA>  The goods and services tax is part of an Opposition policy initiative designed to make more funds available to people with disabilities, not to reduce the amount of income available to these people. Let every Australian face the fact now: this country is in debt to the rest of the world to the tune of $162 billion. We have the highest real interest rates of any developed nation in the world. We have almost 10 per cent of Australians--nearly one million--unemployed, and we have a taxation system which is unfair and discriminatory, as well as optional for some. We have a growing internal black economy, and some of our richest citizens are not paying tax. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Liberal and National parties recognise that changes are necessary to bring Australia out of recession and to protect those less fortunate in our society. I can assure the Minister in this House that we have an overwhelming commitment to people with disabilities and would ask him and other members of the Labor Government not to victimise those people with totally false assumptions and allegations about Opposition policies. </PARA>
<PARA>  I pledge that a coalition Government will listen to people with disabilities and their advocates. We will listen particularly to the concerns of parents and we will listen to the voluntary and charitable organisations which provide the services. We intend to work together with all those elements within the industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Labor vision of a socially just society is one where all Australians can share equitably in the distribution of resources, especially in employment opportunities. The package of new labour market and income support arrangements, known as the disability reform package, was introduced in the 1990 Budget. This package will bring into sharper focus the special needs of clients with disabilities and is an outstanding illustration of the Government's broad approach to reform. Building on the foundation of the disability reform package, the Government is now turning its attention to tackling the next stage of the reform process--overcoming the barriers that exist in the workplace for people with disabilities. I wanted to say that at the outset of this debate today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  There were six issues of concern raised by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite). Not so long ago I had a meeting with the Parent Advocacy Association in Bundaberg. It was not the first, but one of many meetings. With that group and with other concerned parents I have discussed and gone through the process and the position of the Government. I have done so along with members of the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services whom I would like to compliment on their dedication, the amount of work they carry out and their willingness to travel the length and breadth of Queensland, and I am sure other States--I have not travelled in those other States in considering this issue--to explain the reform process to concerned parents and friends of people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA>  There have been some misconceptions. I think some of those misconceptions are understandable because people are reluctant to change and are concerned about the way in which changes will be implemented. It is true, as the previous speaker said, that in order that we get proper change for the better there needs to be consultation. That has been the case; that has been ongoing for years. It will continue. </PARA>
<PARA>  By June 1992 the Federal Government will be spending $390m in the disabilities area under the new program. That is an increase from the previous program of 1986-87, which allocated $126.7m. That is an increase of around three times in the amount of expenditure in the disabilities area. That indicates the determination, compassion and understanding that the Government has for the needs of people in this area. Most of us are touched by friends, relatives or close acquaintances who are disabled, whether it be intellectually disabled or physically disabled. In the physical area there will be more disabilities because of modern science and, unfortunately, accidents, particularly automobile accidents. Sadly, that is a growing area. </PARA>
<PARA>  Ten issues were raised by Parent Advocacy both in newsletters it sent out and in discussions with me. I would like to go through some of those concerns and some of the concerns touched on by the previous speaker. Before I do so I would like to point out another thing that the Government has done to try to help gain better opportunities for people to go into the work place--that is, to honour the Florence agreement which has the effect of removing tariffs on educational, scientific and cultural goods designed especially for people with disabilities, thereby enabling them to have better opportunities in the workplace. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-On top of that, we have removed the sales tax on those vehicles. It previously did not apply to them. That is something that should be recognised. It is rather hypocritical that at the same time that we are removing these imposts, the Opposition is locked into a policy of a consumption tax that will impact not only on the disabled but on all Australians. No matter how many times members of the Opposition say otherwise, they will tax the people who can least afford it while the people at the top end of the market will get an exemption. They do not like it because they know that when the general public understands what this sort of tax means they are going to be as popular as Saddam Hussein.

<PARA>  I would like to get to the first point that has been raised by Parent Advocacy in its newsletter; that is, the effect of rising unemployment levels and the economic downturn on supported and open employment opportunities for people with a disability. The issue here is more one of discrimination against people with disabilities in the open labour market. Participation rates have not tended to rise even in times of economic boom. The Government is currently addressing this issue through marketing and union-employer awareness programs, such as the Employer of the Year award of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). While it is recognised that the current economic climate is not conducive to full employment, it is expected that people with disabilities should compete for and secure their share of available jobs with the support offered through the funded employment programs. </PARA>
<PARA>  The employment programs funded by the Commonwealth provide the support necessary to enable people with disabilities to obtain and retain integrated employment opportunities in the general labour market. This support is tailored to individual needs and may be ongoing or time limited as required. The Government's overall social justice platform looks to a long term permanent change in employment opportunities for people with disabilities and in the attitudes of employers and the community. </PARA>
<PARA>  While there are some who say that people with disabilities cannot possibly compete or cope with people without disabilities for employment, I do not agree. I will use three examples to prove that conclusively: one of the greatest women this century, Helen Keller, had severe physical disabilities; the greatest President the United States had this century, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, was disabled; another man who had greater disabilities than either of those two, and who has been an inspiration to the world, was Christie Brown. A great movie which won some academy awards called My Left Foot was made about Christie Brown only two years ago. I recently had the privilege of meeting the producer and director of that film. It has touched the hearts of everybody and has demonstrated that people with disabilities can achieve. We wish to see that those people have the opportunity to reach whatever heights they desire in our society. That is what this motion is about; that is what our Government is committed to. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do not believe we have a monopoly on wisdom in trying to create the best package. I object to anyone on the other side of the House, or anyone anywhere, saying that we do not have the compassion or the will to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>  The second issue raised was a refusal to extend the transition date beyond 30 June 1992. The Government is committed to the consideration of a range of options available for pursuing the principles and objectives of the Disability Services Act, while providing ongoing funding for sheltered workshops after June 1992, provided they meet minimum outcomes and continue to improve the quality of their services. To assist services in this change process, the Government has provided $3.1m over the next two years to the Australian Management College, Mount Eliza, to establish and support a National Technical Assistance Unit, NTAU. The NTAU will offer sheltered workshops technical advice dealing with financial management, business development and marketing in a competitive environment. The work of the NTAU is also expected to guide transition arrangements for sheltered workshops. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government has also given repeated assurances that no service which meets certain minimum standards of quality related to the observance of basic human rights and has committed itself to a continuing process of change towards meeting the principles and objectives of the Act need have concerns--I emphasise the words `need have concerns'--about continued funding after 1992. Funding at ministerial discretion should not be construed as making the program vulnerable or insecure. This Government, with its commitment to social justice and record of introducing positive new initiatives for people with disabilities, would not arbitrarily withdraw funding. The Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) has also given public assurances to this effect. I would like to stress that again. </PARA>
<PARA>  The third issue raised refers to a refusal by the Government to table guidelines for the DSA. The Disability Services Act, enacted in 1986, focused for the first time on the needs of people with disabilities rather than service providers. The DSA seeks to open up more possibilities and choices for people with disabilities, enabling them to pursue a valued lifestyle. In implementing the DSA, the Government has emphasised innovation to allow for maximum flexibility during the transition phase of services moving towards the DSA. As program parameters become more settled, then the Government will act to develop section 5 guidelines under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>  The fourth issue deals with a lack of guardianship rights. The Government is aware of the need for uniform guardianship legislation through Australia and that conditions of guardianship orders should be portable between all States and Territories. In recognition of the importance of the issue, the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services put the matter on the table for discussion at the recent Council of Social Welfare Ministers. A decision on the issue has not been released at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA>  The fifth issue refers to a supposed lack of meaningful consultation. I have commented on that matter previously. The handicapped programs review generated close to 1,700 submissions from individuals and organisations--5,000 people participated in open public consultation and 3,500 people participated in workshops and seminars. As the first major consultation on disability issues, the recommendations flowing from the review have significantly shaped current Government policy. As I have said, ongoing consultation has occurred through a number of initiatives. I would like to list some of them: the Disability Advisory Council of Australia; the Disability Services Advisory Committees, DSACs, in each State; Ronalds Consultations on Employment; the Advocacy Movement and consumer input to reviews of services. </PARA>
<PARA>  The National Technical Assistance Unit will be consulting in the next few weeks with consumer and parent representatives--some of that is already happening--including Australian Parent Advocacy, on issues associated with the transition of sheltered workshops, and will be providing advice to the Government to assist its consideration of future developments in the disability services program. Recent consultations include consultation on two new initiatives conducted by the disability services program. These initiatives include consumer focus funding, CFF, and individual needs analysis, INA. Consultations have been taking place over the period June 1991 to September 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are several other points, but I will not have time to comment on them. I stress the fact that the Government is working with all groups and this ought to be above politics, but there are some in the community who are frightening people unnecessarily. I will continue to stand up and say that a goods and services tax on the disabled and on every person in this country is not good for Australians. If the Opposition does not like it, that is too bad. It can whistle three bars of Dixie. </PARA>

Talk about frightening people. That was one of the best efforts I have ever heard to frighten a group that is in no position to fight back. I hope the honourable member for Hinkler is extremely proud of his performance!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I am pleased to support this motion by the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) because it raises some matters that have arisen in my own electorate. I have no particular expertise in the disability area, but many people, usually parents or families of people with disabilities, have come into my office and raised their problems with me. What I am getting from them is enormous confusion. They really do not know what is happening. On the one hand, they are subject to the rhetoric about all the good things that are supposed to be happening in the disability area as a result of the Disability Services Act, but families especially are finding that not only are they no better off than they were before but many of them are a lot worse off. They do not know where they stand. </PARA>
<PARA>  They were promised so much but they have got so little. One of the reasons why they have got so little is that a lot of the money that has been put into the disability area has gone into specialised areas such as deinstitutionalisation, which in itself is very positive. With the money available going into institutions and into moving people out of institutions, those families who have been looking after people with disabilities for many years have nowhere to go for their funds. A few people who yell the loudest get large sums of money. In my office recently I had 14 parents of children with intellectual disabilities. One of those parents said, `I have done all right; I got $40,000 for my child. But I feel very ashamed when I look at everybody else in this room'. Indeed, it was an uncomfortable situation: she had got $40,000, and none of the other parents in that room had got anything for their children. </PARA>
<PARA>  Some of the services that have been approved by this Government need an enormous amount of money, and putting that sort of money into some people means that others simply do not get anything. The same thing has happened in the work area. I am aware of one workplace where the subsidy for each person in the workshop is $14,000. That is not their pension or for their accommodation; that is simply the subsidy to keep them working in this one workshop. While those few people are being subsidised at $14,000 each, in South Australia 2,000 people with intellectual disabilities have absolutely nothing to do and nowhere to go during the daytime. Of course, that number will increase with the restrictions on sheltered workshops that have come about. </PARA>
<PARA>  The feedback I am getting from families in my electorate is that they simply do not understand what is happening about sheltered workshops. They have children, many of them adults, who are presently in those workshops. The children enjoy them, they enjoy going there, and they believe what they are doing is a contribution to society. They enjoy the wages they get, they enjoy the activities, and they enjoy the social contact. They are absolutely terrified that these workshops will close down and they will have nothing.   I do not think any of us have any fight with supported employment, with open employment. It is a marvellous ideal, but an ideal is worth absolutely nothing if we cannot realise it. What we do is leave the people in the community with the promise of something better but in fact give them something worse. </PARA>
<PARA>  My time is almost up and there is so much I would like to have covered in this area. Let me just say that I wish this Government would concentrate more on what is best for people with disabilities and their families and less on the philosophy, the grandstanding, and would look to their welfare instead of to the welfare of this Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I find the hypocrisy of the other side absolutely amazing in relation to the treatment of disability services, the Disability Services Act and its implementation. Might I say at the outset in regard to parent advocacy that the most vociferous critics of the Disability Services Act are led by a person called Mary Walsh, who was a National Party candidate at the last election. This kind of political grandstanding should be exposed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  At the heart of all this lies an opposition to the essence of the Disability Services Act. The Disability Services Act is about equity and opportunity for everybody in this community, irrespective of the kind of disability they have. We have a whole range of examples of what has happened and of the excellent opportunities that have been created for people. However, we also have megalithic structures, particularly in Queensland, where for 30 years we had a State government that failed to address any of the disability services issues and so created a monster private provider, particularly in the form of the Endeavour Foundation. It was a leader in education for disabled children when it was first established. Indeed, early in the 1950s it was a leader in the way in which the disabled were educated. </PARA>
<PARA>  What has happened is that the rest of the world--the community, education and other processes--has moved down the track another 40 years. The Government must respond to that, and it has responded, as well as to the needs and demands of those individuals. Of course, if one has a monolithic structure one has power bases and, indeed, an enormous amount of money, power and control over people's lives. One cannot expect this to be handed over to individuals. </PARA>
<PARA>  To say that things are not happening is absolute and utter nonsense. We have seen the rise of a whole range of respite care services which assist people with very young families. I have a respite care centre in my electorate for children up to 12 that specifically addresses the concerns of families with young disabled children. It enables the family and the siblings of the disabled to have a break from each other. It also encourages an amount of independence in those children when they have a day away, a weekend or whatever. A whole range of families use that service. This is part of what we are talking about--developing independence at an early age and making sure the opportunities are there. </PARA>
<PARA>  We should also look at the way in which employment opportunities have been created. I find it quite extraordinary that it seems to depend on the will of the provider as to whether the spirit of the Disability Services Act can be addressed. I can cite three enormously successful transitional operations in my electorate, one of which, Keystone, is in the poorest and most disadvantaged part of my electorate and is supported by the National Party's very own Senator Bjelke-Petersen. It has embraced the Disability Services Act with great alacrity. </PARA>
<PARA>  Keystone has found a way to give people an opportunity to move into full and supported employment. Indeed, the person who now answers the Commander telephone system, who can handle all four lines as they come in, take messages and do the work, is a former client who had been condemned to routine work in a sheltered workshop for no money at all. That person was working only for the invalid pension at a cost to the taxpayer. Young Natalie is now the receptionist there and can answer the phone, take messages and do all that work. Surely those on the other side of the House are not saying that such people should be denied access to real wages and the opportunity to work. </PARA>
<PARA>  At the heart of this motion is a denial of the rights of individuals to move into full employment, to be able to work, to do things. The issue of flexibility was raised by those opposite. The inflexibility is in these monster megalithic foundations that have been created to give power to numbers of people to control those in sheltered workshops. We were told by the honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Gallus) that people actually enjoy sheltered workshops. The same argument was used in the Industrial Revolution when they tried to move children out of the mines--that children actually enjoyed being there. What sort of nonsense is this?  We are about dignity, about the rights of individuals and the rights of all people to have an equal opportunity in employment and not to be condemned to this nonsense of working in sheltered workshops at a cost to the taxpayer.(Time expired)</PARA>

That is something that is most important to them at an individual level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Recently I went to see the family of a young man named Chad. Chad is a handicapped child of 14 or 15 who is in respite care for six nights a week. The family live in absolute terror that this respite care could be taken away from them at any stage if a more worthy case came along. That would be a tragedy. Imagine that a child who needs to be looked after professionally on a 24-hour basis could have that care taken away by a stroke of a bureaucratic pen. The family live with this day after day. To add to their woes, some two years ago the mother of the family had a brain tumour. There was evidence to suggest that the brain tumour was brought on by the stress of her family life.</PARA>
<PARA>  The family came to me and said, `We are in financial trouble. We owe some money for the respite care and we really cannot pay it'. Could I get any money to help this deserving case from the bureaucratic services that I went to? No. The husband was looking at having to throw away his job to go home and look after young Chad. Eventually, I found help for Chad from a multinational company which looks after its people. It had the compassion--which the bureaucracy did not have--to take the financial worries away from one of its workers. The union movement was also involved in this case and it also showed compassion by looking after young Chad. Today that child is still in respite care six nights a week. The family are still struggling on, and they are still uncertain of their future. It is a tragedy that should not have been placed upon that family; one they can do without. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government is very keen to talk about sheltered workshops and social justice; but where is the social justice for all those people who cannot get into sheltered workshops, those people who are on waiting lists and are falling back on the resources of their families? Where is the social justice for them? Where is their level playing field? It is not there. So we find this ongoing tragedy time and time again at a personal level. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of my centres in Warragul, the Mawarra centre, recently had trouble getting funding from the Government because of a bureaucratic muck-up. However there is not time to go into that now. I received a letter, which reads:</PARA>

<PARA>  That this House:</PARA>
<PARA>(1)  calls on the Government to review the standards applied by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service to consumer goods imported into Australia; and</PARA>
<PARA>(2)  contends that the minimum standards applied to imports should reflect the minimum standards applied to exports from Australia of comparable goods. </PARA>
<PARA>In moving this motion I believe I am touching on a matter that is of widespread concern to the Australian community, particularly to primary producers. It is widespread enough for the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) to volunteer to second the motion and for me to feel that I ought to recognise the role of the honourable member for Gwydir (Mr Anderson), whose particular interest in quarantine standards initiated this motion. </PARA>
<PARA>  My interest in this matter arises from my involvement in the horticultural industry of the Riverland in South Australia. As you would be well aware from your primary production experience, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Riverland of South Australia is a fruit-fly-free zone in Australian terms. So I am very familiar with what it is like to live in an area that enjoys a particular advantage and maintains that advantage by the strict policing of quarantine standards. In the Riverland and in South Australia standards are applied to the movement of fruit and, as people in the gallery and honourable members would be aware, there are roadblocks to make it difficult for people to bring what might be contaminated fruit in or out of that area. </PARA>
<PARA>  This intention to isolate an area and maintain its advantage is known as `quarantining' and has been known as `quarantining' since the word first came into existence. When `quarantine' was first used it referred to the time--originally 40 days--during which a vessel suspected of carrying an infectious disease was kept out of contact with the shore of the country that the vessel was intending to visit. </PARA>
<PARA>  The need for effective quarantining in Australia is beyond dispute. It is supported by all Australians, even those who are inconvenienced at immigration barriers by our quarantine techniques. The reason for this motion is that there are real inconsistencies in the way in which the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service polices quarantine in this country. I first became aware of these inconsistencies as a result of the experience of the dried apricot industry and particularly the Angas Park dried fruit packing company, which is in my electorate. Mr Blenkiron, the General Manager of Angas Park, pointed out to me that the quality of dried fruit allowed to be imported into Australia was not good enough to be exported. </PARA>
<PARA>  I got into some trouble in this House when I mentioned that imported Turkish dried apricots reminded me of nothing more than little shrivelled orange balls. That prompted a phone call from the Turkish Ambassador, who was a shade indignant. Whether he was right or wrong--and I have no doubt that what was imported was perfectly edible material--those apricots would not have met the minimum inspection standards applied by AQIS and would not have been good enough to be exported. That is the fundamental inconsistency that we believe ought to be addressed by the House and the Government and that this motion endeavours to focus on. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am not seeking some sort of non-tariff barrier that makes it difficult for people to bring product into Australia; I am simply saying that what we regard as the minimum standard for exported goods ought to be applied to imported goods also. The stance of my Party and the coalition on GATT has always been consistent. We want a similar consistency to be expressed by AQIS. </PARA>
<PARA>  Frankly, I am asking: who inspects the inspecting authority? We have come to the point where the producers in Australia are now asked to pay 100 per cent of the cost of having the goods that they have prepared for export pass meat inspection standards. One hundred per cent of that cost is borne by the producer. The producer rightly says, `It is time I had some say in the way that export and those export standards are applied'. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am aware that the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) has asked that there be a review of AQIS. The company, Ernst and Young, has handed down a review of AQIS procedures. Ernst and Young claims that the difficulty that we have with 100 per cent inspection charges being borne by the producer is that those charges have placed a greater burden on the inefficient producer. The real problem is that there has been too little flexibility in AQIS; too little opportunity for a producer to say, `This is the standard that I believe I have to maintain at export. This is the way that I am going to go about maintaining that standard by inspection'. There is too little flexibility and too few modifications. Companies which once shared their inspection costs with the Commonwealth find that they now have to bear 100 per cent of that cost without any right to say how the inspection should be carried out. </PARA>
<PARA>   The problem, of course, is even more acute in the meat industry than it is in the horticultural industry. Last night in the Appropriation debate, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) spelled out the example of AQIS inspectors who were receiving a salary of $34,000 a year--note that--but are being charged out to the company, by AQIS, at $68,000 a year. He pointed out the fact that 25 per cent of AQIS meat inspection staff were not actually inspecting at all. This, of course, was part of the reason why the salary of meat inspectors had been so dramatically loaded and it provided such a burden to meat processors and abattoirs around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is a small wonder that the Federal Council of the Australian Meat Inspectors calculated that government inspection costs and statutory boards account for 5.5 per cent of the meat industry's turnover. It added, as a rider, that in the best years that the industry had enjoyed, the operating surplus had been only 5.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is an old political adage that says that power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. One of the dilemmas facing AQIS is that it has absolute power. It is AQIS that says whether or not a container of fruit, vegetables or meat will meet a particular standard and whether it will, therefore, go to the market or whether it will stay, be rejected and be a total loss to the processor. AQIS determines whether a particular export will go ahead or stop. </PARA>
<PARA>  As the honourable member for Gwydir has pointed out in this House, we had the situation in Cowra where an abattoir, which was ready to roll with 180 men waiting to work, decided to go ahead and process. When the eight normal inspectors were not available to inspect the meat, the abattoir employed two other fully licensed and qualified inspectors, processed for the day and, in the process, slaughtered and packed the carcasses of 131 cattle and 2,200 sheep worth almost a quarter of a million dollars. It then had AQIS say--after it was inspected by licensed inspectors, but not those on the AQIS roster--that it could not go ahead. I think I can be forgiven for asking whether, in this instance, there was not just a bit of monopoly power being exercised. </PARA>
<PARA>  The plea that I want the Parliament and the Government to consider is the right for producers, in fact, to negotiate the way in which they go about their inspections. Every exporter has a vested interest in maintaining quality; that is what allows his market access. By comparison, every importer poses a threat to Australian consumers. I insist that the standards that apply to our imports ought to be at least as rigorous as the standards that currently apply to our exports. That is the responsibility that AQIS ought to be exercising and reviewing as it looks at its role in Australian exports. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> --I rise to speak in the context of Australia's urgent need to develop an export ethos. Unless Australia develops an export ethos and unless every citizen in this country realises that we, as a nation, are going to survive on exports--exports are our very lifeblood and the backbone of every job in this country--then we are doomed to be a Third World country. I think we need to look very carefully at anything that impedes exports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I am sad to have to say that I have to concur with the previous speaker, the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew). AQIS does not have a good record. It will say that it is diligent, that it works hard and does its duty. I am sure, in its own eyes, it does. I think we need to have a look at a few of the records. When we examine specific cases, we see significant abuse of power. It is true that since July 1980 AQIS has been inspecting imported foods. It is interesting that after inspecting 2,500 consignments, 8 per cent did not come up to Australian standards. I suspect that it has inspected very few of the imports. By its own inspection, it is clearly shown that there is a real problem there. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am concerned about the export side. There was company in Mildura, an area on the Murray Valley, that was very seriously affected by the decision of the Government to allow imported dried fruits. Imported dried fruits often did not meet the same standards of Australian dried fruit. Rather than simply go broke, the farmers in that area sought to find alternative markets. Some enterprising people hit on to the table grape market. They went to Europe and studied it. They found that people in Europe, in fact, liked the sultana grape and that Europe, particularly France and Britain, import a lot of sultana grapes from Spain and Italy during the season. Therefore, they arranged with Mayne Nickless Ltd to send three container loads to London which fetched record prices. </PARA>
<PARA>  They then ran into the problem of AQIS. It said that no grapes could be exported unless they met a certain size. This was clearly nothing to do with AQIS. It was something that should have been decided by the market. There was no health question there whatsoever. If the market in Europe did not like small grapes, then so be it. I think European consumers are apparently more sophisticated than the North American consumer because they like the flavour in the grape. There were people in Australia--forces which I believe were mainly in the Victorian Department of Agriculture--who wanted to produce in Australia these very large plastic blobs of water which pass for American table grapes. They were not liked, particularly in Europe. The fact that our product was acceptable was decided by the market paying the premium price for those three container loads. </PARA>
<PARA>  The inhibitions put on the export of those things have cost those growers in Mildura a fortune. It has driven them into the hands of the banks. With banks being what they are in this country, the growers will probably never recover. I believe that there is room there for clear action against AQIS. I think there ought to be a mechanism where it can be sued for this sort of behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA>  In respect of meat exports, we are now talking about allowing the Russians to modify whalers and operate them as mobile abattoirs outside the national limits in international waters. It is simply not possible to slaughter mutton in Australia, no matter how cheap the sheep are, to supply this vast market. The reason it is not possible is that the abattoirs have to meet these Department of Primary Industries and Energy standards; standards which the Russians say are not necessary for them. These standards of the Department, of course, are far higher than meat that is slaughtered in Australia. We are actually saying that it is all right for Australians to eat this meat, but any foreigner who gets Australian meat must have a higher standard. That is bizarre nonsense and I think it is quite offensive. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is quite possible that the reality is that they are concerned about the Americans. The Americans are the great users of the non-tariff barrier. It is quite possible that the Americans simply say, `If you are going to have two marketing standards, we are not going to allow you to get beef into the United States'. If that is the case, then we ought to be coming out and saying very clearly that that is the case. We will be pinning it on the Americans. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I welcome the opportunity to speak in today's grievance debate. I wish to use this time to bring to the attention of honourable members the Hawke Government's severe mismanagement of the Australian economy. I wish to remind the House of the list of broken promises which have become the hallmark of the current Federal Government and why the Australian Labor Party is not fit to form government in Australia at either State or Federal level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I have just finished reading a very important book. I have yet to reach a conclusion as to whether the book is a comedy or a tragedy. It is certainly an important historical document. It is important that its contents be brought to the attention of honourable members. I am referring to the book entitled Australian Labor Party Platform, Resolutions and Rules, 1988. I will quote some extracts from the book and honourable members will quickly appreciate my dilemma in deciding whether the book is a tragedy or a comedy. Chapter 7 deals with the Labor Party's approach to economic matters. Paragraph 10 states:</PARA>
<PARA>  Labor believes that economic policy should be directed towards</PARA>
<PARA>(a) the development of a strong competitive Australian economy capable of achieving full employment and high and consistently improving living standards, with the elimination of poverty treated as an urgent priority;</PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph (c) states:</PARA>
<PARA>The restoration and maintenance of full employment, with unemployment seen as a denial of the right to share equitably in the nation's resources. </PARA>
<PARA>I also quote from chapter 8, which deals with employment, education and training. Paragraph 2 states:</PARA>
<PARA>Labor is committed to the restoration and maintenance of full employment. Unemployment is a major source of inequality and poverty in our community. As such, full employment is crucial to the achievement of Labor's economic, social and cultural goals. </PARA>
<PARA>It would be a gross understatement to say that the rhetoric contained in this 1988 document has not been matched by the Government's performance in the years following the 1988 ALP conference held in Hobart. Tragically, for so many Australians, the reverse has occurred. In August 1988, 632,000 Australians were out of work. The 1988 ALP conference committed the Federal Government to a policy of full employment. Yet, in August 1991, there were 841,000 Australians registered as unemployed. What is worse, it is quite possible that because of this recession the registered figure will exceed one million. And we all know that the real figures are much higher than that. </PARA>
<PARA>  Indeed, the unemployment crisis facing Australia today is so severe that, if we were able to form a queue of all those currently unemployed standing one metre apart, that queue would stretch from Melbourne to Sydney. That is a national disgrace. So many Australians are unemployed because of the policies of this Labor Government because of the recession we had to have--the same people who promised full employment only three years ago. </PARA>
<PARA>  The ALP conference of 1988 should not be remembered only for its commitment to full employment. The conference also made some very important statements about the role of small business in the Australian economy. Chapter 21 is devoted to small business. Paragraph 1 states:</PARA>
<PARA>Labor recognises the importance of maintaining a strong, viable and diverse small business sector. It accounts for more than 95% of all businesses in Australia, over 50% of private sector employment and 40% of value added. </PARA>
<PARA>This quote from the ALP's 1988 document is laughable when one considers the damage inflicted upon small businesses by the policies of the Hawke-Keating Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  When assessing the damage to small businesses by government policy a very accurate barometer is the statistics dealing with bankruptcies. In the financial year of 1987-88, there were 8,504 recorded bankruptcies in Australia. Three years after the Labor Party conference in Hobart, with its rhetoric about the importance of small businesses to the Australian economy, the annual bankruptcy figures have reached a staggering 12,991. </PARA>
<PARA>  The 1987-88 figure of 8,504 represented a 13.5 per cent increase on the previous year, while the 1990-91 figure of 12,991 represents an increase of 52 per cent on the previous year. With these figures in mind, how can any member of the Government have the temerity to claim that the Labor Party has a commitment to small business in Australia?</PARA>
<PARA>  A more detailed examination of the bankruptcy figures is a worthwhile exercise. It is interesting to compare the figures during the Fraser Administration with the figures during the Hawke Government's term in office. This is particularly interesting, because we all know how often Hawke Government Ministers stand up in this place and blame the Fraser Government for all of Australia's economic woes. They blame a government which has been out of office for over eight years. In that period we have been saddled with nine Budgets from the Hawke Government: eight from Treasurer Keating and one from Treasurer Kerin. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us consider the facts. During the Fraser years, there was a total of 30,945 bankruptcies, with an average of 3,868 per year. During the Hawke Government's period in office, there have been 60,089 bankruptcies, or an average of 7,511 bankruptcies. The figures have doubled.  The bankruptcy figures I have revealed are further evidence of the total failure of the Hawke Government, which is more interested in playing its grubby numbers game to see who will spend Christmas in the Lodge. </PARA>
<PARA>  I come to this place from small business. I am a manufacturer and I therefore have an acute awareness of the pressures and impediments which this Government has imposed upon small businesses. I also represent an area of Melbourne which has the highest concentration of manufacturing businesses within Australia--and they are hurting. So many have gone to the wall, and many are beyond recovery. For a long time small businesses in this country have had to contend with the decline in consumer spending, with high inflation, with high interest rates and with high taxes. That is not all. Let us not forget the administrative burden of the one per cent training levy on businesses with payroll taxes in excess of $200,000. Let us not forget the compulsory superannuation imposed upon businesses but with no link to productivity increases. </PARA>
<PARA>  In this Budget, the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) had the opportunity to show that he would be different from the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), and that he would attempt to help, rather than hinder, small businesses. But no! Instead of Budget initiatives to encourage and assist businesses, we see the imposition of a 5 per cent occupational superannuation policy--a decision that will break the back of small businesses. It will send another 100,000 workers into the ranks of the unemployed. It will add from 2 per cent to 5 per cent to our inflation rate. </PARA>
<PARA>  Earlier this year I challenged the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the then Treasurer to leave the dream world of Canberra and come to Melbourne to visit my electorate of Isaacs. The Prime Minister is a former resident of the seat of Isaacs, so it should be a nostalgic trip for him. I invited him to witness the damage being caused by his Government's economic mismanagement. Once again I extend the invitation. I would be delighted were he to bring the Treasurer with him. If the Prime Minister is willing to leave the comfort zone of Canberra and venture into the real world, I will show him the crisis that he and the former Treasurer have created. I will take him to the industrial estates of my electorate so that he can see how many businesses have closed down completely. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I want to raise again the issue of Austudy. I have spoken on this issue on a number of occasions in the chamber and I welcome the opportunity to do so again. I am aware that a range of additional improvements to the Austudy scheme were introduced by the Government in the August Budget--improvements that included the rural hardship provisions. I welcome these Budget changes, particularly those which will assist the rural sector of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Today I wish to bring to the attention of the House a problem which has been raised with me on a number of occasions over recent months. This is a problem affecting people who, having left school previously, now wish to return to school to further their studies. A large number of people who have left school before completing 12 years of secondary study are either unable to proceed with their chosen career path or have not been successful in finding full time employment. Some of these people make the decision to return to school to further their education and to extend their work related skills. A large majority are young people who left school at an early age for various personal reasons, including breakdown in the family unit or plainly and simply because the family needed them to enter the work force in order to contribute financially to the family budget. </PARA>
<PARA>  Over the last 12 months the cases brought to my attention show clearly that these young people have had gainful employment since leaving school. However, I have found that all too often that is not full time employment, a 37 1/2 hour week. These young people have secured work either on a permanent part time or casual basis, earning enough from their part time or casual work to make them financially independent. They are being paid the higher penalty rates applicable to casual and part time work and are financially better off than some of their counterparts in full time employment. These young people have been able to earn more than they would have received if they had relied solely on the Job Search allowance. Taking into account their earnings for each fortnightly period, which were over the allowable limit, they have received no Government financial assistance under Job Search. They have therefore been fully self-supporting and independent of assistance from their families in the time immediately prior to their returning to study. </PARA>
<PARA>  The difficulties for these young men and women arise when they apply for Austudy assistance. Upon applying for the independent rate for Austudy assistance an assessment is made on the basis of hours worked each week by the applicant. Under the eligibility criteria a minimum of 37 1/2 hours per week must have been worked by the applicant to be deemed as eligible for the independent rate of assistance. In the majority of cases a minimum total of 37 1/2 hours or more was not worked each week. Therefore, assessment of their applications at the independent rate is denied--even though the applicants have been self-supporting in this period with part time or casual employment. Assessment must then be made of parental income. No provision is made for the applicants making a reasonable wage from their casual or part time earnings in this period, nor the fact that they have been fully able to support themselves with their earnings from their casual and part time work. </PARA>
<PARA>  When one takes into consideration Australia's present employment climate, eligibility for Austudy payments based solely on hours worked before independent status can be deemed to have been reached is not a fair means of assessment. This clause must be removed from the Austudy criteria immediately so as not to discourage our young people from returning to study. </PARA>
<PARA>  Assessment should be made on wages earned. This is only fair. The question should be asked as to whether a livable wage was earned each week from casual or part time work by the applicant, and not what hours were worked per week by the applicant. In many instances, above award wages and penalty rates paid to casual and part time workers make it possible for a wage earner to live comfortably on the casual wages earned. The wage earned by a person, not the number of hours worked, is taken into account when assessment is made for financial assistance under the Job Search allowance. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe that this same assessment should apply and that it is only fair when a person applies for assistance under the Austudy program. As a government, we must continue to look at ways to encourage young Australian men and women to return to study. Young people must be encouraged to return to school to further their work related skills to enable them to compete successfully in Australia's competitive job market. The Government must remove from this system the very things that discourage young people from returning to education. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I have done on a number of previous occasions, I would like to draw to the attention of the House the plight of people who are ineligible for Austudy benefits as they are just over the allowable income threshold. In my electorate, some people wishing to go on to higher education have had to leave the rural and community areas to set up a second home in the metropolitan area. These people come from varied backgrounds. Some are the sons and daughters of farmers and others are the children of battling wage earners, such as steelworkers, who find the costs of setting up a second home a financial drain on the family budget. </PARA>
<PARA>  Rental accommodation in the metropolitan area is expensive and hard to come by. The cost of living expenses, such as utilities, clothing, food and travel expenses, adds up to a considerable sum of additional money which needs to be found each week by the family to support the student living away from home. An average working-class family with other children living at home to consider also cannot support the additional cost of a second home for a long period without a drastic change to family life. Many families are doing without just to provide the basic essentials for a child living away from home. </PARA>
<PARA>  Therefore, I once again raise the question of a tax zone allowance being introduced for anybody who lives outside, for example, a 150-kilometre radius of a suitable educational institution. Changes should be made to enable people to claim under the taxation system the costs of setting up and maintaining a second home for educational purposes if they are unable to claim assistance under the Austudy program. The cost of maintaining a second home is prohibitive to people from all walks of life, be they farmers, BHP workers, BHAS workers, railway or powerhouse workers. All have the problem of providing assistance to their children if they go on to further education. </PARA>
<PARA>  Some make the choice to uproot the family from their country home and move to the metropolitan area. We on this side of the House talk about decentralisation and how important it is for people to remain in regional and country areas. If we are not going to give the basic support for young children to have as equal an opportunity as their city cousins in an educational program, we are certainly not carrying out our policies and are denying them that opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA>  As a government, we must urgently consider the problems being experienced in an attempt to provide assistance needed. I call on the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) and the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) to look closely at these anomalies in the Austudy scheme and make the necessary changes to ensure that any person wishing to return to study will not be penalised for doing so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-During the winter recess I took advantage of study leave and visited Hungary, Czechoslovakia and what was formerly East Germany. With the developments that have taken place in these countries since the momentous events of the past two years, it is immediately apparent on the streets of Budapest and Prague, for example, that a grim and dour system is being replaced by bustling signs of capitalism. Street vendors are plying their wares everywhere and Western goods seem to be available at most shops, certainly in the tourist areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  After 45 years of communist control, suspicion of capitalism remains strong and hopes for a quick transition to a market economy are being somewhat dashed as disappointments and bitterness are emerging. There is a prevailing grimness in that the period of transition for many of these countries is going to be much more painful than anticipated. </PARA>
<PARA>  By any measure, eastern Europe is in the grip of a paralysing recession where GDPs are actually shrinking. People I spoke to believe that the turnaround cannot be expected until well into the middle of this decade. There can be no doubting that the task of reform ahead is gargantuan, and few of us could have anticipated the enormity of the task in turning socialism into capitalism. </PARA>
<PARA>  In Hungary at the moment, inflation is high and unemployment rampant. Admittedly, foreign investment is growing, although some commentators are claiming that it is much smaller than might have been expected. Paradoxically, the growth of private enterprises does seem to be surging and it would seem that the entrepreneurial zeal of a people suffocated for 45 years is about to be given free reign. That, by any account, is indeed a marvellous thing. </PARA>
<PARA>  Budapest is a delight in that it is a very beautiful city. Yet, despite the main shopping centres in the immediate vicinity of tourist areas being awash with items for sale, and despite the average Hungarian having access to local clothing and groceries, they clearly have a way to go before they reach the levels of consumption in the West. </PARA>
<PARA>  Shortages exist, but not as many as one might have expected, and so the picture is encouraging. Hungary did get a head start in reform. As the leading reformer under the communists, it illustrates most vividly the potential that these countries have to adopt a free market economy. For example, prior to the fall of the communists in 1989, Hungary already had rudiments of a stock exchange in place, together with a few small private businesses and state owned commercial banks. </PARA>
<PARA>  Now, the private sector in Hungary is said to already contribute roughly one third of the gross domestic product and it has attracted more direct investment than any other eastern European country; so far about $US1 billion, according to a recent study. The down side of the equation is that Hungary is also the most heavily indebted of eastern European countries, and we here in Australia know the danger of that. Nonetheless, trade barriers have been lowered and the privatisation of shops and firms appears to be going ahead steadily, if slowly. </PARA>
<PARA>  At this point, I would like to commend Ambassador Townsend and his staff in Budapest for the marvellous work that they are doing. Considerable business contacts have already been made in Hungary by Australians and we should remember that we owe a tremendous debt to Australians of Hungarian origin in this regard. I hope that we shall continue to build on these beneficial contacts with vigour and governmental encouragement. </PARA>
<PARA>  Prague, on the other hand, displayed more of the austerity of the past. With little wartime damage, the city remains charming and beautiful, with recent attempts to restore some of its fine buildings giving a sense of renewal. Wenceslas Square, which is known worldwide, remains imposing. Yet shortages are more obvious than in Hungary. Crystal and china of rare beauty and elegance cram every tourist spot, but in the other stores there does not seem to be any abundance or variety of goods at all. Unfilled shelves, limited variety and queues at all counters suggest that much remains to be done if there is to be a consumer led advance into a market economy. </PARA>
<PARA>  Private businesses still account for only 2 per cent of GDP, as opposed to a staggering 33 1/3 per cent in Hungary. Plans for a stock market have yet to be agreed upon, although a mass privatisation scheme using vouchers is planned for early 1992. This must be watched with keen interest by the West. Trade barriers here have been lowered, although I have been told that relatively high tariffs still exist on many imports that compete with local goods. </PARA>
<PARA>  Inflation in Czechoslovakia is dangerously high and unemployment is rising as the effects of the loss of the Soviet markets and the move to capitalism cause their hiccups. The Czechoslovakian Government has taken certain measures but they really have to move urgently with their privatisation planning of large undertakings. As the Economist magazine mentioned:</PARA>
<PARA>Thousands of firms are now drifting in the limbo between a command economy without commands and a market economy still lacking the spur of private ownership. </PARA>
<PARA>  One becomes conscious of the lack of interest by the European Community, certainly on trading matters with any of the Eastern trading nations. `Miserable' and `selfish', are words one hears from those East Europeans who talk about trade. It has a familiar ring for Australians when one thinks of the incredibly huge farm subsidies enjoyed by the European Community's continental farmers. </PARA>
<PARA>  As far as eastern Germany is concerned, it is in a far more favourable position, of course. Saxony has been termed the boom state of the East. Already an integral part of the new Germany, it is somewhat breathtaking to realise that since union only a year ago there is a net increase of 40,000 local private firms in Saxony alone. Some $US12 billion has been invested by West German firms. There are the never-ending antique shops or second-hand shops here matched with exciting displays of items that are managing to compete with established companies not only in western Germany, but in western Europe as well. Even so, former East German industries appear to be on the verge of total collapse. </PARA>
<PARA>  My reason for visiting Dresden stemmed primarily from my long time interest in the reasoning behind British wartime policy to virtually obliterate this city during a bombing raid in the final stages of the Second World War--I have not had that properly described to me yet. Dresden was a city of legendary beauty in its heyday--Florence on the Elbe, as it was known. Having a tradition of being the powerhouse of Germany before 1945, it is fascinating to see that firms such as Volkswagen have started building $US3 billion worth of car plants to take advantage of the traditional skills that have survived the communistic disease of 45 years. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is obvious that the state of Saxony will be the centre of attraction for all other eastern European ambitions--cities such as Dresden, Leipzig, Chemnitz and Zwickau will be the spots to watch. It is ironic that Saxony has the same official unemployment rate as Australia--around 10 per cent. For my part, I have more confidence in the capacity of Premier Biedenkopf of Saxony to redress the position than I have of the Hawke-Kerin or the Hawke-Keating Government to improve Australia's employment situation. Even though that Premier believes western Germany has to transfer $100 billion deutschmarks or $US60 billion annually to eastern Germany for the foreseeable future, I believe he will succeed--these figures do not take into account the burgeoning tourist industry and Dresden's plans to take advantage of it all. </PARA>
<PARA>  But for all the economic reform problems, so too are the urban environment problems massive. Eastern Germany probably exemplifies the region's problems as well as any other state, with certain sections of rivers far from crystalline, lignite mining areas cratered like the moon's surface and not the least of all this being the sulphurous clouds of smoke billowing across the border from neighbouring Czechoslovakia's coal plants. Saxons estimate that over half of their air pollution emanates from such plants. That is the horrendous legacy of environmental degradation left by 45 years of communist rule. The sorry state of the environment in this part of the world is palpable evidence that bureaucratic regulation, central planning and a poor economy do not go hand in hand with environmental protection. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the short time remaining to me, there are two aspects I would like to mention: one is the problem of property ownership and the second is the problem of the absence of institutions and institutional law to service and consequently control a capitalistic system. </PARA>
<PARA>  The first is the question of private ownership, but I shall take my time and refer to this in more detail at a later stage. In talking to a number of people while I was there, I was very distressed to find that there was a certain anti-semitism creeping into negotiations. It is my sincere hope that this is not a reality and I would commend to the officials in the countries I visited to be vigilant in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would like to conclude by quoting from an article in the Economist I read recently which says it all:</PARA>
<PARA>Eastern Europe has embarked on a difficult journey towards liberal democracy and a market economy. The faster it goes for that goal, the better its chances of getting there. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I rise in this debate to make a public call for an inquiry into the price of liquefied petroleum gas in Queensland by the Prices Surveillance Authority and I specifically target the gas companies, not the petroleum industry. There is clear evidence that has been gathered by the Central Queensland Consumers Association, by the Motor Traders Association of Queensland and myself that consumers throughout central Queensland and Queensland generally, particular outside the metropolitan area of Brisbane, are being forced to pay exorbitant prices for both domestic and auto gas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I place on record my appreciation for the excellent work that has been done by the MTAQ because its service station division during September did a quick survey right across Queensland and came up with some very interesting information about pricing practices. </PARA>
<PARA>  The price of LPG, for instance, in Brisbane at the time was 24c a litre. In Rockhampton and Mackay it was 43.9c. In Townsville and Cairns it was 43.8c. In Mount Isa it was 48.9c. In places such as Goondiwindi it was 42.9c. In south-western Queensland areas it was between 44c and 49c. On the Gold Coast and the Sunshine Coast it was 31.9c. In your own electorate, Mr Deputy Speaker, it was 30.9c. That is significant when we compare it with Brisbane at 24c. We should also realise that not so long ago in Brisbane it was 17c a litre--and in some of the southern States it is still around 17c a litre. But in central Queensland, it is as high as 43.9c. </PARA>
<PARA>  The question that arises is: why are companies like Boral charging this amount of money? They can blame transportation, storage and retail mark-ups, but the MTAQ found, for instance, that the retail mark-ups from the service station proprietors ranged from three to four cents. </PARA>
<PARA>  So we start to ask why. But we really ask why when we find, using the PSA study that was carried out in August, that the wholesale price--that is, the producer wholesale price of LPG--was $240 per tonne. That is about 12.2c a litre. So we see that in central Queensland the wholesale producer price is 12.2c, but the retail price to motorists is 43.9c. </PARA>
<PARA>  We can go further. The mind boggles when we come across some of the figures for the price of domestic gas--and there is not much difference between bottled gas and auto gas. The wholesale price is 12.2c a litre--as we found in August--but we find that throughout Queensland, including Brisbane, the price for domestic gas is just unbelievable. The lowest price in Brisbane was 48.7c. Another price found in Brisbane was 52.9c. Keep in mind that the wholesale price is 12c. In Rockhampton the lowest price was 46.85c, but the price rose to as much as a dollar a litre depending on how much was purchased. So if we were to buy under 21 litres, we would pay up to a dollar. The prices in other areas were as follows: Clermont, 83.59c per litre; Mount Morgan, 84c; Gladstone, 86.42c; Emerald, 87.25c; Biloela, 88.02c; Mackay, 87.18c; Sarina, 87.68c. It is quite amazing that, with a wholesale price of around 12c, the retailer--and this is the gas company--is charging Queenslanders eight times that amount, in some instances a mark-up of at least 700 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  These supply companies seem to adjust their price upwards whenever they have the whim to do so. I have had pensioners, taxi drivers and pie vendors complaining that the price can differ by $10 a cylinder within a couple of weeks. They usually sell them in 45 kilogram cylinders, which works out at 88.25 litres. There can be a shift of $10 a cylinder. Again, the delivery prices can change from week to week. Whilst they say, `Well, look it is the first 21 litres', or in Mackay, 23 litres, `that you pay for at 84c and 85c and then it drops down to 55c', a lot of pensioners never use great quantities and so they are always locked into the high price element; they are always paying around 83c or 84c per litre. I suggest that the suppliers are simply taking advantage of the monopoly that they have. </PARA>
<PARA>  Some suppliers are trying to compete. In Gladstone, in the electorate of Hinkler--which is well represented by Brian Courtice, the honourable member for Hinkler--the Boral gas price was 86.42c, but Elgas, in trying to compete, had got its price down to 58c. The question that arises here is that, if Elgas can deliver that price domestically at 58.1c a litre, why is Boral charging 86.42c? Boral is doing it everywhere. We have seen mark-ups of 275 per cent for auto gas, but when we come to domestic it is up to 800 per cent. Consumers are expected simply to pay this. One can imagine what rural people, those who live on the land who use bottled gas as their main energy source, are paying. </PARA>
<PARA>  A lot of people said, `Oh, it is because of the war', so we checked back. I realise that during the Kuwait period we did have some problems. I pulled out the wholesale figures for the time. Prior to the Kuwait-Iraq war, the wholesale price of propane was 11.7c a litre. It rose to 19.5c but it is now back down to 12.1c. So the issue is not with the oil companies, it is with the supplier. </PARA>
<PARA>  We need to appreciate that for the last four or five months wholesale prices stayed around that level. In May the price was 12.6c a litre; June, 11.9c; July, 12.1c; August, 12.1c; and September, 12.2c. So the deregulation that this Government brought about on 1 January has been advantageous in terms of getting competition at the wholesale level because the prices are all around 12c. It has gone wrong at the retail price stage. The gas suppliers who buy from the oil companies are making a lot of money because we no longer control the situation. I think we need to use the Prices Surveillance Act to ensure that we can bring the gas industry--the gas suppliers--under those provisions so that they have to show cause why an increase is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>  When one notes also that LPG does not attract any tax, it is clear that there is a major problem. I hear people saying that they want to change from motor spirit, or petrol, to LPG because LPG is so much cheaper. What people do not realise is that there is no excise duty--Commonwealth tax--on LPG. At the moment, the tax on petrol is 26.5c a litre. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let us take Rockhampton as a quick example. In Rockhampton, LPG is 43.9c a litre, with no tax; petrol is 65.9c a litre, with 26.5c a litre in tax. In other words, petrol is, in effect, cheaper than LPG. But it should not be. If we look at the wholesale price, the base price, we see that LPG should be so much cheaper than petrol. The first reason is that it has no tax and the second is that its producer-wholesale price is so much below that of petrol; yet that is not the case. </PARA>
<PARA>  I think that consumers have a right to ask why. It is not just a problem in central Queensland. It is not just a problem in the electorate of Capricornia. It spreads across New South Wales; it goes into South Australia; and it goes into all other areas of this nation. I think it is time we did something about it. </PARA>
<PARA>  I accept that in this instance it is better for industry to work in a deregulated environment. I think that it has been proven that we have deregulated at the wholesale level where we have kept prices at around 12c a litre over the many months since the Gulf war finished, but the retailers--in this instance the gas companies that buy from refineries that buy from the oil companies--are ripping off a lot of Australians. They are ripping off older Australians and they are ripping off motorists, taxi drivers and fleet owners. They are also affecting our tourist industry. If one moves away from the capital cities, one finds that exorbitant prices are paid for bottled gas. It is simply not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA>  Last night I spoke to Professor Allan Fels of the PSA--he is now also the head of the TPC. I told him that I was raising this matter and I asked him to take up the issue. I believe the PSA, in cooperation with the TPC, needs to look at this because it could well be that some of these gas companies are misusing their market power, in which case section 46 will apply. We need to have the PSA initiate an investigation, even if it is only a trial or pioneer study in Queensland, just to find out who is doing what and why and, I would hope, to do something to protect consumers who are the purchasers of LPG, both auto and domestic. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-My grievance today is about the dwindling rights of parents and the increasingly defiant stance of government departments in trampling those rights under the weight of ill-conceived regulations, laws and bureaucracy. My attention was first drawn to the appalling treatment of parents when a mother came to me and pleaded to be told where her 15-year-old daughter was living. This family is not a perfect model of family life but I ask: which family is?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  These parents have six children and both parents are unemployed. Five children are permitted by the Government to live with their parents, but one has been bureaucratically abducted. During this year of agony there has been a wall of silence from government agencies. They have said to these parents, `No, we cannot tell you where your daughter is. No, you are not allowed legal aid. No, you cannot visit your daughter. No, you cannot be told why we, the Government, are keeping her out of your care'. If this home is unfit to nurture children, why has the Government allowed five children to stay?</PARA>
<PARA>  When community welfare officers were asked why this child was given homeless assistance when she had a home, no satisfactory answer was given. When I inquired about the reason for her receiving homeless assistance and asked whether it was sexual abuse, violence or nowhere to sleep, there was a wall of silence. Instead of parents being given their due right, their opinions are ignored or swept aside in these situations. </PARA>
<PARA>  As a former shadow Minister for Aboriginal affairs, I can recall countless stories about the Native Welfare Act days in different States of this nation when Aboriginal children were forcibly removed from their families without adequate reason. Today, the same thing is happening, but it is happening to the whole community. Again, it stems from the mistaken belief that governments know best, that people are the pawns of government and that their children can be shifted on the chessboard of life without consultation with parents. </PARA>
<PARA>  When it comes to making a judgment about the relative capacities of government versus families to nurture our young, I am for families. Today, the removal is not by force but by inducement and enticement by government agencies. The effect, however, is the same--removal of children by governments from parents. I am not saying that the community has no responsibility for caring for young people who have legitimate and verifiable reasons to seek help; it does. Where there is child abuse by parents or others in the community, the community has responsibilities. But what we now have is parental abuse at the hands of government. </PARA>
<PARA>  The community also has a responsibility to ensure that such abuse is stopped. Parental authority is undermined, family life is destabilised and young people's lives are being decimated by government action. I have examples of young people being counselled in our schools, our courts and our welfare agencies and being told, `You do not have to go home if you do not want to'. This is being said by so-called professional counsellors to 14- and 15-year-old people in this country. It is not isolated. It is occurring in many parts of the country; I come across it repeatedly in my talking with parents, teachers and people who are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>  If children take that advice, they are then told about youth centres or other government accommodation centres and a bed is found. Parents are often not told that the child has taken that action. As one parent said, `Ringing a youth shelter is like ringing the dog pound. It is filled with the same emotions'. Parents ring youth shelters in the desperate hope that they will find their son or daughter. </PARA>
<PARA>  For students under 16, there is no obligation on the shelter to notify parents, only another government agency, the Department of Community Services and Health. Also, parents cannot be contacted without the young person's permission. If permission is not given, no contact can be made. I believe that the way these regulations apply is absolutely disgraceful. Once the Department is notified by carers at the shelter, it also has no obligation to contact parents or police. This means that police often spend days or maybe weeks searching for missing persons because they are not notified by a government department. I have illustrations of that in my own electorate. </PARA>
<PARA>  Scarce funds are being used and parents' natural rights are being abused. Not only are children encouraged by government counsellors to leave home without reference to parents; government literature also promotes it. In fact, one gets the distinct impression that the Government wants homelessness to be a growth industry in 1991-92. One of its pamphlets states:</PARA>
<PARA>Life is tough when you're young . . . if you can't live at home or you have hassles at home. </PARA>
<PARA>HOMELESS</PARA>
<PARA>Let us know. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>We are only here for a year so get your skates on. </PARA>
<PARA>The implication there is that, if a lot of young people do not come and use this facility and show that there is a lot of homelessness, then it will not be here next year--`get your skates on--roll up, young people; the long term results depend on you'. Another pamphlet promotes this fact: `you can get a higher independent rate of Austudy if you are out on your own'. Therefore, the word is: `leave home, get higher Austudy and you will be right. Get away from parental authority and any sense of decent standards'. That is what is being promoted. A financial inducement to claim homelessness is clear. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is hard for one not to come to the conclusion that government agencies are soliciting for clients to bolster numbers so that they will retain funding and thus the staff can keep their jobs. For an increasing number of young people the desire for freedom and independence is being accentuated by lavish government advertising, to those children's ultimate detriment. </PARA>
<PARA>  In my area there is a growing concern among parents about youth shelters, and rightly so. Guidelines for who is homeless are not being followed. Invalid reasons for homelessness are being accepted. Stealing is occurring, and there is a lack of supervision, leading to drunkenness, drug use and compromising sexual situations. As one parent stated:</PARA>
<PARA>In one shelter girls stick knives in the doors in order to prevent being raped in one's bed and in another shelter two male residents shoot up on drugs. </PARA>
<PARA>Taxpayers' money is also being abused. For example, a youth worker claims that a 20-year-old youth, fitted for the second time with a hearing aid costing $800, rarely wears the aid because of the lack of supervision and self-discipline. In a second case, a young student was provided with spectacles at a cost of approximately $200--again, they are rarely worn. This is not all. At the same time that taxpayers' money was being used for these purchases, which are probably quite genuine, these young people, who rarely use the aids, had sufficient cash available for drugs, alcohol and other undisciplined activities. A youth worker who has resigned in disgust at the way things are being run says that neither youth should have qualified as homeless. That is where it starts. The guidelines are not being adhered to. </PARA>
<PARA>  Mr Deputy Speaker, I put it to you that, wherever governments have usurped the legitimate role and responsibilities of parents, waste, chaos, misery and heartache have increased. In this country at this stage young people are being solicited to leave their homes so that they can get more money through Austudy, and the rules are not being applied appropriately. There is a lack of discipline in many of these youth shelters throughout the country. I am sure that my electorate is no different from much of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  The way in which these facilities, some of which are needed, are being run is a great tragedy. In my area there is prima facie evidence of wastage, maladministration and low standards of behaviour in government funded youth shelters. This is jeopardising the lives of significant numbers of young people. I ask that the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe), here at the Federal level, and Mr Jackson, at the State level, investigate the matters that I have raised.

<TITLE>Youth Problems--Micro-economic Reform</TITLE>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HI4">Mr PETER MORRIS</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Shortland)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(1.19 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In my area, in the Hunter, we do not have the problem that the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) has. The problem with most of the youth that I come in contact with is their parents. The failure of parents to accept proper responsibility for the raising of their children, the casting out, sexual abuse, physical abuse, denial and rejection of so many young Australians by their parents is not a problem that governments can fix; it is not a problem that members of parliament can fix; it is problem that only Australian parents can fix.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Whilst the honourable member for Braddon may have a particular problem in his region, my experience of visiting youth refuges has been a horrific shock to me to learn about and see the results of what parents can do to young girls and to young boys. Overall, we are all concerned about getting the best results we can for our youth. To that extent, I hope that everybody in the community comes to recognise that the problems of Australian youth are national problems for which we all share responsibility, whatever the nature of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA>  I bring to the attention of the Parliament today the issue of micro-economic reform, how it is spoken about so much by the private sector and how so much of the private sector does so little about it, other than mouth the phrase. It is not some type of new remedy; simply chanting micro-economic reform is not going to produce the increases in productivity, efficiency and competitiveness that this country needs. </PARA>
<PARA>  Micro-economic reform is improvement in productivity, efficiency, working arrangements, operational practices, marketing arrangements and management at the industry and individual business level. Government can make a contribution in government controlled services and those services operate under government fiat. But at the end of the day, it is the individual managers and businesses that have to get their act together. </PARA>
<PARA>  Management is far too slow in far too much of Australia to embrace the challenge of improving its performance. So much is spoken about it and yet so little is done about it in so much of Australia. Within that program of micro-economic reform we have to look towards improving the quality of working life, the quality of training arrangements and availability and the quality of leadership from management within each workplace across this nation. </PARA>
<PARA>  People need to feel they belong to the firm that they are working for. They need to feel that what they are doing is worth while, so that they can be proud of the job they are doing and of the product they help to produce. Within that, the need for quality assurance is an essential part of reform. </PARA>
<PARA>  Wherever we talk of this throughout the world and around this nation, we find that the two most important things that customers want are, firstly, consistency and reliable quality. Customers want to know that the product or the service is up to standard and does the job for which it is being purchased. Secondly, they want to know that the delivery of that product or service is reliable, so that they can build a business around the knowledge that the materials bought and the components that are being supplied will be of consistent quality and will arrive on time, as required. Then, price may be discussed. </PARA>
<PARA>  The need for greater and widening quality assurance is an issue that has not yet been developed enough by Australian industry. I have a great respect for the Metal Trades Industry Association. In my view, it is probably the leading employer organisation in this country. It is certainly the most progressive.</PARA>
<PARA>  I noticed in the press over recent days the comments by Mr Bert Evans, for whom I have a great personal respect, about the slowness in micro-economic reform. He referred to government areas. Certainly in government areas we would want things to go faster but they are improving; for example, on the waterfront and in waterfront related services, where much of the liability is on the private sector and not on government, and in transport generally. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will sweep past that because I want to come to things that can be done by industry itself and the things that Mr Evans himself has pointed to so often in the past: the process of award restructuring; decentralising the decision making process; getting the people on the shop floor involved in the decision making process; motivating each employee; developing a flexible, trained work force; and widening the use of multiskilling so that people can carry out a broader range of tasks. Progress needs to be faster in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to move on to how that affects my own region of the Hunter. The Hunter is a microcosm of this nation. We have virtually everything the nation has to offer, except deep desert and snow. In the Hunter we are ahead of the rest of Australia in respect of industrial relations, award restructuring, operational changes in the work place and relationships between employees and employees. But that does not mean to say that everything that needs to be done has been done. A great deal needs to be done. But whatever progress we have made, we are generally ahead of the rest of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government, in this Budget, has before it a better cities program. The Hunter and Newcastle will share in that program; I am confident about that. But what I want to see is a better regions program. In the great regions of Australia, especially the Hunter region--the others I will not name--we have people with the skills that are required. We have a reliable work force, a good system of industrial relations and involvement by people in the change and progress that need to be undertaken, good educational facilities, good transport links, a congestion-free port, and a commitment from the people of the Hunter to the improvement of productivity and to the improvement in export effort. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to mention two firms. R&amp; Transport is a young Hunter firm with strong management, a desire to do the job well and a firm that is not afraid to look for new opportunities. That firm took advantage of the resources boom of the 1970s and transported construction and fabrication materials to some of Queensland's open-cut mine developments. It expanded in 1984-85 and transfers the main hazardous chemical used in mine explosions--ammonium nitrate. In doing that it broke from its traditional transport base--from road to rail. The firm transports aluminium from the Tomago smelter to Newcastle's wharves. It started that process in 1984. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the process of change, as a firm based in Newcastle, it has developed a timber importing distribution service in the past two years. It has lifted its productivity; it has offered a service that is reliable; and it has gone from a 1989 normal shipment of 180 loads taking 12 days to clear the berth, to a norm of 330 loads of timber within seven days being cleared from the berth. In relation to this the Assistant General Manager stated:</PARA>
<PARA>This has been a demonstration of what can be achieved when all parties agree to work constructively to change some of the older customs and practices. </PARA>
<PARA>It has done this by breaking into the Sydney market. Because of the excellent transport links between Sydney and Newcastle, as a result of our $600m national highway investment and electrification of the rail service, it is feeding northern Sydney and north-west Sydney more efficiently, faster and, in price terms, better than can be done through the port of Sydney. That is an example of what can be done. </PARA>
<PARA>  The firm of Sandvik is another that is involved in supplying the mining industry. That firm, prior to its current ownership, had 20 years of mixed profitability, mostly loss. Managers were not managers in the sense that they are today. Today's managers are actively involved on the shop floor, consulting continually and assisting employees to arrive at solutions on the shop floor. This means productivity gains, and they have been significant. The new general manager has concentrated on changing the organisational structure, and the policy is that if managers do not change, or will not change, then you change the managers. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are no problems with the unions. They work together--site agreements, award restructuring, skills audits are all in place. There is still a long way to go, but good harmony exists. They have gone to a much flatter management structure. The industrial relations matters, in principle, are handled by the general manager himself. On a day-to-day basis they are handled by the supervisors. In most Australian employment places, you will find that most managers do not know how to spell industrial relations and certainly have no knowledge of what can be done on the shop floor. </PARA>
<PARA>  These are two examples in our region of what can be done. We encourage other firms in metropolitan Australia to look at what the regions of Australia have to offer in terms of work force, skills, reliability of labour, transport links and overall a better level of productivity and of efficiency. I bring this information to the attention of the Parliament today with the objective of making a greater number of Australian firms aware of the advantages and opportunities that are available to them by establishing their operations or transferring their operations into the Hunter region where the jobs are needed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Last week the Federal Government lodged its nomination of Fraser Island and the Great Sandy Region for inclusion on the World Heritage List. That nomination occurred despite repeated assurances from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the former environment Minister, Senator Richardson, that it would not happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The decision to nominate Fraser Island no doubt arose from the Fitzgerald inquiry. Tony Fitzgerald was commissioned to report on the future use and management of that particular region. I do not want to comment today on the merits of his recommendation, just merely to observe that there were many who felt that his recommendations were a surprise and did not reflect the weight of evidence that was put before him. </PARA>
<PARA>  Nonetheless, the nomination has been lodged. Initially, the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) had indicated that it would not be possible for the Government to prepare the necessary nomination papers in order for the 1 October deadline to be met. In making that assessment the Minister was correct. A lot of detailed preparation needs to be done to ensure that a nomination is correct and in order. In addition, repeated assurances have been given to the local community, particularly by the State Labor Government, that there would be extensive consultation in the preparation of management plans and the details of the boundaries before anything would be locked into concrete. Those assurances were repeatedly given to endeavour to allay some of the concerns in the local region. </PARA>
<PARA>  It came as a major surprise, only a month or so ago, to learn that the Commonwealth had reassessed its position and that the nomination would be lodged in about three weeks. That decision meant that all of the previous guarantees of consultation were to be dishonoured and that the Government would proceed irrespective of local community concerns. The categorical assurances about the detailed consultations were to be overlooked entirely. The Government engaged consultants, as I understand it, to rush the preparation of the nomination, and it arrived in Paris, I understand, by the 1 October date. </PARA>
<PARA>  This has raised a number of concerns in the local community. Fitzgerald, in his report, prepared a map which recommended the boundaries for nomination. It included Fraser Island, the Cooloola National Park, Hervey Bay and the Great Sandy Straits regions. It specifically excluded the Camp Kerr military training reserve near Tin Can Bay. Tony Fitzgerald did make recommendations about the future use of quite a lot of other Commonwealth property in the area, but he specifically excluded the Tin Can Bay military reserve from his recommended area. </PARA>
<PARA>  Later, the State Government published what it called an amended map of the proposed area. It was apparently on public display, but I understand that one had to go to the office of the State Labor member for the area to actually see it. That map also did not include the Tin Can Bay military reserve. But, when the nomination was presented to Paris, the Commonwealth had apparently unilaterally decided to add this significant new additional area to the area to be included in the World Heritage Listing. </PARA>
<PARA>  Despite the community concern about the precise nature of the boundaries, discussions on intricate details about how it would affect individual properties, and even promises from the State Labor member that he would arrange professional surveys to be done so that individual property owners could see what proportion of their property would actually be World Heritage listed, despite all of these discussions about intricate details, the Government unilaterally acted without any local consultation to add a significant additional area to that which was World Heritage nominated. </PARA>
<PARA>  In fact, that area is not small. It adds 50 per cent to the mainland area of the nomination. It occurred, as I said before, without any local consultation. There had been no public debate; the idea had not even been suggested. The local State Labor members of parliament had not been told, the local shire council had not been told, the Tin Can Bay people had not been told; no local even knew until after the nomination had been lodged. Of course, then, it was too late. </PARA>
<PARA>  There had not been any local pressure to include the area. Fitzgerald, as I said earlier, had not recommended it; the local community did not want it; even the Fraser Island Defenders Organisation and the radical conservation groups had not been pressing to have it included. The Government took the action quite unilaterally and without apparently any consultation or concern for the wishes of local people. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Camp Kerr training reserve is no insignificant field for occasional military manoeuvres. It is the Army's major Queensland heavy artillery firing range. It has been bombarded for more than 30 years by heavy artillery, anti-tank weapons, mortars and the like. It is extensively used for training and it is considered to be critical to the Army's operation in southern Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA>  My predecessor and I have been regularly contacted by people in Tin Can Bay who have been concerned about not only the noise that occurs from the day-to-day use of this particular reserve, but also the shock waves and the damage caused to buildings by the heavy bombardment. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Army has regularly amended its method of operation to suit the needs of the people of Tin Can Bay. The Army is indeed to be commended on the way in which it has accommodated local concerns. </PARA>
<PARA>  This reserve is also of great significance to the people of Tin Can Bay and the economy of the local region. Naturally, the local area is delighted to have such large numbers of armed personnel, servicemen, in its region, who contribute considerably to the local economy. The Army does not consider it to be optional. When I was aware that the Fitzgerald inquiry was looking at regions that could perhaps encompass the Tin Can Bay Army reserve area, I wrote to the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Mr Bilney) raising my concerns that Fitzgerald could conceivably make recommendations which would affect this area and that perhaps his Department should take an interest. He wrote back to me, assured me that that was in fact the case, then added these words:</PARA>
<PARA>Wide Bay Training Area is an important training area whose continued use the Army considers essential. It is the only field firing range within one day's drive for Brisbane-based units, including 6 Brigade. Its importance was stressed to Mr Fitzgerald during his visit. </PARA>
<PARA>So the Army considers it to be of great importance. The conservationists, it is clear, were also caught by surprise. They are now trying to find reasons to justify the inclusion of this region in the World Heritage listed nominated area. The good old reliable ground parrot, which seems to be a remarkably ubiquitous endangered species whenever any development project is proposed, has again turned up, along with the tusked frog, in this particular region. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, the Army must be environmentally sensitive. War is an environmental disaster and any pictures of an ex-battlefield will certainly testify to that. The Army also needs to be responsible in its use of its training areas. But to suggest that an area that has been blasted, bulldozed, bombed, shelled, mortared and mined and is still regularly used for firing heavy artillery and anti-tank weapons is now suitable for World Heritage listing is clearly a nonsense and makes a mockery of the whole process. </PARA>
<PARA>  We have been told that it is inconsistent with World Heritage guidelines to continue to selectively harvest timber from Fraser Island and the Great Sandy Region. That is not in order, but it seems to be quite okay to blast the area to smithereens with heavy artillery and still recognise it for World Heritage listing. Is it that our military power has become so degraded that we cannot even injure a frog or frighten a ground parrot any more?</PARA>
<PARA>  What of the future? Clearly, the environmentalists are unlikely to allow this continued activity in a World Heritage area. There is no doubt going to be massive pressure for change. The convenience of the frogs is likely to be given a higher priority than defence needs. This great pressure to add to the national park land grab is likely to be spread also to Tin Can Bay. The nomination of Camp Kerr heavy artillery firing range has made a mockery of the World Heritage listing guidelines. Its future has been placed in jeopardy, along with the quality of training for our defence forces. It seems we must stop logging and limit tourism and coastal fishing, but it is all right to blast to smithereens an area nominated for the World Heritage List. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-My grievance is the soon-to-be-announced Opposition policy on a goods and services tax. I hear that it will be announced on Friday, 18 October. In just eight days the fascinating details of the goods and services tax will be heard. At that time, presumably we will learn the details about three important elements of the goods and services tax. The first element is the rate at which the tax will be struck, whether it is to be 15 per cent or more. The second element is the important question of the number of exemptions that will apply; in other words, whether or not the sale of the family home will be taxed under GST, et cetera. We will learn how fair dinkum this GST tax will be. The third element involves the consequential changes to income tax that will arise because of the GST. What is the nature of the income tax system that we will see announced in eight days time as a consequence of the introduction of a GST?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Those three elements together will be the areas that I will be looking at because they will indicate the politics of the GST. They will indicate to us where the Opposition is fishing for votes. Quite clearly, an introduction of the GST and a consequential change to income tax will certainly look after those people on higher incomes. I will be very keen indeed to see who it punishes and just how well the politicians on the other side of the chamber here are fishing for votes amongst the lower, middle income earners who, we all know, are so crucial to the next election. In eight days time we will be asking questions of members of the Opposition. Let me pose some others that need to be asked and answered by members of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA>  My big problem with the goods and services tax is not just that it may raise prices; I really ask what it will do for the economy. Will it increase the pool of savings by penalising consumption of Australians? Will it actually do anything to help the Australian economy? For instance, will it improve export earnings by permanently dampening domestic spending?  We do not know the answers to those questions. Not even when the Opposition brings down the details of GST, will it be able to answer convincingly that the GST will do anything good for the Australian economy. On economic grounds, it has difficulties. That is why the political questions about where those rates are going to hit people--the political fishing expedition--becomes so important. Economically it is a dead duck. It is not going to assist in any great manner the Australian economy. These things are reasonably certain. </PARA>
<PARA>  When the Opposition introduces its GST, it will certainly cause a substantial one-off rise in prices that will take some considerable time to wash out of the system. Just at a time when we get an excellent result on inflation, it wants to introduce a GST that will knock that on the head. There is certainty about the fact that the introduction of a GST will raise the rate of inflation for a period of time. The Opposition can call it a one-off increase in prices, if it likes. Terrific! How long is it going to take to get that out of the system?</PARA>
<PARA>  What are the consequential changes that will occur, for instance, in wages and wage negotiations as a result of the introduction of a GST? We should remember, of course, quite theoretically, that if the Opposition were in government, and did introduce a GST, it would not have that negotiating mechanism to deal with the trade union movement, the accord, to get the sort of trade-off in wage rises that it needs in order to have the GST not feed permanently into inflation. It has a problem. Once it introduces its GST, it is almost impossible for the Opposition in government to negotiate the sorts of wage reductions required in order for the GST not to flow through permanently into the rate of inflation. So it is going to fail on those grounds. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another thing that is certain is that there will be a large and non-compensated impact on certain groups, such as superannuants. It is arguable that you can compensate, for instance, those who are paid by the Government, pensioners, for price rises. I understand that. It might be difficult to achieve, but theoretically it is possible to compensate pensioners for price rises. But what do we do about the ever-growing number of those who have a superannuation income, who pay for their own pension, and whom the Government cannot pay more to to compensate for prices rises? It is an enormous difficulty. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-No, tax cuts are not going to help them. They pay very little in terms of tax. They have an income around $15,000 or $16,000. You cannot compensate superannuants through the tax system and you cannot give them an extra boost to their income as you can pensioners in order to compensate them for price rises.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Opposition has a problem. A very large group of superannuants in this country must be disadvantaged by the GST. The Opposition may be able to solve some of the problems, but ultimately if it introduces a GST it will fall because of that group alone. Because the GST will be set at a flat rate, it is by definition a regressive tax. It will affect the poor much more greatly than it will the rich. If, on top of that, it imposes a flat rate income tax, it will be a doubly regressive tax. </PARA>

Their comments related to the underlying rationale of the Disabilities Services Act. They set out to blame, in turn, power-hungry individuals, the Queensland National Party and organisations like the Endeavour Foundation and Australian Parent Advocacy for the ongoing criticism of the provisions associated with the care of the intellectually disabled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I have listened in recent weeks to parents and community services groups on both of those issues. One thing is clear--sheltered workshops are dirty words to the Deputy Prime Minister, the Federal Minister for Health, Housing, and Community Services (Mr Howe). How can a Hawke Government, which espouses compassion for and understanding of the needs of the unprivileged and disabled, deny the disabled their right to train, to work, to gain the appropriate living skills and, most importantly, their basic right to choice. </PARA>

It will keep going up right across the board.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Worse still, the shadow Minister in his electorate of Dawson represents the Bowen mango growers. He is going to put a tax of 15 per cent on the Bowen mango growers, on tomato growers and on all new, young home owners. Worse still, he would put that tax on the tourist industry--an industry that is now bringing in $23 billion a year. It is a tax of 15 per cent across the board that will cause as much damage and havoc as the last cyclone that went through the Whitsunday Islands. </PARA>
<PARA>  We had hypocrisy from the previous speaker, the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor), who talked about compassion. If the honourable member cares about compassion, he will do the right thing in his Party room and roll the consumption tax that is going to help the yuppies in the leafy suburbs but not the pensioners or the farmers. Fifty per cent of farmers will earn no money at all this year, yet the honourable member wants to make them pay 15 per cent more for their food, clothes and everything else they buy. He nevertheless has the audacity to come into this House and talk about compassion or understanding. The problem is that he has the consumption tax monkey on his back and cannot get it off.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The supplement to the draft environmental impact study for the third runway completes the most expensive EIS in Australian history: somewhere around $7m. It should be the last of its type. It proves the pointlessness of proponents preparing EISs and then adjudicating on the objections. The supplement to the draft is a bloated, incompetent response. It provides no effective refutation of the many substantial objections.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  It begins with the presentation of a blatantly biased opinion poll which purports to show that the people of Sydney and those in the noise affected areas are in favour of the proposal. The EIS claims that 170,000 people are in noise affected areas, yet to distort the poll an area containing 700,000 people was polled and two-thirds of these are in the areas east and west of the airport who have been misled to believe that the noise will be substantially reduced in the future. A quarter of a million people north of the airport who are dramatically affected were excluded from the study, further distorting the results. So much for the ethics and competence of the report. And it goes downhill from there. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australia must have a new modern airport to compete in the twenty-first century. Sydney cannot continue to sprawl and be destroyed by an expanding black hole in the centre.

<PARA>  As I say, we deeply regret that people in this country are suffering at this stage from the increase in unemployment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I thank the honourable member for Shortland for his question. I guess the first thing that one should say is that one should be cautious about responding to the figures for one month. What has been perfectly obvious on the month by month figures over the past few months has been the extraordinary level of volatility both in the area of changes in employment and therefore changes in the number of unemployed people as well.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Looking at this month's figures--and I mention them with that initial word of caution--there has been a fall in the level of employment by about 23,000 and a fall in full time employment of nearly 30,000. The participation rate has remained the same and, as a consequence of that, the unemployment rate rose to a little over 10 per cent--10.2 per cent. The number of unemployed persons rose by just over 31,000 to 872,000. I should say that that is well short of the hyped-up, exaggerated figure of one million that the Opposition is so keen to throw around. As the Prime Minister indicated, we take no comfort from these figures. We recognise that those 870,000 people are suffering as a result of the circumstances in which they find themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I mentioned that we have to treat with some caution the month by month figures. If we look at the trend series, we find that over the last four months the level of employment has been basically static; that is, there has been no decline in the level of employment as indicated by the trend figures over the last four months. That seems to give further support to the idea that the labour market has bottomed or is very close to bottoming. Nevertheless, until such time as employment growth exceeds about 1.7 per cent on an annual basis, we will not be making inroads into the level of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Shortland asked what the Government was doing to assist these people to get a job. Firstly, it is worth pointing out that the Government has decided to assist people by providing support particularly to those who have been unemployed for 12 months or more. They are the ones who, having had such a lengthy separation from the labour market, are in a more difficult position than those who have perhaps left a job more recently. Therefore, we have increased substantially the support provided to those people to the point where, this year, there is an additional $200m provided to support training, work experience and other related programs which will provide real benefits to people in terms of assisting them to find the jobs that are available and those that will become available over the months and quarters ahead.</PARA>
<PARA>  It is important also to recognise that the jobs we should be striving for in the context of the recovery are jobs in the industrial sectors, jobs in the traded goods and services sector, and jobs which are likely to be durable in the long term. The Government has decided not to resort to providing Budget funded, artificially created jobs, but rather has decided to concentrate all of its efforts on trying to assist the real economy to create jobs for people.</PARA>
<PARA>  The Prime Minister made some observations about the Opposition's attitude to this whole question, and I should just mention in passing that the Opposition has in mind cutting substantially the support to unemployed people provided through labour market programs. I think the motivation for this comes from an expression used by the Leader of the Opposition when he was commenting on last month's employment data. At that time he said:</PARA>
<PARA>I think there are people that haven't tried hard enough to look for a job.</PARA>
<PARA>That sums up the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition to these 870,000 people; that is, it is basically their fault and therefore he would punish them as a result of the circumstances which they find themselves in. Our approach is of course quite different. We have provided them with additional support in terms of financial assistance for themselves and their families and also in terms of assisting them to make that transition back into the work force.</PARA>
<PARA>  Of course the honourable member for Shortland has a very real concern for these people. There are particular concerns in regional areas, and I am looking forward to the work of the Caucus committee which is examining this question and no doubt will be putting some propositions to the Government in the weeks ahead. If there are inadequacies in terms of the Government's response to this situation, no doubt the Government will address that question in response to the special committee's report.</PARA>

Okay, some of the predictions that we have made have not been borne out. I am saying that the Leader of the Opposition has been profoundly wrong in the assessments that he has made. If honourable members opposite are in the business of saying that they do not rely on people whose predictions are not borne out, then they should start the process of doing what is inevitably going to happen before next year, 1993, and that is to sack this man and his policy of a broad-based consumption tax which they know will not be worn by their parties or by the people of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Today's number of 10.2 per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis is within the Budget forecast which, as honourable members know, was for unemployment to peak at 10 3/4 per cent in late 1991 before beginning to fall in the first half of 1992. That events have confirmed our expectation that unemployment would rise above 10 per cent brings no joy to me or any other member of the Government, and I certainly do not want to understate the cost to those people who have been directly affected. There is a lot of chatter here today about other unemployment figures and, of course, 1982-83. One of the statistics is that the employment ratio now is still well above 1982-83, and that is indicative of the very strong employment growth that this Government gained through the 1980s.</PARA></TALK.START>

Consistent with the Budget expectations that the housing sector would provide an important impetus to growth this financial year, the number of private residential approvals rose in August, confirming a recovery in the housing sector which had been evident with a strong growth in the three months to August. My colleague the Minister for Employment, Education and Training has pointed out other figures in answer to the previous question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The DEET skilled vacancy survey showed a strong rise in the skilled and trade skill vacancy index, the first rise recorded since the September quarter of 1989. The National Australia Bank quarterly business survey for September, which came out early this week, showed improvements in expectations. Trading performance and profitability are expected to become less adverse in the December quarter. A rise in orders is expected in December and export sales are expected to grow significantly in the next quarter. These are early signs of recovery.</PARA>
<PARA>  Unfortunately, we all know--anyone with any economic wit on the other side would know--that employment always lags. The good news is that the modest pace of this recovery will contribute to consolidating the recent gains we have made with both inflation and the current account. One of the predictions of the Opposition, as has already been pointed out by the Prime Minister, is double digit inflation. We at least have very low inflation, not double digit inflation, with our unemployment figure in this stage of the business cycle and a recession. We did not have a wages blow-out. We are far better placed to recover from this recession.</PARA>

That is something he regularly does.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I would suggest that it is fairly difficult to sustain the proposition about an adverse investment climate if we look at the figures over the last few years. Let me go to them. It is all very well making these assertions because we will always have some people from the business community coming along and saying that they want better treatment, a better handout. Let us look at the figures. As a proportion of real non-farm GDP, private business investment has reached record highs in recent years. We are not now speculating, let us look at what happened. It was 12.3 per cent in 1987-88; 13.7 per cent in 1988-89, which is the highest level on record; 13.2 per cent in 1989-90; and 11.8 per cent in 1990-91. Those figures compare with the long run average of 11.2 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  So what is the actual factual position with regard to what has been happening to investment? I repeat: the long term average has been 11.2 per cent investment in this country as a proportion of GDP. The figures for the last four years are 12.3 per cent, 13.7 per cent, 13.2 per cent and 11.8 per cent. When we look at the facts, we are not looking at a situation where, on the evidence, investment in this country has been stultified by the taxation structure. It is simply not the fact because in the last four years, including in this most recent year--1990-91--investment has been above the long term average.</PARA>
<PARA>  Having said that, I and my Government have not been complacent about it. There are suggestions being made that there are elements of uncompetitiveness in the totality of the business tax structure and that is why we are going to look at it. We will have that report within a matter of weeks. I repeat to the honourable gentleman, who I think is serious about it: if we were to find as a result of that report that some changes needed to be made, then we would obviously seriously consider them.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am aware of calls in the direction that the honourable member alluded to. They were made yesterday by the honourable member for Bennelong in a speech in the House. It was a very useful speech in the context of the line of questioning that the Opposition has handed out to this point today. He said, among other things, that we ought to tell the truth about unemployment and we ought not to exaggerate it. That is a very sensible stricture as far as the honourable member for Bennelong is concerned--a member of the front bench. The lie that the Opposition puts forward persistently that at this stage there are one million unemployed in this country needs to be nailed. It has been persistent over the last couple of months. The unemployment level is nowhere near that. It has been a lie perpetrated by members of the Opposition in the hope that somebody will believe it at the end of the day. He went on to say that we ought not be gloom and doom merchants. Today and throughout this week the Opposition has been precisely that in the tone of its questioning in this place, despite the fact that it has had from this side of the House the obvious evidence presented that economic recovery is under way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The honourable member for Bennelong then went on to talk about micro-economic reform and what impact it would have on the situation as far as employment was concerned. To some extent I agree with what he had to say; to some extent I do not. His argument about what would create employment in this country in the long term was that an accelerated micro-economic reform process would do the trick. It might and it might not. It all depends on the broad policy settings under which micro-economic reform is introduced. Of course, with micro-economic reform, in the first instance the most likely outcome is an increase in unemployment. If it has not been structured in an effective fashion by the time a recovery is under way--if it is introduced in a recession--and if it has not been done on a consensual basis, at the end of the day we are likely to find a return to bargaining power on the part of the work force. We will see any particular impact of it blown away at that point.</PARA>
<PARA>  Contrary to what the honourable member for Bennelong has had to say, over the last couple of years the micro-economic reform process has been dramatically accelerated. We have a series of waterfront agreements in place that will improve productivity by 70 per cent and that have seen a couple of thousand people exit the workplace. In relation to the telecommunications area, I was delighted to get a call from the Chairman of Austel the other day. He was at a very important telecommunications conference in Europe. He said that in speech after speech at that conference people were saying that the legislative basis of the Government's telecommunications micro-economic reform process is that which ought to commend itself as the relevant model to any other country operating, in effect, in monopoly conditions in telecommunications.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PE4">Mr BEAZLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-We are proceeding with the third runway process. As I have had occasion to remark here before, one of the things that this House and this country can be grateful for is that we have at least placed ourselves in a position to consider a third runway proposal which will provide us with an outcome that actually does increase the usage of Sydney Airport. If we had proceeded with the Opposition's third runway we would have had about $400m worth of expenditure to produce no effective increase in movement at Sydney Airport, because it proposed a close-spaced parallel runway, as it boasted at the time. I never listen to the heckling of the Leader of the National Party on the third runway because his policy on the third runway, if it had been implemented by himself, would have been a major letdown to his own constituents in so far as movement at Sydney Airport is concerned. This is the only Government that has managed to identify and get under way the development of a second airport in the Sydney region. We do not wander around the place feeling at all inferior to the Leader of the National Party on the subject of micro-economic reform as far as Sydney Airport is concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I now turn to the changes we have introduced in aviation. We are now getting some truly astounding statistics as a result of the deregulatory policies that we have pursued. I will cite a couple. A record 382,000 passengers were carried on the weekend of 19 July. That was superseded in the weekend of 20 September, when 414,000 passengers travelled. The average discount on the top 20 routes during the June to August seat sale was 61 per cent off standard economy fares and 53 per cent off during the spring sale.</PARA>
<PARA>  I go back to the point I made earlier in answer to the honourable member's question about whether or not micro-economic reform actually improves the possibilities of employment. It really depends on the broad policy settings and the extent to which it can contribute to that. As far as aviation is concerned, over the last couple of years we have had demonstrated to us extraordinary price sensitivity. People, on a movement of 10 or 15 per cent in the price of an air fare, will make a determination on whether or not they will undertake air travel either for business purposes or to support the tourism industry.</PARA>
<PARA>  If the Opposition sticks a consumption tax on domestic aviation in this country, no matter what it might do in improving anything that we have done--I cannot imagine that there is anything it could do to improve what we have done if it got into office--it would immediately reduce the effectiveness of that micro-economic reform by its broad policy settings. Likewise in telecommunications. If it got a price change in telecommunications that improves it by 30 or 40 per cent--the sorts of figures that people have been talking about--but then sticks another 10 or 15 per cent on it, it does not get the benefit of its micro-economic reform.</PARA>
<PARA>  The experience of Britain demonstrates again and again what can happen with micro-economic reform. We can introduce just about anything we like in terms of changes in work practices in the labour market during a recession; the test is what happens when the recession moves away. The United Kingdom had enormous wage demands go through the system. It was also quite evident--at the very great cost to British industry--that fundamentally there had been no workplace restructuring at all, merely redundancies. Because the Opposition is utterly incapable of either comprehending that or delivering it even if it did comprehend it, everything that it would propose to do in the micro-economic reform area in the recession that it would induce, despite the heehawing going on here about what the Opposition's feelings are about the contemporary state of the economy, would fall flat on its face.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In answer to the honourable member's question, the Government has been considering not the issue of co-payments, which seems to be a preoccupation of the honourable member, but a package which goes to the structure of general practice in this country. As I indicated yesterday, it is an area in which I believe there is certainly room for very significant reform. As the Western Australian spokesman for the AMA, Michael Jones, pointed out recently, we have a quite significant problem of oversupply of doctors in this country. In a situation of very competitive pressures that operate in cities such as the honourable member's home city of Sydney and in a situation in which general practice in a sense is underwritten by fee for service, that effectively provides an incentive to overservice and overutilisation.</PARA></TALK.START>

We have been waiting; I think February was the latest target date, and we have had a series of deferments through the course of this year. We operate on the basis of stated policy. Our policy is geared not to symbolics but towards dealing with the problems as they arise. The fundamental problem in the area of general practice is oversupply of doctors. That is creating a situation in which there are incentives for overservicing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Government's concern is to seek to address that issue on both the supply and the demand side and to achieve, hopefully, an improvement in the quality of general practice.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In the interests of the good conduct of Question Time I will run briefly through just a few points. I am aware of the issue raised by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, and I must say I am surprised. In my own portfolio area--and this is a very quick thumbnail sketch--there has been an unprecedented level of micro-economic reform, and that micro-economic reform has unquestionably led to significant new investment and job opportunities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In mining, for example, we have removed all export controls on copper, copper scrap, lead, nickel, salt and zinc, eliminating a range of delays to companies that previously had to wait for export approval. We have relaxed foreign investment guidelines for minerals processing, which has led to faster approval processes for new projects. We have substantially reduced tariffs, removing, in effect, taxes on efficient export industries. In that context, we have thereby brought about a prospective additional outflow of mineral product of about 5 per cent, or about $1 billion, in export income at 1988 prices. We have introduced duty free entry for minerals processing equipment and expanded the range of goods and services exempt from wholesale sales taxes. They have led to unprecedented levels of minerals output.</PARA>
<PARA>  There is a similar--indeed, I would submit, a better--picture in the petroleum sector. We have deregulated the oil market, we have deregulated the LPG market and we have introduced historic and widely applauded reforms to the RRT, and introduced cross-company deductibility, which has led to significant enhancement of our exploration effort in high risk or frontier areas. We have provided for platform removal. Our new internationally accepted offshore acreage release program is commented upon regularly as the way to go in terms of the RRT changes. The East-West Centre has acknowledged this as being a brave decision and a model for other governments interested in these areas.</PARA>
<PARA>  As a result, we have more exports; we have generated massive and prospectively enormous new investment. We have higher levels of petroleum self-sufficiency than ever before. We are now described as the fourth most desirable investment destination for offshore oil and gas exploration expenditure in the world, which is an improvement from twentieth in 1989.</PARA>
<PARA>  In the quarantine area, there are very significant reforms. AQIS meat inspectors in the field have increased productivity by 36 per cent, providing a move towards quality assurance, which is the way to go, and lower service costs. But, more importantly, at 2 o'clock this morning, I might say, I concluded the Cabinet submission which I think will bring in the biggest range of comprehensive reforms in relation to the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, so we can have a debate about that in the not too distant future.</PARA>
<PARA>  Again in my portfolio area, I address the issues of electricity reform, the initiative of the Prime Minister and the Government in the new federalism context. We have gone from the seventh lowest to the third lowest electricity prices in the world, and we will get better.</PARA>
<PARA>  Working with the States, we have now moved very far down the track towards developing Australia's first national natural gas strategy, which will become a key component of a comprehensive energy policy. By the middle of next year we will have formulated, for the first time since Federation, a very comprehensive national forest strategy. We will have a national energy strategy in place in concert and in cooperation with the States and all key players in that area.</PARA>
<PARA>  In the electorate of Eden-Monaro we are setting about the biggest reforms--and, I might say, much overdue reforms; they should have been carried out three decades ago--to the Snowy Mountains hydro-electricity scheme. I welcome, quite genuinely, the comments of the honourable member for Bennelong on this point, and I am a bit disappointed that he is not here. But as is so often the case in politics, the rhetoric of the honourable member for Bennelong is not matched by his Party. In particular, it is not matched by the Leader of the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA>  Let me just run past honourable members again a couple of those reforms that I have indicated. The changes to the RRT will trigger $1 billion to $1.5 billion in new investment. Who opposed them? Who opposed these internationally acclaimed reforms? Of course, the Opposition parties did, and it was only at the death-knock in the Senate that they allowed them to go through.</PARA>
<PARA>  In respect of the forest conservation and development strategy, the Leader of the Opposition is on the record early this year as saying he would be constructive about these proposals. What is he now saying down in Tasmania? He is doing a little bit of political pot stirring. He is now saying he will consider the thing in due course and that he does not see the need for it.</PARA>

In reality the position of the Opposition is no different, in terms of hard reform, from what it has been for decades and from what it has been most recently in the term of this Parliament, when it agonised, divided and eventually self-destructed over the issue of grain transport regulation--a reform which is now showing very real and very tangible benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OH4">Mrs KELLY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am very pleased to inform the House that the Government last week nominated Kakadu National Park, Fraser Island and the Great Sandy region, and Macquarie Island for consideration by the World Heritage committee in 1992. The nominations were prepared in full consultation with the relevant governments, those of the Northern Territory, Queensland and Tasmania, and in fact they have been very supportive of those nominations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Kakadu National Park is already recognised nationally and internationally as one of the world's great parks, and the inscription of stage 3 of that park will now ensure that almost all of the South Alligator River catchment will be included in the World Heritage List--a step that was encouraged by the World Heritage committee as early as 1981.</PARA>
<PARA>  Fraser Island--and I know Queenslanders will be very proud of this--has been nominated for all four natural criteria set in the World Heritage Convention. This is an area of exceptional beauty, and I am sure that it will become one of the world's great tourist attractions in years to come. Because of that, the Queensland Government, in consultation with the Federal Government, is preparing a very detailed management plan for the area.</PARA>
<PARA>  Our view about all these areas is that of course they must be protected and of course they are great natural assets; but that does not mean that we should try to keep people out or exclude the tourist industry in particular from those areas. To assist in that purpose and in the restructuring, the Federal Government has provided $16.5m, and the Queensland Government has matched that, for a structural adjustment program over three years to reduce the impact that World Heritage may have on employment in the area.  Macquarie Island has also been nominated. It contains geological formations of outstanding scientific value. It is also the location for important upper atmosphere and meteorological studies which add to our knowledge of weather and the ozone layer.</PARA>
<PARA>  I am very proud of these nominations and I hope all members of the House are. I am very proud of our achievements in this area because they add to a very substantial list of successful World Heritage applications. To remind the House, the list includes the World Heritage wet tropics of Queensland, the wilderness area in Tasmania, Uluru, the New South Wales rainforest area and, hopefully by the end of this year we will have a further successful nomination for Shark Bay.</PARA>

<PARA>  That this House censures the Prime Minister for his failure to provide the leadership necessary to provide real job opportunities for the one in ten Australians now out of work, and for his failure to maintain the integrity of the Budget in the worst recession in 60 years. </PARA>
<PARA>Today in this Parliament we have seen an attempt by the Government to down play the significance of the unemployment data that were released earlier today. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) strutted around as if there was no real problem in Australia, as if it was not a very significant issue that unemployment has now reached 10.2 per cent and that, on his own Budget estimates, nearly one million Australians will be unemployed in the course of this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Prime Minister spent a lot of time trying to act nonchalantly about that by quoting from the past. He is a great lover of quotes. There is one quote for which he will never be forgiven. That is the guarantee he gave in a statement to this Parliament on 4 December 1990, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>The truth is this: unemployment will not reach double digits. </PARA>
<PARA>Here we are, just eight months later, with the Prime Minister being damned out of his own mouth by the release today of the unemployment data, which shows an unemployment rate of 10.2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  That statement--`unemployment will not reach double digits'--will go down in history, along with the other classic frauds this Prime Minister has perpetrated on the people of Australia. Let us remember some of them. `No child will live in poverty by 1990' was one of the first and most significant classic frauds for which he will never be forgiven. `We will not need to fear a recession' was another classic fraud perpetrated by this Prime Minister on the people of Australia. The daddy of all classic frauds was the one taken into the last election campaign, when he promised to lead the Government after the 1990 election, knowing full well that he had done a secret deal with the then Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), at Kirribilli House to pass over the prime ministership in the course of this parliamentary term. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is a Prime Minister who prides himself on his integrity. He struts around the place proclaiming his integrity. He claims to be a man of the people; he claims to be a person who understands the lot of working Australians. Working Australians will never forgive him for those classic frauds he has perpetrated on them. They will never forgive him for the situation he has now thrown them into, with the prospect of one million of them being unemployed. One in 10 already are unemployed in this country, with no real hope under his policies of getting a job in the foreseeable future. Indeed, on his assumptions and using his models, under his policies unemployment will still be above 9 per cent by the middle of this decade. The Prime Minister can sit there and yawn; he can sit there and try to distract, but he will not be forgiven for the significant extent to which he has deliberately and knowingly misled the people of Australia in relation to the unemployment situation, the recession, children living in poverty and so on. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the other things the Prime Minister likes to do is to pride himself on being a great leader. He puts himself in the tradition of some of the great leaders of the past. Last weekend he delivered the John Curtin Memorial Lecture. He sees himself as a disciple of John Curtin, one who follows in the tradition established by John Curtin. He talked at length of how John Curtin was the Prime Minister for 1941: he was the Prime Minister in the very difficult circumstances of the war; he set a very clear sense of direction for this country; and he led this country in a very effective way. The Prime Minister went out of his way to create the impression that, as John Curtin was the man to lead the nation in those difficult circumstances in 1942, it is Bob Hawke who is the man to lead the nation in 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>  This is the man who has created one million unemployed. This is the man who claims to be in the Labor tradition. This is the man who, in the centenary year of the ALP, has constructed the monument of one million Australians unemployed. As far as his place in history is concerned, he will not be remembered as the man who handled our perilous times in 1991 but more akin to the experiences of 1931. If he continues down the policy path he has been following, unemployment will continue to rise in this country. He offers no hope for the unemployed at present. </PARA>
<PARA>  The evidence of the past few days--as has been the evidence of the 18 months since he won the last election--is that the Prime Minister has lost control of this Government. He personally is starting to show the strains that have been on him and his inability to deliver even simple decisions about the last Budget. His Budget now stands in tatters. A week or so ago he lost his cool and lashed out at the Premier of Victoria because she and some of her Ministers reportedly were part of the leadership contest between him and the ex-Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland. </PARA>
<PARA>  Now he has Caucus in revolt, a series of midnight Caucus and factional meetings, and open factional warfare. He has demonstrated absolutely no capacity to deliver even some of the simplest decisions of the last Budget. Imagine a situation where the Opposition has decided to do the responsible thing and not play politics on an issue as difficult as making changes to the Medicare system but give the Government full support for the $3.50 co-payment. The Prime Minister cannot deliver even that decision against his Caucus. </PARA>
<PARA>  A Prime Minister has not been rolled by Caucus since the final days of the Whitlam years. This Prime Minister will go down in history as the second Prime Minister who has been rolled by Caucus--unable to deliver even the simplest change in relation to Medicare, a minor change in the context of what has to be done in this country to rebuild the health shambles that he and his Government have created. All through this uncertainty, factional fighting and Caucus revolt the vulture, the ex-Treasurer, sits waiting to pounce on the carcass of this Labor leader when he trips in the next few months. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is significant today to look in some detail at the current state of the Budget and at the extent to which the Government has lost control of its Budget and therefore of economic management in the midst of the worst crisis in 60 years. There were two or three key elements in the Budget. The first was the wage assumption, which was plucked out of nowhere: 6 1/2 per cent through the year, 5 per cent in the year as a whole over last year, but no basis for that figure to go into that document. </PARA>
<PARA>  Apparently there was a meeting at the Lodge. At the time it was not able to hold that meeting at Parliament House because a couple of our union leaders, Mr Kelty and Mr Ferguson, could not or would not cross the picket line. The meeting was held at the Lodge apparently in order to set a new direction for wages policy in Australia. Yet here we are in the middle of October with absolutely no idea of what that wages policy is. All the Budget figuring stems from those wage assumptions--the basis of which we have been told absolutely nothing. </PARA>
<PARA>  The first reason the Budget is in tatters is that it has a fictitious wages policy and a fictitious wage assumption. The second reason, of course, is that there is this superannuation decision which is nothing more than yet another tax on the business community. The Prime Minister shows the appalling nature of the extent of his lack of understanding of basic economics. But he cannot see that an additional tax on the business community is going in precisely the wrong direction from the point of view of job creation. If he wants to create jobs in this country, he has to rebuild the business sector from the bottom up. </PARA>
<PARA>  Central to rebuilding the business sector in this country is rebuilding business investment in this country. Despite the figures from some private sector based investment data that the Prime Minister very selectively quoted in the Parliament today in Question Time, the fact is that investment is at a 40-year low in this country. The business community is on its knees. The Prime Minister has seen record levels of small to medium size, and indeed large, business failures. In those circumstances, the last thing he should think of doing is imposing another tax. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Budget is going to be called into question on that assumption as there have been reports in the media that some in the business community are going to challenge in the courts the decision in relation to occupational superannuation. Again, using the Government's model, we have demonstrated that that decision of 5 per cent occupational superannuation will create an additional 100,000 unemployed in this country; 100,000 more people will be thrown on the scrap heap by a completely misguided policy developed in the climate of the leadership wrangle that took place in June of this year. </PARA>
<PARA>  The third reason, of course, relates to the Medicare part of the Budget. A major part was the simple decision to impose a $3.50 charge, a co-payment, subject to a safety net in order to start to get some rationality into the system of health care provision. There is a massive problem of overservicing in relation to health. In part, it is true that it is related to the excess supply of doctors but, importantly, price has to be introduced into that system and people have to face the reality that they need to pay for visits to the doctor, albeit quite a small amount, if that system is to start to see overservicing reduced. That is one step, but a simple step. It is only the first tentative step that needs to be taken if the health system in this country is going to be fixed, if the overservicing is going to be reduced and if something is going to be done about the appalling length of queues at hospitals in this country. It is a first step and the Government cannot deliver it and it cannot deliver it in a climate where the Opposition is out there publicly supporting it. </PARA>
<PARA>  Indeed, people on this side of the Parliament have done more radio interviews and gone out publicly more frequently in support of that decision than have the Minister and the Prime Minister in trying to get that decision through. What hope does this country have for genuine reform when a minor tentative step in relation to the health system cannot be delivered by a Prime Minister who is totally preoccupied in saving his own job and could not care less about the one million Australians he has thrown on the scrap heap?</PARA>
<PARA>  The Budget is in tatters for three reasons. Of course, one should not forget that the money that was to be raised from the Medicare changes over the next few years was to pay for the mad cities fantasy, which is an idea that has gone down very well, I gather, in the Caucus! It has had a tremendous amount of trouble understanding how on earth one could go into the health area to raise money to pursue some mad cities fantasy which could not even be explained to members and their staff when they met a few days after the Budget. They asked, `Where is the money going? How it is going to be spent? What are the projects that you have in mind?' They received no answers from the Minister's office or the Minister's Department about this mad cities program. There was a commitment of $800m over five years and no concept of how that is to be spent. </PARA>
<PARA>  Just a few months after the Budget has been handed down, it is totally in tatters. The Prime Minister is totally preoccupied with trying to save his own job. He is doing absolutely nothing to improve the lot of the unemployed and to give them a real chance to get a job in this country. It is absolutely appalling when there is a genuine desire on our part to provide bipartisan support and to get on and solve what is a very difficult set of circumstances in the Australian economy at the present time. We are looking down the barrel of a very different labour market locked into an unemployment rate in excess of 9 per cent and the prospect of over 300,000 Australians facing long term unemployment, that is, being unemployed for more than 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is a sad indictment that the Prime Minister does not listen even to his colleagues--let alone anybody else--about the need to put in place an effective job strategy for recovery in this country. Bob Carr, Wally Curran, Joan Kirner, the honourable member for Blaxland, Senator Button and Mr Bannon have told the Prime Minister; why does he not listen to some of them? They all have good ideas. Wally Curran is the guy who destroyed the jobs in the export meat industry in Victoria. He has had a Damascus road conversion and he, too, is telling Mr Hawke that he ought to do something about jobs in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The Prime Minister is not listening to anybody. He worries about his own job. He does not worry about creating jobs for those one million Australians. There is plenty that he can do in current circumstances to create jobs for those one million Australians. For example, he could start by acknowledging that he does not have a wages policy and that there will be no more wage increases across-the-board unless there is productivity improvement. To give the prospect of a 6 per cent increase in wages in the midst of a recession will be the biggest wage increase, if delivered, in our history in relation to recessions. It will create more unemployment. If he wants to stop creating unemployment, the first stage is to forgo the possibility of any further wage increases across-the-board unless they are related to productivity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Secondly, of course, he could scrap this mad scheme of occupational superannuation, which is a tax on the business community. I am not downplaying the significance by saying that of having an effective retirement incomes policy in this country--one of the most important requirements in the course of the next couple of decades. But there is no way he can try to provide occupational superannuation by compulsion and there is no way he can do it by taxing jobs. It shows an appalling misunderstanding of the nature of business; it shows an appalling misunderstanding of the needs of the Australian people in relation to retirement incomes. If he scraps it, he can save some of those 100,000 jobs that are going to be lost as a result of that decision. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, there are plenty of other things the Prime Minister can do immediately, too, to give us a clear sense of direction and to start to create jobs. He has played around with development projects for years. We have seen some of the greatest displays of hypocrisy here in the Parliament today in Question Time as some of the Ministers have trotted up one after the other--and I was not sure whether there was some sort of leadership contest going on at the time--delivering long speeches, not answers, in relation to questions asked from their side. They were trying to create the impression that they have done a lot of micro reform and approved a lot of projects. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let me just give the Prime Minister a few challenges. Why does he not start today and formally commit the building of the third runway at the Sydney airport? He took a decision some time ago. He should go out and break ground with a shovel, get the process started and call for some tenders immediately. </PARA>
<PARA>  Nobody could understand that mad Coronation Hill decision that the Prime Minister took but, apparently, at that stage, Caucus felt sorry for him. It saw him in an amazingly weakened state. It said, `We have to let the fellow have it. We have to give him this one'. Caucus could not understand one argument he put up on behalf of whoever he was putting up those arguments in order to turn that situation around. When I attacked him for the basis of that decision and some of the things that he said about the spirit Bula, I was amazed that I got a letter attacking me. It was not from the Aboriginal Heritage Group but, of course, from members of the Australian Conservation Foundation. Having failed to get Mr Hawke to deliver on the deal in relation to the environment and environmental considerations on Coronation Hill, the Foundation is out there manipulating the black tape element of the decision so as to make sure he delivered against his election promises of last time. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of Mr Hawke's Ministers stood up here today and attacked me for remaining to be convinced about resource security legislation. It is a sad commentary that that whole issue should ever have existed. It only exists because of the very cynical and dishonest way that the Prime Minister has manipulated the environment and development projects in this country in order to buy votes in selected marginal seats around Australia, rather than looking after the interests of those who are unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Prime Minister should reverse his Coronation Hill decision. He should go back and have a look at Wesley Vale and proposals such as that for pulp mills. He should not block them on foreign investment grounds this time, but give them a clear go-ahead. He should go and pick up the three-mines uranium policy which he has said is an illogical policy. He was rolled by the Left on that too. He could not even allow it to be debated at the last Party conference--a policy that he knows is wrong and is costing jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are three or four immediate things that he can do, over and above the wages initiative and the superannuation decision that I mentioned, in order to start to create jobs in this country. Over and above that, of course, there are plenty of other things the Prime Minister can do. He can embark on a genuine process of reform, including tax reform, which is fundamental to creating jobs in this country. For `Bob Hawke is against tax reform', read `Bob Hawke is against jobs'. There should be no doubt in anybody's mind that this man is not prepared to take that decision. </PARA>
<PARA>  Again, here we are leading the fray, out there calling the shots, setting the agenda and putting the arguments that he put on consumption tax in 1985. We are prepared to go with them. But what does he do? He takes a cheap, political shot and tries to capitalise, in a cheap, short term political sense, rather than get on and do what he knows has to be done in this country to start to rebuild it. </PARA>
<PARA>  So we can go with the waterfront; so we can go with aviation; so we can go with telecommunications and so we can go with electricity generation--all the areas where he has been unable to govern this country because he has been rolled by the union leadership or some of his business mates whose interests he has looked after at the expense of the average Australian. </PARA>
<PARA>  One million Australians are unemployed under the Prime Minister's data. I have noticed that he does not query the one million figure. Some of his Ministers have been put up to start to query it, but on his own numbers in his own Budget nearly one million Australians are unemployed as a result of his policies. </PARA>
<PARA>  So the Prime Minister must be censured. He must be censured, in the midst of the worst recession in 60 years, for failing to provide the leadership that is necessary to provide real job opportunities for the one in 10 Australians who are now out of work and for his failure to maintain the integrity of the Budget--a document that was brought down just a few months ago and a document which further compounds the basic problems of this country in terms of rising unemployment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Let me go to what I understand to be the central element of the attack by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). It is in regard to the non-creation of jobs under my leadership of this Government. Let me quietly and unemotionally put to the Leader of the Opposition what the facts are in terms of the job creation record of my Government under my leadership and then, having put what the facts are  and having compared them with the record of those opposite, completely destroy his argument by reference to what he has had to say about the incompetence of the Opposition in regard to the essentials for creating employment in this country, which is the question of having an appropriate wages policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  First, let me put the facts. Fact one: even with the figures that have come out today, under the period of my leadership since 1983, in each year since we have been in government we have averaged the creation of 172,000 jobs--172,000 jobs a year since I have been Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>  Fact two: what is the comparison between the rate of job creation under my leadership and the rate of job creation under the Tories when they were in power between 1973 and 1975 and had the great benefit in that period of the economic advice of the present Leader of the Opposition? The comparison is this: the rate of job creation under my leadership of 172,000 jobs a year is three times higher than when those opposite were in government, being advised by the Leader of the Opposition. Those are the facts; not opinions, facts. </PARA>
<PARA>  It ill becomes the Leader of the Opposition in those circumstances to base his attack on employment and unemployment--as badly as it ill becomes him to start his vastly incompetent attack on me by reference to John Curtin. It is very interesting that he should refer to John Curtin because this week is in fact the fiftieth anniversary of the coming to power of John Curtin. He was appointed Prime Minister of this country on 7 October 1941. There is a great resonance, a great overtone, about this when one compares 1991 with 1941. </PARA>
<PARA>  How did John Curtin become Prime Minister of this country? He became Prime Minister of this country because, in dramatic events on the floor of the Parliament on 3 October in a situation where the Tories had the responsibility for defending this country in its gravest moment of peril, two Independents crossed the floor and said to the Tories, the Liberals--the UAP as they were then--and the Country Party, `You are not fit to govern. You do not have policies which are relevant to the challenge of the times'. At the time of challenge, when this country was in its deepest crisis of war, the Tories then did not have the policies to meet the challenge of the times. The Independents crossed the floor and said, `Be gone. You are not capable. You do not understand this country. You have no policies which are relevant. Be gone'. </PARA>
<PARA>  Those are the circumstances under which John Curtain came to power. It is exactly true today; nothing has changed. Fifty years on, the Tories in this country have no policies that are relevant to the challenge of today. Just as they were thrown out properly 50 years ago, so they are irrelevant today. </PARA>
<PARA>  Let me go right to the very core of the attack by the Leader of the Opposition. The charge against me was that I had constructed a monument in regard to employment or unemployment in this country. I have told him what my monument is; it is 172,000 jobs a year. But let us look at the analysis by the Leader of the Opposition as to what is necessary, what is relevant, for the creation of employment. I will quote from what the Leader of the Opposition had to say back in 1984 about what is necessary in regard to economic policy which is relevant to the creation of jobs. These were the words of the Leader of the Opposition:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Liberals really need to recognise the wages area as their achilles heel--</PARA>
<PARA>those were his words--</PARA>
<PARA>and to come up with an alternative. </PARA>
<PARA>What did he go on to say? He said:</PARA>
<PARA>At risk of being accused of heresy, might I suggest that it may be desirable for them to accept the concept of an accord-type agreement. </PARA>
<PARA>There is the analysis of the Leader of the Opposition. He said, `I look at the Liberals when it comes to the question of conduct of economic policy--and what do I find is their Achilles heel? They should face up to the fact that their Achilles heel is wages policy. At the risk of being accused of heresy, might I suggest that it is desirable for them to accept the concept of an accord type agreement'. </PARA>
<PARA>  Again, what did he go on to say several years later when he had seen the impact of the accord type policy? This is what he said on 23 August 1989:</PARA>
<PARA>We have achieved some wage restraint in Australia in recent years and this has contributed to strong growth in employment and a fall in unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>There we have the analysis by the Leader of the Opposition of the weakness of the Liberals' wages policy and his saying that what they ought to do is to have an accord type arrangement. There was an acknowledgment in 1989 of the strong growth in employment in this country and a fall in unemployment. Why was that? It was because the Government had and operated a wages accord policy. There is the real analysis by the Leader of the Opposition. That is when he gave his dispassionate economic analysis of what is required in this country. He was saying that the Liberals were no good because their wages policy was their Achilles heel; that what was needed to cure it was an accord. The analysis of that man was that what was needed was the operation of the accord, growth in employment and a fall in unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Leader of the Opposition, having done that, has the temerity to stand up on this occasion and say, in purported censure of me, that my problem is that I am operating under an accord and a wages policy and what a terrible thing it is to have this accord. What note do we take of this man when he says, on the one hand, `We are hopeless'--the Liberals--`because we have not got a wages policy; we are hopeless because we have not got an accord. The Government is good; Hawke is good because he has a wages policy and an accord' and then for miserable political purposes, he stands up here and says, `I condemn the Prime Minister on the grounds that he operates an accord and he does not do anything in terms of achieving employment outcomes'? The Leader of the Opposition is revealed out of his own mouth as a hopeless hypocrite who will say and do anything in a time of pressure to try to save himself from the increasing public evidence that he is on the nose with the Australian electorate, and getting more and more on the nose. </PARA>
<PARA>    Let me go further. I and the people of this country are entitled to say, `We hear the Leader of the Opposition, who puts himself up as an alternative Prime Minister, attacking the Prime Minister who has a rate of employment creation three times higher than the government of the conservatives advised by Dr Hewson'. People are entitled to then ask: what is it that Dr Hewson is now advocating as an alternative policy? What is it that he would do which would have an impact upon the level of economic policy and thereby on the level of employment? Let me briefly analyse what is involved. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Courtice" NAMEID="UF4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-A consumption tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-No, we will come to a consumption tax later. But before we come to that we ask: what is the basic structure of the alternative economic policy? It is this: the Leader of the Opposition will savagely cut the level of government expenditure in the order of $4 billion. One does not need to be a first year student of economics to know that it would be an inevitable fact that if these people were to come in and dramatically slash the level of government expenditure in these tight economic circumstances it would inevitably drive unemployment even higher. There is not an economist in the country who has denied that that would be the impact of the policies of the Leader of the Opposition. So that is the fundamental alternative: a dramatic and significant increase in unemployment under the impact of that budgetary policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  But, as has been said by way of interjection, there is worse to come. What is the Hewson panacea for the problems of this country? It is the broad based consumption tax--the goods and services tax. Let us analyse, as I have already done in this place, the impact of that tax in New Zealand. I remind honourable members that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) has said that this is the place that shows us the way to go. They are his words. What has happened? I am not choosing, capriciously, some irrelevant model. I am going to the Opposition's model. Members of the Opposition have said that is the way we should go. So we go there to find out what would be the impact in this country of the imposition of their panacea. As I have told honourable members, in five years there has been a 5 per cent decline in employment in that country; at the same time we have had a 9 per cent increase in employment. That 5 per cent decline represents a loss of one million jobs. </PARA>
<PARA>  So I say to this man who has launched this censure, `You are a hypocrite because you have analysed your own weaknesses and said that you have not got a wages policy and that it is the accord which has created employment'. I have got that. I pointed out that the Opposition would slash expenditure by $4 billion and massively increase unemployment. I then pointed out, in regard to the Opposition's own model, that with five years of operation of a broad based consumption tax in New Zealand there has been a massive increase in unemployment. That is the alternative prescription of the Leader of the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA>  As though that is not enough in itself to totally destroy this man, we come to the further observations about courage. The Leader of the Opposition said that I have not got the courage to make the hard decisions. Well, we have made them year after year and, may I say, that we have made them every time with the courageous support of members of the back bench. They have had to take some very tough decisions. This man stands up and talks about a lack of courage. Let me remind honourable members again of this man's courage. This is the man who said to Beryl Beaurepaire, `Don't you worry about that'--to coin a phrase; I do not know where he borrowed it from, I think he had heard another famous conservative use the phrase--`I'll fix up Jocelyn Newman on this fundamental and terribly important thing of the charge to visitors to the War Memorial'. When the brave man marched into the combined party meeting, Jocelyn did him like a dinner. He did not even have the courage to fight her. Having promised Beryl Beaurepaire that he would take it on and win he was beaten and knocked over by Senator Jocelyn Newman. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Leader of the Opposition should not come in here and talk about courage when we have had courage in the area, for instance, of tariffs. Those opposite were in office for seven years. What did they do? Not a single thing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I can understand that honourable members opposite do not want to hear much more. I will not go on for very much longer. I will just go to a couple more things that this gentleman dealt with. He talked about superannuation. I will spend a little time on the question of superannuation. The fact is that the organised working men and women of this country in the period since March 1983 have exhibited a restraint and a responsibility unrivalled in the history of this country and, I would suggest, unrivalled in just about any other democracy in the world. That has brought about a reduction of 10 per cent in real unit labour costs. That is the result of the restraint and responsibility of the ordinary working men and women of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The time has come when it is appropriate that that restraint should be recognised in bringing in a system whereby we will ensure that all people in this country will have, as a matter of right, a secure superannuation system. This is not some luxury. This is something which should be regarded as a matter of right for the ordinary people of this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  Those sitting on the other side of the House represent the privileged sorts of people for whom superannuation is regarded as an automatic right. It should not be questioned that the people that they represent should have protection for their future!  On this side of this place we happen to believe that there should not be, as there was when we came to office, this distinction between who had superannuation and who did not. When we came to office it was, by and large, in the possession of the privileged in this country. It was not the right of the ordinary working man--and certainly it was not the right of the ordinary working woman. But we are saying, as a deliberate policy decision, that we will bring about a situation whereby all working men and women in this country will have the right to superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA>  What does the Leader of the Opposition say about this, coming from the sort of position of privilege to which he has become accustomed? This is what the Leader of the Opposition had to say about superannuation:</PARA>
<PARA>People can prepare for their superannuation (by) not only putting it into a few superannuation funds . . . they may save in banks, they may keep their money in a stockmarket and invest in equity themselves. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what he is saying to the ordinary working men and women of this country. He knows about the Reuters investment screen. That is the sort of background that he is accustomed to--`We can look after ourselves because we know how to play the stock market'. He is saying to the ordinary men and women of this country, `That is what you should do'. As far as this Australian Labor Party Government is concerned, we say that that is not good enough. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to play his screens, play the stock market, he can do it. But as far as this Government is concerned, we will provide, as a matter of legislation, that all working men and women will have the same right and the same opportunity as the privileged classes that the Leader of the Opposition represents. Those are the sorts of principles for which we stand. </PARA>
<PARA>  As far as the impact of this proposal is concerned, the Leader of the Opposition in his speech has deliberately misrepresented the impact upon employers of this decision in regard to superannuation. In the discussions we have had with the representatives of the trade union movement--including the discussions that I had with them at the Lodge--they have made it quite clear that, as far as they are concerned, it would be perfectly appropriate and proper for what is paid out by the employers in regard to superannuation to be taken into account in the wages negotiations. We are not talking about double counting. But if one were to listen to this mischievous, misrepresenting Leader of the Opposition, the only conclusion that one could draw is that this was a new impost on top of wages which would not be taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA>  Any acquaintance that the Leader of the Opposition would have with the truth would be entirely accidental. The Leader of the Opposition comes into this place determined to misrepresent both the achievements and the intentions of this Government. As far as we on this side of the House are concerned, we have said, firstly, that we are proud of the employment record that we have. We are proud of the fact--and perhaps subsequent speakers on the Opposition side will address this factual position that I put to them--that the rate of employment creation under my Government has been three times higher than it was under the Government of honourable members opposite. Will they say why that has been the case? Perhaps they will say whether they agree that it has been because, as the Leader of the Opposition said, their Achilles heel is that they did not have a wages policy--and they still do not have a wages policy. When the Deputy Leader of the Opposition speaks, he may address that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Good--and he will not have an answer to it. Not only are we proud of that record, but also we deeply regret at this stage that we have had to slow down the Australian economy. I have said before why we had to do it. It was because our expenditure in fact was growing twice as fast as our rate of production. But I can now say to the people of Australia that the position now is that we have an inflation rate which is significantly lower than that of our major competitors. In this year it will be 3 per cent, as against a current rate of about 4 1/2 per cent for our major trading partners. If we look at the figures in regard to exports of manufactured goods we see that in the last two years we have achieved a 57 per cent increase.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  We should be together--it should not be just this side; it should be Opposition and Government together--in being proud of the fact that Australian enterprises large, medium and small are now, as a result of the changes we have made, taking on the most competitive opposition in the world in manufactured goods. And we are beating that opposition. That is something of which we are proud; the damned pity of it is that honourable members opposite do not share that pride with us. What they want is not recovery but continued recession--because they hope that they will miserably creep into office on the basis of a continuing recession. Unfortunately for honourable members opposite, the signs are there that the recovery is coming. And not only is the economy recovering, but also the Australian people are increasingly waking up to what a bunch of irrelevant and hopeless hypocrites honourable members opposite are. Honourable members opposite will have the same result in 1993 that they had in 1983, 1984, 1987 and 1990--they will be rejected for the irrelevancies that they are. (Time expired)</PARA>

People are not interested in the Prime Minister's living in the past, in the 1940s with John Curtin. They are not interested in the personal abuse and the silly political point scoring that laced the whole of his speech today. They are interested in one thing, and that is: what is the Prime Minister going to do about jobs?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I am very happy to take up some of the political points that the Prime Minister makes. The Prime Minister can demonstrate his real interest in this issue by walking out of this debate, as he will do. But if the Prime Minister wants to talk about comparisons, let me put this figure to him: during the Fraser years the average rate of unemployment was 5.8 per cent. Does the Prime Minister know what it is today, and has been through the period of his Government? It is nearly 8 per cent. The Prime Minister wants to talk about compassion. Let us talk about the people who have been thrown into unemployment as a result of the Government's deliberate policy to engineer a recession. Sure, jobs have been created in the last eight or nine years. We have an economy which, just through population, has grown in size. But at what cost have those jobs been created?</PARA>
<PARA>  Under this Government's management our debt to the rest of the world has grown from $23 billion when this Prime Minister and the world's greatest Treasurer came into office eight years ago to $130 billion today. This country is literally addicted to debt as a result of the Government's policies. Sure, some jobs have been created, but it has been done at the cost of something like $75,000 per job. Any fool can borrow and spend, as this Government has done in the last eight years. But what has it done to our country? It has literally brought this country to its knees with the recession that we were told by the last Treasurer we had to have. Why did he say that? It was because the former Minister for Finance, Senator Walsh, said that this Government deliberately induced this recession. </PARA>
<PARA>  So what does all this borrowing leave the average family in this country with? The average families in the gallery today are left with a debt of $8,000 for every man, woman and child in the Australian community. That is the extent of the massive hike in debt that we owe to the rest of the world as a result of the Government's incompetence. </PARA>
<PARA>  From the Prime Minister's contribution to the debate today, one would not know that we have seen the unemployment figure crash through the 10 per cent barrier to 10.2 per cent. One would not know that from the Prime Minister's attack on the Opposition. Given the opportunity to debate an issue which is on the lips and on the minds of every Australian, the Prime Minister's only response was to attack the Opposition. That will do him no good, and those who are unemployed as a result of his policies will take no solace from that fact.</PARA>
<PARA>   There are 872,100 Australians who are now unemployed. Just in the last month, 31,600 Australians have become unemployed as a result of this Government's policies, many of those 31,600 being people honourable members would know--friends, members of the family, relatives. These are people who a month ago had a job, had the dignity of a job. A month ago they were able to bring in, as a result of their own endeavours, income to support their families. A month ago people making up this 31,600 were able to hold their heads high and make a contribution not just to their families but, through their work, to the future development of this country. That figure includes 8,800 full time breadwinners--fathers and husbands who had a job and the dignity of making that contribution. </PARA>
<PARA>  A total of 20,800 females lost their full time jobs in the last month--that is, 20,800 mothers or sisters who, until this Government's policies imposed themselves on them and threw them out of work, were able to bring in a dollar and provide for their families, friends, relatives and others. These are real people who were proud of their ability to hold down a job and earn a living--people who had never dreamt that they would be themselves the victims of a recession induced by the Government, forcing them to go down to fill in the form for the social security benefit. </PARA>
<PARA>  The figures show that nearly 30 per cent of young Australians are now unemployed. I invite honourable members to think of the tragedy that that represents for the future of this country. These unemployment figures are not just figures. These are, in fact, Australians and young Australians looking to make a contribution to this society. These young people are being robbed of the opportunity to work and to contribute to the future of this country, to themselves and to their families. Literally thousands of young Australians, as they look for work, find themselves on the treadmill of social security dependency which this Government is so fond of building constantly and which it has been forced to build on as a result of its policy. Think of how those young people will have their morale crushed--young people who will be scarred for life as a result of this Government's deliberate policy to introduce a recession. </PARA>
<PARA>  I ask honourable members to set the economics aside and think of the social consequences of putting these young people on the treadmill. Think of the consequences for the crime rate. Think of the consequences for those who might get entrapped in the world of drugs. Think of those thousands of young people only recently described by the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe), the man who claims to have  concern and compassion for these people, as the new poor--a direct consequence of the absolute failure of economic policy under this Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  The official figure of unemployed is certainly 872,000 today, but do not forget the rest. That is just part of the story. The truth is that beyond that many more are underemployed. They would work more if they had a chance. They would put in more if the opportunities were provided. There would be something like 520,000 of those people, in addition to the 872,000. So we have a total of not nearly a million; we in fact have a total of 1.4 million Australians who are either out of work or who would work more if only they were given the opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA>  What do we get from the Government?  Nothing but a political attack on the Opposition, as if that offered anybody any hope. Today, again, we got from the Government just the holding out, the spectre of some hope of some recovery in the Australian economy. The Prime Minister promised us on 4 December 1990 that unemployment would not reach double digits. </PARA>
<PARA>  That really is the classic completion of the trifecta: no child will live in poverty in 1990, honourable members might remember that; in the last election campaign, Government members promised until they were blue in the face that they would not let there be a recession; and then in December last year they made the claim that unemployment would not reach double digits, and yet it has done so today on their own figures. Now they are standing here and saying, `This is all right; this is what we thought would happen'. For heaven's sake, these guys have deliberately brought on this recession and thrown people into unemployment as a deliberate policy, reflecting their inability to do all the other things that need to be done in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA>  I ask honourable members to look at the claim of recovery. This is a claim they make week in and week out. I can take honourable members back to 1987 when the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), said, `This is the coming of the golden age'. It is a sick joke. The Government must believe that members of the Australian public are ultimately gullible. In 1988 the claim was, `We are bringing home the bacon'. Even last year as the economy was slipping into recession, the Prime Minister was saying, `Look, the recovery is on the way; things are picking up in the housing sector'. Does that ring a bell with honourable members?  That is exactly what he said today. He is just repeating the same old words as the economy dives further into recession. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government says that recovery is picking up, inflation is down. For heaven's sake, inflation is down because we are in the worst recession for 60 years--not as a result of any policy of those opposite but because of the recession. The other claim is, `The balance of payments is looking better. This is good policy; we are really controlling this economy; we are fixing the balance of payments'. Sure, imports are down. They were down 12 per cent last time. Why?  Because people cannot afford to buy the imports that they otherwise would have. In other words, this is a direct result of the recession--the worst recession in 60 years. </PARA>
<PARA>  If honourable members want to know where this economy is going, the truth is that we are in a rolling recession. Sure, the figures are up and down a bit, but I ask honourable members to look at the figures that really count. Look at the big income earners for this country. Look at our agricultural industries, the rural industries. They are facing probably the hardest times they have faced since the Great Depression of the 1930s, as is endorsed by the Leader of the National Party. </PARA>

If we talk to a few people out in the real world, they will tell us that investment is going to drop 16, 17 or 18 per cent. What is the Government going to do about that? The biggest symbol of the failure of economic policy and an indication of where we are going is the fact that unemployment is rising, as the figures show today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  There is no quick fix and we do not suggest to people there is. But I tell honourable members, as sure as we are all here today, that there are many things that can be done, and can be done now, to provide people with jobs. The damning indictment of this Government, during the worst recession for 60 years, is what we find if we look in their ranks. Do we find Government members talking about a national strategy for jobs? Do we find them talking about making those changes to policy that will give this country a future? No. What we find is incredible factional infighting as the Prime Minister builds up support to retain the top job. Why did we get the superannuation reforms? Because the former Treasurer had promised them to the ACTU and the Prime Minister had to do a deal to keep him at bay. It was made for no other reason but to save Government members' own political scalps--it was not made for the public interest at all. As a consequence of that decision, at the time of the worst recession in 60 years the Government introduces in the Budget a change to superannuation that will see an additional 100,000 Australians unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are a lot of things that the Government could do. It ought to change the tax system. We have a massive problem with our foreign debt. The Government thinks that we need, as we obviously do, to boost our exports. Look at Australia's tax system. We tax people who export. Just let that sink in. The very people we want to encourage, we tax through the existing sales tax system. That is crazy. </PARA>

In other words, we penalise our exporters but we give our importers a tax break. We pick up the paper and we read that another factory has closed down with jobs exported offshore. Why is that happening?  One of the reasons is that we run a tax system that penalises the people we ought to encourage yet provides a tax break, with the taxpayers' money, to the people who are importing into this country. We have a tax system that imposes tax on investment. It is an incredible proposition. We are desperate for investment, yet the Government taxes investment.

<PARA>  There used to be a large measure of agreement in this country about the general goals. These were goals shared by all political parties.

Nicholls's cliches because the present Opposition is led by a clique of extreme right wing ideologues led in turn by an extreme right wing ideologue. Its policies are nothing but a gaggle of cliches. There is no detail in the Opposition's policies. The centrepiece is a goods and services tax, and it is absolutely incredible that a major political party such as the Liberal Party, which has been kicking round since about 1945, is proposing to the Australian people an alternative as far-reaching as a goods and services tax but still does not have the guts to put up detail. </PARA>

It was a performance short on detail, short on solutions, but long--very long--on personal abuse. It was short--very short--on any policy prescriptions with nothing about how to get real jobs. Of course, we have heard the usual general litany and prognostications from the Opposition. The message is unchanged: slash government expenditure;  slash community facilities; introduce an unfair and regressive consumption tax; and privatise, without exception, publicly owned institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>  Thatcher is the model. New Zealand is the model. What the Opposition wants is an intensification of Thatcher's prescriptions which have failed in the United Kingdom because, in moving to a more market driven society, the UK failed to do what we are doing, and that is restructuring in industry. New Zealand failed because it did not have a wages policy in its essential restructuring. </PARA>
<PARA>  What we have heard this afternoon is a half-adequate description of computer economics I. What we have not heard is the detail of how the Opposition intends to implement its narrow ideology. We all know--people who have been in politics--that the Opposition's policies will irresistibly lead to higher unemployment. After all, the Opposition is dedicated to slashing close to $5 billion from Commonwealth programs. We all know that the Opposition's policies will irresistibly lead to higher interest rates. After all, the Opposition is committed to 0 to 2 per cent inflation, whatever the social cost. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do not know how the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) particularly can stand in this place and say that his Party--his so-called coalition--is committed to 0 to 2 per cent inflation and yet is also committed to the introduction of a goods and services tax, when it sees what happened to inflation in New Zealand. For a period interest rates went to 25 per cent and inflation was at 19 per cent. That is the New Zealand model, the model the Opposition wants to inflict upon Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have got to hand it to the Leader of the Opposition. On some occasions he claims that he is green. It all depends on the audience, I guess. But he did say on 1 October:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I believe in the environment as much as anybody else does, anywhere else in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>He is right, and the proof of the Leader of the Opposition's environmental credentials are simple: he is an ardent believer in recycling. He is recycling his consumption tax policy--if we could describe it as that, if we could dignify it by calling it that, because we have no detail--which has been around in his mind for years and years. He is recycling his flat tax policy. That has also been around for years in the Opposition. Joh Bjelke-Petersen probably gave that one to him. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Leader of the Opposition is recycling his health policy--if there is one. That has been a major recycling effort by the Conservatives. He is recycling his privatisation schemes. He is recycling his industrial relations schemes. Jay Pendarvis is still the hero of the computer worthies of the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Where is he?  He was put up by the Opposition as the token, and then he was wiped off. We all know that the Opposition's policies will irresistibly place the burden of economic change on those least able to protect themselves. The Opposition is dedicated to scrapping benefits for the unemployed and taking the short sword to welfare payments. All of us in this place who have been in politics for a while know that the Opposition's policies will irresistibly benefit those people in positions of privilege and power. After all, the Opposition advocates with this gaggle, this string of H.R. Nicholls's cliches, the further empowerment of the already powerful in Australian society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  These are the general results of a political philosophy which holds that the devil and the scrap heap take the hindmost. Thinking members of this House and the people of Australia understand that the general thrust of the Opposition's policy approach is unfair, narrow and regressive. But that is about all we know, for we in this House, and Australians in the urban and regional areas, are still waiting for the detail. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Leader of the Opposition started off today with a childish, immature approach to politics. He was trying, as he did in Question Time today, to pin the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and other members of the Government with statements made some time ago. As we all well know, this is a very childish exercise; anybody can pick the statements of any one of us at any time and show later they were incorrect. I have never come to the conclusion about that sort of nitpicking that people in public life do not believe what they are saying at the time. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is the much misquoted `children in poverty' allegation that the Opposition loves to trot out, knowing full well, cynically, that if it were in government it would slash social welfare. I will just refer to the family allowance supplement. All the reforms that we have secured in social security and the fact that we have increased the percentage of spending on those least able to cope with the conditions they are faced with in society--all that targeting, most recently exemplified in the family package in the Budget--show that we are doing more and more for the poor, and we are proud of it. The Opposition wishes to slash social welfare, yet it laughs about an honestly made statement, one that we have gone a long way towards providing security for the children of this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is talk of the recession. We have to understand that the 1980s was a long period of growth for many of the countries in the world. It was a decade of unprecedented growth. Policies followed by us and many other countries in the world did not make allowance for some aspects of the growth and the activities of the private sector particularly, in those growing economies. It was not just the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand that took some of the same policy prescriptions; there was also a range of smaller countries. </PARA>
<PARA>  Part of this was associated with financial deregulation. In Australia's case, the terms of trade collapse in 1985-86, the worldwide phenomenon of the stock market crash in 1987, and the very rapid turnaround in our terms of trade were not fully allowed for. In hindsight, the world's reaction to the 1987 stock market crash was too much. Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition should quote all those people in the United States and the other advanced Western economies who made statements at the time which were subsequently proved to be incorrect. We swapped a tight fiscal policy for what could be seen, with hindsight, as a too soft monetary policy. None of us in the advanced Western countries measured well enough the dimensions of the asset price boom, particularly in central business district management, in equities and in dwellings. The countries of the world with which we compare ourselves all shared that experience. </PARA>
<PARA>  We are vitally concerned about business investment. The leaks to the newspapers today indicate that. But we have to face reality. I believe in telling Australians the way it is. There is not going to be a lot of investment in the central business districts of our cities. We can see the legacy of that assets price boom, with at least three cities in Australia massively overbuilt. We know the stress that agriculture is going through. We know that there is not going to be a lot of investment there. Through that big boom in investment in the late 1980s, we know that a lot of investment went into manufacturing industry and that there is now low capacity utilisation there. </PARA>
<PARA>  The point the Opposition fails to understand and fails to make, in its cynical opportunism, is that through the 1980s, through that period of growth, with the cooperation of the trade union movement in this country we achieved more structural reform than we have ever achieved before. State governments now come to us for funds for redundancy programs as they straighten out their public infrastructure. We are the ones who took the hard decisions on tariff reform. We are the ones who have taken the hard decisions in welfare reform. We are the ones who have taken the hard decisions on restructuring, getting a larger traded goods sector. We are the ones who took the fundamental decisions to internationalise this economy and get away from the colonial cringe once and for all. We are the people who have been taking the decisions to make this economy more competitive. </PARA>
<PARA>  What is the Opposition going to do about investment? It is not saying a word about that. It is not prepared to take reality into account. We know that we will get continuing investment in the mining sector. We know that as the economy grows again there will be investments to take up the slack and pick up stocks. We know that when the Opposition is honest, as the Leader of the Opposition recently was in part of his speech to ACOSS, and as the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) was yesterday about the reality of interest rates--all the speculation by the media is silly if we are going to equate any particular interest rate drop with jobs immediately--it understands the situation, but today we saw an example of cynical opportunism. </PARA>
<PARA>  What is the Opposition going to say? Is it going to say to the business sector that it can have immediate write-off? Is it going to say with respect to depreciation that it can have 33 per cent write-off? Is it going to advocate those sorts of policies and encourage investment, probably not of an optimal nature? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition says that there is a tax on investment. I do not quite know what he means by that. We have always had very good depreciation systems in this country. The taxation reform we put in place for the company sector, the business sector, through the 1980s was unprecedented. We changed the effective company tax rate from 74.4 per cent to 39 per cent. The Opposition could never have even envisaged doing what the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) did for the corporate sector with respect to taxation reform through the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is almost ironic that, while the discipline of the trade union movement meant that profits were vastly increased as we worked with the union movement and increased the social wage, a lot of those profits were frittered away by the private sector and the suboptimal decisions taken. We can go into international comparisons with respect to our taxation system. Overall, we have the second lowest level of tax in the whole of the OECD. These matters are before us. </PARA>
<PARA>  I could go on, but I am sure that this motion has been seen for what it is by the people of Australia. It is just another example of cynical opportunism by the Opposition. The Opposition does not have one skerrick of alternative policy. We have not seen one detail of its policies and nothing has been said about the future of Australia. I move:</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MD4">Mr BALDWIN</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Sydney-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>-Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services)</ROLE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-by leave--I present a policy statement, Higher Education: Quality and Diversity in the 1990s, which outlines the Government's policies and priorities for higher education for the coming decade. The statement incorporates the announcements of the level and composition of enrolment growth, as well as the aggregate levels of funding to be provided under the operating grant and capital programs for the 1992-94 triennium.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Since the release of the Government's White Paper on higher education in July 1988, Australia's higher education system has undergone a period of unparalleled growth and structural change. This period saw the ending of the increasingly anachronistic `binary' divide between the traditional universities and the colleges of advanced education, and an increased emphasis on the competitive allocation of research funds. One particularly welcome change was the introduction of rolling triennial arrangements for higher education funding. </PARA>
<PARA>  It has also been marked by very substantial increases in levels of Commonwealth funding support. In this statement the Government is announcing major new funding commitments, over and above those needed to support growth, to enable the system to address the challenges of the 1990s. Total funding for the 1992-94 triennium will exceed $12 billion. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of particular importance is the Government's decision to provide an additional $70m per year from 1994, approximately 2 per cent of total operating grant funds, to support and to reward measures adopted by institutions to enhance quality of teaching. These funds are over and above normal operating grant funds. This is a key element in an integrated set of initiatives set out in this statement addressing the issue of quality. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government is providing a major boost to the higher education capital program for 1994 to facilitate continuing growth in the system and to address the pressing need for refurbishment of existing capital stock. An additional $270.3m is to be provided in 1994, a 27 per cent real increase over the 1993 level. By way of contrast, the 1988 capital program was $94.2m. </PARA>
<PARA>  In this statement the Government is also signalling its intention to liberalise the capital program, in particular by, from 1992, extending the definition of capital to recognise major investments in course materials and equipment which are genuine capital substitutes and, over the period 1994-96, the incorporation of the higher education capital program into institutional operating grants. </PARA>
<PARA>  In deciding on higher education growth in 1994, the Government has sought to at least maintain levels of opportunity for undergraduate study for both school leavers and older aspirants, and has decided to provide an additional $41m for some 2,845 new intakes in 1994, including 1,450 higher degree places. This means that the higher education operating resources will have risen from $2,950m in 1988 to $3,700m in 1994. Support for targeted research programs administered by the Australian Research Council has risen from $90m in 1988 to $260m in 1994. </PARA>
<PARA>  Some of the changes introduced since the White Paper, particularly the annual `profiles' negotiations which provide the basis for the Commonwealth's funding for individual institutions, attracted a degree of initial controversy. However these processes, as they have been refined over the past three years, are now very well accepted by the system. The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, AVCC, in particular, has repeatedly affirmed its support for the profiles mechanism as providing a reasonable balance between the requirements of institutional autonomy and public accountability. </PARA>
<PARA>  The higher education system has experienced some particular stresses in recent times as a result of high levels of over-enrolment and overcrowding. On 4 October I released a statement which, drawing on data collected by the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the results of a survey of institutions conducted by the AVCC, provided an analysis of the causes of the problem and a strategy to deal with them. </PARA>
<PARA>  While current labour market conditions were a contributing factor, it is also clear that there are significant deficiencies in some institutions' procedures for monitoring and controlling enrolments. The Government's strategy to ameliorate these problems, which includes giving institutions more flexibility in meeting student load targets, has been welcomed by the system. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government announced a range of short term measures to deal with these problems in the 1991-92 Budget context, including an acceleration of the capital program, the introduction of renovation grants on a matching funds basis, and additional recurrent funding to help cope with enrolment pressures.</PARA>
<PARA>  A further source of tension was the long delay in finalising the salary increases and other matters flowing from the structural efficiency principles. This matter, which was eventually referred to a Full Bench of the Industrial Relations Commission, took far longer to resolve than any of the parties, or the Commonwealth, would have desired. The Commonwealth responded very promptly to the IRC decision on 23 July by agreeing to fund fully the salary increases flowing from the decision. This decision, which will mean average salary increases for academics of 16 per cent, rising to 20 per cent, should help considerably to alleviate the prospective shortage of academic staff to the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA>  In considering directions for the future, the Government has been mindful that many of the White Paper changes, particularly the institutional restructuring and amalgamations, need further time to become fully bedded down. It is clear that the system would benefit from a further period of relative stability in these matters. It is the Commonwealth's intention that, in general, the further evolution of institutional arrangements in the higher education system should be on the initiative of the institutions themselves, with the Commonwealth playing a less active role than in the recent past. </PARA>
<PARA>  In framing this statement, the Government has been mindful of the recommendations of the report on young people's participation in education and training, the Finn review. The Finn review envisages continued growth in all education and training sectors but places particular emphasis on raising the status of and participation in the technical and further education sector. The report also calls for an inquiry into the appropriate balance of participation in the various education and training sectors. </PARA>
<PARA>  Concern has been expressed in some quarters that higher education could suffer as a result of the renewed attention being given to TAFE. This statement should put any such fears decisively to rest. The 1994 level of growth, as announced in this statement, is the same as that for 1993 and, furthermore, should be regarded as a minimum as it may be revisited following the Finn review of intersectoral balance. </PARA>
<PARA>  The level of funding I am announcing today supports a series of measures, which are detailed in this statement, designed to promote quality and diversity in the higher education system. These measures can be grouped according to three broad themes:</PARA>
<PARA>    the need for credible quality assurance arrangements for Australia's higher education system and for arrangements to systematically reward excellence in teaching as well as research;</PARA>
<PARA>    the changing pattern of participation in higher education during the 1990s and the relationship of higher education to the other education and training sectors; and</PARA>
<PARA>    the potential for new technologies and alternative delivery modes to transform aspects of the delivery of higher education and to substantially broaden access. Institutions need increased flexibility in the use of funds, particularly those provided under the capital program, if this potential is to be realised. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend this policy statement to the House. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BT4">Dr KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It looks like a student essay; in some respects, unfortunately, it is as thin as many a student essay. It has the nice plastic cover that a student essay typically has. It has an attractive title, which I recognise as referring to important values in higher education that have been consistently reiterated by the Opposition but have not figured largely in the Government's statements about its goals for higher education. So it is pleasing to see these values reflected in the title of the paper.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  If one were marking this paper, I think one would have to say that the substance of the essay is not appropriate to the title. There is very little in the paper of any substance which supports the title or which will increase quality or secure diversity in higher education in the 1990s. I think the Minister probably believes that that is the case and is somewhat embarrassed by the thinness of this document, because in his statement to the House when presenting the paper he made a great deal of the funding decisions embodied in the paper but said very little about any of the material set out in the paper under the headings of `Quality' and `Diversity'. </PARA>
<PARA>  I can only assume from that that the Minister does not believe that the measures he has set out in the paper specifically to achieve quality and diversity will do so. If that is his secret belief, one can only endorse it, because this is a paper which fails totally to address the fundamental structural problems in higher education. It relies for its acceptance in the academic community on some funding decisions that undoubtedly will be welcomed. I have no doubt that vice-chancellors will welcome the moves towards greater flexibility in relation to capital funding and the widening of the definition of capital funding. </PARA>
<PARA>  There will be general acceptance of and satisfaction with the increases in funding that occur; although, when a paper continually refers to figures relating to triennia and long periods of time, one begins to wonder whether it is not a deliberate political strategy to inflate the size of the funding figures to create a better impression on behalf of the paper than the paper actually warrants. A look at the substance of these measures will show that they are considerably slighter than the inflated rhetoric the Minister has applied to them. </PARA>
<PARA>  This paper serves only to underscore how the Liberal and National parties have been leading the debate on higher education in this country. It is a paper that is full of plagiarised rhetoric and symbolic gestures in an effort to pretend that the Government is actually proposing some significant freeing up of the higher education system in the interests of quality and diversity. The emphasis on funding decisions in the Minister's statement I think is revealing. The paper fails to address the fundamental structural impediments to quality and diversity which its system of funding and its system of regulation have put in place. Quality and diversity are important values. Indeed, they are vital to the health of higher education over this decade. The paper speaks loudly on their behalf but does little to achieve them. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is interesting that this paper does not refer in its title to equity or opportunity. There is, of course, a reason for this--and not the reason given in the paper, which is that that has all been dealt with. The Minister knows that it would receive a horse laugh from people around the country who have been reading of the tens of thousands of qualified students who are excluded from universities. Not even this Minister could pretend that this paper has anything in it which will significantly enhance opportunities for the growing number of qualified students whom this Minister will not let into universities. This year the number of students was 30,000. A week ago the Minister announced his solution to those additional students who had crept in over and beyond the quotas he had imposed on universities. He said to the universities, `We'll solve the problem of overcrowding. We'll lock these students out of the institutions'. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister admitted then, and admits in this paper, that there was a flaw in the Government's system of quotas imposed on institutions. I think there was some recognition in this statement he issued that these regulations of the Government provided institutions with an incentive to overenrol. Institutions knew that if they underenrolled they would lose funding and that if they overenrolled they would be fully funded. So they had to enrol up to the base figure. The Government created the problem of overcrowding. It refused to fund the students. Now it says that the solution is to help the universities stop letting in so many Australian students. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government has given the universities some flexibility in relation to quotas; that is something. But it is quite clear from this paper that it is determined to maintain its prohibition on the universities offering additional places to Australian students on terms that are acceptable to both the student and the institution. This Minister has no objection whatever to overseas students being admitted to Australian universities for full fees--and there are 15,000 such students in the system, but he has a deep objection to the universities overenrolling some 14,000 students who he says should not be there, and he is determined to prevent them enrolling another 30,000 students whom he says he is not prepared to pay for. He will not allow them to pay for themselves, for business sponsors to pay for them or for them in any way to get access to the public higher education system. </PARA>
<PARA>  The purpose of this paper is to reiterate the locking out of tens of thousands of qualified Australian students from higher education. The Minister has, of course, released this document in a context which is deeply embarrassing for him and his senior Minister, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), because the Government's most authoritative independent source of advice on policy, the Industry Commission, has just brought down a report on education services. This report damned the Government's funding and regulatory framework for higher education. It said that it was inequitable; that it was choking off opportunities to expand the export sector; and that it was fundamentally flawed. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Industry Commission said that under the current framework for allocating resources, it was virtually impossible to get any satisfactory indication of what value students placed on the private benefits they get from their university courses and that, as a result, resource allocation decisions would very likely be wrong. That is what the Industry Commission said about the Government's current funding framework--that the decisions would very likely be wrong. </PARA>
<PARA>  But, of course, the Minister is not interested in that. For ideological reasons, he wants to maintain central bureaucratic and political control over the nation's universities. He cannot afford to free up those institutions to give them a financial independence because they might start doing things that the students or the academics wanted. They might actually start to be able to provide the sort of world-class education that this country needs. The Minister wants to keep them on a very tight leash. Despite all the rhetoric in this document about flexibility and autonomy--rhetoric stolen from the coalition--with one or two minor exceptions, there is no substantive move in this direction. </PARA>
<PARA>  In its report, the Industry Commission also drew attention to the fact that universities were suffering from the entirely expected rigidities which arise from the Government's approach to the central regulation of industrial relations. I quote from the report:</PARA>
<PARA>Inflexibilities in the labour market are also important. Academic salaries are, with some limited exceptions, uniform and unrelated to market demand. </PARA>
<PARA>As a result, of course, there is very likely to be a shortage of high quality teachers in those very disciplines where demand is high. The Industry Commission set out--I thought very helpfully--to assist the Minister in finally getting his paper completed. The Commission canvassed a range of alternatives in its report. For example, it noted that Professor Karmel, one of Australia's most respected academics and academic administrators, had proposed a voucher-based system based on price flexibility. It said in its report:</PARA>
<PARA>There is no reason why such an approach could not be developed using the HECS payback mechanism, to preserve the benefits of the policy. </PARA>
<PARA>Being of a helpful frame of mind, the Industry Commission went on to suggest:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Government might provide vouchers, redeemable at any institution, to all qualified students, with the amount of the voucher set at a rough estimate of the valuation of the external benefits of higher education to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>It said that it assumed that the Government would wish to have an urgent thorough review of current arrangements and it requested a reference for such a review. It thought that an urgent review was necessary because of the gross inequities that it had identified--inequities which, for ideological reasons, the Minister will not shift. It identified serious inefficiencies in the Government's funding system--a system which is likely to make decisions which are incorrect and wrong in terms of the wishes of those people actually seeking higher education services. The Minister, however, has taken no notice of that. </PARA>
<PARA>  I hope that the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) might provide a reference to the Industry Commission. But the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, of course, wanted no such independent review of his disastrous and flawed system. The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services in his paper today says that the Government:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . intends that the existing system in which operating resources are largely distributed in accordance with weighted student loads after negotiation of institutional profiles should stand. </PARA>
<PARA>The real issue, however, is whether these arrangements are going to provide for the sensible and rational development of the system of universities over this decade. </PARA>
<PARA>  Whatever the attitude of particular institutions may be to the Government's profiles process, it is undeniable--and the Government has never denied this--that these decisions are based on nothing more than bureaucratic and political discretion. The decisions are made in each individual case, depending upon how persuasive each institution is. Institutions are making their recommendations in an environment in which certain crucial kinds of information are being denied to them by the Government, especially information about the value that Australian students are placing on their courses. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is no wonder that the Industry Commission said that this system was flawed. But, of course, the Government does not want to know this. It has resisted the Opposition's continued exposure of the fundamental weaknesses of the process it has established and it is angered when the Industry Commission makes the same point. The Commission, of course, foresaw the possibility that there might not be a reference to it. It therefore said in the report that, in the absence of such a public review:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the costs to Australians of continuing to preclude qualified domestic students from universities would warrant urgent attention. In these circumstances the Government should address the question by implementing immediately one of the more acceptable options discussed below. </PARA>
<PARA>The Industry Commission said that the Government should immediately implement one of these options to allow these 30,000 students in. The Government will not do so. The Minister is too committed to the centralised system to allow such a flexibility and freedom to be put into place. The queues of qualified students will lengthen because this Minister has locked the door on them. </PARA>
<PARA>  Nor is it good enough for the Minister to now say that the pressures on institutions to amalgamate is going to be eased. Of course, this will be welcomed by some institutions. But the Government needs to say more. We need details. Will it allow the institutions to disamalgamate if they believe that this is desirable on academic grounds? The Minister may well be faced with such decisions. </PARA>
<PARA>  This statement for the nineties lacks this detail. The statement contains only a general wink and a nod to institutions in verbal terms that the Government will not be putting quite as much pressure on them in the future as it has in the past. We will see from experience just how much freedom the Minister is actually prepared to allow the institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, the amalgamations process has been one of the major problems for higher education. It is a government-caused problem. It has caused upheaval, demoralised academic staff and damaged quality. Therefore, one can only view with a great deal of cynicism the following statement in the Minister's paper:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the main rationale for institutional restructuring--</PARA>
<PARA>that is the bureaucratic language for forced amalgamations--</PARA>
<PARA>was to enhance quality through the enrichment of academic programs. </PARA>
<PARA>Has it done so? Has it increased quality?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Yes.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BT4">Dr KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-Well, the Minister's paper does not say so. He was not prepared to say that in print. He can say that in an interjection in the House but there is nothing in this paper which says that. The Minister says that he still needs to review the impact of the amalgamations process. But we have him on the record now. We will see what his review says. Why was he not prepared to allow an independent review of the performance of his system by the Industry Commission? It is very easy to make these rhetorical interjections but let us have a look at the substance of the system. Everybody who has looked at higher education knows that this process of forced amalgamations has been immensely damaging to the quality of higher education in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Is this not the time when we should have had an assessment of the impact of the amalgamation process? It is very indicative that the Government now feels it necessary to implement a whole series of new initiatives, none of which are of any substance--but new initiatives which, it says, will increase quality in higher education. Of course, quality is not something which the Government can assure. The Minister, who is leaving the chamber, knows that. He is not prepared to defend this paper. It arises from institutions which have the freedom and the incentives to set and pursue a mission of educational quality. The Minister's rhetoric in this paper is fine. He is going to give the institutions greater freedom to pursue quality. </PARA>
<PARA>  What is more--wait for it--he is going to provide a fund of $70m every year out of which sums of money will be given to those institutions which have performed best in the expenditure of their total allocation. Who is going to give out this money? On what basis is this $70m going to be awarded to the lucky institutions? Of course, it will be awarded according to the Government's own political and bureaucratic judgments. It is symptomatic of the problem that underlies the Government's whole approach to higher education--that quality is something generated from the centre and that those people who sit in the Department of Employment, Education and Training are the best judges of what is quality education. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government will have this slush fund of $70m which it will dole out to those institutions of which it approves. It has the nerve in this paper to say that, of course, participation in this process of quality assurance--it sounds like the meat industry--will be voluntary. There will be this carrot of $70m, but people do not have to compete for it. It is up to them whether they put themselves into this system and try to get some money out of the pot. Who in higher education is going to believe that? It is perfectly evident that this slush fund will be there to make sure that institutions toe the line. Let us make no mistake about it: this $70m is what the Minister in this paper calls the major initiative to secure quality--a new fund to be given out at his discretion and the discretion of his bureaucrats. It is the major initiative to ensure quality in higher education. </PARA>
<PARA>  Well, I do not think anyone in higher education will be fooled by the sort of approach which is taken here. Of course, it is characteristic of the Government's approach that it has given the Higher Education Council a reference to tell it what quality is. It has asked Professor Chubb, for whom one must have a great deal of sympathy, and the lobby groups which sit behind him on the Higher Education Council, to inform the Government what quality is--and no doubt to assist the Government in handing out this $70m. Professor Chubb is having a fairly tough time in doing this. An article in the Sydney Morning Herald of 8 October 1991 stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The task of deciding what quality in higher education is all about is proving a tough one for the Department of Employment, Education and Training's Higher Education Council. Asked some time ago by the Minister for Higher Education, Mr Baldwin, to prepare a paper on the topic, the council's chairman, Professor Ian Chubb, said: "We're ploughing through that. The problem is no two people would agree on what quality is. . . quality has been likened to love--you know what it is when you feel it, but you can't describe it. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, what that means is that one cannot determine and settle it from the centre, either. Only a system which is freed up, which is responsive to the student market, which has the flexibility to get top quality staff into the courses where there is demand, and to pay the money for the researchers will be able to produce quality. Ultimately, the students and the academics themselves will determine quality in the system--not the Minister presiding over one of his slush funds, and not the Higher Education Council. </PARA>
<PARA>  A national quality assurance structure is to be established to report on the adequacy of quality management arrangements at the institutional level. The Government is going to tell the institutions whether they are being well managed. Let us imagine anybody presiding over the structure of the Department of Employment, Education and Training attempting to tell the universities in this country whether or not they are being well managed. </PARA>
<PARA>  In the industry statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in March, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training's effective schools program was announced. Now we have the junior Minister's effective universities program announced. Neither will succeed. Both are entirely symbolic and both show that the Government is simply not prepared to address the issues that will produce quality and diversity in higher education in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  I come to the final section of this paper, which states that the Government will produce diversity. Diversity is a problem for the Government because the unified national system is a centralised bureaucratic system operating under an ideology of what the Government calls equity. It is a very strange definition of equity, as we have seen, but that is what it calls equity. It means giving the same to everybody regardless of performance. It means the imposition of uniformity. </PARA>
<PARA>  But how within this system does one guarantee diversity? Without diversity, it is absolutely certain that one will not have quality and one will not have the courses that the students, who are diverse, want. Firstly, the Government starts off by quoting the Higher Education Council's December report last year which stated that diversity is important. What was characteristic about that report was that there was not a single recommendation in it to secure diversity. It was entirely empty rhetoric. </PARA>
<PARA>  In this section of his paper, the Minister states that the amalgamations process will be eased up. But, of course, everybody knows that it is this process which has squeezed diversity out of the system. Over the last year I have spoken to hundreds and hundreds of students in higher education throughout this country and, without exception, there is an awareness on their part that this system is depriving them of the opportunity to take the kinds of courses that were formerly available in the binary system. Once these institutions have been amalgamated, a uniform structure, a uniform format, a uniform philosophy has been applied to courses. </PARA>
<PARA>  The fact is that in this paper the Minister has no measures which will secure institutional diversity. He is quite unclear as to whether he will allow this amalgamation. He has not evaluated the impact of the unified national system and so he is not prepared to put forward any substantial proposition whatever that would guarantee that over this decade we will have a growing diversity of appropriate institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Minister talks about the diversity of students. He talks about some minor measures relating to lifelong learning. He inflates the importance of the use of technology in distance education. He talks about credit transfers. They are all efforts to suggest that somehow or other this Government is determined to secure diversity in higher education. But there is nothing of substance. </PARA>
<PARA>  This report fails to address any of the basic structural impediments to quality and diversity in higher education. It has taken no notice whatever of the Industry Commission report, which identified this current system as fundamentally flawed. It fails to address any of the significant labour market issues. It continues to misrepresent the impact on recruitment of the academic salary increase earlier this year. It does nothing to correct the fundamental flaws of the centralised funding system. Despite all the rhetoric, it continues on the proposition that Canberra knows best and it locks the door on over 30,000 qualified Australian students. This paper is a fraud. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-It has been drawn to my attention that during Question Time, which I could not attend because I was at a memorial service in Sydney, the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) saw fit to quote from a speech I made in the House yesterday. I am always flattered when honourable members opposite quote from my speeches, and I encourage them to continue to do so because those speeches always have much to commend them. However, in the process of doing so the Minister, by leaving out the second half of what I had said on the subject to which he referred, gave a rather unbalanced view of what I had said. Therefore, I should simply read the two sentences to put the matter in context. What I said about truth on unemployment was:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I suppose the first thing that can be done is that we ought to tell the truth about unemployment; we ought not exaggerate it; and we ought not be doom and gloom merchants. </PARA>
<PARA>That is fine; I did say that. However, I then went on to say something which the Minister, of course, did not refer to. I said:</PARA>
<PARA>But, by the same token, we should not indulge in some of the Pollyanna language which has lately come, particularly from the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). On the truth stakes, when it comes to projections from the other side of the House about what is going to happen with unemployment, I would support the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) and I would reject Mr Hawke. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-by leave--I present the report of the visit by the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Hong Kong, Singapore and Indonesia, 24 January to 23 February 1991. It was a privilege for me to lead the parliamentary delegation to Hong Kong and Singapore in January and February of this year. The Speaker, Mr Leo McLeay, the honourable member for Grayndler, joined the delegation as leader for the visit to Indonesia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The delegation's itinerary was an interrupted one, owing to the events in the Middle East and an uncertainty about security in Bangkok. The proposed participation of the delegation in the IPU regional conference in Thailand had to be cancelled, as was the planned visit to Pakistan. While these changes were a disappointment, they did not detract from the worth of the visit, and I consider this report to be an extremely productive and constructive one. </PARA>
<PARA>  This was the first official parliamentary delegation ever to visit Hong Kong and it was a very worthwhile precedent. The delegation recommends the establishment of an Australia-Hong Kong parliamentary group in this Parliament and delegation members believe that more regular parliamentary exchanges between Australia and Hong Kong are appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>  The report makes some comments and recommendations on the business migration program as it applies in Hong Kong. While these comments have largely been overtaken by events, it is important that they be considered by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand). The delegation visited a Vietnamese refugee camp in Hong Kong and spoke to representatives of organisations involved in the refugee issue. Members of the delegation were surprised to discover that the majority of Vietnamese refugees were from North Vietnam. They had travelled overland through the People's Republic of China, and then by boat down the Pearl River. Events in recent weeks have supported the delegation's recommendations, particularly recommendation 1.17. </PARA>
<PARA>  The itinerary in Hong Kong was comprehensive and included working meetings with Hong Kong and Australian business people, political leaders and government officials, as well as attending a meeting of the Legislative Council. Members of the delegation were impressed with Hong Kong's dynamism and its success in trade. We believe that there is substantial room for improvement in trade between Hong Kong and Australia. We were also impressed with the approach and performance of Austrade in Hong Kong and strongly support the McKinsey recommendations as to the expansion of Austrade in Hong Kong. We also strongly recommend the involvement of Hong Kong in APEC. </PARA>
<PARA>  On behalf of the delegation, I would like to thank those in Hong Kong who made us feel very welcome. I would like to express our appreciation to Mr Bentley, our Consul-General, and his staff for the excellent program they arranged and for their assistance during our visit. </PARA>
<PARA>  Our visit to Singapore was arranged at very short notice. While the program was not as extensive as that for Hong Kong, it was still extremely useful. </PARA>
<PARA>  The delegation had the unique privilege of visiting the HMAS Success which was berthed in Singapore on its way back from the Arabian Gulf where it had been involved in the naval blockade of Iraq for some seven months.  We were impressed with the morale and efficiency of the officers and crew of the vessel. I note that Captain Graham Sloper has subsequently been promoted. On behalf of all the delegation I offer our congratulations to him. </PARA>
<PARA>  The report draws attention to some areas in which we believe our relations and trade with Singapore could be improved. On behalf of the delegation, I would like to express our appreciation to Mr Alan Brown, the High Commissioner in Singapore, and his staff for their efforts in arranging a diverse and worthwhile itinerary at very short notice, as well as to other Australian officials, including Colonel Kerry Mellor and Mr Frank Walsh from Austrade. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Indonesian segment of the visit was led by Mr Speaker who, unfortunately, is absent from the Parliament today. This visit was both intensive and extensive. I express our appreciation to the Indonesian Government for the warmth and excellence of the hospitality provided. I also thank Mr Phillip Flood, the Australian Ambassador in Jakarta, his wife and all of his staff for their assistance while we were visiting Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA>  The report documents the numerous meetings and inspections that were undertaken by the delegation. Discussions were full and frank, and I believe that all members of the delegation were delighted with the growing health and maturity in relations between our two countries. Improvements in trade and investment between our two nations are mirrored by continuing development in defence and intergovernmental cooperation, as indicated by the signing of the Timor Gap Treaty whilst we were in Indonesia. It is very clear to us that Indonesia regards the signing of that treaty as a major milestone in the developing relationship between our two countries. </PARA>
<PARA>  We had the opportunity to visit some aid funded projects in West Timor and were impressed not only with the success of the projects and the calibre of the Australian personnel involved but also with the excellent relationship that has been developed between Australia and the Indonesian villagers and officials who were involved. It is a matter of regret that these aid programs are not better understood in the broader Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA>  The aspect of the Indonesian visit that was the most complex for the delegation was the visit to East Timor. While there are differences of opinion amongst the delegation which have led to two minority recommendations, the remainder of the report is unanimous. The report has an extensive set of recommendations resulting from the visit to Indonesia. While time will not permit me to go into them in detail, I believe that they are positive and constructive and, if implemented, would further improve relations between our two countries. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of these recommendations is for the Indonesian Government to investigate the establishment of an office of a commercial ombudsman to assist in preliminary legal or contractual arbitrations between Australian companies and their Indonesian partners. It was clear that the difference between the Australian and Indonesian legal systems, together with the complexity of the latter, is becoming a major obstacle to further Australian investment in Indonesia, particularly in manufacturing. A commercial ombudsman to carry out preliminary arbitration could minimise disputes ending in courts with the substantial costs and delays that flow from them. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are also a number of general recommendations in the report which are not country specific. A group of these--recommendations 4.9 to 4.12--relates to the recruiting of overseas students. I particularly commend these to the Government and to the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs as a positive proposal to enhance our commercial interconnection with our Asia-Pacific neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA>  This delegation was a hard-working and productive one. The report I am tabling today is extremely comprehensive, and in that context I particularly thank Mr John Dyer, the delegation secretary, not only for his tireless efforts in assisting us on the visit but also for his help in assembling this report. On behalf of the delegation, I extend to the Parliament our thanks and appreciation for extending to us the privilege of representing it on this visit. I also thank all of those people in the three countries we visited who extended us their hospitality. </PARA>
<PARA>  At a personal level, I express my appreciation to members of the delegation for their efforts both during and following the visit. I believe that they served both this Parliament and their nation well. My thanks also go to those spouses who were able to accompany us at various times. Their presence was extremely beneficial, and in very many cases allowed us to glean information and attitudes that may otherwise not have been available to us. </PARA>
<PARA>  I stated earlier that the report is extensive, but I also believe it is a very positive contribution to Australia's relationship with three of its significant neighbours. It is with great pleasure that I table the report and commend it to honourable members for their consideration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-by leave --I endorse the remarks of my colleague the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), with the exception of his reference to the minority report. In opening, I should say that I enjoyed the spectacle of having two leaders of a delegation. It is a little like the Government itself: it is uncertain where its leadership lies at the moment--and so were we. We had Mr Speaker as the leader in Indonesia and the honourable member for Newcastle as our leader in Hong Kong and Singapore. I would like to thank my colleague John Dyer and, indeed, all those in the various posts overseas and in the private sector who helped us throughout our visit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I want to address a few brief subjects. Obviously, the highlight of our trip was our visit to Indonesia, which is a very significant neighbour of Australia. Our relations with Indonesia are critical to our future. I have been very critical of the Government in past years for the way in which it has allowed individual differences to predominate over the overall necessity for us to maintain and establish an understanding with a country that has a different culture, a different language, enormous diversity, a country that really does not see many issues as we see them. I think the speech made by the incoming Ambassador from Indonesia to Australia, talking about the arrogance of Australians in presenting our perspective on things Asian and on the way in which they conduct their affairs, was very pertinent. </PARA>
<PARA>  From my point of view, of course there are areas in the administration of Indonesia with which I differ. There are many in the administration of Australia with which I also differ. The difficulty in our understanding of how we can best function and operate for the future with Indonesia lies not peculiarly in the enormous population of that country but in the particular relationship of some areas of Indonesia to Australia and, of course, in the undoubted concerns there are with respect to the conduct of affairs in the relationship between East Timor and those who have come from East Timor to Australia and equally, I might say, between Irian Jaya and Papua New Guinea. So there are a number of areas where there are flashpoints in our relationship. </PARA>
<PARA>  As one who has visited East Timor, Irian Jaya and Indonesia on a number of occasions, I can do nothing but commend President Suharto and his Government for what I see as the significant progress that has been achieved. There are, of course, matters that with Australian eyes we would see as being better administered, better managed, where human rights might well be advanced and, indeed, the process of law advanced differently from the way it is at this time. But in saying that I stress that Indonesians do have a different society, and far be it for us to impose our priorities when there are so many faults here. </PARA>
<PARA>  I found the visit in this instance well worth while. I am most impressed with the progress in many centres, particularly in Jakarta and Surabaya. As Mrs Morris, the wife of the honourable member for Newcastle, said at a private function last night, those looking at Australian industry and visiting, for example, the factories we saw in Surabaya cannot but be concerned at how difficult it will be for us to be competitive when the Indonesians are rapidly able to utilise the same machines as we do and are technically as capable. We are foolish if we think the world owes us a living. </PARA>
<PARA>  Indeed, Batam Island, which is adjacent to Singapore, is a venue I would recommend every Australian visiting Singapore should attempt to visit. It is a tribute not only to the Jurong industrial corporation that is developing it but to the Government of Indonesia and the cooperation it has been prepared to extend. Provided the environment is dealt with in a sensitive and sensible manner, I believe it is going to be, much as is Singapore, an illustration of how industrial development can be achieved utilising both human resources and natural resources in a sensible and responsible way. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are several other brief remarks I would like to make with respect to the visit. As far as each of us was concerned, I do not think there was any doubt that the visit to HMAS Success was a highlight. The whole of the journey was taken at a time when the Gulf war was still imminent. In October 1991, it is a little hard looking back and imagining the crisis that existed. We were due to visit an IPU conference in Thailand. We were told of a security threat, and that part of the journey did not eventuate. We were due to visit Pakistan. We were told of security risks there too, and as a result the visit did not eventuate. </PARA>
<PARA>  Our visit to HMAS Success was a product of that ship returning from its service in the Gulf and enforcing the United Nations sanctions. In the report there are observations about some aspects of the ship, but essentially we all had nothing but praise for then Captain, now Commodore, Sloper, and I join with the honourable member for Newcastle in complimenting him on his promotion. We had nothing but praise for the captain of the vessel and for his crew for the way in which they undertook their task. There is little doubt that Success performed its task admirably, and it is to me a great pity that the Success was not constructed at Cockatoo Island. I believe there would have been a far happier group of employees there today if the Government had proceeded on a plan that was originally in mind for forward defence planning when I was Minister for Defence some years ago. </PARA>
<PARA>  The third area I want to mention briefly is Hong Kong. The recommendations in the report include several with respect to each of the places we visited. In respect of Hong Kong, there are two things I would say. The first is that in Australia we must register that Hong Kong is essentially an Asian city. Whatever the future of that community post-1997, it is essential that we maintain our relationships with Hong Kong and understand that, part of China though it will be, Hong Kong is going to continue to be a very critical entrepot port for access for capital, access for commercial activity, and of course for cultural and social contact indefinitely into the future. </PARA>
<PARA>  Hong Kong is a different place. It is a stimulating, vital commercial centre and it is one that has great importance to us. There are great opportunities there for Australians, and Mr Donald Hay, to whom reference is made in the report, is one of those who through his great enterprises has done a great deal to take advantage of those opportunities. There is no doubt that those sorts of opportunities are helped by the way in which Australians conduct their affairs to enhance the reputation of this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  The second recommendation to which I wish to refer might relate to Singapore or it might relate to Hong Kong. In any event, it applies irrespective of the port. It is essential for us, if we are looking at investment and migration into Australia--and I am delighted that the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) is at the table--to set up an instrumentality that will allow one-stop understanding of the requirements for investment and migration to this country. At the moment, it is extraordinarily difficult for an investor coming here, interested in acquiring land, in setting up in whichever part of Australia, to know that labyrinth of responsibility that stretches through local government, State government and Federal government--through all the authorities--to understand, for example, the processes of establishing a new factopower supplies, how to get planning approval and how to proceed with an environmental impact statement. </PARA>
<PARA>  We should provide for all those interested in coming here at least a brochure which sets down fairly simply the ways by which we process their application so that they might be able to have some understanding of the needs of our various levels of government and the ways by which they can invest. I commend that report to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, with respect to East Timor, I know that the honourable member who is about to follow me is about to refer to aspects of that minority report. I sympathise greatly with the people of East Timor. I know how difficult it has been for many of them, but I would hope that the Indonesian authorities, recognising as the Government and the Opposition do, that East Timor is part of Indonesia, progressively might remove the combat military presence in that province and, if need be, the construction elements of the armed forces that are so important to Indonesia, but, above all, allow that part of Indonesia to progress and develop as I believe it has since I last visited there nearly seven or eight years ago. </PARA>
<PARA>  There has been progress; there is a long way to go. But certainly in terms of human rights and human opportunities, one way that they could be facilitated is by greater access, particularly from Dili to Darwin. I hope that in the same way as we had yesteryear, that direct link can be established so that Australians and the relatives of those in East Timor can visit East Timor and we can re-establish normal relations at a tourist and personal level. I think that would help enormously in overcoming some of the barriers of understanding that still exist in that province. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-by leave--I welcome the opportunity in the short time we have available to us today to make a few comments on this report. Firstly, I would also like to place on record my appreciation to the very many people who helped us during our visit. First and foremost, our delegation secretary, John Dyer, deserves great mention. He was a very diligent worker and I certainly appreciated his hard work, tolerance, strong friendship, and the level of experience that he provided to the new members of Parliament going on their first trip.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I would also like to thank most sincerely for their hospitality the Government and the people of Hong Kong and express appreciation for the great cooperation that we received from the Australian Consulate staff, particularly Geoff Bentley, the Consul-General, and Grant Batteersby, the Deputy Consul-General. Also, my thanks go to the Government and the people of Singapore for their delightful hospitality, and to the staff of the Australian High Commission, in particular, Alan Brown and Les Luck. They had very little notice of our intention to visit Singapore, yet still managed to organise an excellent program for us while we were there. </PARA>
<PARA>  As the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) has indicated, all members of the delegation were disappointed at not being able to attend the IPU conference that was held in Thailand or to participate in a parliamentary visit to Pakistan, owing to the security concerns that existed at the time in relation to the Gulf war. </PARA>
<PARA>  I also wish to express my sincere appreciation to the Parliament and Government of the Republic of Indonesia for their comprehensive program, their thorough organisation of all parts of our itinerary during our visit to their country, and their hospitality and generosity. My further thanks go to Phillip Flood, the Australian Ambassador and his staff, particularly Mrs Judith Pead and Dr Mark Napier, for their advice, support and companionship on the trip. </PARA>
<PARA>  The report being tabled covers in detail the extensive range of meetings and discussions that members of the delegation had in our three host countries. All of us learnt a great deal about the current position on trade, economic development, regional security issues, immigration and the flow of illegal immigration from Vietnam, the education of students from these countries in Australian institutions, and Australia's profile and reputation in the region. We utilised numerous opportunities to advance our nation's position on many matters and to seek to identify ways in which we can improve our economic and trading links in these rapidly growing economies. </PARA>
<PARA>  Our educational links with these nations, through the marketing of places in Australian tertiary and secondary institutions, are a large and growing component of our trade, as well as having valuable benefits in our social, cultural and educational relationships. </PARA>
<PARA>  Senator Nick Sherry and I visited the Australian Education Offices in both Hong Kong and Singapore and also spoke about these important education links with representatives of all three governments. I refer honourable members to recommendations 4.1 to 4.4, which we believe will improve the structural processes involved with international students studying in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  The visit of our delegation to Indonesia and, in particular, to East Timor has generated the most comment and interest among the media and the community. I wish to spend some time on this part of our trip, but I do wish to emphasise that the large body of information and recommendations on the other elements of our itinerary deserve full consideration and attention by both the Government and honourable members. My colleagues have highlighted many important elements of our trip in their contributions today. </PARA>
<PARA>  Our visit to East Timor was part of an eight day visit to a number of locations in Indonesia. We also spent quite a deal of our time speaking with senior Indonesian Government Ministers, including the President, on the situation in East Timor as well as on other issues of importance to Indonesian-Australian relations. </PARA>
<PARA>  Our visit to East Timor was brief and limited in its opportunities for us to speak freely and frankly with East Timorese people, compared with our discussions with selected government and military officials. Therefore much of the feedback concerning the situation of the people of East Timor was learned second-hand. </PARA>
<PARA>  Earlier this year, on 17 April, I outlined to the House the history of the conflict of East Timor and my disagreement with the Australian Government's position. In that speech I outlined my perceptions of the situation for the people in that territory of being oppressed, occupied and abused. I do not wish to repeat today all of my concerns as expressed in that speech. However, the perceptions I outlined then are confirmed by this report in our conclusions and recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA>  During our time in Dili, the leader of the delegation, the Speaker, the Hon. Leo McLeay, was handed a letter from the leader of the resistance forces in East Timor, Xanana Gusmao, to be delivered to the Prime Minister of Australia (Mr Hawke). A rough translation of this letter was also given to some members of the delegation, and I seek leave to table a copy of this translation for the benefit of honourable members. </PARA>
<PARA>  Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ST4">Mr GIBSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I thank the House. This letter is an appeal to the Prime Minister and the Australian Government to assist the East Timorese people to find a peaceful resolution to the continuing conflict. I quote from the letter:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  We seek a peaceful political solution and call on the principal parties to the question--Indonesia, Portugal and legitimate representatives of East Timor--to meet with the United Nations to find this solution. The only way to find an immediate solution is through dialogue under the auspices of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA>This statement from Xanana Gusmao in his letter goes to the very essence of the minority recommendations of this report contained on page 140. </PARA>
<PARA>  My colleagues the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), Senator Nick Sherry and I have sought to find a positive way of restoring peace to the people of East Timor. When the Indonesians invaded the territory in 1975, they disrupted the legitimate process of self-determination that was under way. In the years since, they have deliberately embarked on a military campaign to destroy all vestiges of opposition to their takeover. </PARA>
<PARA>  For 16 years the Indonesians have engaged in military action which has resulted in the death of over 100,000 people, destroyed villages and uprooted many thousands more, and they have continued a campaign of oppression. It is clear that the Indonesian authorities are facing a new generation of resistance in both the towns and villages as well as in the hills and countryside. Coverage of demonstrations that were held in 1989 and 1990 in Dili and elsewhere demonstrates this. </PARA>
<PARA>  Reports from reliable sources during our visit, such as the International Committee of the Red Cross and Amnesty International, confirm that abuses of human rights are still widely prevalent and that military offences are regular occurrences. The violence, torture and death in East Timor will not cease until a proper settlement occurs, and no amount of ostrich-type actions by either the Australian Government or some honourable members in this House can avoid this conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA>  If Indonesia truly wishes to take a higher profile on the world stage--to be seen to be a new responsible power in Asia and the Third World--it must sit down and negotiate on the issue of East Timor. Australia has a responsibility to act to achieve this end. We must stand up for the principles of human rights and self-determination that are the foundation of our foreign policy in the rest of the world and apply them to our own backyard. </PARA>
<PARA>  The minority report recommendations seek the United Nations to convene a conference of all interested parties to negotiate a future for East Timor. We also seek greater involvement of the Australian Government in achieving this goal. This recommendation is supported by the East Timorese people, as evidenced from the letter from Xanana Gusmao. It is supported by the East Timorese groups throughout Australia. It is the basis of a strong campaign being mounted by the Australian Council for Overseas Aid called `A Time for Talks'. I call on the Australian Government and, in particular, our Foreign Minister, Senator Gareth Evans, to utilise his obvious skills of diplomacy, as demonstrated in the resolution of the Cambodian situation, in arriving at a just peace for the people of East Timor. </PARA>
<PARA>  As I said on 17 April, and I reaffirm today, my strong disagreement with Indonesia's actions in East Timor and the Australian Government's appeasement attitude in response in no way diminishes my support for improving the economic, trade, social, cultural and educational links between our two nations. As is clear with most other nations--particularly Japan, the United States, Canada, Britain and all of Europe--increasing relationships with Indonesia are not conditional on acceptance of Indonesia's takeover of East Timor. None of these nations accept Indonesia's hegemony. They have been able to develop a mature relationship with Indonesia without prostituting their foreign policy principles. It is a time for Australia to do the same. </PARA>
<PARA>  I commend both the full report of our delegation and the two minority recommendations to honourable members and the Government and urge their full consideration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-by leave--First and foremost, I would like to add my thanks to those people who led the delegation, the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris) and the Speaker. I make special mention of the right honourable member for New England in his position as deputy leader. With the experience that he showed on that trip, it was certainly a great privilege to be there with him and to be able to participate in some of the many meetings that we had there. The great reputation that he has developed overseas as well as in Australia was very much exemplified in that trip. I also thank the staff of the embassies in the various places we visited who looked after us so superbly. One would be very remiss if one did not mention John Dyer, the secretary to the delegation, who did an extraordinary job and was very much instrumental in putting this report together. I am grateful for his help during the trip.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  Being my first overseas trip, it was a great privilege to be chosen by the party room to go on this delegation in my first year as a parliamentarian. Therefore, to me it was very much a learning experience and a learning curve that one seldom gets the privilege of undertaking. I hope that I took full opportunity of that experience. </PARA>
<PARA>  Starting off in the chronological order of where we went, Hong Kong was the first city we visited. My first impression was that Hong Kong is undoubtedly a Chinese, or Asian, city. It is not an outpost of England. This was very clearly demonstrated, as was said in the report, by the fact that 98 per cent of the information was obtained through Chinese language newspapers. There seems to be extraordinary opportunities for Australia in the 1997 changeover. It seems to me that when this extraordinarily dynamic colony becomes part of China it will be a gateway and an opportunity for us in trade. I can only encourage many business people to take up this opportunity to see how it goes.</PARA>
<PARA>  One of the sadder notes was to see what I would call nothing more than the illegal immigrants from Vietnam. Australia should very much recognise that these people are queue jumpers and we should encourage their return to Vietnam to join the queue. If they have genuine refugee status, they will be accepted as such. Those who jump the queue in Hong Kong are no different from those who jump the queue in Australia. I would support Hong Kong in its return of these people back to their native land. </PARA>
<PARA>  During the visit I, along with the right honourable member for New England and the delegation secretary, was privileged to be a guest at a lunch with a division of the Ghurkhas. These people have a great history which is part and parcel of our history. It was interesting to look at what is being done. At that particular time we were advised that the Ghurkhas were in the Gulf doing all the satellite communications for the British Army. They are a group of people who have a great history that is connected with Australia. It seems to me that it would be very compassionate of Australia after 1997, when these people lose their home, to look very favourably on the immigration of Ghurkha soldiers and perhaps look very much at their British Army qualifications to see whether they can go onto the points which are required for immigrating to Australia. I recommend that the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) look at this suggestion to see whether we can look on very compassionate grounds at these excellent people with a great record of history who would certainly make wonderful Australians and wonderful immigrants to this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  After visiting Hong Kong we made a rather rushed visit to Singapore. One of the things that came home very quickly to me in both Hong Kong and Singapore is Australia's trade with both those nations. The first thing that was pointed out was that the quality of manufactured goods and foodstuffs that go from Australia to that part of the world is recognised as being excellent, second to none. It was great to hear that. We were also advised that the prices of our goods are in the ball park, that they are competitive. I was also delighted to hear that. </PARA>
<PARA>  The one thing that was repeated to us time and time again is that it is a joke to deal with Australia and to try to get goods delivered on time. Contract after contract has been jeopardised because of our inefficient waterfront and because of the inability of our manufacturers to deliver into Hong Kong and Singapore on time. We have to take urgent action with our trading partners to ensure that when we give a delivery time the goods get there on time, regardless of what we have to go through to do that, otherwise Australia will be in jeopardy of becoming irrelevant in those markets. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the stories that was told in Hong Kong was about the excellent underground rail system there. When it was being built the Governor gave the promise that it would be opened within 36 months, and he gave the date. On opening that railway line he apologised because he was 10 minutes late. How that differs from major projects in Australia, which seem to go over budget time and time again. I must say that for that particular underground railways project there was an Australian tenderer who told us that his tender was competitive but that the people calling for tenders felt he would not be able to complete the job on time because of delays in supplies coming out of Australia and therefore he was knocked out and was not among the last two or three tenderers. </PARA>
<PARA>  While in Singapore we had the opportunity to visit with Colonel Kerry Mellors the war cemetery at Kranji. I have to thank Colonel Mellors for this particular trip. He has taken on the role of local historian and was able to fill us in on many of the details of what happened during the war and the various actions that took place. It was a great privilege to go round with him and hear the stories. He also pointed out that next year is the fiftieth anniversary of the fall of Singapore. We were also taken to the factory, which was the old Ford factory, where the surrender was actually signed. The emotion that one felt when going into that factory, which is now a Japanese tyre factory, was quite overwhelming. The road and the old photographs were there. One could see photographs of the surrender flag being carried. It was a very emotional time. </PARA>
<PARA>  When we were at the war cemetery we had an opportunity to read the inscriptions on many of the gravestones and note the ages of the men and women who lost their lives during that conflict. They were so very young, and it was frightening that so many good people from Australia, England and other parts of the world lost their lives so tragically at such a young age. The next day we went down to HMAS Success, freshly back from the Gulf war, and there we met young men and women of the same age. It struck me what such a tragic waste war is, and I was grateful that we did not have any loss of life during that conflict. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe that by far the most important part of the trip was our visit to Indonesia. I am reminded of the old adage: if one comes from the land one does not have to get on with one's relations, but one does have to get on with one's neighbours. In a sense, that is very true at a national level. Indonesia is our closest neighbour and it is important that we have good material relations with it. It is important for us to understand that Indonesia is a young democracy, some 40 years old, and is fighting its way to establish itself through all the huge problems that it has within the nation, made up of some 1,200 islands and a great number of mixed and various cultures, all put in together and trying to make it work. It has not been easy for the Indonesians, and I believe that they are now coming of age and will present great opportunities for Australians to go in there in business partnerships with Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA>  It came through time and time again that they are very keen to have closer relations with Australia. I can only recommend that my colleagues, both within the House and outside it in business, take the opportunity of talking with the Indonesians to see what investment opportunities are there. A very interesting anecdote came from one of the Indonesian Ministers, when he said, `Thou shalt not kill thy customer'. In a sense that expresses what they want to do. They want to be a trading nation and they want to lift their standard of living. Although the Indonesian population is somewhere between 180 million and 200 million, we heard evidence that only 30 million are actually in the cash economy. So Indonesia has very much a rural and tribal society in many ways, and it has huge problems to overcome. </PARA>
<PARA>  As the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) said, we did not spend a great deal of time in East Timor and there was a heavy military presence there. As I have said before in this place, I believe that Australia's relationship with Indonesia and East Timor are right and proper. It was noted that, of the money that was spent on developing East Timor, 97 per cent came from Consolidated Revenue, other than that which was raised locally. So the Indonesians are putting assets and money and time and effort in there, and we got the feeling that the military presence would gradually drift. I must agree with the right honourable member for New England that, if we can have some sort of tourist link with East Timor, that military presence will get smaller and smaller. </PARA>
<PARA>  One thing that was quite striking to me when we were flying over East Timor in a helicopter was just how poor the country is. It is very poor country, hilly, shaly, suffering from a lack of rain, a lack of depth of soil, huge erosion problems and huge slips. It has very few what one would call natural advantages for those people to lift their standard of living. So I believe it is vital that they get continued support from other nations and I would encourage that. If Australia could put aid groups in there, it should do so because there is an urgent need for those sorts of things in order to try to lift the standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA>  When we flew over a mountain village the actual land degradation that we saw occurring was quite frightening, and I think there is a need for our expertise to help people resolve those problems in an Indonesian sense so that they can go on to a more sustainable yield of agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another thing I was delighted to see at the time was the signing of the East Timor Gap Treaty. I think this was a breakthrough in relationships between Australia and Indonesia, and it is most important that that sort of international cooperation keeps going. I hope and urge that there be some financial spin-off to East Timor. </PARA>
<PARA>  As time is of the essence in this debate, I will conclude my comments, but once again I thank my fellow parliamentarians and their wives who came on that trip for a most enjoyable experience, for the company that I had and for the very good dinner that we had last night as some sort of celebration. Despite the diverse points of view that we started off with, it was extremely pleasing to me to see that in general the delegation report was in the main agreed to, and I recommend it to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>  That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1991 gives effect to a number of measures most of which were announced in the 1991 Budget. In his Budget Speech the Treasurer recalled that in 1987 the Government introduced the family allowance supplement to provide a basis for targeting income support to families and that during 1991-92 the Government would be building on that work. The Treasurer announced that a major families package would be introduced to provide additional assistance to low and medium income families with children and target family allowance more effectively. This Bill provides for the first stage of that package. </PARA>
<PARA>  From 1 January 1992, the existing parental assets test of $347,500, indexed each 1 January, for family allowance supplement, FAS, will be replaced by a family assets test. The existing assets test for FAS is based on parental assets only. This can be avoided by rearranging assets among family members to ensure parental assets fall below the test threshold. As a result of the changes this possible avenue of avoidance will be closed. </PARA>
<PARA>  Family allowance is the only major social security payment not subject to an assets test. This Bill provides for the introduction from 1 January 1992 of a family assets test of $600,000 of net assets, excluding the family home. Currently, the parental assets test on FAS removes entitlement when the value of net assets, excluding the family home, exceeds $347,500. In the prevailing economic circumstances, especially the effects of the rural downturn, the Government is concerned about the welfare of children in families with assets above the test threshold but where those assets are returning very low incomes. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill proposes to introduce a special financial hardship test to operate for the next two years from 1 January 1992. This change will protect these families by allowing them to continue to receive FAS if the value of their net assets does not exceed $600,000. If the value of their net assets exceeds $600,000, they may continue to receive family allowance only. </PARA>
<PARA>  From 1 April 1992, the income threshold at which full rate FAS is payable, currently $18,000 a year, will be increased and aligned with the Austudy income threshold. This is currently $19,300. From January 1992 this will increase to $20,700 a year, indexed each January. This increase in the FAS income threshold will increase both the number of families eligible for FAS and the entitlements of families receiving less than the maximum rate of FAS. It will also achieve greater consistency between the Austudy and FAS income tests. </PARA>
<PARA>  Under current arrangements, all FAS recipients, irrespective of whether a full or part rate is payable, are entitled to a health care card. In order to bring entitlement to health care cards more into line with the income test arrangements for eligibility for health care cards for low income earners, from 1 January 1992 health care card entitlement will be limited to existing FAS recipients--full or part rate--and new recipients of full rate FAS. </PARA>
<PARA>  Provisions to give effect to the second stage of the package, namely, integration of family allowance, FAS and additional pension and benefit and the continuation of payment of family allowance until the end of a young person's secondary studies or to the end of the year in which the young person turns 18, whichever is the earlier, will be introduced in the autumn sittings next year. From 1 January 1992 a person's FAS will be recalculated where the person's income increases to 125 per cent of his or her base tax year income even though the increase was not related to a notifiable event. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill will also effect a number of minor changes, from 1 January 1992, in the area of families administration. Other measures contained in this Bill will also benefit families. First, on 1 January 1992 there will be an increase in the rate of child disability allowance by $2.15 a week, after the annual 1 January indexation has occurred, to help restore child disability allowance to the same value it had in real terms when introduced in 1987. The youth disability supplement will be increased by the same amount. Second, family payments will be back paid to the child's date of birth if a claim is lodged within 13 weeks of the date of birth where the child is born on or after 1 January 1992. At present back payments apply only if a claim is lodged within four weeks of the date of birth. </PARA>
<PARA>  Sole parent pensioners face substantial up-front costs when undertaking education. Although those undertaking vocational training have course fees, books and equipment paid for, no similar assistance is available to those undertaking general education. Accordingly, this Bill provides for a $200 up-front payment to be made each year to sole parent pensioners who are starting or continuing full time or part time education courses and who are eligible for the Austudy supplement. This will apply from 1 January 1992. </PARA>
<PARA>  There can be no doubt that young persons who have to live away from home or who leave secondary studies at an early age face considerable social and economic disadvantages. With this in mind, this Bill provides for initiatives directed at young persons under 18 years of age. </PARA>
<PARA>  The current Job Search allowance and sickness allowance provisions relating to young persons aged 16 to 17 years have helped to improve the circumstances of many young people. However, many face hardship because, although they have lived away from home for a substantial period, they are precluded from Job Search allowance or sickness allowance as they do not meet the employment requirement set down in this definition.  This Bill provides that, from 1 January 1992, for an `independent young person', 13 weeks registration with the CES will be accepted. At present the definition requires that the young person must actually have been employed. </PARA>
<PARA>  At present, a 16- to 17-year-old person in substitute care for whom no substitute care or similar allowance is being paid receives the basic rate of Job Search allowance or sickness allowance unless he or she qualifies for the independent rate under other criteria. From 1 January 1992, this Bill provides for social security arrangements to be brought into line with Austudy entitlements for 16- to 17-year-old persons in substitute care. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are currently unemployed and sick 15-year-olds who receive special benefit on the ground that they would, apart from age, qualify for Job Search allowance or sickness allowance respectively. These special beneficiaries are required to comply with all the usual Job Search allowance or sickness allowance qualification and payability conditions but are subject to more rigorous income testing, that is, dollar for dollar reduction in benefit for each dollar of income earned. Persons in this category are not eligible for transition to work incentives such as the employment entry payment and are not generally eligible, under Department of Employment, Education and Training guidelines, for the labour market assistance available for 16- and 17-year-old Job Search allowance recipients. This places 15-year-olds who are essentially in the same position as their 16- and 17-year-old Job Search allowance counterparts at a distinct disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Bill extends qualification for Job Search allowance to 15-year-olds who meet the requirements for Job Search allowance apart from age, who are above the minimum school leaving age or have a formal exemption from attending school, who have an employment history and who are not living with or being supported by a parent. (Quorum formed)</PARA>
<PARA>  Mr Deputy Speaker, there is a need to ensure that any anomalies in social security legislation or administration are removed. To that end, from the day of royal assent neither Job Search allowance nor Newstart allowance will be payable to persons receiving income that is paid by a community or group from funds provided under a Commonwealth funded employment program. If the person's partner is receiving such income, the person will not be entitled to an additional payment in respect of the partner. </PARA>
<PARA>  There can be no person in Australia today who is not aware of the special difficulties being faced by the rural community. Although many primary producers are `asset rich', they are often `income poor'. As a result, they may receive reduced social security payments or none at all as a result of the application of the assets test. This may be the case even though they have considerable liabilities. At present, the assets test works by compartmentalising debts so that they can be offset against only the particular asset which provides primary security for the debt and then only if the owner of the asset and the primary debtor are the same person. An example of the problems this causes is where the value of a person's farm is included in the person's assets thus precluding payments. Assume there is also farm machinery valued at $100,000 but it is subject to a bank lien of $150,000. Effectively the machinery has a negative value of $50,000. At present the liability of $50,000 cannot be offset against the value of the farm to allow the person to qualify for payments. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Bill modifies the assets test from 1 January 1992 to allow primary producers to deduct all liabilities which relate to carrying on of primary production from the value of all assets used in that production. The Bill will also ensure that, with effect from the day of royal assent, the value of a person's asset will be taken to be reduced by the value of a charge or encumbrance on the asset only if the person or the person's partner gets the direct benefit of a loan secured by the charge or encumbrance. This amendment will close a loophole highlighted by the recent Federal Court case of Clayton whereby mortgages taken out for the benefit of others were held to be allowable deductions. From the day of royal assent, the rules for assessing notional ordinary income within the hardship rules will be modified so that owners of residential premises that are occupied by family members in certain situations will not be penalised because the premises are not attracting commercial rates of rent. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Bill provides for the implementation of two initiatives relating to rent assistance. First, the rent assistance waiting period for recipients of Job Search allowance, Newstart allowance, sickness allowance or special benefit who have no children and who are aged between 18 and 60 years will be reduced from 26 weeks to 18 weeks. This will apply also for disability support pensioners aged between 18 and 20 years. This will start on 20 March 1992. Also, from 20 March 1992 eligibility for rent assistance will be extended to under-18-year-olds who receive the homeless/independent rate of Job Search allowance, sickness allowance, disability support pension or special benefit and who have been receiving social security income support for at least 18 weeks. A further initiative relating to rent assistance will be included in a Bill to be introduced later in the current sittings. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill also provides for the extension, from 1 July 1992, of bereavement payments to certain long term social security recipients and their partners. The bereavement provisions generally work by allowing the survivor of a pensioner couple to get paid more for a period of 14 weeks. In some cases a lump sum may be payable. However, at present the bereavement provisions do not extend to beneficiary couples. The Bill also extends from 12 to 14 weeks the period in which a person receiving a widowed person allowance will be entitled to a bereavement payment. This measure will apply from 26 March 1992. </PARA>
<PARA>  Mr Deputy Speaker, the aftermath of the recent deaths of people at Strathfield highlighted an unfortunate aspect of current social security legislation whereby child bereavement payments were not available to some families. My colleague the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) gave an undertaking to correct this deficiency at the first opportunity. This Bill gives effect to that commitment and provides that, on the death of a child, a parent may be eligible for payment for four weeks of family allowance, child disability allowance or double orphan pension as is applicable in the particular circumstances. This measure is to be taken to have commenced on 17 August 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill also makes some minor consequential amendments to various Acts mainly as a result of initiatives effected by this Bill and the introduction from 12 November 1991 of the disability reform package. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA>  That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill is to put arrangements in place for the provision of general purpose assistance to the States and the Northern Territory in 1991-92, consistent with the decisions taken at the Premiers Conference and Loan Council meeting on 31 May 1991. The Bill will replace the States Grants (General Purposes) Act 1990 and its provisions closely follow those of that Act. </PARA>
<PARA>  The current estimate of general purpose funding for the States and the Northern Territory under the Bill totals $13,734m or about 13 per cent of estimated Commonwealth Budget outlays in 1991-92. As such, these payments constitute a major element of the Commonwealth's Budget. In combination with the global borrowing limits agreed at the Loan Council meeting, they also have a major bearing on the spending and borrowing of State governments. </PARA>
<PARA>  In recent years there have been significant real reductions in payments to the States and in the size of their global borrowing limits. These reductions in payments and borrowings have been a key part of the Commonwealth strategy to ensure a continuing process of fiscal consolidation by encouraging restraint in expenditure at all levels of government but, at the same time, targeting that restraint so that the burden is shared equitably and sensibly. </PARA>
<PARA>  We acknowledge that in recent years the States have borne substantial real adjustments in the level of Commonwealth assistance. Against that background, and in response to requests from the States for greater certainty in funding levels for the purpose of planning their medium term budget strategies, the Commonwealth agreed at the 1990 Premiers Conference and Loan Council meeting to maintain the level of general revenue assistance in real terms for the three years 1991-92 to 1993-94. This commitment was subject to the qualification that Australia not suffer a major deterioration in its economic circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>  At the 1991 conference, the Commonwealth agreed to honour that undertaking, notwithstanding the sharp slowdown in economic activity and the consequent deterioration in its own budgetary position. In return, the States undertook to focus their adjustment efforts on restraint in current outlays and to consider increases in taxes and non-routine increases in tax charges only as very much a last resort. This undertaking has been honoured by the States in their 1991-92 budgets, and the Government is confident that excessive increases in State taxes and charges will not threaten to erode the substantial progress we have made in reducing inflationary pressures. </PARA>
<PARA>  Most of the assistance to be provided under this Bill is in the form of general revenue grants, which are currently estimated to be $13,382m in 1991-92. By far the larger part of this amount comprises financial assistance grants, but it also includes special revenue assistance to the Northern Territory and a separate new interim category of assistance, namely, identified road funding, which gives effect to the October 1990 Special Premiers Conference decision to untie local road funding. </PARA>
<PARA>  Consistent with the arrangements in previous years, financial assistance grants, special revenue assistance and identified road funding will all be adjusted for the difference between the actual increase in the consumer price index in the year to the March quarter 1992 and the forecast at the time of the Premiers Conference, so that the real level of assistance agreed at the conference is maintained. </PARA>
<PARA>  Financial assistance grants are to be distributed on the basis of the Grants Commission's updated per capita relativities based on the five-year review period included in the Commission's 1991 report. As in recent years, the relativities are applied to a combined pool of financial assistance grants and the base level of hospital funding grants. </PARA>
<PARA>  As noted earlier, the Northern Territory is to be provided with special revenue assistance in 1991-92. Similar special assistance has been provided to the Northern Territory in each year since its inclusion in the pool of general revenue assistance for the States. In line with the intention to progressively move the Northern Territory to a financial basis comparable with the States, the base level of this assistance has been reduced from $50m in 1990-91 to $40m in 1991-92. </PARA>
<PARA>  Turning to the identified road funding to be appropriated under this Bill, while the greater part of the funds for local roads that are now untied are paid to local government there remains a small amount of these funds which, under the agreed arrangements for 1991-92, are to be paid to State, rather than local, governments. This Bill will authorise those payments. The overall distribution of these funds between the States reflects the existing distributional principles pertaining to previous tied grant arrangements. The arrangements for payments to local government bodies in 1991-92 were incorporated in amendments to the Local Governments (Financial Assistance) Act passed by Parliament last June. This will make a modest, but nonetheless significant, contribution to enhancing State and local government budgetary flexibility. The final arrangements to apply beyond 1991-92 will be determined with an eye, inter alia, to the implications of other such changes in Commonwealth-State financial relations which might be agreed in the context of the current Special Premiers Conference review processes. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill also provides for the payment of $296.8m in interest free capital grants to the States and the Northern Territory. This is the same amount as provided in 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA>  No provision is made in this Bill for payments of general purpose assistance to the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). However, provisions in Appropriation Bill No. 2 allow for analogous payments to be made to the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA>  Mr Deputy Speaker, this Bill is an integral part of the Commonwealth's financial relations with the State governments and the Budget. I commend the Bill to the House and present the related explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA>  That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Financial Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 will simplify the statutory procedures for approval of new coin issues under the Currency Act 1965 and remove potential ambiguities in the wording of sections 13 and 14 of that Act. The Bill also effects two minor amendments to the Financial Corporations Act 1974, and repeals the Special Employment-related Programs Act 1982. </PARA>
<PARA>  The statutory procedures under the Currency Act 1965 for the approval of new coins, or variations to design or other characteristics of existing denominations, were drawn up at a time when the number of new numismatic or collector coins was very small. However, in recent years there has been a considerable increase in the number of such coins being issued under the programs of both the Royal Australian Mint and the Gold Corporation, a statutory authority of the Western Australian Government that produces precious metal coins. </PARA>
<PARA>  Under the present arrangements, considerable administrative effort is required before the necessary Executive Council approval is obtained for any variation to the currency regulations. Apart from the drafting and preparation of additional documentation, the procedures can involve time delays, particularly as Executive Council meets only periodically. Such delays can create difficulties for the marketing programs associated with the launch of new collector coins. </PARA>
<PARA>  The proposed amendments to sections 13 and 14 of the Currency Act contained in this Bill are designed primarily to provide the Treasurer with the authority to approve new coins or determine variations to designs or other characteristics of existing denominations</PARA>
<PARA>by means of a disallowable instrument, thereby dispensing with the need to refer such matters to the Executive Council. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is anticipated that this simplified procedure will offer administrative savings. In all other respects, the effect of the arrangement will be the same as the making of a regulation. In particular, there will be the same opportunity for parliamentary scrutiny as that which currently exists. </PARA>
<PARA>  The remaining amendments to sections 13 and 14 of the Currency Act are designed to remove possible ambiguities arising from the amendments to the Act made in 1987 to facilitate the production of the same coin denomination in different metallic compositions. </PARA>
<PARA>  The amendments to the Financial Corporations Act 1974 will permit the Treasurer to delegate to the Governor or Deputy Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia the responsibility for varying and publishing the list of non-bank financial institutions which fall under the Act. The amendments will also permit the Treasurer to publish the varied list in a manner or form he or she thinks appropriate.  These amendments are intended to simplify administrative processes but do not affect the substance of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Special Employment-related Programs Act 1982 was enacted by the former Fraser Government to appropriate moneys saved under wage pause arrangements for Commonwealth employees up to a total of $300m for the purposes of employment generating programs. The Act provided that subsidies were not to be payable in respect of employment after 30 June 1984. </PARA>
<PARA>  By agreement with the States, which administered the program, $200m was allocated for employment programs and the remaining $100m was provided for welfare housing. </PARA>
<PARA>  All activities under the Act are obviously complete and all moneys paid out have been satisfactorily accounted for. As the Act is now spent, the Government is taking the opportunity afforded by the Financial Legislation Amendment Bill to remove it from the statute books. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA>  That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to introduce this Bill, which will provide legislative authority for the entry into force of comprehensive double taxation agreements between Australia and India and Australia and Poland. The Bill will insert the texts of the agreements into the Income Tax (International Agreements) Act 1953 as schedules to that Act. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Polish and Indian agreements, which were signed on 7 May 1991 and 25 July 1991 respectively, deal with all substantial forms of income flowing between Australia and those countries. Details of each agreement were announced and copies made publicly available at the time of signature. </PARA>
<PARA>  Both agreements generally accord with other comprehensive taxation agreements concluded by Australia in recent years but the agreement with India differs from them in certain respects. Those differences reflect a balancing of Australia's interests with India's position as a major developing country and importer of technology. </PARA>
<PARA>  A notable feature of the agreement with India in that regard is the royalty provisions, which prescribe different source country tax rate limits for various categories of royalty payments and provide for fees for services to be treated as royalties in specified limited circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another feature of the agreement with India is that it provides for `tax sparing' credit relief to be extended by Australia for tax forgone by India under specified development incentives for the encouragement of foreign investment. </PARA>
<PARA>  Where income derived by an Australian resident taxpayer has benefited from one of the nominated development incentives, the agreement calls for a tax credit to be allowed by Australia for the Indian tax forgone. By this means, the development incentives will retain their attractions for Australian firms and allow them to compete for business in India on favourable terms. </PARA>
<PARA>  The agreement with India will enter into force when the Australian and Indian governments have exchanged diplomatic notes advising each other that the necessary constitutional processes to give the agreement the force of law in their respective countries have been completed. The enactment of this Bill will complete the processes required of Australia for those purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>  Conclusion of the agreement with Poland is indicative of Australia's support for that country's moves towards democratic structures and economic reforms. That agreement will enter into force on the date of exchange of instruments of ratification. This ratification process would also follow the enactment of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government believes the agreements will contribute positively to the strengthening of trade, investment, and wider relationships between Australia and India and Australia and Poland, but it is not possible to predict the eventual effect on the revenue. I present the explanatory memorandum and commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>  That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will amend the taxation laws in a number of respects. The Bill will give effect to the announcements in the March industry statement that the tax concession for research and development will be retained as a permanent feature and that provision be made for the deductibility of environmental impact study expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill will exempt from tax the pay and allowances of members of the Australian defence forces allotted for duty in Iraq and Kuwait in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. It also contains amendments to support the existing tax file number arrangements. Another amendment will give effect to the announcement of the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) on 13 June to provide relief for small business by deferring the initial payment of company tax in respect of the 1990-91 income year. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill will also give effect to the announcement on 2 August that living away from home allowances paid to offshore oil and gas rig workers will be treated as fringe benefits. Other announcements to be given effect by this Bill relate to foreign source income measures, gifts to funds administered by cultural organisations, deductibility of petroleum resource rent tax payments and Medicare levy exemptions. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Bill will also give effect to certain changes announced in the 1991-92 Budget. One Budget announcement is an amendment to include the winnings of certain investment related lotteries in the assessable income of the winner. Another will accord friendly societies and other registered organisations the same treatment for dividend imputation purposes as mutual life companies and government insurance offices. Other Budget announcements to be given effect by this Bill relate to general mining exploration and prospecting expenditure, the timing of franking credits, capital gains tax and protection levy payments by life insurance companies. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill introduces new procedures to be followed by taxpayers seeking review by the Federal Court or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of decisions of the Commissioner of Taxation. The Bill also simplifies the law by consolidating objection, review and appeal provisions that are common to various taxation laws administered by the Commissioner. The Bill will also amend the garnishee rules and PAYE provisions of the tax laws as well as propose several minor changes to the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987. Finally, the Bill contains a number of minor technical or consequential amendments of the tax laws. I turn now to a more detailed discussion of these measures. </PARA>
<PARA>Environmental Impact Study</PARA>
<PARA>Expenditure</PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill will allow a deduction for expenditure incurred on or after 12 March 1991 on environmental impact studies. The expenditure, other than for plant and articles, will be written off over the lesser of 10 years or the life of the project to which the studies relate. The cost of plant and articles will be depreciable. The proposed deduction was announced by the Government in the March 1991 industry statement. The cost of this measure is expected to rise to an estimated cost of $45m after 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA>  Exemption of pay and allowances</PARA>
<PARA>of members of Defence Forces</PARA>
<PARA>serving in Iraq and Kuwait</PARA>
<PARA>  As announced by the Minister for Defence, Science and Personnel on 14 August 1990, the pay and allowances earned by Defence Force personnel allotted for duty in Iraq and Kuwait in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait will be exempt from income tax. The amendment proposed by this Bill will extend the existing operational area for the exemption to include the countries of Iraq and Kuwait with effect from 23 February 1991. The amendment will also cease the exemption after 9 June 1991. The revenue cost was in the order of $8.75m in the 1990-91 income year. </PARA>
<PARA>Capital Gains Tax Cost Base</PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill will implement the change announced in the 1991-92 Budget to the capital gains tax provisions. Taxpayers will now be allowed to offset non-deductible costs such as interest, repairs, rates and taxes and insurance premiums against the taxable capital gain made on disposal of an asset. The change affects assets acquired on or after 21 August 1991 and is not expected to have a significant revenue cost. </PARA>
<PARA>Research and Development</PARA>
<PARA>  The tax concession for research and development at the rate of 125 per cent of expenditure incurred will be retained as a permanent feature of the Income Tax Assessment Act beyond 1995. The Government has decided to retain the concession in order to keep promoting research and development activities by industry in Australia. This Bill will give effect to the Government's decision which was announced in the March industry statement. The estimated cost is $180m per annum in the first year of impact, 1996-97, rising to $280m per annum by the year 2000-01. </PARA>
<PARA>Direct lodgment of taxation appeals</PARA>
<PARA>and applications for review</PARA>
<PARA>Under the present law a taxpayer who is dissatisfied with the decision of the Commissioner on an objection against an assessment or similar decision may request the Commissioner to refer the decision to the Federal Court or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This right of appeal or review is given to taxpayers by various taxation laws. Following an independent review of the processes for resolving taxation disputes, a recommendation was made to the Government that taxpayers should--like litigants in fields other than taxation--lodge their own appeals and applications for review direct with the Court or the Tribunal. The Government has accepted this recommendation. As a result, this Bill proposes amendments of provisions in various taxation laws to remove the requirement that appeals and applications for review be lodged through the Commissioner. These changes have also provided an opportunity to simplify the law by consolidating the common objection, review and appeal provisions of the different statutes in the Taxation Administration Act. </PARA>
<PARA>  The new provisions adopt more modern language and drafting approaches. Existing provisions of that Act which modify procedures in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for taxation matters have been rewritten to take account of the new method for seeking review. Their effect is unchanged except in two minor respects. One is that many documents formerly supplied by the Commissioner to the Tribunal as a matter of course will be supplied only if the Tribunal calls for them. This will save a lot of unnecessary time and expense. </PARA>
<PARA>  The other change relates to the review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of decisions of a training advisory body to issue a training advisory certificate under the training guarantee legislation. They are not decisions of the Commissioner and, in future, review by the Tribunal of such decisions will not be subject to the procedural modifications I have referred to. </PARA>
<PARA>  These amendments will apply to all taxation decisions made on or after a date to be fixed by proclamation. Transitional provisions will ensure that the amendments also apply to appeals or applications for review made after the commencement date even though the relevant assessment was made before that date. This means that appeals or applications for review in respect of any objection decision made after the proclaimed commencement date will need to be lodged direct with the Federal Court or the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA>Tax File Number</PARA>
<PARA>  This Bill will amend the income tax law to provide for the assessment and collection of a tax file number withholding tax where an investor has not quoted a tax file number for certain deferred interest investments. A separate Bill, the Income Tax (Deferred Interest Securities) (Tax File Number Withholding Tax) Bill 1991, will impose the tax file number withholding tax. The new arrangements, which will not impact on the revenue, will provide that, where a tax file number is not quoted by the investor for certain deferred interest investments, a tax file number withholding tax will be payable jointly and severally by the investor and the investment body. Investment bodies which pay the tax file number withholding tax for a deferred interest investment will be able to recover the amount paid from the investor. As a result of industry consultations, the Government has decided that the new rules will only apply to investments made on or after 1 February 1992. This will give investment bodies sufficient time to make any necessary changes to their existing practices to give effect to these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA>Investment-related Lottery Winnings</PARA>
<PARA>  The winnings of certain investment-related lotteries which are drawn or decided on or after the day on which this Bill receives royal assent will be treated as assessable income of the winner. The winnings will not be taxed by this amendment if either the prize won or the right to participate in the investment-related lottery is already liable to tax under existing rules. Prizes will be taxed only if the lottery is in the nature of a return on an investment. Prizes won in ordinary lotteries such as Lotto are not affected. The proposal was announced in the 1991-92 Budget. The amendment has no direct impact on revenue, but will prevent revenue losses by ensuring that otherwise taxable investment receipts such as interest cannot be replaced by non-taxable lottery winnings. </PARA>
<PARA>Registered Organisations</PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill will accord friendly societies and other registered organisations the same treatment for dividend imputation purposes as mutual life companies and government insurance offices. A company's tax liability gives rise to franking credits which can be used to frank dividends paid to shareholders. Registered organisations, such as mutual life assurance companies and government insurance offices, do not have shareholders and therefore cannot use the franking credits that accrue from the tax paid on their insurance and superannuation business. This Bill will give effect to the 1991-92 Budget announcement to deny registered organisations the right to maintain a franking account and to cancel any surplus of franking credits held by them at 3.00 p.m. on 20 August 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>  The measure will have no direct impact on the revenue. However, there are potential revenue savings, in that it will prevent new shareholders of any friendly society that issues share capital from having access to franking credits accumulated before capitalisation. </PARA>
<PARA>Timing of Franking Credits</PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill will give effect to the announcement in the 1991-92 Budget to change the basis on which companies receive franking credits under the dividend imputation arrangements. The effect of the measure will be that only the payment of company tax will give rise to a franking credit. </PARA>
<PARA>  The present law allows companies to pay franked dividends on the basis of imputation credits that are generated when a notice of assessment is served rather than when the assessment is paid. Shareholders are presently entitled to a franking rebate on the franked dividends received, even if the company tax liability that allowed the company to frank the dividends is never paid. </PARA>
<PARA>  The amendments proposed by this Bill will apply to  assessment and other notices increasing tax liability which issue after 20 August 1991. Appropriate transitional measures will cover cases where tax has been paid prior to issue of such notices. Changing the source of imputation credits from assessment to a payment basis will eliminate the scope for compounding the revenue losses that occur under the present law when companies fail to pay their tax liabilities. These revenue gains, however, cannot be quantified. </PARA>
<PARA>Deferral of Initial Payment of Company Tax</PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill will provide the legislation necessary to give effect to the Treasurer's announcement of 13 June to provide relief for small business by deferring the initial payment of company income tax in respect of the 1990-91 income year. The companies affected are those with a tax liability of $1,000 or more but less than $400,000 and which pay their tax in two instalments. The date for the initial payment of tax was deferred by seven weeks from the twenty-eighth day of the month following balance date to the fifteenth day of the third month following balance date. </PARA>
<PARA>  The amount of initial tax payment affects the amount of a company's franking deficit tax and franking credits and debits. The amendments, which will not affect the revenue, will ensure that those amounts will be determined as if there had been no deferral of the initial tax payment. </PARA>
<PARA>Foreign Source Income</PARA>
<PARA>  The Government has always been willing to finetune the foreign source income measures to ensure their smoother operation. To this end, three of the amendments proposed by this Bill will operate to relieve double taxation that could arise under the measures. In the first instance, further relief from double taxation will be provided in relation to an  Australian controlled foreign company that has changed its residence from a low tax country to either Australia or a listed--comparable tax--country. </PARA>
<PARA>  Secondly, corporate unit trusts, public trading trusts and superannuation trusts will be treated similarly to other resident taxpayers by being granted an exemption from Australian tax for distributions from a controlled foreign company out of income previously attributed to them. The third amendment will ensure that taxpayers are not disadvantaged by the operation of the rules for the conversion and carry-forward of foreign losses incurred before 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, the Government is determined to act against attempts to erode the integrity of the foreign source income measures. Therefore, one amendment will deny taxpayers a tax advantage they have sought to obtain through changing the residence of a controlled foreign company from a comparable tax country to a low tax country. These taxpayers will be denied foreign tax credits on dividends paid by the company out of pre-1990-91 profits accumulated in the comparable tax  country. </PARA>
<PARA>Fringe Benefits Tax--Living Away From Home Allowances</PARA>
<PARA>  On 2 August 1991 the Government announced that living-away-from-home allowances paid to offshore oil and gas rig workers will be treated as fringe benefits. When the fringe benefits tax law was introduced in 1986 it was the Government's intention that these allowances would be subject to fringe benefits tax. The Bill will amend the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act to achieve that result. The amendment will have a negligible effect on revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>Gifts to Gift Funds of Cultural Organisations</PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill will give effect to the announcement of 24 March 1991 introducing new arrangements for gifts to gift funds of cultural organisations. The amendment will take effect from 25 March 1991. Under the new arrangements tax deductible gifts may be made to gift funds listed on a register of cultural organisations. To be listed, a fund must be approved by the Treasurer and the Minister responsible for the arts. As a consequence of these new arrangements, the Bill will also remove the names of seven cultural organisations that are presently listed in the gift provisions of the income tax law.   Although the financial impact of the amendment cannot be quantified it is unlikely that the amendment will have a substantial impact on revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>Life Insurance Protection Levy</PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill will amend the income tax law to provide for the taxation treatment of various payments associated with the measure to assist policyholders of Occidental Life Insurance Company of Australia Ltd and Regal Life Insurance Ltd. For instance, protection levy payments will be tax deductible to life insurance companies. This proposal was announced in the 1991-92 Budget and the estimated cost of the amendments is $25m. </PARA>
<PARA>General Mining Exploration and Prospecting Expenditure</PARA>
<PARA>  The mineral exploration and prospecting provision in the income tax law will be amended by this Bill. The requirement that general mineral exploration and prospecting expenditure needs to be incurred on a mining tenement to be eligible for a deduction will not apply on or after 1 July 1991. The change, which was announced in the 1991-92 Budget, will ensure that deductibility for such expenditure is the same as that which is available to petroleum and quarrying exploration expenditure. There is expected to be a small but unquantifiable impact on revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>Medicare Levy</PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill gives effect to the announcement on 9 July of the Government's intention to remove an anomaly which has arisen in the Medicare levy exemption arrangements. The amendment will continue to guarantee that blind pensioners and sickness beneficiaries are exempt from paying the Medicare levy regardless of the level of their income. The amendment avoids an additional unintended cost to revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments Relating to Garnishee Notices</PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill will amend the garnishee rules in the tax laws so that, in relation to building society shares, only withdrawable shares--and not permanent or fixed shares--in the capital of a building society can be garnisheed from such a society. This will provide for similar treatment for shares in companies and building societies in relation to the garnishee rules. The amendment will apply to garnishee notices issued after the date of Royal Assent to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>PAYE Amendments</PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill will also amend the pay-as-you-earn provisions in the income tax law. The amendment will restructure and update the definitions contained in the provisions. The update will clarify the scope of the PAYE arrangements and remove existing references to arrangements between the Governor-General and the States. These references are no longer required. </PARA>
<PARA>  The amendments will also correct a technical inconsistency between the definition of `employer' and the penalty provisions in the PAYE arrangements. The amendments will not affect the revenue. </PARA>
<PARA>Occupational Superannuation Standards</PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill proposes that all payers of eligible termination payments be required to report such payments to the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner. This will remedy deficiencies in the current legislation whereby some payers are not required to report such payments because of inadequacies in the existing definition of payer. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill also provides that, where a superannuation fund fails to comply with a request by the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner to commute the excessive component of a pension, the Commissioner may exercise a discretion to treat the fund as though it were a complying fund. The legislation currently provides that a fund which does not commute an excessive component of a pension as requested by the Commissioner becomes a non-complying fund and loses its entitlement to concessional taxation treatment on its income. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill proposes that the existing deadline of 31 December 1991 for applications for pre-1 July 1988 funding credits be removed from the Act and that the date by which applications must be made be prescribed in the Occupational Superannuation Standards Regulations. </PARA>
<PARA>Petroleum Resource Rent Tax</PARA>
<PARA>  The Government foreshadowed when introducing the Petroleum Resource Rent Legislation Amendment Bill 1991 into this House on 9 May 1991 that a minor change in the treatment of Petroleum Resource Rent Tax payments would be made.</PARA>
<PARA>Under the existing law, PRRT is deductible for income tax purposes only after the final assessment has been made. Therefore, instalments of PRRT are not deductible until a later income year when an assessment of PRRT is made. </PARA>
<PARA>  This Bill will allow instalments of PRRT paid on or after 1 July 1991 to be deductible for income tax purposes in the year in which the instalment payments are made. The new provisions will be consistent with general income tax principles. This change will apply to all PRRT instalments paid on or after 1 July 1991. The estimated cost of the amendment will be $125m in 1991-92 and $205m in 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA>Provisional tax changes</PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill also contains amendments that relate to the measures enacted by this Government last year requiring the payment of provisional tax on certain salary or wages income. </PARA>
<PARA>  These amendments, which will have negligible effect on the revenue, are designed to prevent certain taxpayers from receiving an income tax deferral advantage. The law will also make it clear which amounts are to be taken into account when a taxpayer varies his or her provisional tax. </PARA>
<PARA>Minor and Consequential Amendments</PARA>
<PARA>  The Bill will make a number of minor technical amendments to the income tax law. Consequential amendments are also required to bring the income tax law into line with amendments to social security and veterans' entitlements legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>  A minor technical amendment will also be made to the Wool Tax (Administration) Act 1964. I present the explanatory memorandum, which contains more detailed explanations of the provisions of the Bill. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA>  That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1991 will amend the Medicare Levy Act 1986 to increase the income thresholds below which married couples and sole parents will not be called on to pay any levy.  For 1991-92, individuals with taxable incomes of up to $11,745 will not be required to pay the levy. This threshold is unchanged from the previous year. Married couples and sole parents with family incomes of up to $19,674 will not be required to pay the levy for the income year 1991-92. The income threshold for married couples and sole parents will continue to be increased by a further $2,100 for each dependent child or student. For example, a married couple with three dependent children will pay no levy until their combined taxable incomes exceed $25,974. </PARA>
<PARA>  The estimated cost of the increased low income threshold is nil in 1991-92 and $10m in 1992-93. The change in low income thresholds will not be reflected in provisional tax raised for 1991-92 as the amounts involved would be very small for individual taxpayers. It is not proposed to amend the tax instalment schedules to take account of the change until 1 July 1992. The number of people from whom the levy is deducted in PAYE instalments and who would be affected by the change would be relatively small. On the other hand changing the PAYE instalment schedules would involve an administrative cost to the Government and there would also be a substantial administrative cost to the business community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I want to address my remarks in this debate to the Budget provisions relating to the Department of Veterans' Affairs entitlements. I will link these provisions to the extension of repatriation medical entitlements to wartime merchant mariners. On 20 June I told the House about the role that our wartime merchant mariners had played in the defence of our country; about their contribution to the Allied effort around the globe; and about the difficulty in gaining accurate statistics on how many men lost their lives. Certainly, I referred to the paucity of information about the injuries suffered by the wartime merchant mariners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I want to quote a couple of paragraphs from the report of the McGirr inquiry which was set up by this Government. Paragraph 3.91 says:</PARA>
<PARA>It is difficult to ascertain the number of Australian merchant mariners who were injured, but not killed, as a result of enemy action. If the injury was sufficiently serious to disable a mariner or to bring it to the notice of the ship's master, it should have been recorded in the ship's log. Some records, such as ships' logs, were lost when ships were sunk. </PARA>
<PARA>The next paragraph goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Very few merchant ships had medical staff or facilities on board. Some of the larger cargo ships, in particular those that also carried passengers, carried a doctor or trained medical staff. However, in the majority of cases there are very few, if any, medical records available for Australian merchant mariners during the war. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the background to the paucity of information that is available on injuries suffered by our wartime merchant mariners. I have been unable to fathom the reasons for the historical reluctance to give proper recognition to the role that shipping has played in the development of our nation and to the role that Australian merchant mariners have played in the fight for liberty and independence in the defence of our nation. </PARA>
<PARA>  I am sure that in sectors of Australian industry and in sections of the Federal bureaucracy there has been a longstanding antipathy towards Australian mariners. I have no doubt that this has been a major factor in the failure of successive Australian governments to grant proper recognition to wartime merchant mariners and to grant the proper entitlements due to them. It has only been in recent years that a change in attitude has brought about some of that recognition. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have some ideas of the reasons for that antipathy but I do not want to go into them. Suffice it to say that I think it is time they were put aside and that our wartime merchant mariners were given the proper recognition that is due to them for the role that they played in fighting alongside our servicemen in uniform in times of need and in the defence of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA>  Next year is the fiftieth anniversary of the Coral Sea battle. Yesterday we saw the first meeting of the Australia-United States Coral Sea Commemorative Council. That council is to be chaired by Sir Eric Neal AC with Admiral Mike Hudson AC the deputy chairman. The Council has an important role to play in ensuring that all activities associated with the Coral Sea fiftieth commemoration are a spectacular success. I am especially pleased that the Federal Secretary of the Seamen's Union of Australia, Patrick Geraghty, is part of that committee. This means that merchant mariners will not be forgotten when those celebrations and activities in respect of the fiftieth anniversary of the Coral Sea battle are being organised next year. </PARA>
<PARA>  Our merchant mariners made a significant contribution to our wartime effort and certainly they made a contribution in the battle for the Coral Sea. In the Budget they were recognised as being equal with Australian veterans in respect of repatriation treatment benefits and they will be recognised during next year's commemorative activities. In fact, a number of memorials will be erected to recognise the efforts of our merchant mariners and they will be unveiled during the course of next year. </PARA>
<PARA>  Next year also will be the fiftieth anniversary of the sinking of the first Australian ships on the Australian coast during World War II--the Iron Knight and the Iron Chieftain, both BHP owned ships. A committee in the Hunter is working to build and unveil a regional memorial to wartime merchant mariners in recognition not only of the sinking of those vessels but also in recognition of the contribution generally made by merchant mariners during that war. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have mentioned the difficulty of getting information on the number of crew that were injured and I will come back to that in a moment. I want to refer to the activities in our own city of Newcastle and our own region of the Hunter. Organisations and people who are working with the committee to erect a memorial to wartime merchant mariners include: the Newcastle City Council; the Company of Master Mariners and their Federal master, Captain Allan Irons; Captain Les Packman, a former BHP captain; Bob Nelson of Mount Hutton; officers of council; Captain Geoff Fair; and me. So there is a cross-section of people associated with the industry in our region and with direct links with BHP and the industry. There is a very strong relationship with and recognition of the role of our wartime merchant mariners and of the role that shipping and shipbuilding have played in the Hunter. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Hunter is renowned as the great shipbuilding centre of Australia. The first steamship ever built in this country, the William the Fourth, was built in the Hunter by a family called Lowe. Shipbuilders were brought out from Scotland for that purpose. The vessel was built of local timbers on the shores of the Williams River just north of Newcastle at Raymond Terrace. We have constructed a full-scale operating replica of that first steamship built in Australia. Currently the William the Fourth is at Darling Harbour on exhibition. It will sail back to Newcastle in the next few weeks to participate in the major maritime festival we have organised in Newcastle at which we will be conducting a `walk-the-plankathon'. I invite all members of this House and all Ministers of this Government to contribute to that worthy cause by making a contribution to the Newcastle regional museum. </PARA>
<PARA>  I will accept the very honourable and welcome tax deductible donation from the Minister for Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons), who is at the table. Those donations will go to a very important cause--that is, a recognition of our maritime heritage and a recognition of the role that our merchant mariners have played and will play in the development of this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  In trying to identify how many people lost their lives in World War II, I again go back to the reference in the McGirr report to the seeking of further information. The inquiry contacted the Australian War Memorial. The War Memorial used a variety of sources to compile a list of names of Australian merchant mariners who lost their lives in wartime. Approximately 520 names are currently listed and I have referred to that in debates in this House before. I make the point that the project is an ongoing one and that names are still being added. </PARA>
<PARA>  I want to conclude by saying that wartime merchant mariners have brought their case to this Parliament year after year after year. Almost half a century after the event we are now extending to them medical entitlements similar to those available to our veterans. We want to see those entitlements extended now so that wartime merchant mariners are placed on an equal footing with veterans of our defence forces. They are entitled to that. But in saying that, we want to commend especially the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) for his determination and for his commitment. </PARA>
<PARA>  When I spoke in the House on 20 June, I put the case for wartime merchant mariners to him and to the House. He obviously responded to that and argued successfully in Cabinet for the extension of those medical entitlements to wartime merchant mariners. They have asked me to convey to him their very warm appreciation of his commitment, his effort and his success in convincing his Cabinet colleagues that this was a right decision to make. We look forward now to a further recognition of those wartime merchant mariners in terms of the extension of full entitlements on an equal footing with veterans of World War II. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> --I share the regard of the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) for the present Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys), whom I have always found to be interested in veterans affairs. I believe that he takes his portfolio very seriously. In the correspondence I have had with him on numerous occasions, I have found him to be very helpful. However, he is a member of the Government which, through its Budget, has missed many opportunities in respect of the appropriation and handling of funds for the Department of Veterans' Affairs. In the speech I made in this place last night relating to defence, I said that I seriously doubt the commitment of this Labor Government to the defence of this country, not only because of the Minister's May statement, but also because of what followed in the Budget. There are some very disappointing aspects of the Budget in respect of its treatment of veterans affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Government does not use the Budget to redress the inequalities faced by war widows as compared with their social security civilian widow counterparts. Once again, another Budget is passed without recognition in the form of the Vietnam medal for those who served on HMAS Sydney and other logistical support vessels. The Government did not take the opportunity in this Budget to reform the artificial limbs scheme. I could go on. There are other examples of what I see as plain insensitivity, or even ignorance in a sense, when it comes to veterans affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>  As you will recall, Mr Deputy Chairman, earlier this year we had the debacle over the introduction of an entry fee to the Australian War Memorial. I notice that in this Budget the Government has almost rubbed salt into the wounds that it created in its attempt to restrict access to the War Memorial through placing a charge on that access. The Budget cuts the funding for the War Memorial by some $80,000. I believe that is a disgrace. It must be a bitter pill to swallow not only for our ex-servicemen whose mates gave their lives in the active service of our country, but also for today's service personnel who must surely view this as a further denigration of the vital role that they are playing in our country's future. </PARA>
<PARA>  I could speak at length on the blows that our Defence Force has had to face in recent times. In dealing with the defence appropriation last night, I took the opportunity to do just that. I will not dwell on defence tonight; I want to talk particularly about veterans affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe that the Labor Government's treatment of veterans mirrors the low priority it places on defence. I ask: why has not one veterans organisation been given formal representation on the Australian War Memorial Council? If anyone deserves a seat on the Council table it is a representative of ex-service organisations, given the important role that they have traditionally played in remembering our war dead. I see this as yet another example of the Government's insensitivity. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another issue that is of concern--it is one that we have debated in this Parliament in recent times--is the absence of a war service home loan within the current defence housing scheme. Apparently, when the scheme was devised the Government did not anticipate that Australia would be engaged in a war again. That turned out to be rather naive and short-sighted because only shortly afterwards we were sending troops to serve in the Gulf war. When the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was farewelling the troops that we were sending to the Gulf--mainly Navy personnel who equipped themselves extremely well--he was doing that in the full knowledge that for the first time since World War I those particular service personnel would not be eligible for a war service loan on their return to Australia. Of course, there was an outcry about this. The Opposition was successful in having that problem addressed and redressed. The Government subsequently introduced amendments to the scheme which would mean that war service loans are reinstated for those who served in the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, the problem remains--we pointed this out in the debate when we dealt with the correction of that problem involving Gulf personnel--that there is still no provision beyond that for war service loans for those who serve in any future conflicts. That shows a real disregard for the interests of those who currently serve in the Defence Force. After all, at any time they may be required to serve this country in an overseas theatre of war. I think it shows that we are ill-prepared for the future. As I said in the debate last night, that underlines the Government's whole attitude to the defence of this country. </PARA>
<PARA>  Earlier the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) alluded to a number of the important events which will shortly be upon us as we approach a number of significant fiftieth anniversary celebrations. It is now 50 years since many of the important events of World War II that Australian troops were engaged in. In April last year we had the seventy-fifth anniversary of Gallipoli. Recently we had the commemoration of the Battle of Long Tan in South Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA>  Next year we are to commemorate the fall of Singapore, the bombing of Darwin, the Battle of the Java Sea and the Battle of the Coral Sea. It was that event which the honourable member for Shortland alluded to. Like him, I was pleased to note that in Sydney yesterday a Coral Sea commemorative council was formed, to be headed by Sir Eric Neal. It is to embark on the raising of $2m specifically for the purpose of commemorating the Battle of the Coral Sea next year. That particular event underlines for veterans the very important relationship which we have enjoyed over the years with our close friend and ally, the United States of America. </PARA>
<PARA>  We look forward later this year to a visit from the President of the United States. He is a World War II veteran. No doubt he will be the last American President to be a veteran of that war. I am looking forward--as, I am sure, are honourable members on both sides of this House--to welcoming President George Bush to Australia in December this year. I note, in particular, that he served with great distinction in the Second World War. We have other events to look forward to, including the Battle of Milne Bay and Kokoda. It is important for those who served in those events to commemorate them. It is extremely significant. It is even more significant in some respects for the relatives of those who served who did not live to look back. </PARA>
<PARA>  In October next year we will also see the dedication of the Australian Vietnam forces national memorial in Canberra--a particularly significant event for the three of us in this place who saw active service in South Vietnam. Yet Vietnam veterans, many of whom I am particularly close to, continue to suffer. Hardly a week goes by in this country where there is not a suicide of another Vietnam veteran who has been unable to cope with the memories of that particular conflict. Many of them were very young when they served. </PARA>
<PARA>  In looking back at many of these significant events, apparently very little money is available from the Government coffers to help subsidise reunions and commemorations of historic battles. I wrote to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs recently about this. In his reply he says:</PARA>
<PARA>  My assistance must be drawn from a small fund which I have at my discretion as almost the entirety of my portfolio's budget is required for the provision of pensions and health care. </PARA>
<PARA>It may well be that that is the case, but I think it is pretty poor that the Government is not able to allocate more than it has towards supporting the veterans in the commemoration of these particular events. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I wish to focus my comments on the health area and, in particular, the appropriations that come under the heading of AIDS control, which is found on page 3-83 of Budget Paper No. 1. In this paragraph details are given for grants provided for education and prevention, treatment and support services, the national media campaign and research activities. Expenditure for these areas during 1991-92 is estimated at $51.7m, which of course is not an insignificant amount.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In Budget Paper No.3, on page 199, under the heading `Health Promotion and Disease Prevention', an objective is clearly articulated which I believe proves most interesting reading. The objective reads:</PARA>
<PARA>To reduce the burden of preventable disease and disability amongst all Australians and improve the equitable access for all Australians to opportunities and prerequisites to good health. </PARA>
<PARA>To reduce the incidence, morbidity and mortality of communicable diseases in Australia, with particular emphasis on minimising transmission of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). </PARA>
<PARA>The objectives then go on to cover the assistance the Government will provide for sufferers. I admit that unfortunately our education programs continue to assume a maturity that is not present. They assume moral relativism and promiscuity and in doing so legitimise both. They give our young people false confidence. In fact, I believe these programs even betray them. </PARA>
<PARA>  Sadly, research conducted in South Australia by Dr Gavin Hart, and published in a recent edition of the Medical Journal of Australia, documents the failure of many to associate the HIV infection with other sexually transmitted diseases. Professor John Dwyer, Professor of Medicine at the University of New South Wales, said that Dr Hart's study `confirmed suspicions, generated concern and suggested direction for future HIV educational programs'. The study involved 2,249 men and 1,153 women and identified a number of key areas for concern. They were: firstly, many men and women, unconcerned about HIV infection, admitted to having multiple sexual partners and actually had a sexually transmitted disease; secondly, those who had previously had a negative test for HIV and who continued to engage in dangerous sexual activity saw no reason for further testing; thirdly, despite educational efforts, it was largely believed that only gays and IV drug users are at risk of infection of HIV. </PARA>
<PARA>  In discussing these findings with directors of socially transmitted disease services in Victoria and New South Wales, Professor Dwyer concluded that the South Australian results are typical, indeed representative, of national attitudes. </PARA>
<PARA>  I would like to quote Professor Dwyer from a recent paper he had published in the Medical Journal of Australia. His comments are most interesting. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>  The simple truth of course is that unless sexual behaviour is modified in a manner that sees a dramatic fall in the incidence of all socially transmitted diseases in our community, we must consider our anti-HIV educational programmes to have failed. Education which informs but does not alter behaviour is useless. </PARA>
<PARA>Professor Dwyer goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>  The World Health Organisation estimates that 10,000 new HIV infections occur daily and while most infected are in the third world, increasing numbers of infections in the heterosexual communities of western countries are being reported. This is particularly true for women who are more readily infected than are men. Any belief that we have beaten the AIDS epidemic in Australia will ensure that we have not. </PARA>
<PARA>Professor Dwyer then says:</PARA>
<PARA>  AIDS/HIV education programmes have lost their way in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>This evidence reinforces my belief that we need to tell young people that if they fool around, it is very likely that they will die a lonely and miserable death. They should be warned that through self-abuse of drugs or sexual irresponsibility, they break a trust with the community, forfeit certain rights and can expect certain sanctions. This should be the view put bluntly as adults to adults, heterosexual or homosexual, who in the AIDS context are acting like children. </PARA>
<PARA>  In October 1987 I put to this chamber a suggestion that the community, Parliament and the Government had not come to grips with the fundamental questions that the AIDS epidemic poses. I said then that we were ignoring to our peril five fundamental questions, and I believe quite strongly that we continue to ignore them. For that reason I ask those questions again in order of priority. Firstly, what is the role of government in nurturing or moulding community values and individual behaviour? Secondly, what is the obligation of government to prevent harm to innocent individuals caused by the behaviour of other individuals, if necessary, by restricting freedom of those other individuals? Thirdly, what is the nature and extent of individual accountability to the community for behaviour which creates significant financial burdens on the community? Fourthly, what balance is to be struck between individual privacy and liberty and community interest when dealing with an extreme epidemic of the type the AIDS epidemic represents? Finally, do our young people in schools have the maturity, conceptually and morally, that sex and AIDS education programs assume that they have?</PARA>
<PARA>  I said it then in 1987 and I say it again in 1991: I do not believe that our allocations will be effective until we have gone through the process of addressing these questions. The Government will continue to be directionless and constantly responding to various pressure groups if it does not consciously clarify its views on these five very important questions. </PARA>
<PARA>  What the AIDS epidemic has revealed, above all else, is what has been called AIDS in the moral and spiritual realm. In reflecting on the strategy we should adopt to address the spread of AIDS, we should focus on the success of an intellectual virus which has first invaded the various areas of this society's intellectual and moral defence system, and then rendered that system incapable of discerning those ideas and behaviour which produce fundamental social degeneration. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the main contributing factors in this gradual loss of the capacity to identify what is right and wrong has been the paralysis of this Parliament and governments of all political persuasions. We see evidence of the now familiar pattern in liberal democracies of powerful minority interest groups vetoing or intimidating policy makers. In this case the political power of homosexual groups and so-called progressive opinion makers in our community has prevented parliaments and governments from even speaking the truth about the centrality of promiscuity and homosexuality in spreading death. </PARA>
<PARA>  It has been the blurring of the truth, the watering down of what we say to our young people and ourselves about sexuality, about human relations, about love, about self-control, about human nature and about God, that has produced the obviously weak and self-indulging AIDS policies and laws that we have put in place. When we take the lead in speaking the truth about promiscuity, drug self-abuse and sodomy, and when we place ourselves under the authority of what is right, then we will be able to equip our children and young people to move from technical knowledge of their bodies to the wisdom and prudence which enables judgment. Then we will be fulfilling the high duty to the public good which so often goes unfulfilled. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> --In addressing the estimates for the Department of Veterans' Affairs, I point out to the Committee that in Australia today there are approximately 625,000 surviving veterans from the various wars, conflicts and campaigns involving our nation, including World War I, World War II, Korea, Malaya and Vietnam, and other overseas roles. Together with other ex-service personnel and all surviving war widows, the ex-service and related community numbers about one million people. Significantly, the average age of the biggest single group, that is, the World War II veterans, now exceeds 70 years. Many of these veterans are reaching a critical phase of their lives when various medical services are in heavy demand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  To give some indication of the magnitude of this nation's commitment to its veterans, the Department of Veterans' Affairs will expend over $5 billion in the coming year, employ about 13,000 staff and provide about 625,000 veterans with some form of benefit. About $2.9m has been provided in the 1991-92 Budget for the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme. Despite the size of those figures, it is regrettably true that throughout the eight years of this Labor Government there has been a progressive whittling away of veterans' entitlements. What this nation must never lose sight of is our commitment to the veterans, and to the disabled veteran in particular, for the debt owed by a grateful nation to those who fought for this country in time of war. </PARA>
<PARA>  In meeting that commitment the Government seems all too often to forget two fundamental features of that responsibility. Firstly, veterans' benefits and care must be based on the principle of compensation, not welfare. Secondly, the elderly generally, and especially the ageing veteran population, should not be subject to unnecessary or uncertain changes that are alarming and unsettling. Unfortunately, the Government has not always acted with this in mind. Consider, for example, its approach to the proposed transfer of repatriation general hospitals to the State health system; or the application of the assets test to veterans' service pensions from 1985 onwards and the resulting pension reductions or cancellations for over 13,000 veterans; or limitations imposed on the dental scheme; or totally and permanently incapacitated pension criteria being tightened, with the result that many veterans are no longer eligible for that special assistance; or the deferment of CPI-related increases to pensions; or the provision for the Government to claim from private health funds the cost of veterans hospital and medical treatment where a veteran has private insurance; or indeed a number of restrictions affecting access to the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>  The most recent changes to the repatriation pharmaceutical benefits scheme occurred in the 1991 Budget and could be described only as niggling in the extreme. The Government has announced that from 1 January 1992 personal treatment entitlement card holders, that is, the yellow card holders, and specific treatment entitlement card holders, the white card holders, will be required to pay a patient contribution charge of $2.60 per prescription. Veterans will be compensated by the payment of a fortnightly pharmaceutical allowance of $5.20, together with the provision of a safety net of $135 to protect the chronically ill. </PARA>
<PARA>  I appreciate that this allowance and safety net will operate in such a way that a veteran will be fully compensated over the year for all the patient contribution charges a patient must meet from his or her own pocket, but the key words are `over the year'. What this change means in practice is that a veteran whose need for medicines exceeds one script per week, and most of them are in this category, will be out of pocket by up to $135 and that he or she will be progressively repaid that amount over the year as the fortnightly allowance is received. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is true that under this scheme it will be possible for some veterans who need fewer than 52 scripts per year to come out in front. But a pharmaceutical benefits scheme for veterans should be all about helping those people with very heavy pharmaceutical needs, such as the TPIs. What on earth is this Government up to in insisting that veterans who do need more than 52 scripts per year must pay for their scripts up front and then wait up to 12 months before they are fully compensated? This Government has created the principle that the more severe the prescription needs of the veteran, the sooner he or she will be out of pocket to the tune of $135 and the longer he or she must wait for compensation. In other words, the person who in all likelihood is least able to cope with the inconvenience and stress of any additional financial drain will be the very person who has to find up to $135. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe that the majority of Australians recognise the need for a strong commitment to the veteran community, and to the disabled veteran in particular. I must say that this is one of the worst examples of unfeeling bureaucratic petty-mindedness that I can recall, and it should be withdrawn immediately. Veterans in particular do not deserve such mindlessness. They are entitled to the greatest understanding, recognition and support any government can afford, and I am confident that most Australians would agree with me when I say that it is shabby treatment in the extreme for this Government to be insisting that totally and permanently incapacitated veterans have to pay for their medicines up front, and from an already tightly stretched and barely adequate pension. </PARA>
<PARA>  Having said that about veterans, I turn to the health aspects of the Estimates debate to speak briefly about the Disability Services Act 1986, which was an historic and important step in the process of integrating Australians with disabilities into the general community. In particular the Act provided a framework for developing a range of support services in the areas of employment, rehabilitation and accommodation. It was supported by the Opposition and came into effect on 1 July 1987. Its provisions were to be implemented over a five-year period to June 1992. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government undertook to consult regularly over this transitional period with the providers of disability services, but I am receiving increasing evidence of widespread dissatisfaction with both the consultation process and the way in which the transitional period is being administered. I am also aware that the Opposition spokesman on community services is sufficiently alarmed about this process to have tabled a private member's Bill seeking amendments to a number of areas of concern and for an extension to the transitional period from 1992 to 1995. </PARA>
<PARA>  An area of particular concern to a number of constituents, and to me, is the manner in which the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) is administering changes to sheltered workshops. The Minister is insisting that people with disabilities must be integrated into the work force, regardless of whether they wish to or, more importantly, can be placed in open employment. Similarly, the Minister and his Department have apparently indicated to service managers that all existing workshops, regardless of the excellence of their existing standards, must reprofile if government funding is to continue after June 1992. The operative word is `indicated' because, four years into the transitional period and only eight months before it is to be completed, managements of sheltered workshops have had no official advice as to the guidelines they will have to meet to satisfy ongoing profiling and financial requirements. Is it any wonder that this uncertainty is desperately worrying the parents and carers of disabled people who are presently placed in a sheltered workshop. </PARA>
<PARA>  To further aggravate this unsatisfactory situation, the Government gave a commitment that no service will be closed during the transitional period, yet it is cutting back on funding to an extent that it is jeopardising the viability of many services and may well cause some to close before June 1992. Four years into the Disability Services Act the parents and carers of disabled people have a right to some certainty as to the future of sheltered workshops and the people who work in them. Instead, this uncertainty is inevitably causing growing alarm amongst a group of people who already carry an enormous load as carers for disabled people. </PARA>
<PARA>  If the Government is proposing to continue to support sheltered workshops, I suggest that full funding should be restored on the basis of existing minimum standards; that the new eligibility profiles should be decided upon in consultation with the industry; that special attention should be given to those people with disabilities of a nature that will make integration very difficult or even impossible; and that workshops be given at least three years in which to meet those new guidelines. However, if the Government's real intention is to close down existing workshops in favour of some form of open, commercially viable organisation, it must be prepared to accept responsibility for a decision that will cause the most distressing trauma for the many disabled who are simply unable to make that step. </PARA>
<PARA>  I should declare a special interest in this area. I have a disabled son. He is a person who is unable to meet the requirements of the disabled workshop under the present circumstances and yet, because of this present situation, he is unable to be trained to meet those requirements. He is one of those unfortunate people who fall between two criteria--too good for the nursing home situation but not good enough for the sheltered workshop. This is a very great area of concern for an enormous number of people, and the Government should address it as a matter of the greatest urgency. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-One of the many great achievements of the Hawke maladministration has been to send women back into the work force in unprecedented numbers to help offset the crippling effects of high interest rates on their families. High interest rates meant hikes in mortgage rates and repayments that demanded the return of mothers, often with babes in arms, back into the workplace. This has resulted in huge new pressures on child-care centres for extra places. The recession has now turned around that demand in pockets of urban and rural Victoria and elsewhere throughout the country. If the baby has not been thrown out with the bath water, in this case the Government has at least let out the bath water.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In areas of the greatest unemployment, particularly in the industrial heartlands of the northern, western and north-western suburbs of Melbourne, child-care centres today are struggling to survive because unemployed and underemployed people cannot afford these services. Two centres have closed and others are on shaky ground. In order to survive, the centres have had to top up their operations with the children of non-working parents who need respite from the rigours of coping with children. Now their continued viability is in doubt and general access to child-care places has been reduced by the changes in government funding sneaked in with this Budget. While putting up new centres, the Government is, with its usual sleight of hand, reducing the affordability of the existing places. The message of the Government to the centres whose budgets are severely out of whack because of this Government-led recession is that they must wear it. This means that these centres have to put up fees and more parents are unable to afford to use them, thus creating a vicious cycle. </PARA>
<PARA>  To this situation the Government has added a new two-tiered apartheid system of fee subsidies for all child-care services. Until now, access to fee relief was based solely on inability to pay, which was fair as far as it went. But from 1 January next year people are to be discriminated against in terms of fee relief on the basis of their reasons for wanting child-care--echoes of the old socialist credo: `The end justifies the means'. This means that those who use the centres for certified work-related activities get the top level of relief, but those who are not working, are not registered with the CES, are not on a disability pension or do not have a child on a disability pension will receive only the lower level of fee relief. This discriminates against parents who are at home and need occasional respite from children, against parents who are enrolled in what are deemed non-vocational courses, against parents who have ceased to look for work because none is available, and against parents who have children with developmental problems. </PARA>
<PARA>  The new apartheid of assistance takes into account none of the permutations of real life; everything is either black or white. The difference in the two tiers is about $8 a day, or $40 a week--a not inconsiderable amount for people already suffering the worst depression since the 1930s. Typically, these changes are testimony to the Labor Party's ongoing love affair with shuffling papers. The corollary of this new apartheid system is the expansion of the Department of Social Security administrative apparatus to assess whether a child is at risk--a field in which it has absolutely no expertise. This will demand that people then label themselves in order to receive the benefits--benefits that the experts say are unlikely to occur anyway. </PARA>
<PARA>  Then there is the matter of assessing whether people--almost invariably women, who are the major caretakers of children--are doing courses likely to lead to work. The nexus between work and the preparation for it is not as straightforward as this policy suggests. In fact, women do courses--in their neighbourhood houses or wherever else--to get back their confidence to go to or even apply for work. Yet these niggardly prescriptions which have been introduced in this Budget will preclude many of these women from the so-called non-vocational courses. At the level of the child-care centres themselves, the chairperson of community child-care in Victoria suggests that the increasing administrative demands of the ever-burgeoning bureaucracy which this Government is imposing will increase the charges on the hapless parents to whom they are passed on because of this policy. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Government's Alice in Wonderland version of social equity is to be found in its slashing of support for out of school programs, which care for children either before or after school on a permanent or temporary basis. This service, which is run from neighbourhood houses, schools, churches and the YWCA, is the fastest growing area of all child-care. There are some 22,000 places in out of school programs in Victoria and 80,600 throughout Australia. Any one place may be taken up by as many as three children during the course of a week. The total number of child-care places in Australia is some 255,000. So the out of school care sector makes up about one-third of the total of child-care places and it is the fastest increasing area in which these services are provided. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Budget made noises about bringing the service into line with other child-care services, which gave the unwary out of school coordinators a warm, fuzzy feeling of good about this Government. To their horror, in the last couple of weeks it has transpired that the details of this plan, which were written in invisible ink in the Budget Papers, meant a cut of 50 per cent in the operational subsidy provided by the Government. The operational subsidy for these services has been slashed from $9,828 to $5,292 for each school program from 1 January next year. In hourly terms this is a reduction from 54c to 28c an hour. The other child-care services receive less funding because their longer hours bring in fees of commensurate size. </PARA>
<PARA>  To add insult to injury, those using the out of school program can receive only the second tier of funding relief, a logical inconsistency and nonsense in itself because these are parents who are going to work and, therefore, using the child-care places. We are talking about a difference in fee relief of $2 on the top tier and about $1.15 on the second tier subsidy. The Government's excuse that these programs do not cost as much is a chimera because the costs are hidden in subsidies by local schools and by local government. </PARA>
<PARA>  Increased administration necessitates one of the two out of school program workers actually having to use some of his or her valuable time on the administration of the program. As usual, the Government cannot see the wood for the forms to be filled in. While the Government can say that it has increased fee relief and that now people on combined incomes of up to $46,000 get some relief, the reality is that this is only a drop in the ocean of higher costs and higher fees. By reducing the affordability of out of school care we are now creating a new generation of latchkey children. Is this social justice?</PARA>
<PARA>  The provision of affordable child-care is essential if we are to facilitate people getting back to work, but what we have now is the worst of two possible worlds. As more and more people are unable to use child-care services, or to use them as often, fees escalate to cover the cost of the child-care services and the difference between operating costs and the government subsidy increases. </PARA>
<PARA>  A gap fee--which, on average, is from $25 to $30, but can be up to $45--is charged on top of the fees which are subsidised for the parents and on top of what is based on the parents' income. The gap fee goes to the heart of the affordability problem and, because it is non-variable, has a greater impact on lower income families. Anyone whose income is $22,000 can now get full fee relief. But from 1 January next year they will pay an additional $30 on their assessed fee, on top of an ever-increasing gap fee, if they do not fall into the tier one category. Yet this Government is throwing money at new child-care Taj Mahals while the sound of childish chatter and the patter of little feet grows ever dimmer in the existing centres which are being deserted by economically stressed parents. In the meantime, Labor's Tweedledum and Tweedledee go on fighting over the leadership rattle. The Government has surely thrown the baby out with the bath water. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In speaking to the estimates of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, I wish to address my comments to an area of expenditure relating to a major foreign affairs issue facing Australia at this time. In the space of 10 minutes, it is very difficult to address all of the complexities and difficulties that arise in the area of foreign affairs and all of the issues that one would like to refer to. Having spoken this morning about the problems arising from the disintegration of the Soviet Union, this evening I wish to comment on the issues now facing us in Yugoslavia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The international community has faced many such challenges in recent times. There is a growing desire for self-determination by many individuals in states that have previously been trapped within the boundaries of imperial structures. Within these newly independent states are several ethnic minorities, each of which is anxious to regain and assert its cultural and religious heritage. We are grappling with these problems with the present disintegration of Yugoslavia. The tragic civil war that we are now seeing is a result of a failure of the newly emerging independent components to negotiate the terms of new political and economic arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>  This issue is of great concern to many people in this country. The census records that in 1986 there were 150,000 Yugoslavian born people in Australia. Of this number, 82,546 record Yugoslavian ancestry; 27,265 Croatian ancestry; 5,936 Serbian ancestry; 3,605 Slovenian ancestry; and about 20,800 Macedonian ancestry. All of these groups have some real concerns about the events that are unfolding in the Balkans at this time. </PARA>
<PARA>  Undoubtedly, some families have experienced the tragic loss of a loved one and many more are still anxious for the safety of family members and friends caught in the conflict. Families are turning in desperation to the Government for some hope and constructive support which will lead to a swift conclusion of this terrible situation. </PARA>
<PARA>  However, what the Government has offered is very short of even simple consolation. On the other hand, the Opposition has been constructively participating in and leading debate and it is pushing the Government to take some initiatives. It has urged the Government to protest in the strongest possible terms to the Yugoslavian Government. And, of course, the Opposition has called for intervention internationally, including the involvement of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA>  Honourable members will recall that the current crisis followed on the heels of events which had given us some real cause for optimism. A week or so before the Yugoslavian army launched a military attack in Slovenia, Presidents of the six republics reached an agreement in principle which would allow for a loose confederation to provide for a common army, foreign policy and economy. At the same time, each republic would have its own army, diplomatic missions and United Nations membership. My colleague Senator Hill expressed the hopes of many of us when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Agreement to consider this plan as a basis for negotiation shows that a solution to the problem of reforming Yugoslavia can be achieved peacefully. </PARA>
<PARA>On 26 June, representatives of both Croatia and Slovenia declared independence from Yugoslavia after a plebiscite expressed an overwhelming majority vote for independence. These declarations were seen as an important step in the process of resolving constitutional problems which were facing the region. However, as I noted in the House earlier today when speaking on the motion in relation to the Soviet Union, the democratic impulse can be so easily undermined and our optimism short-lived if we do not face squarely the realities of these very volatile times. </PARA>
<PARA>  On 28 June--the day of the Yugoslav invasion--the Opposition condemned the use of military force and called for immediate dialogue between the parties. In August, as acting Foreign Affairs spokesmen for the Opposition, I urged the Australian Government to support the mission by three European Community foreign Ministers to try to negotiate a cease-fire. On 6 August, I condemned the Government's inactivity and urged it to back a role for the United Nations in mediating a, by then, escalating conflict. </PARA>
<PARA>  On 16 August, Senator Hill had returned and urged the Australian Government to recall its Ambassador to Yugoslavia for talks. He moved in the Senate a motion deploring the violence which had taken place in Slovenia and Croatia and called on the Government, again, to support international efforts for a negotiated settlement. The Australian Government offered some pious platitudes but had taken no real initiatives to support the peaceful transition to the establish the of new independent states. </PARA>
<PARA>  Unbelievably, the Government opposed this motion of Senator Hill's in the other place after changing its mind several times. This clearly demonstrated the indifference to the deep concern expressed in Australia by those of Balkan origin. The motion was finally passed with the support of Australian Democrats and Senator Harradine. </PARA>
<PARA>  On 26 August, Senator Hill again called on the Government to seek action in the international community to negotiate a withdrawal of the Yugoslav federal army from Croatia and to urge the United Nations Security Council to step in to avert this disaster. The Opposition also urged the Government to press for the International Red Cross to be permitted to help refugees from its headquarters in Geneva, rather than in Belgrade. Clearly, it is unlikely that the Croatian refugees or asylum seekers would be able to travel with impunity to Belgrade to ask for asylum. </PARA>
<PARA>  We also called for the Australian Government to give relief via the International Committee of the Red Cross. A week later, the Government acceded and announced $100,000 in relief. A further $100,000 has been announced in the last day or so. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) urged the Government to provide humanitarian support directly in the form of urgently needed medical requirements and the provision on consular support in Zagreb so that people of Croatian origin seeking visas would no longer need to apply through Belgrade. We urged the Government to support the European Community proposal for a peace conference. The inactivity and indifference of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) on this issue forced the Opposition to approach the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to actively support the European Community's proposals. </PARA>
<PARA>  When the first cease-fire was breached late in August, the Opposition again approached the Government to end its inactivity on the crisis and lodge an immediate protest with Belgrade. Still no action was taken. Even the Opposition's suggestion to back UN involvement and the Prime Minister's indication on a national television program that he would pursue the matter was not followed by positive government action. </PARA>
<PARA>  While the Government has remained quiet, the crisis has deepened and there has been a tragic escalation with the loss of life and an increased possibility that the conflict could spread beyond Yugoslavia. My colleague, the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), moved in the House a motion on my behalf two or three weeks ago deploring the violence, loss of life and destruction of property in Slovenia and Croatia. In the last few days we have seen the very tragic loss of some of the most historic and important national estate properties on the Adriatic coast. The honourable member noted the potential for further conflict if the aspiration for self-determination was confronted by military force. </PARA>
<PARA>  We welcomed the efforts of the European Community to act as a mediator and again called upon the Government to support international efforts for a negotiated solution which might achieve independence for the Slovenian and Croatian people. We demanded protection of ethnic and religious minorities within all of the republics of Yugoslavia. This is a matter of very considerable concern. We repeated our call for the Australian Government to recall its Ambassador. However, this and statements by the Chairman of the Yugoslav Presidency, Mr Mesic, which indicated that the Yugoslav forces were not under constitutional control, still failed to elicit a positive response from the Government. The Prime Minister's response to the clear and immediate concerns of the Opposition was that the Australian Ambassador to the UN was keeping abreast of developments. </PARA>
<PARA>  Throughout this entire crisis, the Opposition has been actively and constructively involved in trying to find an appropriate solution to the complex and difficult problems in Yugoslavia. As late as Tuesday, we again had to push the Government to consider taking action in the United Nations to seek sanctions and an oil embargo on Yugoslavia. Even in relation to that matter, Senator Evans has, to date, refused to commit the Government to this action. As Senator Hill has said:</PARA>
<PARA>At a time when all vestiges of constitutional authority have broken down and the Croatian capital of Zagreb is being pounded by Yugoslav forces, it is simply not good enough to say that Australia is still thinking about action in the UN. </PARA>
<PARA>For the sake of those suffering from the appalling violence being perpetrated in Croatia, Australia should move now. </PARA>
<PARA>  I wholeheartedly support those sentiments and I imagine that all honourable members, as they are conscious of the meetings and discussions that will be taking place throughout Australia, appreciate the concern of those who live within this country who are aware of the difficulties and who want to seek the good offices of Australia in trying to mediate successfully to ensure a peaceful and sensible outcome to this very difficult situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I am pleased to speak in the committee stage of this debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) dealing with appropriations for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I sometimes wonder, when we are talking about foreign affairs, about our diplomatic missions abroad. I note in recent days that there has been some discussion about some of our missions and talk of the closure of some. I wonder whether it is always necessary to have such large missions and so many Australian based staff in some of our missions instead of perhaps missions of two and three people. I am particularly concerned that we no longer have a mission in Ethiopia. I believe it is very important that we reopen our mission in Addis Ababa. In fact, I thought it was a tragedy that that was closed, and I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) to look carefully again at the reopening of the mission in Addis Ababa.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The past 12 months have seen dramatic changes in the international community. Events in eastern Europe have changed the political map. Indeed, who could have imagined the changed situation that we see today in the Soviet Union or indeed, as the previous speaker mentioned, the tragedy that is Yugoslavia today. </PARA>
<PARA>  Equally dramatic but perhaps more inevitable have been the changes in South Africa. No longer do black and white live as total strangers in the same land; but they are still strangers. I fully support the approach that Australia is taking in regard to South Africa. We should not rush to lift economic sanctions, but I believe it is appropriate for a relaxation of the bans on person to person contact. Sanctions have had an impact. Those who for years opposed sanctions and were apologists for the apartheid regime in South Africa should ask themselves this question: without sanctions would the majority of South Africans have ever had the opportunity, as now promised if as yet undelivered, of being fully participating members in the country of their birth?</PARA>
<PARA>  Those who were among the last to impose sanctions were among the first to lift them. This must raise the question of how genuine was their commitment to the process. One does not have to be unduly cynical to suspect that many governments have been more interested in dollars than in the well-being of the black South African population. </PARA>
<PARA>  South Africa will need help in the years ahead. The need to rebuild the economy is shown by the fact that over the next 30 years the population of South Africa will double. By the year 2020 the population will reach 80 million. This will cause tremendous challenges and a huge expenditure on health, housing, welfare and education. Of all the education programs, perhaps family planning is the most important. </PARA>
<PARA>  The next few years will be a testing time for South Africa, but one suspects that it will be many years before the black majority really enjoy the benefits of what could be one of the most prosperous nations on earth for all its inhabitants. </PARA>
<PARA>  On the other hand, South Africa has the opportunity to show the world that a truly multicultural, multiracial, democratic society can exist and prosper. The knowledge of many Solomons will be needed to work out which way South Africa will go. The task ahead of South Africa is awesome. The legacy of apartheid, in social and economic as well as political terms, is appalling. Those contemplating the future of South Africa through the current period of change and beyond might be forgiven a degree of pessimism. Yet the very enormity of those difficulties has forced South Africans of all races to contemplate fundamental adjustments to entrenched positions on political and economic issues. There is justification for optimism in this evidence of flexibility. We must look forward keenly to the time when that flexibility provides justification for the removal of sanctions and the integration of a multiracial South Africa into the international community. </PARA>
<PARA>  Another area of concern to Australia is Papua New Guinea. Australia has a significant role to play with the people of that country, not in a neocolonial way but in a helping way, respecting the sovereign independence of Papua New Guinea. We make a significant contribution through aid to Papua New Guinea. Questions have been raised about our aid. Many suggest that the greater proportion should be tied aid--aid for projects rather than as now happens with untied or Budget supported aid. </PARA>
<PARA>  One of the great challenges for Papua New Guinea is education. Through our aid, Australia can be of great assistance. Papua New Guinea is still retarded in implementing many of its plans for development by its lack of trained people. Another area of concern is law and order. Perhaps more of our aid could be directed towards training and equipping the Papua New Guinea police. </PARA>
<PARA>  Despite its many problems, everyone should be heartened by the obvious strength of Papua New Guinea's democracy as shown in the recent constitutional crisis. It must be stated that democracy has remained strong since independence. Changes to government have always been made in a constitutional way. In the area of international relationships, I would like to see more emphasis on our relationship with India. Many people, including me, have felt that the relationship between Australia and India has not developed as dynamically and robustly as it could have. Perhaps we have taken each other for granted too much. I believe that we must work harder for a better relationship between India and Australia. We mean more to each other than competitors on the cricket field. More attention to this important relationship will bring political and economic rewards to both countries. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australia has been a world leader in protecting Antarctica. Last week in Spain Australia and 38 other nations signed an agreement that will guarantee protection of, and ban mining and oil exploration on, the Antarctic continent for 50 years. I applaud Australia's efforts in protecting Antarctica for future generations. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australia has just taken its most significant and effective step for 16 years to promote human rights in Australia, in our region and in the world. On 30 September 1975 Australia ratified the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination, which was opened for signature on 21 December 1965 and entered into force on 2 January 1969. The Racial Discrimination Act of 1975 had given approval for ratification and made the provisions of the convention part of the law of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>  On 25 September 1991 Australia acceded to the first optional protocol to the 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Those within Australia aggrieved by a breach of human rights are now entitled to communicate with the Human Rights Committee which was established 15 years ago. As one who has spoken on this matter many times and who has put many questions on the Notice Paper since 1985, I applaud this highly significant step by the Hawke Labor Government. I also believe that there should be no further delay in Australia's making a declaration under article 14 of the racial discrimination convention, recognising the competence of the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination to receive communications against a state party by individuals or groups of individuals within its jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA>  History shows that the Aborigines sorely need an international forum in which to address their grievances, for which they have exhausted all domestic remedies. </PARA>
<PARA>  I also welcome the latest increase in the Budget of the contribution to overseas aid. I am appalled by comments made by both the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) that overseas aid would be cut if they came to government. But I suppose we can console ourselves that it is most unlikely that they will come to government. Nevertheless, they have made this commitment that one of the first areas that would be cut under a conservative government in Australia would be overseas aid. </PARA>
<PARA>  Australia cannot isolate itself from the rest of the world. Not only do we have a duty to assist people who do not always enjoy a similar degree of wealth or standard of living to ours; in the long term it makes good economic sense to assist those people. I am just appalled that the Opposition would target overseas aid as one of the areas it would cut in the unlikely event that it came to government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> --The ministerial statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) in the Senate on 6 December 1989 referred to the rapid and fundamental changes then taking place in central Europe and the USSR and offered a timely consideration of their impact on Australia's national interests. In view of the quite incredible rate and nature of those changes and their implications for Australia's sphere of interest, I think it is an appropriate time to review that statement and to assess the Government's success or otherwise in meeting Australia's foreign policy objectives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I have little disagreement with much of the statement's conclusions as to the strategic importance to Australia of South East Asia and the South Pacific and of the uncertainties created by the passing of the bipolar Cold War era. Senator Evans responds to that challenge by identifying seven objectives which constitute what he calls Australia's multidimensional approach to regional security. </PARA>
<PARA>  The first and second of those objectives relate to military capacity and application; the third to the use of traditional diplomacy; the fourth to trade and investment; the fifth to foreign aid; the sixth to so-called neighbourly assistance; and the seventh to what I would describe as a call to close the cultural distance and, in the words of the Foreign Minister, `to overcome the significant image problem we still tend to have in South East Asia and the South Pacific'. </PARA>
<PARA>  My concern with Senator Evans's multidimensional approach is fourfold. First, he acknowledges the importance of traditional diplomatic skills and says that his statement `carries some important implications for departmental resources'. Those implications are not discussed in the document; nor are they mentioned in the Department's annual report for 1989-90, which talks only of a new corporate plan and evaluation procedures. However, from a departmental discussion paper released earlier this year and from recent press reports of the closure and pending closure of several missions and of a commitment to new missions in Cambodia, Europe and the Middle East, we must assume that these are the implications referred to in the Minister's 1989 statement. </PARA>
<PARA>  The reality is that it has taken almost two years to see any evidence of a tangible response to the new international circumstances. I must say that this falls disappointingly short of the urgency warranted by events in central Europe, by their implications for the Australasian region, and by the importance given to them by the Minister in December 1989.  Furthermore, from the 2.2 per cent increase in the Department's division 315 funding for 1991-92, which in fact is a drop in real terms, it is clear that the Department is being asked to respond to the most important diplomatic challenges for the past 50 years with fewer resources. From the little we know of the redirection of resources taking place within the Department, I must admit also to some doubts as to whether this is a sufficient response to the new world order, whatever that really means, and its implications for our region. </PARA>
<PARA>  My second concern is that Senator Evans's statement fails to identify properly one of the most significant elements needed for the successful achievement of our foreign policy objectives. Third, the seven multidimensional objectives are offered without any discussion as to their relative importance or priority. My fourth concern centres around the conclusion that must be drawn from an analysis of Australia's foreign policy track record in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA>  Returning to that second concern, it seems to me that a particularly important objective of foreign affairs must be the achievement and maintenance of highly developed relations with and expertise in the affairs of our South East Asian and South Pacific neighbours. The key words I stress are `highly developed' and `expertise'. That objective is not acknowledged by Senator Evans, yet it seems unarguable to me that if we have soundly and sensitively developed relations with our neighbours then other objectives such as military cooperation, the diplomatic management of tensions and misunderstandings, trade, investment and aid considerations and cultural ties all become more amenable to mutually beneficial solutions. </PARA>
<PARA>  This can be extended into the third area of my concern, that is, Senator Evans's failure to consider priorities. I suggested in what I have just said that the establishment of highly developed relations is a matter of the highest priority. Senator Evans gives this only an oblique mention in his multidimensional objectives, at points 3 and 7. In point 3 he talks about the use of traditional diplomatic skills. He clearly considers this to be a tool to be applied in the limited and negative role of managing tensions and frictions. In fact, I see it in the reverse role. I see it as a positive role, a role which allows us to develop to a very high order an expertise in and understanding of the nations of our region and to use those skills in building relations that directly and positively contribute to our national interest. </PARA>
<PARA>  Senator Evans also vaguely touches on this same subject in his point 7 when he talks of cultural ties. Here an even more serious criticism must be made of the ministerial statement, for it is in regard to this last point, and only after acknowledging the need to close cultural distances with our neighbours, that Senator Evans makes his damaging admission that Australia still has a significant image problem in the region. I join with others when I say that honesty must always be admired; but does the Foreign Minister not appreciate that after eight years of Labor administration and three years of his own stewardship his comments are in fact an admission of failure?</PARA>
<PARA>  The Hawke Government has had some notable foreign policy successes, such as its role in Cambodia and the formation of the Cairns Group. However, the past eight years have coincided with, at best, a period of uncertain and unstable relations with much of our region and, at worst, an identifiable erosion of those relations. I believe that there is ample evidence to substantiate those claims. For example, there have been instances of sheer thoughtlessness, such as Senator Evans's insult to the memory of hundreds of young Australians killed in the Vietnam campaign by his wearing a Ho Chi Minh lapel badge during a visit to that country. There was the tactlessness of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in describing the hanging of Barlow and Chambers by the Malaysian Government as a barbaric act. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are many instances of foreign policy being shaped largely in response to left wing Labor Party pressures, such as the Prime Minister's MX missile backdown and the cool, even non-existent, response to the American SDI program; the one-sided financial assistance to the African National Congress; and the nature of the Government's support for the Fijian trade union movement. There have been errors of judgment such as the sale of jets to Pakistan and the way in which we have managed our overseas aid programs to Papua New Guinea and South Pacific nations. </PARA>
<PARA>  Those who have an interest in and an appreciation of the importance of foreign affairs will be aware that this is a very modest selection from a wide field of diplomatic mistakes and totally insensitive actions. What they add up to is a sorry story of strained and uncertain relations with Malaysia, Indonesia, South Africa, China, Papua New Guinea, Fiji and a number of other South Pacific nations. We have been gently criticised by Singapore's Lee Kuan Yew, snubbed by the Solomon Island's Prime Minister, bypassed in the Bougainville dispute negotiations, sidelined by the ASEAN group of nations, and had a Foreign Minister told in very forthright terms that he was not welcome in Fiji and publicly humiliated in South Africa and Malaysia. Having taken that into account, Senator Evans is certainly correct in admitting to an image problem in our region. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe that a consideration of the above circumstances indicates a worrying pattern of a government that is allowing its political ideology to interfere with Australia's national interests; a misreading of the feelings of neighbouring countries and their leadership; and a personality in our present Foreign Minister which has shown itself to be a complex mixture of intellectualism, naivete and outspokenness. These three influences--party ideology, errors of judgment and personality factors--make for circumstances that are inimical to the need for highly developed expertise in foreign affairs matters. </PARA>
<PARA>  I suggest that the Foreign Minister has shown a particular lack of judgment in the management of his Ministry, and I mention three specific areas. It was unforgivable that during his recent South African visit he should be so naively partisan as to give direct financial assistance to the African National Congress and then be very surprised at the reaction of the Inkatha Freedom Party. Can honourable members recall any circumstance in living memory in which a Foreign Minister has been so publicly rebuked? In my opinion, the most basic error of judgment made in regard to Senator Evans's trip to South Africa was his decision to undertake a fairly long visit--an eight-day visit. Given the background to our relations and the present circumstances in that country, I believe that a much shorter visit was a diplomatic necessity. I think reference must be made to Senator Evans's obsequious behaviour in Malaysia last year. Such behaviour was not the action of a country that has successfully conducted its foreign relations. Diplomacy is all about avoiding precisely such demeaning behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, we have our relations with Fiji. This must be  close to a textbook case in how not to conduct foreign relations--from our initial lack of intelligence about the Rabuka coup to the confused assessments as to its motives, a suggestion of gunboat diplomacy, the trade union connection, and our downright arrogance over subsequent constitutional developments. Is it any wonder that the Fijian Government has taken the attitude it has? (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I rise to wholeheartedly congratulate the Government for the increase in overseas aid in this Budget. Overseas aid went up by about $54m, a one per cent real increase, at a time when Budget outlays were very severely constrained. That is a very important contribution to reducing poverty in developing countries. As anyone who is concerned about what happens in the rest of the world knows, there has been a very severe depression in much of the developing world throughout the 1980s. So it is essential for anyone concerned about international justice as well as domestic justice to urge governments to do what they can to alleviate that poverty, and this increase in aid will make an important contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  That increase in aid is in sharp contrast to the position of the Opposition. At the time of the last election, the Opposition said that it would cut overseas aid by $200m. Only three weeks ago, in a major statement on foreign policy the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) said:</PARA>
<PARA>We believe that in Australia's current economic circumstances there is no responsible alternative to a short-term cut in the level of Australia's foreign aid. </PARA>
<PARA>What that means is that, despite the fact that 1,000 million people are living in absolute poverty--meaning that they end every day still hungry--the Opposition would further cut our overseas aid. That would be anathema to anyone with a modicum of a sense of fairness. It emphasises again that the Labor Party is the one party that has consistently worked to ease poverty in the developing world, as it works to ease poverty within Australia. It was the Whitlam Government, for example, that established what is now the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau. </PARA>
<PARA>  For those of us in the Labor Party concerned with development cooperation, our main focus has been to lift Australia's official development assistance as a proportion of national income. We have been successful in incorporating aid targets into ALP policy. For example, at the National Conference in June, the target of giving 0.7 per cent of our national income to official development assistance was reiterated. We have, I must admit, been less successful in getting those targets translated into reality. But the 1991 Conference did include an interim goal of achieving 0.4 per cent of GNP by 1995. That would be a significant increase on the present level of 0.35 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is true--and it is something that I strongly regret--that the ratio of aid to national income has fallen in the last six years. But it would be unfair to place too much of the blame for that on the Labor Government. The reality is that the ratio of aid to national income has been falling since the late 1960s, and the principal reason for that fall has been the declining assistance to Papua New Guinea--which is a welcomed and natural consequence of Papua New Guinea's increasing economic independence. </PARA>
<PARA>  Viewed in that way, the falling aid to national income ratio is not so much a deliberate and mean spirited cutback as an unwillingness to compensate by more rapidly expanding the non-PNG parts of our aid program. Perhaps we have focused too heavily on an important but simplistic aid to national income target and not enough on arguing for increased aid for specific purposes. Perhaps we have spent too much effort in criticising parts of the aid program and too little in seeking to expand those areas that are most developmentally beneficial. </PARA>
<PARA>  The motion that went through the Labor Party Conference in June had as it emphasis development cooperation which focuses on the most vulnerable people, increasing the focus on eliminating poverty and making a substantial contribution to the life chances of the billion people who live in absolute poverty. That focus on poverty is the basis of our struggle for a larger and better Australian aid program, but to achieve that goal we need to argue for high priority projects which the aid program can concentrate on. </PARA>
<PARA>  Existing aid programs are partly protected by precedent and vested interest. It is the new programs--the initiatives--that require our strongest support. These are also the best means for increasing the total aid to GNP ratio. The environmental groups, with support from others, have successfully applied this principle. Much of the 1991-92 aid increase comes from an $80m--over four years--environmental assistance program, which itself is a quadrupling of a 1989 initiative. Similarly, there is an increase in this aid budget for spending on population programs. That must be one of the highest priority areas for increased support, because those programs will enable developing countries which want additional funds for their population programs to increase their effectiveness so as to reduce their population growth rates. And the reduction of population growth rates is one of the principal requirements for both economic development and protection of the environment. </PARA>
<PARA>  Other major increases in the 1991-92 Budget are 10 per cent increases in funding for both non-government organisations and for the Development Import Finance Facility. Those programs are strongly supported by community groups and by business, demonstrating that the Government is willing to act on pressure from outside the portals of government. The Development Import Finance Facility exemplifies well the efficacy of calling for specific projects. DIFF projects are proposed by Australian businesses seeking finance for developmentally sound projects overseas, and there are many more projects proposed than can be funded. This backlog provides a continuous pressure on the Government to increase funding. Non-government organisations would find much community support if they spoke about poverty projects being delayed by a lack of funding. Precious public attention might be better directed to this more positive criticism than to the unfortunate but inevitable failings in funding our total aid program. </PARA>
<PARA>  We should be preparing funding increase requests for specific and realistic projects which meet our poverty alleviation objectives. More basic preventative health projects, primary and vocational education projects, revolving credit schemes and so on will not naturally grow out of AIDAB as it is currently structured. It is up to the supporters of poverty alleviation to propose and advocate those sorts of projects with the Ministers responsible. </PARA>
<PARA>  Our emphasis on poverty alleviation has been central to our success in convincing the Government to renew funding for the International Fund for Agricultural Development. Also in this Budget, Australia has rejoined the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation, meaning that we are now a member of all the UN agencies and that we can contribute through that particular agency to the process of industrialisation within developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA>  To conclude, I reiterate that anyone who is concerned about poverty alleviation overseas, as with poverty alleviation in Australia, should realise that it is the Labor Government that is in the position most effectively to implement programs of that type. It is quite clear that the Opposition has lost its way and its sense of compassion, and that it is now advocating cuts in the aid program beyond those which have already occurred. At the same time, the Labor Government is substantially increasing in real terms its allocation to poverty alleviating aid programs. I commend and praise the Government for that decision, and I hope that the Opposition will reconsider its position. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I wish first to take up a point made by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), on the issue of aid. I am disappointed not only by the honourable member for Fraser but generally by this debate about assistance to developing countries because so much of the debate is about aid and so little of it is about trade. There is no doubt that the best way to help the vast majority of developing countries is by giving them greater access to the markets of developed countries and, in particular, markets in the European Community and the United States and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I believe that if one is going to claim to be the most compassionate person, which seems to be a game this Parliament plays these days, the best way one can be compassionate and helpful towards people living in developing countries is to ensure that markets in developed countries are properly open to them. I speak with real experience, having worked in the north and south unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs for some time and having seen all sorts of programs of the kind that the honourable member for Fraser so passionately advocates--a little bit here and a little bit there. In terms of the totality of the need in developing countries, trade can do so much more for them than aid ever will be able to do. </PARA>
<PARA>  To carry on with that theme, though, the burden of my remarks tonight was going to rest on trade because I have noticed in this debate, as is so often the case, when one talks about the portfolio of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade it is interesting that people say so little about trade and talk inevitably about the perhaps more high profile and politically exciting foreign affairs issues. But I must say, without wishing to criticise other speakers, that I think the trade function of that department is a vastly important function, particularly at a time when our economy is simply on its knees. </PARA>
<PARA>  This year is the first year that Austrade will ever have come under the auspices of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade--and I welcome that change. I have always thought it was logical for Austrade to be a part of or come under the auspices of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. It has been an anomaly since 1986 that it has somehow found itself under the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, despite the pleadings of Senator Evans and clearly following, initially, the Cabinet victory for Senator Button. </PARA>
<PARA>  Senator Button's tutelage of Austrade, though, has not been a happy one. His period as the Minister responsible for it was one of benign negligence. I hope very much his successors as Ministers responsible for Austrade, in particular the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Mr Blewett), will show a greater interest in the activities of that organisation and ensure that it changes for the better. </PARA>
<PARA>  Austrade is undergoing at present a process of very significant change as a result of the McKinsey and Co. report. It remains to be seen how successful the implementation of that change is really going to be. One of the concerns I had about the McKinsey report was not the work done, but the fact that the terms of reference did not take into account the need to at least give consideration to redesigning the charter and long term strategy of Austrade. It is worth reflecting that McKinsey has made precisely that point in the report on Austrade that it gave to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>  So the McKinsey report was limited by its terms of reference and, as a result of it, there have been substantial changes within Austrade, including in personnel. Mr Ralph Evans is now the Managing Director and I wish him well in his work. I have every confidence he will do a competent job within the confines in which he has to operate. However, there is no doubt whatsoever that the recent debate in the community about Austrade--in the business community, the media and, to some extent, in this Parliament as well--has been brought about by a lot of concern that one hears from the business community about all over Australia about the historic performance of Austrade and the trade commissioner service. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are two aspects to that. Firstly, there is its past administration, happily is undergoing change now; and, secondly, the actual effectiveness of the organisation. I do not want to dwell too much tonight on the past administration, except to say that my mailbox has been full day after day with anonymous letters from officers of Austrade providing more and more information on goings-on within Austrade. I must say that, whatever one may think about the information--which has all turned out, I must say, to be entirely accurate--it does reflect a lack of morale in an organisation when its officers feel that they really want to show up maladministration that has taken place over recent years. I am happy to accommodate them in doing that, particularly as an awful lot of taxpayers' money has been involved. Some of it, without any doubt, has been squandered in ways that I could only describe as quite extraordinary. There is more to come on that, but I will not talk about it tonight. </PARA>
<PARA>  However--and this will be where the burden of my remarks rest tonight--one has to ask about the effectiveness of Austrade. The McKinsey report made a range of criticisms about it: that it needed to adopt a more market driven approach; that it needed to push more resources and responsibility into the field and away from the head office; and that the international and domestic network had to be revitalised and re-engineered to improve service delivery--and so the list goes on. I will not go right through that list, but I think those criticisms and some of those sorts of recommendations were really motherhood recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do not think anyone would disagree with the recommendations of the McKinsey report. I would only say that they were not as specific as I would really have liked. It explained what would be nice, new, fresh objectives for Austrade, but did not outline in detail how they could be achieved. In fact, if we look at both volumes of the McKinsey report, they are surprisingly slim. So the challenge is how to achieve the sorts of changes that McKinsey has recommended. I want to make four points about that. </PARA>
<PARA>  Firstly, is Austrade going to be an organisation which will pick winners? Is it going to be an organisation which will help what McKinsey has described as `high potential clients'; and, if it is going to do that, how is it going to do it?  Of course, it is axiomatic to say that we would like to feel that, if Austrade is to continue to exist--and I believe it should--it must help high potential clients. It is easy to say that, but who are the high potential clients?  How will we ever find them?  Within Austrade over many years there has been a debate as to whether it should help big business, medium sized business or small business--and I do not think that debate has been resolved satisfactorily. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is one conundrum that Austrade has to face: should it help firms that are already efficient and proven operators in export markets, or should it just help people who really desperately need help and are not doing very well? The fact is that, if people are efficient in export markets, it is questionable that they need help: if they are not and they show themselves to be struggling overseas, perhaps help is going to be a waste of money. It is a conundrum and one which Austrade has yet to find a simple way of resolving. One of the solutions is clearly to commercialise the organisation and to charge firms--and of course there is a system of charging already--on a more commercial basis for the services provided. One of the responses we get from the business community to that proposal is: why should they pay for a service which is of such poor quality?  The answer to that is that, if the service were of high quality, if it were a commercial service, commercially oriented, I am sure the business community would be happy to pay a higher charge than is currently the case. </PARA>
<PARA>  Secondly, Austrade needs to be better integrated with the business community, with business associations, business organisations and individual firms. I do think that it needs to demonstrate very clearly how it is linking directly with business associations and, in particular, using those associations with its extensive membership as a conduit for market intelligence collected by Austrade. </PARA>
<PARA>  Thirdly, I do think that the smaller firms are the ones who need marketing assistance overseas. The South African Foreign Trade Organisation serves as a very good example of how that can happen. Firms go to SAFTO, they buy marketing services there at a commercial rate, and the marketing is handled on their behalf by SAFTO. It is a system that works very well and I would like Austrade to have a look at that. </PARA>
<PARA>  Fourthly and finally, the trade commissioners themselves, many of whom are excellent, able, hardworking people, need to have a system of reward for success rather than the system which they have at present which is simply bureaucratic and where they get paid the same, regardless of whether they do a good job or bad job. I wish Austrade well in the future. I hope it becomes more dynamic, more commercial and more market driven. It has potential. It could become a really effective organisation of which all Australians could be proud. It has not quite made it yet, though. (Time expired)</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> --Like the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer), I feel there has been inadequate reference made to the trade responsibility of this amalgamated Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I should say that I remain totally cynical about the amalgamation and I am greatly concerned about the way in which the foreign affairs and trade components of the Department still seem to be unhappy partners. In my view, the Department is still a bureaucratic nightmare. I do not believe it functions as well as it should. I believe there are enormous problems in getting efficient output from its present structure--not peculiarly because of the marriage between foreign affairs and trade, but that certainly does not help to ease the problems. I say that with due respect to Dick Woolcott, the Secretary, for whom I have a high personal regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I think there are enormous problems in the functions of the Department at the moment and, frankly, I think it would do well if it were split and if the way in which the bureaucracy has taken over the Department were examined to ensure that there was greater efficiency and, I suspect, less bureaucracy. I would see greater advantage in pruning the Department here in Canberra than cutting posts such as that in San Francisco at a time when in San Francisco there lies a great market, a region which is of vital importance to us. Certainly, I do not believe that that decision can be offset by any advantage arising from the decision to fund, as I understand it, the new embassy in Phnom Penh. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are a series of aspects of the Department's estimates to which I wish to refer. I was delighted too to hear the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar) refer to his concern about the approach of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) and the Government's approach to the conduct of foreign affairs. Like the honourable member for Warringah and others on this side of the House, I believe the Minister has been overemotive in his response and reaction to so many issues. We saw it most recently in his visit to South Africa. But it also has occurred in other attitudes with respect to the peacekeeping negotiations in Cambodia. We have seen it in his own approach to issues in Europe, and we have certainly seen it in the way in which we have had an on-off relationship with Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA>  I believe we need to develop stability in our foreign relationships. We must give priority to our relationships with the countries of South East Asia, our relationships with Papua New Guinea and our relationships with the nations of the South Pacific; they should be way up at the top in the priorities for our conduct of our foreign policy. Yet, I am afraid that there seems so often to have been priority given to emotional issues such as the eradication of apartheid, with which we all agree philosophically, but certainly do not agree in respect of the maintenance of sanctions which still continue against South Africa or in the delay that has occurred in the re-establishment of an air service with that country, or even the establishment of direct air links with Taiwan--although, with respect to the latter, I am delighted to see that this week it looks at long last as though the air service on both sides will commence. </PARA>
<PARA>  There are a number of particular areas in the estimates to which I want to refer. The next one is with respect to the construction of embassies. There are two aspects to this. First, it is extraordinarily difficult to find how and in what respect funds are being provided for which posts and in what time. I would like to refer honourable members to the Administrative Services estimates, to the reference to funds allocated for new posts. If one turns to the Foreign Affairs estimates, one finds that there too there is reference in the measures table on page 3-225 of Budget Statement No. 3 to particular new posts and funds provided. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, it is not only in new posts; it is also in the $17.5m that is allocated towards Australian participation in Expo 92 in Seville, including $12.9m to construct a pavilion. But there is reference to money allocated for posts within which Australia will, of course, in the future hold its foreign affairs and trade representatives or, in the instance of Expo, its display representatives. I am quite horrified at the design capability of those who produce these new embassies. Those honourable members who have been to the embassy in Japan, for example, would be as embarrassed as I am at a building which replaces one of the most gorgeous old traditional homes within the city of Tokyo. The new building is an absolute disgrace to the architect, to the Department, to the Government, and indeed to everybody responsible. </PARA>
<PARA>  In my view it should be sold for whatever we can get, and we should try to get a building that in some way reflects Australia's honour, dignity and the significance of our relationship with Japan. Indeed, that building is more like Alcatraz or perhaps Long Bay gaol. If one of the corrective services departments of the States were to build a building of that ilk here, I would be more understanding than I am in respect of the building to house Australia's representatives and interests in Tokyo. </PARA>
<PARA>  According to the estimates, we are still completing the Beijing property; we are constructing or about to construct a new embassy in Jakarta and a new embassy and deputy head of mission residence in Suva; we have negotiated a new Manila embassy lease, presumably at some stage for either a new building or the continuation of an existing lease. I find inadequate detail in the estimates. </PARA>
<PARA>  Of course, we also have new posts in Phnom Penh and the Gulf, and new posts in Prague and Berlin. There are overseas feasibility studies and design works in Bangkok and Port Moresby, and, of course, there is also secure staff housing in Port Moresby. I say to both departments--that is, Administrative Services and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade--for goodness sake, get some Australian identity; get some reasonable, practical, common sense in building those edifices which represent our national character. </PARA>
<PARA>  In my mind, in Canberra, we have been extraordinarily fortunate with some wonderful embassy and chancellery buildings around this city. With some of ours overseas, firstly, one would know little from the exterior design that they were Australian premises; secondly, in some instances even the colour offends Asian sensitivities, as Asians have slightly different emphasis and in some instances totally different cultural and religious preferences for colour from those of us who look at these things with Western eyes; thirdly, we do have some tremendously innovative and Australian related concepts and designs which I believe could so well be translated into those buildings. </PARA>
<PARA>  For example, all one has to do is to go to Longreach to see what has happened in that magnificent building that has been constructed to preserve something of the history of those who established the bush identity in this country--the Stockman's Hall of Fame, which has an Australian identity. I think that we can do that in buildings. We can certainly do it to a far greater degree than we have in the Australian embassy in Tokyo. </PARA>
<PARA>  Indeed, I regard some of the other embassy buildings I have seen--those in Paris and Jakarta--as being less than adequate and certainly have nothing like the character, in the Paris instance  and certainly in the Tokyo instance, of the buildings they have replaced. I would suggest that it would be appropriate for us to start not just to do it with embassy buildings but, for example, in that Australian building in Expo 92 in Seville. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have seen in many instances New Zealand buildings which are a great tribute to that country. They spend the money and they certainly produce something that has the warmth and character of New Zealand. Somehow we just do not seem to achieve that. </PARA>
<PARA>  The other area I wish briefly to address is Papua New Guinea. I note that we are still in the process of running out of that five year development cooperation treaty signed with Papua New Guinea in 1989. That of course was a disaster attained by the previous Foreign Minister, the present Governor-General when Foreign Minister. He then, we recall, let down totally Papua New Guinea. Having made a commitment, he changed the character of that aid program. There is still a difficulty in knowing just where the aid should go. There is the debate on whether it should be budget aid or whether it should be project oriented. </PARA>
<PARA>  I certainly think we need to move away from the budget support, but I am concerned that in the present climate we need to recognise the particular relationship that Papua New Guinea has with us. I think it is not sufficient that we only look at providing help in the law and order field. I would like to see more aid given to education, more aid given to employment related activities, and perhaps more assistance given so that there can be a better quality of administration in a country which at one stage was our colony. I think our relationships with Papua New Guinea should be at the top of our priorities and I do not believe that the priorities the Department has given quite amount to that. </PARA>
<PARA>  Like the honourable member for Mayo, can I advert to the fact that as far as the trade connections are concerned, I am interested to see Austrade coming in this Budget portfolio for the first time. However, for my money, I would scrap Austrade and get back to the stage where we had those senior trade commissioners and trade commissioners working for the Government, with the rest of it to be handled by the private sector.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I rise tonight to bring to the attention of this House and of this nation an inequity which is absolutely beyond belief. I wish to quote from a recent newspaper report:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Rebel lawyer John Little faces another two months in jail after a Supreme Court judge yesterday set a fixed term for his contempt of court sentence. </PARA>
<PARA>  As Mr Justice McGarvie ordered Little, 52, to be taken back to Pentridge, the disbarred solicitor shook his head and said: "This is ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA>  He was led away in handcuffs comforted by his wife Dokhi and surrounded by 30 supporters who demonstrated outside the court. </PARA>
<PARA>  Little, who has already served a month of what was originally an indefinite jail term, said the whole situation was a joke and he would sue the Law Institute for damages. </PARA>
<PARA>  "It was a parody of justice," he said. "They should be embarrassed. I have committed no crime. </PARA>
<PARA>  Little has fought a one-man battle for a number of years against the institute over compulsory professional indemnity insurance and solicitors' practising fees. </PARA>
<PARA>  He claims the institute illegally uses the money it levies from lawyers to fund cocktail parties, subsidise meals and market superannuation schemes. </PARA>
<PARA>  Little's defence has moved the Law Institute to set up an inquiry into solicitors' practising fees. </PARA>
<PARA>  Little was fined $10,000 for contempt of court in June after he defied an earlier court order by practising without a certificate. He was also struck off the solicitors' roll. </PARA>
<PARA>  Little was before the court yesterday at the request of the institute, which claimed there was public concern that he was imprisoned indefinitely. </PARA>
<PARA>  Mr Justice McGarvie said he was satisfied Little would never pay the fine and it was left for him to be punished for his contempt. </PARA>
<PARA>That is ridiculous. In this country we believe in the individual rights of women, we believe in rights for animals, and we believe in citizens' rights of almost anything we can think of but, for heavens sake, a solicitor has no individual right not to belong to an organisation. That is ridiculous. I maintain that it is long past time that this House and this Parliament gave credence to my private member's Bill for voluntary membership of organisations which offers all Australians the right to belong or not to belong to an organisation. It does not matter whether that is an organisation of membership of a union--that is, a union of workers--whether it is an organisation of professional bodies or an organisation of solicitors or lawyers, as my friend the honourable member for Ballarat (Mr Ronaldson) will attest. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-As you would be well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, this week has marked a dramatic turning point in the fortunes of politics in this Government. All the opinion polls are now showing that the Federal Government is going to come back at the next election. The Bulletin poll this week shows that the number of people who expect the Liberal-National coalition to win the next election has dropped by 8 per cent and those who expect the ALP to win has risen by 8 per cent. The number who think that the Liberals will win the next election has gone from 62 per cent to 44 per cent, and the ALP has risen correspondingly very rapidly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  We know that the reason for the increased popularity of this Government is its capacity to take unified, tough reforming decisions in the overall interests of this country. But there are three other factors that should be taken into account. One is that the economy is coming back; the second is that the Opposition is being increasingly exposed for the right wing extremist rabble that it is; and the third is that its tax on consumption is being exposed to the general public and they can see how unpopular it is. </PARA>
<PARA>  First of all, the economy has turned dramatically this month. The current account deficit is down, the inflation rate is down, savings are moving up with our superannuation schemes, and the eight-year business cycle is generally turning in the other direction--that is, upwards. Even honourable members opposite are well educated enough to know that the last factor that will turn will be the unemployment rate. They know from experience, and even their Leader with his absurd brand of dry economics is aware, that the upturn in the business cycle is now taking place. </PARA>
<PARA>  Secondly, the Opposition's extreme right wing policies are being seen by the public for what they are. It has no health policy. We have just reaffirmed a reforming, equitable, universalist health policy. The Opposition's education policy is lurching towards vouchers for students. It still has not itemised the extra $3 billion cuts in government expenditure that it promised at the last election. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Opposition wants to privatise madly, including the entire social welfare system. Not satisfied with that, its Leader went to ACOSS last week and gave these people a bath--the people with the greatest conscience in this country about the poor and the underprivileged who have had a symbiotic relationship for the last 8 1/2 years with our great Government. It wants to kick the unemployed off benefits after nine months and give them who knows what, and it wants to abolish and dismantle the great savings scheme we have implemented-- compulsory superannuation for all workers in this country, not the 25 per cent that were covered under the Opposition's schemes. </PARA>
<PARA>  Finally, to cap it all off, the Opposition is sticking with this absurd consumption tax, although it is reluctant to reveal the final details because it knows with what horror they will be greeted by people generally in this country. What do honourable members opposite intend to do?  They intend to introduce an across-the-board consumption tax that will have the effect of increasing the price of football tickets, of betting, of homes, of funerals. It will have the effect of decreasing the price of diamonds, fur coats, French perfumes and imported luxury cars. School fees will go up. Private health insurance will go up. Graveyard monuments will go up. Wedding receptions will increase in price. Of course people do not like the idea. </PARA>
<PARA>  Who does the Opposition propose will benefit from this?  The people in the upper income brackets will benefit from a reduction in the income tax rates applied to them. The people who will benefit are the 2 per cent of taxpayers who pay capital gains tax amounting to $1 billion, which will be abolished. No wonder the consumption tax is unpopular. It is not only unpopular with the general public; we find that it is also unpopular with specialist commentators on the subject. We find Eric Risstrom, the national director of the Australian Taxpayers Association, saying that the purchasing power of superannuation, life insurance policies and savings would be ripped away; the coalition would not win the next Federal election if it vowed to introduce a consumption tax. True enough. We find Bob Santamaria, who has hardly been a friend of this Government over the past couple of years, saying that the consumption tax does not fulfil the qualification; there is little if any evidence that it will increase the fund of national savings or provide an increase in internal and investable funds. </PARA>
<PARA>  Why is it being introduced?  It is being introduced for one reason only, and that is to redistribute wealth and income from the poor to the rich. It has that feature in common with most of the other policies that have been cobbled together under the guise of dry economic policy. This Opposition is a redistributive Opposition, intent on redistributing income and wealth from the needy and poor in this society to the already wealthy who back its parties. It will not win the next election because the public will become more aware of its intentions, as was reflected in the opinion polls this week and will be again over the next couple of weeks. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-I feel very privileged to get the call tonight, Mr Deputy Speaker. I wish to address the question of the Australian International Defence and Equipment Exhibition (AIDEX). I do not seek to discuss the merits, because time is short in the adjournment debate, but to express the views of some constituents who have written to me in relation to this matter. In particular I mention the Ballarat Diocesan Council of Priests and particularly the Reverend Father Peter Sherman, who is the Secretary of that organisation. I also mention Mr Kevin Lenehan, J. P. McCulloch, Mr and Mrs Martin, and in particular the parishioners of St Columba's Parish.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  I had a petition from 117 people on this matter. Regrettably, the petition was not in the correct form and was therefore unable to be officially lodged with this House, but I will take the opportunity to read the letter that accompanied the petition. The letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA>We are writing to you as Australian citizens and voters to voice our concern about the plan to hold an Australian International Defence and Equipment Exhibition (AIDEX) arms fair in Canberra on 26 to 28 November 1991. </PARA>
<PARA>We believe that the Australian Government has decided to support what is considered to be the largest arms fair ever in the Southern Hemisphere. We do not believe that the Opposition has, as yet, stated its position on this decision. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to us that Australia is a privileged country in the Southern Hemisphere and especially in the Asia-Pacific region, despite its current recession. It is apparent to us that armaments are used by some countries for so called `national security' as well as for acts of aggression and `defence'. It also is evident that poverty and ill health in some countries are aggravated when large funds are being spent on armaments. </PARA>
<PARA>In the current world situation, following the end of the Cold War, it seems that international negotiation is now more a possibility rather than the use of armed force in resolving disputes. </PARA>
<PARA>We would hope that Australia could be making real contributions to the region and the world by offering to take part in and mediate in negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA>To promote AIDEX and to support the sale of armaments in our National Capital in these circumstances would weaken Australia's credibility as a negotiator and mediator in disputes. It would also open possibilities for oppression and aggression to continue and spread in countries in this hemisphere. </PARA>
<PARA>We are signing this petition with the firm hope that you will see the reason of our arguments and take steps to voice your opposition to this proposal. To take this initiative would, we consider, be in keeping with Australia's character and something that we as future voters would support strongly in you. </PARA>
<PARA>I agree with some of the sentiments expressed by those 117 parishioners, and I thank them most sincerely for taking the time to organise this petition. The question of AIDEX has aroused considerable community discussion throughout Australia, both supporting and opposing. In some respects it might be unfortunate that AIDEX comes after the Gulf conflict earlier this year, when these sorts of matters are still very much in the public arena and are very much of concern. </PARA>
<PARA>  I have not got time to read my full reply to the parishioners, but I would like to read one paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA>I am sure that you all share my very great joy at events in Europe and particularly the USSR. I believe that we finally are heading towards an achievable world peace. We must however, be mindful of the potential for the likes of Saddam Hussein to breach that peace and the fact that all the world powers were prepared to address his unconscionable aggression also gives me great hope. Regrettably it was only through armed force that Saddam Hussein was able to be dealt the contempt of the world and it is my fervent hope that the necessity to deal with the likes of Hussein by military aggression will eventually disappear. </PARA>
<PARA>My great concern is that the current export guidelines are not sufficient. I am pleased that the Opposition is undertaking a study with the ultimate goal of correcting the deficiencies in those guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA>I thank the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-In the past 12 months or so I have had to admit that there is a remote possibility that there will be an election which the Opposition would win--a very remote possibility, but a possibility nevertheless. However, in recent days--and the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley) has told us about some polls that were done--that remote possibility is becoming ever more remote. There is very little chance of its happening now. But even given that, a fair-minded person has to say that in a two horse race there is still a mathematical possibility that the Opposition will win an election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  That very remote possibility is a bit of a worry to me. It is a worry to this side of politics. It is a worry, and should be, to the Australian people. But especially it is a worry to the people of my electorate, which reflects so many other country electorates of Australia. It will knock the hell out of country people of Australia if the Opposition happens to win an election, because its policies will be disastrous for country people. </PARA>
<PARA>  The statistics concerning the make-up of my electorate of Page, which is similar to many other country electorates, show that there is a large number of people, of families, the vast majority of whom are on below average incomes. That is in comparison with the rest of Australia, but most especially, it is in comparison with Liberal Party electorates, which are very much wealthier. That is the difference. That is not a new thing; it has been going on for years. It is not because of the recession or statistics. The records I looked at were census records from 1986 and prior to then. When the recession has gone, country electorates like mine will still have large numbers of people, the majority of their people, on lower than average incomes, whereas some of those wealthy Liberal Party electorates will have up to 70 per cent of people and families earning in excess of $70,000 a year. In my electorate less than one-tenth of that percentage earn that sort of money. </PARA>
<PARA>  One has to look at the sorts of policies the Liberal Party is putting forward. The consumption tax is the major one at the present time. One has to look at whom that helps and who pays for it. The Opposition has admitted that it is looking for ways to compensate low income earners. The Opposition admits that the consumption tax will hurt lower income people, people below the average income, who make up the vast majority in my electorate and in other country electorates. The people who will benefit are those in the wealthy areas, in Liberal Party electorates, the electorates where there are Ferraris. I can tell honourable members that in Grafton, Albury and Moree it is rarely that a Ferrari is seen being driven down the street. </PARA>
<PARA>  How are these lower income earners to be compensated?  If one looks at the Australian Taxpayers Association chart that was put out recently, one sees that lower income earners have to be compensated by up to and exceeding 100 per cent of the tax they are paying now. That will just not happen. The reason why I worry about the people in my electorate should the Opposition get into power is plain to see. The people in my electorate will pay the price, and the people who will benefit are those in wealthier Liberal Party electorates. </PARA>
<PARA>  I challenge the National Party to start asking questions. The people represented by the National Party are the same people, the same sort of people, as I represent. If members of that Party are not willing to start asking questions of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), they are not representing the vast majority of the people in their electorates. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Leader of the Opposition is going up to the north coast in my area next week. I challenge him to start telling us about this consumption tax. I challenge him to start telling us how he will adequately compensate the vast majority of people on the north coast of New South Wales who have below average incomes. The Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) was up there last week. I challenged him to do the same, but he refused. He could not and he would not take up the challenge of explaining the consumption tax because, when one has to explain it to people who will have to pay for it, it cannot be explained.

I cannot see any hope that the people of Grafton would want to return this Labor Government at the next election. I am absolutely certain they will not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  What is thriving, of course, is the Gold Coast. I want to speak about tourist promotion. Recently the subject of tourist promotion has become a hot issue in my electorate, the Gold Coast. The local council, the Gold Coast City Council, has proposed the introduction of a tourism levy, which would be an additional rate for commercial properties. The issue has become extremely controversial. The matter has raised the whole issue of how tourist promotion should be funded. </PARA>
<PARA>  It is fairly obvious that the Queensland Government has not accepted its responsibility for tourist promotion funding. The Goss Government rips the Gold Coast off to the extent of $70m per annum in land tax levies. It gets an enormous windfall from stamp duty through property transactions on the Gold Coast. Out of all those millions of dollars, the Queensland Government gives us back for tourist promotion the princely sum of $1,000,000 per annum through the Queensland Tourist and Travel Corporation. That is the same amount it gives for tourist promotion in Mount Isa, Bundaberg and perhaps even in Ipswich. I do not know whether it funds tourist promotion in Ipswich, Mr Deputy Speaker. Perhaps at some time you could tell me. Beautiful place that it is, perhaps it ought to attract tourists. </PARA>
<PARA>  The Gold Coast needs tourist promotion funds. The Gold Coast Visitors and Convention Bureau is largely charged with the responsibility of promoting the Gold Coast and does a terrific job. However, unfortunately, it is vastly under-funded. The question of the tourist promotion levy came up simply because to a large extent the Visitors and Convention Bureau relies for its financing on private membership. Unfortunately, a significant number of businesses do not choose to join. They benefit from tourism, as almost every business on the Gold Coast does, directly or indirectly, but do not contribute. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do not believe that the Gold Coast City Council should impose an additional levy, what amounts to an additional tax on small business. I acknowledge that there must be funding for tourist promotion. Tourist promotion is clearly a good investment. There is no doubt in my mind about that. Money put into tourist promotion has immediate benefits for the Australian economy and for the local economy on the Gold Coast. It creates jobs and earns export income. We desperately need both of those things in this country at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA>  I do not believe the answer is a further impost upon small business by virtue of another tax. The Goss Labor Government in Queensland should accept its responsibility to put more money into tourist promotion on the Gold Coast. As I said, it takes an enormous amount of money from the Gold Coast and puts very little back. </PARA>
<PARA>  There is, in addition, a case for boosting Federal Government funding of tourist promotion. The Budget this year increases the amount to $64m, but I believe at the moment we attract only about one per cent of the world tourism market. I think there is a tremendous opportunity, a tremendous potential, for us to increase that. If we can double the number of international visitors to our shores by 1995 and then perhaps double it again by the year 2000 we will have created more than a million jobs for Australians and earned, in today's dollar terms, $26 billion in foreign exchange. </PARA>
<PARA>  I suggest that in the Budget the Government could have done more for tourist promotion. Even increasing the amount of money to $130m would have been a step that would have paid off enormously in the creation of jobs and the earning of foreign exchange. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr Crean</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  In June 1990, the AWC instructed Smith Shelston Beadle, (now Carter Smith Beadle) Patent Attorneys, to lodge a Notice of Opposition to Mr F J Newman's Australian Patent Application No 14645/88--Sheep Delivery System.</PARA>
<PARA>  In September 1989, the AWC was made aware of Mr Newman's patent application which described and claimed a number of features that were considered by the AWC to be `prior published material' and/or `prior public use' resulting from a Wool Research and Development Fund (WRDF) project at the University of Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA>  In November 1989, Smith Shelston Beadle were instructed to write to Mr Newman's patent attorney drawing Mr Newman's attention to the prior material and inviting him to suitably amend the claims in his patent application.</PARA>
<PARA>  The AWC's attitude to the Newman application arose from the Corporation's endeavour to allow the results of certain WRDF funded wool harvesting projects, including the above-mentioned University of Melbourne project, to be available to growers either free from the patent monopoly or on not more than a `break-even' returns basis. It was for this reason that the AWC, and the project team, elected to publish rather than apply to patent the results of that University of Melbourne project. Having taken that course, it was entirely inconsistent with the AWC's approach that a patent application which it believed relied upon the prior University of Melbourne project insights should be allowed to proceed without challenge. This is not to suggest that the AWC held, or now holds, any view that Mr Newman's application was not in good faith or involved plagiarism, but rather, that the AWC's opposition was legitimate to prevent even bona fide coincidental inventions from achieving subsequent patent monopoly status.</PARA>

<PARA>  (1) Until the second tier negotiations the Meat Inspectors' Award included a procedure providing for the reheadquartering of inspectors, whereby the officers concerned were made a series of three offers of alternative headquarters, which could be followed by involuntary transfer means. This procedure was pursued according to the award until the proceedings were subsumed within award restructuring negotiations. The following tables show the number of inspectors who did not accept any offers of voluntary transfer. However it should be noted that the vast majority of inspectors headquartered at closed establishments over the years have accepted either transfer or redundancy.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0H4">Mr Griffiths</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  (1) The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) is responsible for inspecting imported foods, as identified by the Imported Foods Risks Advisory Committee (IFRAC). Foods are subject to inspection where there is evidence of significant risk to human health. Imported foods considered to pose low risk to consumers are not subject to point of entry examination by AQIS.</PARA>
<PARA>  (2) By decision of the Government, a moratorium was placed on the use of food irradiation technology within Australia, and on the importation of irradiated foods, for a period of three years from the end of 1989. A review of food irradiation technology by the World Health Organisation, considering data on safety, nutritional defects and means of detection of irradiated food, has been requested. This review process has commenced and should be completed by about October 1992.</PARA>
<PARA>  (3) and (4) AQIS does not inspect imported foods per se to ensure they have not been irradiated.</PARA>
<PARA>  A limited number of risk categorised foods currently fall within the scope of the imported foods inspection program administered by AQIS. Other foods are allowed unrestricted access to the Australia market and typically pose a low risk to consumers.</PARA>
<PARA>  With respect to those foods which are subject to inspection, if AQIS inspectors observe through label checks that food has been irradiated it will be denied importation. At present there is no practicable scientific procedure for determining directly whether food has been irradiated. If, however, analysis of imported food led to an inference that food may have been irradiated, the matter would be referred to State health authorities for investigation. Such a circumstance might conceivably arise where a food usually prone to micro-biological contamination, such as crustacea, is found to be micro-biologically sterile.</PARA>
<PARA>  Importers are reminded from time to time that irradiation is not an approved treatment for food for consumption in Australia, but declarations that imported food has not been irradiated are not required from importers. AQIS will refer the matter to IFRAC for further consideration at the earliest opportunity with a view to determining what other measures, if any, may be appropriate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;-The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>  The Shadow Minister for Primary Industries and Energy is misinformed about the natural distribution of the silver-lipped oyster known scientifically as Pinctada maxima. In Australian waters silver-lipped pearl oysters are found primarily off the northern coast of Western Australia, and to a lesser extent in waters off the Northern Territory and in the Torres Strait. They also have a wide geographical distribution within the western tropical Pacific and South East Asian regions. Silver-lipped oysters are found in commercial quantities in waters off Papua New Guinea, Indonesia, the Solomon Islands, the Malay Archipelago and the Philippines.</PARA>
<PARA>  It has been estimated that the Western Australian pearling industry produces 40 per cent--50 per cent of the world's supply of South Sea pearls, which come from silver-lipped pearl oysters. The balance is produced primarily by our South East Asian neighbours.</PARA>
<PARA>  Pearl production in Australia is controlled by Australian companies. Currently Indonesia and some other countries lead Australia in hatchery-produced pearl oysters.</PARA>
<PARA>  Exports of live pearl oysters from Australia are prohibited under the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations, Third Schedule, Item 13. In addition the importation of live pearl oysters is prohibited by Proclamation 108A under the Quarantine Act.</PARA>
