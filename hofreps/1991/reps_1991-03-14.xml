<TITLE>Rights of the Child</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA>1. that ratification of United Nations Conventions, such as the above, by the Federal Government, without Parliamentary debate or consultation with the people through a referendum, is a gross abuse of the Australian Constitution and is contrary to democratic principles;</PARA>
<PARA>2. that the Convention's philosophy of parent/child relationships is based on a false premise and embodies the totalitarian principles of State ownership of children;</PARA>
<PARA>3. that the Christian principle of parental authority is essential for the proper functioning of society, but phrases in the Convention implying parents' rights are virtually meaningless, with escape clauses permitting the widest of interpretation;</PARA>
<PARA>4. that Articles 12 to 16 giving children the right to seek, think, say and be whatever, where ever and with whom they wish violates the common sense of any normal parent;</PARA>
<PARA>5. that some Articles contradict other Articles and imprecise wording adds to the confusion by providing loopholes for the protection of paedophiles and certain types of child traffickers;</PARA>
<PARA>6. that some of the proposed rights are inappropriate for immature child minds and have no logical connection with the protection of children from abuse or deprivation, such protection being already provided by existing Australian laws.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore request the House to legislate or provide for:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) a twelve month Moratorium on the ratification of the Convention to enable the people of Australia to discuss and examine in detail the 54 Articles;</PARA>
<PARA>(b) a referendum to follow the Moratorium, seeking public approval before ratification of the Convention.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<TITLE>Medicare: Abortions</TITLE>
<PARA>The Honourable Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in Parliament. This petition of the below citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House of Representatives that we support the continued cover for all abortions on the Medicare schedule. We oppose any attempt to restrict access to the rebate under Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA> Medicare cannot pretend to be a Universal health care system without providing a rebate for a termination of pregnancy.

<PARA>To the Honourable Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully shows:</PARA>
<PARA> Their opposition to the dispatch of three Australian warships to the Middle East, which is part of an unnecessary militarisation of the region, and which contributes to the likelihood of all-out war. The increasing military buildup in the Middle East does not contribute to a resolution of the conflict. The conflict can only be resolved by regionally based diplomatic means. Whilst we unambiguously oppose the acquisition of territory by force and Iraq's military takeover of Kuwait, we note that current actions against Iraq have not been applied in similar circumstances, such as the annexation of East Timor by Indonesia.</PARA>

<TITLE>Therapeutic Goods Regulations</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the Speaker and members of the House of Representatives assembled in parliament:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of certain citizens of Australia, draws to the attention of the House our objections to the Therapeutic Goods Regulations under the Therapeutic Goods Act, 1989. Under the guise of protecting the public against inferior produce those Regulations will have the effect of putting out of business many natural therapists and small-scale manufacturers of natural remedies. The charges levied at manufacturers will increase the cost of supplements and constitute an indirect taxation on users of Natural Therapies. The clauses in the Regulations which purport to exempt Homeopaths and Herbalists are so badly drafted as to be inoperable, and the prohibition on allegedly misleading representations will make it impossible to refer to efficacies of natural remedies which have been public knowledge for centuries. The Regulations, therefore, represent a fundamental attack on the Australian people's freedom of choice in medicine and are an abomination.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore pray that the House will reject the Therapeutic Goods Regulations and request the House to constitute a Public Enquiry into the question of regulation of natural therapeutic goods.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the report of the visit by the Australian parliamentary delegation to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Mongolian People's Republic and Japan in September and October of 1990.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The delegation of three members of the Government and three members of the Opposition arrived in Moscow on 19 September and separated in Fukuoka, in the south of Japan, on 12 October. Indeed, it afforded us a unique opportunity to look at the Soviet Union, Mongolia and Japan in a time of transition, particularly in the former two nations. </PARA>
<PARA> In Moscow we had the opportunity of meeting with large numbers of elected Soviet parliamentarians, something which is unique to their structure and which afforded us an opportunity which few others have had. We had the opportunity of visiting plenary sessions of the Supreme Soviet. While those sessions are major ratings winners in the Soviet Union, the impression that we got from that experience was that the way of doing business in the Supreme Soviet was something that required considerable refinement. While many of us may criticise the practices of this place, it is clear that hundreds of years of parliamentary democracy have refined the process in the West, and in the Soviet Union there is the requirement for that to occur. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the most abiding impression of the Soviet Union is that of the enormous size of the country. It represents one-third of the world's land mass. We had the opportunity of travelling right across the country from Moscow, via Mongolia, to eastern Siberia and then to the Soviet Far East. The Soviet Far East was the focus of our attention because it was believed that this region of the Soviet Union represented the best opportunities for Australia to make business contacts and to do business in that part of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> The thing that strikes one about the Soviet Union is the enormous diversity in its cultural and historical background, the geographical diversity, the religious differences and the fragmentation of the country. It is my belief that over the next decade one of the great challenges for the Soviet Union will be to hold together that union. Perhaps only history will tell whether or not it is successful. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the most pressing need for change in the Soviet Union is that of economic reform. While we were in the country the Shatalin plan, the 5,500 day proposal for reforming the economy and the move towards a market economy, was the focus of attention. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, of course, enormous difficulties when one considers the transition that the Soviet Union is trying to make. I refer to the requirement for a convertible currency, the requirement for legislation relating to private land ownership, the setting up of an efficient banking system, stock exchange, company legislation, and trade practices protection. Many things that in a Western democracy we take for granted are not part of the structure there and represent enormous problems. But one thing that was very clear was the determination of the Soviet parliamentarians and officials that we met to change the system, an acknowledgment that their experiment had failed and the requirement for them to make the necessary adjustments. </PARA>
<PARA> Within that country, we were the subject of a great deal of interest and the hospitality was very pleasing. Between our visit to Moscow and the Soviet Far East, we had the opportunity to visit Mongolia, a country of enormous contrasts. Many of us have a perception of Mongolia as being a country of sheep herders, so on arriving in Ulan Bator, more than anything we were surprised by the industrial development of that place and the fact that in the middle of the Asian continent was an industrial town which was the capital of Mongolia. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the case that in Mongolia the same sorts of changes are being wrought that are occurring in the Soviet Union. For the first time it has a democratically elected legislature and it is establishing a multi-party government, which is an indication of commendable cooperation between the different political forces in that country. </PARA>
<PARA> Mongolia's need for political and economic reform is perhaps as great as the Soviet Union's, but one believes that, as a small country, and one which has a homogeneous population and a great number of forces that are working in the same direction, perhaps its task is an easier one. We had the opportunity to meet with large numbers of parliamentarians in that country. They were very frank in their discussions. My belief is that they were very realistic about the need for change and the difficulties they face, so this was a unique experience. </PARA>
<PARA> Probably the highlight of our trip to Mongolia was our visit to the Gobi Desert. I suppose that is something that Australian children only hear of in geography lessons, but it was really an experience and was, in many ways, not unlike the central part of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> From Mongolia, we travelled to the Soviet Far East and into Japan. Immediately on arrival in Japan, we were struck by the contrast between the Eastern countries and one of the West's modern miracles. The high-tech efficiency, the consumerism and the pace of life in Tokyo were in stark contrast to what we had become used to, particularly in the Soviet Far East. </PARA>
<PARA> While we were in Japan, the Persian Gulf crisis was something that was central to Japanese thinking. The difficulties that Japan was having in dealing with draft United Nations peace cooperation legislation indicated the constrictions that are put on the Japanese Constitution and the problems it has in responding to those sorts of difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> We had a number of discussions about significant trade and industry policy matters. Wool was a focus of attention for members of the delegation, and the unique relationship and the important trading relationship that exist between Japan and Australia were central to our thinking while we were there. </PARA>
<PARA> The great paradox with Japan is the contrast between its free trading industrial sector and its protected agricultural sector. Every opportunity, particularly with the finalisation of the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) discussions, was taken by the delegation to pursue the matter of the opening up of the rice market in Japan. There had been commendable progress made in the area of beef. It is our view that moves by Japan in this respect would be valuable to the GATT negotiations and certainly valuable to Australia's position. </PARA>
<PARA> While we were in Japan, nothing brought home more starkly the difference between a commodity exporting nation like Australia and a value adding industrial nation like Japan than the program instigated by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry of `import now'. Every taxi in Japan has a sign on the back saying `import now'. Nothing more than that indicated the contrast that exists between our country and Japan. While we are obviously in the throes of an important export push, Japan's orientation is completely different. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is appropriate to thank the large number of people who were involved in the organisation of the delegation and, indeed, the members of the delegation who travelled with us. It is the case that many people played a part. Siobhan from the Parliamentary Relations Office was an important organiser who, though she had nothing to do with the actual travel, played an important part. Francesca Beddie played a part in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. In the Soviet Union and in the Mongolian People's Republic liaison officers played an important part in our travel. Derek Brown, who played the role of interpreter in Japan, was an important influence and enabled us to carry out our role in that country. I need also to acknowledge the role of Jennifer Blood, who, as our secretary, travelled with us; and, indeed, Yolanda Campagna who played a part in the typing up of our report. </PARA>
<PARA> I should say just a few brief things about members of the delegation. I have thought for some time that the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), my deputy, was ideologically misguided but, of course, we respect him for his competence and experience. Indeed, the role that he played in the delegation was an important one and I thank him for his contribution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is important that the members of this House, on as many occasions as possible, maintain contact with their counterparts in the parliaments of the countries around the world. As one who in the past has been involved in these missions through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, I had some scepticism as to the wisdom of journeys of this sort being sponsored by the Parliament, not because I do not think the Parliament is able to do so. But I was hesitant as to whether or not the same ability to meet members of the governments of the countries visited and to discuss in detail aspects of the relationship between Australia and those countries would be as great for visits organised by the Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having returned from the mission for which the honourable member for Perth (Dr Charlesworth) has just presented this report, I can assure members of the House and the Australian electorate that visits of this sort are both rewarding in a personal sense to members of parliament and of enormous benefit to Australia and to the countries visited. They are able to see our different approach to some issues and to learn something of our aspirations, attitudes and, of course, our undoubted democratic right to express our own point of view on occasions. </PARA>
<PARA> In opening, I would like to commend the honourable member for Perth and the members of the delegation for the way in which they approached what was an extraordinarily long and not necessarily always an easy journey. Indeed, the honourable member for Forde (Ms Crawford) found herself falling uphill on one occasion and returned with an arm that is still occasionally strapped. Fortunately, with the medical care of the honourable member for Perth and the pills of my colleague the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster), we were able to take her from Khabarovsk across the ocean and get her to hospital in Japan. Fortunately, she seems still able to write with her right hand, so that was one of the pluses of the journey. </PARA>
<PARA> Each of the members contributed significantly. I am not going to say a great deal about that, but I would like to add that the honourable member for Macquarie who, as we all know, is a very prominent member of the christian fellowship of this Parliament, astounded us all by the links he had through the Bible Union through countries where christianity is not necessarily as well known or as espoused as one might believe. I think he probably has the biggest book-retailing opportunity of anybody I know. He distributed Bibles in most unlikely places-even in Ulan Bator where, as many people will know, the Buddhists regard religion as almost a part of their daily lives. </PARA>
<PARA> Each member contributed. I will not mention each of the others by name, but I do commend them for their role. What I wanted to do was to say a few brief words about each of the countries visited. In the time allocated, of course, it is impossible to say very much. </PARA>
<PARA> The Soviet Union is going through quite a ferment. Since we visited that country only a few months ago there has been enormous change. There are two aspects which I think people in Australia need to know about. One is that there is far more open dialogue, far more open discussion of the issues that are fundamental to the Soviet people than I believed possible. On other occasions when I have been to the Soviet Union, people have been scurrying around, looking behind their backs, apprehensive that somebody would report on their very thoughts. </PARA>
<PARA> While there might still be enormous power in the KGB, and while the nature of a closed society regrettably exists more notably as one moves away from Moscow, there is little doubt that within the Soviet Union the freedom that glasnost and perestroika have brought has given a fundamental new direction to that nation. Whether it can stay together, whether there will be a continued Union of Soviet Socialist Republics or whether there is going to be a fragmentation is not for the people of Australia to say. </PARA>
<PARA> I was impressed with the openness and frankness of those presenting their scenarios for the future, although I must say I remain apprehensive about the extent to which the military and those of the conservative old right, if you like to call them that, seemed to be intruding on what seemed to us, at the time of our visit, to be prospects for more democracy and greater economic freedom. </PARA>
<PARA> One particular fragment of a conversation that took place at the home of the Ambassador for Australia in Moscow, Robin Ashwin, stays in my memory. I talked to a Soviet playwright who, indeed, at that very time had a play being presented in the West End in London. He said to me that part of the difficulty in that country is that people do not even understand the concept of private ownership. So many of the elements of a market economy sound great in rhetoric but, unless understood, sadly, are not necessarily going to be translated, in the short term at least, into a change in their structure. </PARA>
<PARA> The most significant of all the ventures that I saw, indeed one of the best of the aid ventures I have seen anywhere around the world, was a bread shop in Moscow sponsored by the Australian Wheat Board, run and operated by an Australian and his wife. They are not only introducing new techniques, but also producing a product which I understand is nearly twice the price of the locally baked bread. Yet they still have queues, some hundreds of yards long, in the rain. People are buying the bread because it is fresh and because it lasts longer. In other words, the technology of the simple things is an area in which we excel. I think we would do well in business, in our economy, and in our exports to try to understand that we do not always have to build the biggest and the best; some of the simplest things are done well in Australia. We should be proud of doing well and try to extend that message to a greater degree than we do at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Mongolia is a fascinating country. I have been to Inner Mongolia, that part of the People's Republic of China (PRC) that still calls itself Mongolia and is, of course, Mongolia. The high plains run straight up there on that stretch of Siberia that we have all known of since our childhood. There are two amazing things about Outer Mongolia. Firstly, there is the hardiness of the people. Apart from the fermented mares' milk, there are those who savour camels' milk. The dust storms, the harshness of the climate and the hardiness of the people really strikes one. They are remarkable people and a people for whom each of us developed quite an affection. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thing is that one forgets that Mongolia is landlocked. It is completely surrounded by the PRC on one side and the Soviet Union on the other-enormous countries with enormous economies, yet this little country is landlocked in the middle. It has great prospects and Australia would do well to try to develop a greater understanding of and contact with it. </PARA>
<PARA> Japan, the third country we visited, is by far the most important of Australia's contacts. There are many aspects of our relationship that concern me. It is becoming more westernised and certainly, within its politics, there seems to be some recognition that there are demands for change, yet I somehow suspect that those changes will take a while to emerge. I found it quite fascinating talking to the Leader of the Socialist Party, Mrs T. Doi, who is an interesting person, and our discussions with her are referred to in this report. There is no doubt that the nature of Japan's political scene is changing, but the structure of that feudalistic society and the extent to which there is still a masculine dominance I know concerned the honourable member for Forde. There are difficulties in a society where the nature of industrialisation seems to us to be too paternal and not necessarily giving of the opportunity of individual freedoms in the way that we would prefer. </PARA>
<PARA> We tried hard in our advocacy, and I would reassert that if GATT and the Uruguay Round are to succeed countries like Japan need to be encouraged to play a greater role than they have. If the Japanese, for example, had been prepared to put rice on the table in the GATT negotiations-and this is part of their political, social and economic challenge for the future-then I believe that we could have persuaded the Europeans and the Americans to come along, too. The difficulty is that, while Japan holds back, we are going to find that those other giants are going to bog us down in their rivalry. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many aspects of Japan that I would like to address, but there is not time. There are recommendations in the report which I would commend to the Government. In closing, I would like to thank each of the members of the delegation, in particular the honourable member for Perth for his contribution. I say to Jenny Blood, the secretary, that her's was a difficult job well done. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report which I tabled earlier this morning is the first report of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training in this Parliament. I would like to pay tribute to my predecessor, John Brumby, who generously allowed subcommittees to be chaired by committee members-an approach which not all House of Representative committees follow. I am particularly pleased that this report reflects the work of a subcommittee chaired by my good friend and colleague the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen). I wish to thank her and the Subcommittee. I also wish to acknowledge the enthusiasm and effort of members of the Committee. This is particularly so of Opposition members who, with one exception, were elected to the Parliament at the last general election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Members of the secretariat are all new to the Committee and are deserving of high praise. I am indebted to John Cummins and his team, particularly Bronwen Worthington, the Subcommittee secretary, who did an outstanding job, and our keyboard wizard, Kerry Warner, without whom this report could not have been tabled. </PARA>
<PARA> With the International Literacy Year just finished, I think it is appropriate that the Committee's first report should deal with workplace literacy. It is also significant that the Committee's report is tabled in the year following the International Year of Literacy rather than during the year itself. Far too often, international years result in one year of concentrated effort and then the particular issue fades. </PARA>
<PARA> The report's introduction states that, with Australia facing unparalleled competition from trading neighbours with a strong commitment to improved educational standards, the problem of literacy is far too serious for a token response. It is essential, therefore, that there be a continuing commitment to improving literacy skills of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> I will leave it to my colleagues to provide detailed comments on the Committee's recommendations, but there are three issues that I wish to address. The first relates to the responsibility of schools. I was disheartened by what appears to be a fatalistic attitude of some educators. That attitude seems to accept that between 10 and 20 per cent of people will not make adequate literacy progress. Of course, I accept that there are children who come from disadvantaged and differing family backgrounds. Of course, I accept that there are kids from homes where little or no English is spoken. But what I will not accept is that because some children come from these sorts of backgrounds we should give up. We should not blame the parents; we should not blame the kids; we should not condemn children to failure because of their family background. This is totally unacceptable in 1991, the International Year of Literacy plus one. </PARA>
<PARA> All children have the right to expect that when they leave school they will be literate and every school has a responsibility to ensure that this happens. I cannot accept a philosophy which assumes that it is inevitable that hundreds of thousands of people will never become effective members of Australian society because of poor literacy skills. The Committee in the previous Parliament found that ultimately the education system and schools must accept responsibility for the educational outcomes of students no matter what their backgrounds might be. The present Committee supports that view and I trust it will not retreat from it. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter I wish to raise is the role of community organisations in the provision of literacy programs to those who had otherwise been failed by the system. In my electorate of Chifley I have a community based literacy program that has been operating very successfully for eight years and has just recently received some government funding. The program caters for people ranging from school students to adults. I cannot speak highly enough of their work and their dedication to the people they seek to serve. I believe that governments have inadequately utilised the good work being undertaken by community-based literacy providers and the sooner they do so the better. </PARA>
<PARA> The final matter I wish to discuss briefly is who should be responsible for the provision of literacy programs in the workplace. The Committee does not believe that employers have an obligation to meet the total cost of providing for basic literacy skills which should have been acquired during the compulsory years of schooling or prior to entry into the work force. The Committee has developed three simple principles: it is the responsibility of government to ensure that all people leaving the school system or entering the work force are literate; it is the responsibility of government to meet the costs of providing basic literacy and English language training in the workplace; and the upgrading of vocational literacy skills because of workplace reorganisation or new technology is the responsibility of the employer. </PARA>
<PARA> There will sometimes be an employee who needs additional basic education because of changed workplace requirements. In these grey areas it will not always be clear whether the upgrading of skills is basic or vocational. In these circumstances there may be justification to share the cost, but this would be subject to negotiation between the employer, employee representatives and the literacy provider. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Committee and its report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Words at work: A report on literacy needs in the workplace by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training should be compulsory reading for every teacher in every primary school, secondary school, technical and further education centre, college of advanced education or private training institution in Australia. It should also be compulsory reading for every member of the education or training bureaucracy, every business manager in both public and private business enterprises and every owner-manager of every small business in Australia. Most of those individuals will read Words at work with a high degree of comprehension; some will have difficulty in understanding; and tragically some will not be able to read it at all. Words at work is a serious report addressing an important national problem and I hope it will have a serious impact throughout the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report is tragic when it describes the monetary and social costs to individuals and to society resulting from the lack of literacy skills. It is comforting and hopeful when it describes some of the truly excellent programs which have been developed to help adults read, write and think critically in the English language. It is challenging in its recommendations to government, educational institutions and industry in firm, hard and strong recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> Following on the International Year of Literacy and the Wickert report, No Single Measure, this report is a comprehensive effort by members of parliament and secretariat staff who hold serious and grave concerns that, if we do not address the national disgrace of 10 to 20 per cent of our adult population being functionally illiterate, we will surely fail in any attempt to become the clever country. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the difficulties the Committee faced was that there is very little data regarding levels of illiteracy in the adult population and no data whatsoever regarding levels or standards of literacy for our school aged youth. In considering adult literacy needs, the Committee took the view that there is substantive evidence that there is a big problem and that to recommend further surveys and adult testing would be to wimp out while the problem escalates. While not resiling from facing the issue of the need for more information, we felt that it was far more important to make firm, strong recommendations for action to address and help fix the problem because it will not fix itself. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue of the effectiveness of our primary and secondary schools in delivering literacy skills to our youth is, however, a different matter. While the terms of the reference of the inquiry tended to limit the Committee to an examination of literacy only in the workplace, some of us were concerned to examine the root cause of lack of literacy skills amongst both adults and youth. I asked witness after witness whether we are still growing the problem in our schools, given that we have an unacceptably high level of people in society with poor literacy skills. Substantive evidence was received by the Committee that we are still growing the problem, but no witness and no submission was able to quantify that judgment. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of submissions and witnesses claimed that a change in teaching methodology in primary school reading programs was inappropriate and acted to put a substantial percentage of students in the first three years of primary school at risk. We were not able to substantiate the validity of those claims as there has been no continuous comparable testing over the period of the change. I believe, therefore, that the lack of testing prevents us from evaluating the effectiveness or otherwise of changes in methodology or the overall effectiveness of our schools in producing successful literacy outcomes in the entire student population. </PARA>
<PARA> While agreeing with and supporting the majority of this report, I came to the conclusion that it is imperative that we institute internationally comparable testing of all students' reading, writing and maths skills attainment at regular intervals throughout the years of both primary and secondary school. It is not good enough just to segregate from the system those students who seem to have problems. </PARA>
<PARA> We must also determine the effectiveness or otherwise of teaching methods and the overall ability of the system to produce. For that reason, I reject certain of the recommendations as being only half measures towards the solution to our problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Several of us have joined in dissent from the report in putting forward six specific recommendations dealing with the issue of literacy standards in our schools. In essence, those recommendations call for, firstly, international comparable testing of all students' reading, writing and maths skills attainment at various stages during the school years. Secondly, all primary schools should monitor literacy development in the first three years of formal schooling through frequent testing and reporting. Thirdly, reading testing results should be used to encourage changes in teaching methodology where appropriate. Fourthly, reading recovery programs should be implemented for all students not making satisfactory reading progress. Fifthly, students should not be permitted to progress through the levels of schools without satisfactory literacy performance. Sixthly, teacher training in literacy must be made a priority and methodology must be a serious consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> These are serious matters which must be addressed in order to give our youth the opportunity to actively participate in all the activities of this great nation. I join with the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) in thanking Bronwen Worthington for an excellent secretarial job. I recommend the report and the dissenting report to the House, to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) and to the nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to thank the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) for his assistance in connection with the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. He was Chairman of the main Committee, I was Chairman of the Subcommittee, and we are very proud of this report. I would also very much like to thank the other members of the Subcommittee and some of the members of the main Committee who actually were not members of the Subcommittee but who took an exceeding interest in the Subcommittee's inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report, Words at Work: A report on literacy needs in the workplace, looks at the problem of illiteracy and inadequate literacy amongst Australians. Hard as it is to believe, there are thousands of people in our society who cannot read or write in even the most fundamental manner. In fact, it is estimated that 10 per cent of the adult population of Australia may be functionally illiterate. In a society that requires at least a basic level of competence in oral and written communication to perform most tasks, these people are unable to contribute fully. Evidence presented to the Committee shows that the problem is not confined to people from non-English speaking origins. Rather a significant number of native English speaking Australians also have very low levels of literacy and many are actually illiterate. </PARA>
<PARA> Why do such a large number of people lack adequate literacy skills? Apart from the separate and distinct difficulties confronting non-English speakers, which the Committee also addressed, native Australians identified a number of reasons for their illiteracy problems-including social dislocation, illness during a school period, emotional trauma and problems at home. Obviously under these circumstances it is difficult, if not impossible, for schools and teachers to overcome or counteract such factors in the classroom under normal conditions. That is why the Committee has recommended that special resources are necessary before any progress can be expected with such students. These students obviously deserve this assistance, and that is one of the main recommendations of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the Committee had a great commonality of view during the course of its deliberations and, in fact, during the course of writing the report, I was disappointed that a couple of the members were unable to agree with all of the recommendations. Whilst I understand perfectly the rationale in their argument, the Committee itself did feel that we had addressed questions of methodology and testing in a fairly indirect sense by referring them to the Australian Education Council for further consideration. Some members of the Committee did not feel that we were actually qualified to make too many comments on the methodological questions involved. But I do take very seriously the genuineness of the people who have found the need to dissent from a couple of these recommendations in the Committee's report. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of illiteracy is far too high for both the individuals it cripples and the society from which it stems. Obviously, it is difficult to quantify this cost, but there have been some discussions on it and it does amount to something like $3.5 billion at least. Every Australian child, the Committee felt, deserves the opportunity to be literate and governments must do everything in their power to ensure that educational outcome is achieved. To that extent, I am very pleased to endorse the Chairman's comments in regard to the importance of schooling and school outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to people who fail to attain adequate literacy while attending school, there are those who have learned how to read and write at school but whose subsequent life has not required the use of those particular skills. This may sound very strange to people who use their skills all the time, but there are definitely people in our society whose job requirements are such that very little verbal or written communication is entered into and often that extends to the home life as well. Therefore, the ability fades and atrophies, and the people forget how to perform rudimentary tasks with which they were previously at least passingly familiar. I would say `passingly familiar' because I suspect that if people were very good literary people they perhaps would not lose their skills even if they were not used to a large degree, because they would have a fondness for them which would almost compel their use in their life. </PARA>
<PARA> Even so, the education gained at school can provide only the baseline for the future. Continued upgrading of skills will be required as industry and society demand additional skills of each individual, and I think this point takes up one which is very common now in the whole of our society, where people are recognising more and more the need for whole of life education. </PARA>
<PARA> During the course of the inquiry, the Subcommittee had the opportunity to meet with workers and management in a number of workplaces. Many employers have become aware of the literacy needs of their workers and of the benefits that occur as a result of providing this education in the workplace. Before I finish, I would like to read one small aspect of the report on page 42 at paragraph 5.6 where we talk about our visit to EZ Industries in Tasmania. The Committee was very impressed with what was going on in Tasmania. We say:</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee was impressed with the attitude and achievements of the management of EZ Industries in Tasmania which had conducted a number of workplace literacy programs with the assistance of the Tasmanian Adult Education team. The cost of releasing employees to undertake the courses was estimated at approximately $7.50 per hour which the management thought was reasonable, given the overall benefits which accrue to the company in the short and longer term. The Committee talked to workers who had participated in courses and was advised that self-esteem had improved markedly and that many of the people were now actively involved in award restructuring and workplace democracy. These workers had previously taken no part in such discussions but were now making a valuable and constructive contribution utilising their skills and expertise. Morale in the company had also improved as workers were encouraged by the management's support for the education program and saw it as an investment in them by the company which gave them confidence in their own worth and ability. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that point is actually the point that I would like to see made from the Committee's report, that it is important to the workers and to the management that workplace literacy programs be conducted and provided, whether it is by the State Government, by the Commonwealth Government, by the contribution of the worker or by the contribution of the employer. There is a definite advantage for the economy, for the industry and for the people involved in having these sorts of literacy programs in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA> I would very much like to thank the secretariat, particularly Bronwen Worthington, for her forbearance during the course of our inquiry and the course of our discussions in determining the nature of the report. I regret I cannot speak longer, but I would like to provide all the other members of the Committee with an opportunity to do so. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the short time available this morning, I intend to highlight a number of issues raised in the report titled Words at work: A report on literacy needs in the workplace. As one who comes to this place with a background in manufacturing, I have first-hand experience of some of the problems detailed in this report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a starting point, it is important that honourable members have a clear understanding of the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training's definition of `literacy'. For the purpose of this report, the Committee adopted the definition offered by the National Consultative Council for International Literacy Year, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Literacy involves the integration of listening, speaking, reading, writing and critical thinking; it incorporates numeracy. It includes the cultural knowledge which enables a speaker, writer, or reader to recognise and use language appropriate to different social situations. </PARA>
<PARA>As an employer in the manufacturing industry over many years, I knew at once that the adoption of this definition of `literacy' would reveal that we as a nation are faced with a serious problem in the workplace. I applaud the Committee's conclusion that for an advanced technological society such as Australia's, the goal must be an active literacy which allows people to use language to enhance their capacity to think, create and question, which helps them to participate effectively in society. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the House that a 1989 national survey sampling 1,500 people across Australia indicated that between 10 and 20 per cent of the adult population is functionally illiterate. Poor literacy skills have traditionally been associated with migrant workers, but this survey revealed that a significant number of native English speakers experience difficulties, and of particular concern is the number of people facing literacy problems with technology related issues. </PARA>
<PARA> The full extent of the problem is not known, but it is certain that workers with inadequate literacy, numeracy and language skills have been identified in a wide cross-section of industries and workplaces. The Committee's report offers an interesting assessment of the extent of the problem by monitoring a number of industries. The report also makes mention of the extent of the problem within various communities, such as Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders, and amongst prisoners. </PARA>
<PARA> The impact and costs of inadequate literacy in the workplace are not easily determined. The report correctly points out that there is a personal cost to the individual where the lack of skills largely prevents those affected from functioning to their fullest potential; there is the cost to the community in terms of support needed to compensate and educate the adult concerned; and there is the cost in terms of lost productivity and the negative resultant effect on the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of the industry statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on Tuesday, I will restrict my comments to the impact of poor literacy skills on productivity. No studies have yet provided an adequate assessment of the cost to Australia as a result of poor literacy skills. It has been claimed that, considering the numbers of people involved-over one million-this figure could be as high as $6.5 billion in lost production time. </PARA>
<PARA> The report concluded that low levels of literacy directly influence productivity in several ways. The production cycle is increased because employees have difficulties in understanding written instructions. They are unable to complete production reports or communicate in writing with supervisors, managers and other employees. Orders may be delayed and production quality suffers. An increase in time on the production cycle adds to the indirect cost of the product, which decreases Australia's competitiveness. My experience in the workplace would attest to the validity of the Committee's conclusions. </PARA>
<PARA> The report also makes some valuable observations about the impact on migrant workers who lack the essential language skills and are unable to enter the labour market at the relevant level. I support the Committee's conclusion that the skills of overseas born employees must be more effectively utilised. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not difficult to outline the problems facing Australian industry as a result of a lack of literacy skills. A harder task is to isolate the causes of the problem. The starting point is our education system, and the Committee is correct to quote the Harrison submission:</PARA>
<PARA>An adult with literacy problems has first been a child with literacy problems.</PARA>
<PARA>A number of submissions and much of the evidence stressed the need to look urgently at the methods of reading instruction in the early years of schooling. I accept the argument that success in dealing with the literacy problem will be achieved only if changes are made in the primary school, and in most cases the damage cannot be corrected during the secondary and tertiary years. </PARA>
<PARA> I also wish to advise honourable members that during the inquiry a number of submissions were received regarding the poor literacy skills of trainee and beginning teachers. It was argued that if teachers do not possess adequate literacy skills themselves they will be unable to develop the required skills in their students. </PARA>
<PARA> I also wish to draw the attention of honourable members to the Committee's discussion of the cause of the problem and of the large number of non-English speaking migrants engaged in the workplace. This is a major factor contributing to poor literacy skills in the workplace, and immediate attention must be given to finding long term solutions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's recommendations and accompanying explanations are detailed in the report. Time does not permit me to discuss these recommendations. The report has made a valuable contribution to the debate on literacy needs, and I urge the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) to give due consideration to the recommendations contained therein. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am particularly pleased to be able to speak today on the report Words at work: A report on literacy needs in the workplace, as it is the first report I have had any direct involvement in as a new member of the Parliament. I think it is particularly appropriate that the first report to which I am a signatory relates to education; in my previous 15 years of working life I was involved in the education industry, and I am pleased to be able to participate in this debate today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first thing I should like to do is record my thanks, both to the secretarial staff-in particular to Bronwen Worthington for all her dedication, patience and hard work-and to other members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. Travelling around Australia, taking submissions, talking to people and discussing matters in this inquiry was a new experience for me, and the support and friendship of all members of the Committee was particularly helpful in that process. I appreciate that. </PARA>
<PARA> The one thing that disappointments me is that a minority report has been attached. It is particularly disturbing to me since it is on a matter that was not directly related to the terms of reference and on which we did not seek or receive any real submissions. In my opinion, the minority report represents a naive and superficial approach to the process of identifying and reacting to teaching methodology issues. What is particularly disturbing to me is that the minority report has been signed by two members of the full Committee who took no part in the work of this inquiry and therefore have no substantive basis on which to agree to the recommendations in the minority report. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, I believe this minority report and its recommendations are driven more by ideological dogma than by any credible evidence, facts or a realistic approach to the process of education in the 1990s. The minority report is irrelevant to the real issues tackled in the inquiry and is discredited due to lack of evidence, and should be ignored. </PARA>
<PARA> The major thrust of the full report is that poor literacy skills amongst a significant section of our work force are inhibiting efficiency and productivity as well as lifestyle and life choices for people. It is in the nation's interests to get serious about the task of improving literacy skills in the work force and in the population generally. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike what many people had thought, poor literacy is not just a migrant problem. It is an important concern amongst our immigrant community but it is just as much a problem amongst a significant group of Australian born citizens. The strength of this report is that it makes firm recommendations for properly coordinated, funded and accessible programs to tackle the issue head on. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee in its series of recommendations proposes a multifaceted approach. It tackles literacy in all areas within the community. Firstly, it looks at the question of better diagnosis and remedial response in the early years of schooling, to prevent students going through the school system without their difficulties being addressed. I draw attention to recommendation No. 17, which talks about the Australian Education Council implementing a national early intervention program involving the development of comprehensive diagnostic assessment procedures for literacy problems in the years P to 3. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with my colleagues on the Committee who have stated that if we do not tackle the problem in the early school years we are creating an even bigger problem for later in life. It is important that we be provided with the resources and the support mechanisms in the early years of schooling to make sure that we do not have children going through the school system and still being illiterate. </PARA>
<PARA> Fundamental to this is the clear objective in recommendation 18, which states in part that we should be setting a national goal that all students leaving school should be literate. It is amazing that we have to recommend such a thing, but I think it is important that we have stated it and I hope all the Ministers involved with education will take up that challenge. </PARA>
<PARA> Literacy programs should be established in all large workplaces as part of the award restructure process. Literacy in the workplace is the crux of this report, but it is only one of many areas where we need to tackle it. We have talked in the report about the Trade Union Training Authority picking it up, we have talked about employers large and small picking up the needs of literacy and we have talked about the importance of encouraging the business community to give greater attention to literacy when it is looking at the general question of retraining.</PARA>
<PARA> We have also looked at the problem for unemployed people, and we have suggested that all unemployed applicants for active employment training courses-SkillShare courses, et cetera-should have their literacy needs identified and addressed. There should be much better coordination of language programs for migrants, and eligibility criteria need to be broadened to make it easier for migrants who may have been here for a few years still to participate. </PARA>
<PARA> The rate of illiteracy amongst prisoners is much higher than it is for the rest of the community. It is widely agreed that this is a major factor in recidivism in the prison population and needs to be addressed. The Committee has recommended more programs and that active attention be given by corrective services departments to this important area. </PARA>
<PARA> The other important area we addressed is the small business sector. Small business owners, managers and workers have also been considered and positive recommendations have been made that we start to address their literacy needs. We believe that is one factor which would assist their viability and economic performance. </PARA>
<PARA> I strongly urge our Federal Ministers and all State Ministers who have responsibilities in this area to respond positively to the report. The Australian community deserves and expects this issue to be addressed. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to recommend the report Words at work: Literacy needs in the workplace to the Parliament, to our responsible Ministers and of course to Australians generally. The matter I want to address in the time available to me is the creation of a climate in Australia, an environment, which acknowledges the urgency of the needs of literacy but, more important than that, acknowledges the value of literacy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many speakers have recognised the cost to our community in terms of productivity, in terms of an inability to gain work, in terms of a dependence upon the community in prisons and, of course, in a whole range of welfare areas where people are unable to read and write in any meaningful way at all. Just imagine being unable to read the newspapers, access information, look up a telephone number or be unable to read a label on a jar! All of these things are the day to day effects on an illiterate adult. As has been said before, an illiterate adult has been an illiterate child. We must create an environment within our schools, within our families, within our teacher training institutions and within our community as a whole across the spectrum of Australia for those who deserve that. </PARA>
<PARA> This report does go to the heart of the issue. It looks at an early intervention program; it looks at teacher training; and it looks at an advertising program in which the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) can play a role as part of our community service in raising the value and the merits of literacy, not just in a financial sense but in a community sense and in a sense of the worth of the individual. </PARA>
<PARA> We also demand that the Government take a role in this by ensuring that all documents are in plain English. In this Parliament only this week we have had the examples of the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Social Security rewriting their documents; so they too recognise the value of documents which can be easily read and are easily accessible. They are also contributing to community expectations of the kinds of values which we place on literacy. </PARA>
<PARA> One other issue which was really brought home to me through the submission is the enormous cost to us, as a community of people, of prisoners particularly, of whom 90 per cent are illiterate. That is a terrible indictment upon us as a community and, indeed, upon the prison services which to date have failed to address the issue. If prisoners are unable to read and write, they are unable to get a job in 1990s Australia. So what do they do? They reoffend, and cost us a further $140,000 a year to maintain them in prison. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of English classes is in fact infinitesimal in those parameters. We would urge, as a matter of urgency, the Minister for Justice and Consumer Affairs (Senator Tate) and his counterparts in the States to ensure that the whole issue of the needs and requirements of prisoners is addressed and met in a sensitive and humane way, and not, as has been the case in the United States, where mandatory literacy programs have proven to be failures. At the heart of literacy must be recognition by the individual that literacy is a basic human right and responsibility, but the will to acquire it must in fact come from the individual themselves, and cannot be imposed. Indeed, all the submissions-from the workplace, from people who work in prisons, from people who work in schools-have pointed to the fact that, whilst we cannot overcome the actual disadvantages of people's backgrounds, we must ensure that they do not continue to be barriers to the work of literacy. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why I say to this House, and to other honourable members, that it is important to create an environment in which literacy, the teaching of literacy and the value of literacy are prized by the community as a whole and are seen as a worthwhile and valuable part of our society. Literacy will mean that our productivity will increase, people will be able to get jobs, people will be kept out of prison, young truants will be kept off the street and the level of assistance within social welfare can be lessened. So as a community we will all gain from this. </PARA>
<PARA> May I also say that I enjoyed the very healthy debate which occurred within the Committee. I can only hope that this report will ensure that the debate is taken out into the wider community, that it is taken to the Australian Education Council, and that the kinds of issues which were raised within our debate will continue to be discussed widely so that literacy is very much on the agenda for all people in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I also record my thanks to Bronwen Worthington, who has in many ways put up with a great deal of discussion and dissension, but we have always respected her. I recommend this report to everybody here in the hope that as we pursue the frontiers of equity, literacy becomes a central cornerstone for that and that Australia as a whole and the Australian work place will gain in the long run. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the 90 seconds remaining I want to comment on what the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) said. I am disappointed that he cast aspersions on the motives of those who signed the dissenting report. His comments should be put in the context of his own background, which he said was as a former primary teacher and as a former Teachers Federation functionary. If the truth hurts that is bad luck, but if the cap fits he should wear it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The dissenting report actually emphasises the need for monitoring and testing literacy skills. It also underlines the importance of teacher training in literacy teaching. If teachers are not taught or enabled to teach reading and other literacy skills effectively, it will become a matter of the blind leading the blind. </PARA>
<PARA> The minority report emphasises the importance, in our view, of ensuring that the very real problem that we have recognised is not being perpetuated in schools. In my view there was plenty of evidence put before the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training that gave us the impression that we may be allowing the problem to be perpetuated in schools. This is not in any sense teacher bashing, because I am sure that the vast majority of teachers will recognise the importance of their having the right skills and the right methodology to be able to teach literacy effectively so that children leaving school these days are entirely literate and thus able to take an active role in the work force and contribute to the very real need that we have in Australia to increase the productivity of the work force. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House for the opportunity to continue my remarks. The report of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, entitled Islands in the Sun-The Legal Regimes of Australia's External Territories and the Jervis Bay Territory, was tabled, as members will recall, by the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) in a debate in this chamber last week. It is a report which addresses the legal regimes applicable to a number of Australia's external territories. I wanted to say a few words about particular aspects of several of them. In my opening remarks I addressed the report in general. I commend to the Government the recommendations included in the report and set out in the introductory speech of the honourable member for Denison.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The particular territories that this report addresses include the Ashmore and Cartier islands, Christmas Island, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, the Coral Sea islands territory, the Jervis Bay Territory and Norfolk Island. In my few minutes this morning I am obviously not going to be able to address each of them in detail. I really wanted to continue the remarks I had opened on. </PARA>
<PARA> Last week I spoke about the economy of these Territories. This report affecting the legislation and the legal regimes of the islands does not per se involve the decision or resolution of the problems of the economy of those islands. I think, however, it is important that it be understood that unless there is a proper and clear definition of the law that is to apply, the capacity to resolve the very fragile economies of each is going to be somewhat less. </PARA>
<PARA> As I remarked on the last occasion I spoke, we recommended-and certainly this is my view-that Ashmore and Cartier islands should be immediately handed over to the Northern Territory. The Territory of Jervis Bay is an anachronism because it was set up as a port for the Australian Capital Territory when the Territory was first established. That is quite transparently not necessary now. I believe it should therefore become part of New South Wales and there are recommendations in the report about that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Coral Sea Islands Territory is in a slightly different category, but generally it seems that the laws of Queensland should apply there. In looking at the economy and how the laws should apply, it is essential that there be some certainty, some predictability, as to what law in the commercial, civil and criminal instances can be referred to and the complexities if that is not allowed. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly there are difficulties with the economy of the Christmas and Cocos Territories. In my view, tourism is probably the most convenient vehicle, yet there will be enormous problems for the future. Unless we realise the particular nature and character of the social difficulties of the islands, the economics will be harder to resolve. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to spend my time talking not so much about the economics as about the separate Territories and what I see as some of the problems of the politics of those separate Territories. I turn first to Christmas Island, which is a fragile, beautiful island in the Indian Ocean. The people there have largely settled from either Malaysia or Singapore, and the nature and character of the history of the islands, which is set down in the report, explains something of the circumstances of the law and how the people came to be there. </PARA>
<PARA> Last week I condemned the proposal for a casino there not because I am against casinos per se but because there seems to be some belief that a casino will resolve the problems of the island. Frankly, I do not think it will. I think we need to address the problem of how to attract tourists there in a little more rational way than we have. We need to recognise that air services are not particularly convenient. It would be far better, for example, if there were more frequent flights from either Western Australia or Singapore. Certainly it would help if there were through-flights. That is an aspect that I would like to see addressed, because if we can overcome that problem of the people on the island, then it will all fit in together. </PARA>
<PARA> Within Christmas Island there are difficulties. Our recommendation is that eventually there might be capacity to make Christmas island part of Western Australia. There is quite an affiliation there. It is a Territory that feels itself closer to Western Australia than to any other part of Australia, but above all the recommendations with respect to the changes of law are essential, critical and urgent. I would say to this Government that, unless it is prepared to accept those changes with respect to the legal regime on Christmas Island, there is a real problem for the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The Cocos (Keeling) area is a fascinating part of the Indian Ocean. Again there are enormous problems. I think people do not understand the difficulties of tourists in a closed environment. If one has a look at the yachties and their use of Direction Island, where it was considered that a tourist development should proceed, one sees that no doubt difficulties would arise. We need to permit recognition of the fact that the nature of Cocos is not just one island, and that the two main islands, Home Island and West Island, are different in character and in population. Then there is North Keeling, which, as the honourable member for Denison said, badly needs urgent treatment to preserve and protect its very fragile environment. I would strongly recommend to the Government that it take up our Committee's recommendations in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned not only about the position of the Cocos Malays on the island, however, and the right to vote of people on West Island; I am concerned also about the position of the Clunies-Ross family. It is important that, above all, in trying to overcome the cost to Australia of providing the services for the Cocos group, we understand there are obligations on us also to provide some certainty in the law. That essentially is what this report seeks to address. </PARA>
<PARA> But the island I want to spend most time on in my few remarks this morning is Norfolk. I think all of us respect the history of the Pitcairners, the pride they have in their traditions and the their undoubted feeling that they are different. Several asserted to us that they did not really want to be Australians. That might be all very well, but, as far as I am concerned, as I said in my opening remarks the other week, I think Australia looks on these islands not as Territories, but as part of Australia. If Norfolk, Cocos, Christmas and the other Territories are part of Australia, we have to approach them in that way. If they are part of Australia, then I am afraid that I believe that the recommendations we have made, which suggest that only Australian citizens should have a right to vote on the islands in due course and that the Islanders should have an option to vote in an electorate in Australia, are steps that I see as essential to allow them that right as Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is equally important that we say to the Norfolk Islanders that we respect their desire and right for self-government. Nothing in our report denies them that right. What we seek, however, is to provide that connection between their Australian identity and their Pitcairner heritage. Of course, they will remain Pitcairners. </PARA>
<PARA> My wife, who is a Lord Howe Islander, would strongly assert her right to be a Lord Howe Islander beyond being an Australian. Being realistic, the same thing applies to Norfolk Islanders. Of course they can be Pitcairners; they can be Norfolk Islanders-but as Norfolk Islanders they are Australian citizens. I think it is important that we understand that difference. Self-government, yes, but within the operation of that self-government there are differences and difficulties according to the perspective of the people concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> There are expatriates working on the Island who say, `We are working here. We have lived here for two years and we are still not entitled to a vote'. There are those who say, `The Pitcairners run the Island'. Those people who are Pitcairners say, `We have a right. Queen Victoria gave us a guaranteed land grant that would give us a unique status'. I say to them that this is 1991. We are looking towards the twenty-first century. We are trying to see how and in what way we can protect them and their interests, their legal obligations and their economic and social development and ensure that we do not draw down a blind by shutting them off from Australia in some way-which I believe would happen if some of their recommendations were to be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say, therefore, that while I support totally the idea of their self-government, I commend to them the idea of a continued relationship with the evolution of laws in Australia. When I last spoke I suggested that perhaps the laws of New South Wales were more applicable than those of the Australian Capital Territory. But whatever, it will be for the Legislative Assembly of Norfolk Island to determine that. </PARA>
<PARA> There are aspects within that administration that worry me. I find it quite unacceptable that the President of the Legislative Assembly should also be an employee of that Assembly. Of course, that would be prevented in our Federal Parliament. We all know that a person cannot hold two offices of profit under the Crown. He may not even be paid and I might be doing him a wrong by suggesting that he is being paid for both of those offices, but in my view he cannot be in the position of being the President of the Assembly and also its employee. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is urgent that the Government change the appropriate ordinance or regulation or legislation to ensure that that cannot continue. Let me make it clear: I am not saying that he should not stand for the Assembly or that he should not be President. I am saying that when he is he must forgo his employment within the Assembly, for to be its employee creates, I think, an unacceptable conflict of interest which really does not give confidence to the people of the island territory that they are being administered in the way they should. </PARA>
<PARA> In all, I believe that this is a very good report. I commend the honourable member for Denison and the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) for their roles in its preparation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which is before the House, recommends a number of actions in respect of a number of Territories. Two of those Territories have what I would say are populations of reasonably significant size and a number are virtually unpopulated or are unpopulated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Norfolk Island has achieved, by way of the Norfolk Island Act 1979, virtually a constitutional arrangement by law of this Parliament which sets it aside from all other parts of Australia in that its form of government does not include the application of the great majority of laws-including taxation laws-of this Parliament. It is treated as a separate and different entity. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true that Queen Victoria made land grants to Pitcairners when it became apparent that they could not continue to reside on Pitcairn Island. There is legal argument, which will never be resolved, that those land grants also granted to Pitcairners the island itself and its sovereignty. During our two visits to the island in the course of this inquiry a small number of people on that Island did not do justice to the island or its inhabitants and sought, I think in a rather adolescent way, to create difficulties that did not, should not and do not exist between Australia and Norfolk Island. </PARA>
<PARA> The major point of this report, from my point of view-and I have had the privilege of being the Minister responsible for these islands-is the recommendations in respect of Cocos and Christmas islands. I have to acknowledge that when I was Minister I was unable to get any movement on the provision and drafting of laws, particularly for Christmas Island but also for Cocos Island. There were always other priorities for the draftsmen. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation on Christmas Island is particularly significant and the recommendations of this inquiry point to the urgency of the problem. In recent times, there have been two major criminal trials in that area. In each case the presiding judge has indicated the totally unsatisfactory nature of the law which applies to that island. Australia assumed responsibility for the administration of Christmas Island-the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) bought Cocos Island at a later date-in 1958. </PARA>
<PARA> Previously, it had been administered under the British administration of Singapore. The law which applied to Christmas Island at that time was entrenched in the Australian acceptance legislation and still is. The law which applied in Singapore in 1958 is quite irrelevant to the 1990s. Its standards, the norms, the application of law and the attitude of individuals to what is and what is not acceptable behaviour have changed totally. The law also reflects a colonial regime where certain laws were in fact drafted to meet the convenience of the British administration of Singapore. They have no relevance whatsoever to Christmas Island or, for that matter, Cocos Island where to some extent they now apply. </PARA>
<PARA> Fortunately, to this stage Cocos has not had a serious crime. Therefore, the status of the law has never come into question. But in Christmas Island it has come into question. There has been a murder trial; there have been drug trials. In each case, the law was not only unsatisfactory but also unavailable. There is, to my knowledge, only one copy of the statutes as they apply to Christmas Island on Christmas Island. That can be inspected at the Administrator's office. There is no body of case law which has evolved from the original law because Singapore has changed its status and law and no longer has any practising law which is relevant to Christmas Island. It makes its own laws. Judges have made it clear that the law is unsatisfactory, unworkable, and inaccessible to those people who are expected to abide by it. I think that if one turned the pages of the copy of the law that is available, they would probably crack. </PARA>
<PARA> This report recommends urgent treatment to bring Christmas Island within the ambit of the laws of Western Australia as an immediate measure. It also recommends that Christmas Island and Cocos Island come under the control of Western Australia, but that is probably a longer term process. The first recommendation is urgent and can be, and should be, dealt with as a matter of urgency. When I was Minister, because there were certain difficulties with the Timor Gap and negotiations on borders, workers compensation, et cetera, with respect to oil drilling off Ashmore and Cartier Islands, it was possible to put application laws for Ashmore and Cartier through this Parliament very quickly. They did not actually get proclaimed, but they were put through this Parliament in a matter of weeks. A similar solution, even if only temporary, to apply to Western Australia law is and has been available for some considerable time. Modifications would have to be made. But at least there would be a current body of law which is living law, which has been ruled on by judges, which is being tested every day and which is available, including the case form of the law to those people to whom it applies and those people who must participate in that jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the report covers a lot of ground and makes a lot of important recommendations. I have to say that, whilst I believe that Norfolk Island has achieved a degree of self-government far beyond that of any other Australian territory-it is economically viable, it is a place where the difficulty is getting to live on the island rather than finding a way of leaving it-like all of the islands, there are problems with health services and with continuing education, particularly for young people whose families do not have significant income. Australia should look at giving some assistance to ensure that such services are available. But those are problems which also exist in every small isolated community in Australia. They are not problems that can be overcome by any form of government or statute. They are problems which I believe we have an obligation to deal with. </PARA>
<PARA> The status of the law on Norfolk Island is being maintained by this report. People are being given the option, if they so desire, to enrol and vote-this has been recommended-in an Australian electorate. As we have final control over the island and could, in fact, repeal the Norfolk Island Act tomorrow, that is not unreasonable. I do not think that a great number of people will exercise that right, but it is a right which should and will be available if the terms of the report are adopted. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not agree with the proposition which was put by some, almost to the point of hysteria, that Australia should say to Norfolk Island, `You are totally independent, with some association with Australia'-which is difficult to understand or comprehend-`and you may go your own way. You may ignore all the international covenants which Australia has entered into which set out the rights of people. You may determine your own foreign policy, defence policy and all of those things which go with independence'. Norfolk Island is a small island. It is a well governed island but there are very serious problems. That will be the case in any small community. It is impossible to avoid them. But it is a territory of Australia. It operates under the Norfolk Island Act and I do not believe that is likely to change in the foreseeable future. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the report to the House and I ask the Government to deal specifically with the laws of Christmas Island and Cocos Island as a matter of absolute urgency. The present situation is a disgrace to Australia and, while nothing is done, it will remain so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the Flags Amendment Bill 1991. In presenting this Bill again, on behalf of the Liberal Party and the National Party of Australia, I remind all honourable members that this is the fourth time since 1985 that the coalition has introduced this Bill into the Parliament. I also remind honourable members that a similar Bill was introduced into the Senate by my colleague Senator Durack in February 1985. That Bill was passed unanimously by the Senate. The challenge here is for the Government to take up what is in this Bill and allow it to be passed through this chamber. Thus we will ensure that the Australian flag cannot be changed without a referendum of the people. It is as simple as that. The Bill is not seeking any changes to the flag or anything complex like that. It purely and simply allows the people of Australia to have a say in maintaining the flag and ensures that, if at some stage in the future people want to change the flag, it will be a democratic decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the reasons the Opposition is keen to see this Bill pass through the House is that it has always had some suspicion about the Australian Labor Party (ALP). I think that suspicion is well founded because until 1988 the Labor Party had in its platform a recommendation to get rid of the Australian flag and to replace it with something else. For this reason, we feel that it should not be allowed to get away with trying to sneak something through. It should be forced to face all Australians if any attempt is to be made to change the flag. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that in 1988 the Australian Labor Party just dropped that recommendation off its platform. Although it seems that the recommendation is no longer part of its platform, the Labor Party has not to date shown its willingness to allow this Bill to be passed through this chamber so that we can ensure that the Australian flag will not be changed without the choice going to all Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> All Australians are very proud of our flag. We only have to look at the pride with which people fly it and the fact that we all realise how much history is steeped in the flag. If one looks at any community poll, one will find that there is overwhelming support for the present Australian flag. For this reason, the Liberal and National parties are very keen to see that that support is allowed to be reflected in a referendum. On the other hand, if anyone would like to make any changes, we are keen to ensure a referendum occurs before those changes are allowed to be made. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, as I said, this is the fourth attempt since 1985 by the coalition parties to have this Bill accepted by the chamber. I therefore urge the Labor Party to demonstrate the sincerity of its claimed support for the Australian flag by allowing the Bill to go through. Otherwise, we will continue to harbour the suspicion that, although the ALP has removed the part of its platform where it wants to change the Australian flag, on the back of the agenda there are some people who would like to change it. For that reason, I urge the Government to support this Bill and, when it comes up for debate again, I hope that this time we can actually say `fourth time lucky'. I also hope we will see that, like the Senate, the House of Representatives is prepared to support a Bill which will ensure that all Australians will have a say in what sort of flag we have in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have this opportunity to outline a Bill which I would like this House to consider. In 1983 one of this chamber's more unforgettable members, Mick Young, as a Minister in the first Hawke Government, moved a motion to set up the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Reform. In his speech to this House he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>As I have said publicly, the laws that will be brought into this Parliament and approved by this Government will mean that if the conservative parties of this country get 50 per cent of the vote plus one they will be the government, but if the Labor Party gets 50 per cent plus one, it will be the Government. That is the way it ought to be. </PARA>
<PARA>Those words were spoken by an Australian Labor Party Cabinet Minister who was elected to this House after having served as Federal Secretary and Campaign Director of the Australian Labor Party. But Mick Young left this House without carrying out his promise. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill I wish to see carried with the support of the Government and the Opposition will reform our electoral law in accordance with Mick Young's commitment. The Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill will require that the redistribution committees, when redrawing boundaries of House of Representatives divisions in any State, will ensure that as far as practicable any political party or political group whose candidates obtain more than 50 per cent of the votes in that State will win a majority of the seats in that State. The Bill will introduce a fairness test into the redistribution process. The former colleague of honourable members of the Government put it succinctly when he said, `That is the way it ought to be'. Yet eight years have elapsed since he promised legislation to achieve what ought to be. </PARA>
<PARA> I have the support of the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia to introduce this Bill. I now call upon the Labor Party to support it. It is of course possible that, unlike Mick Young, members of the Government today do not have the same sense of fair play. Perhaps it is because they do not really believe that it is `the way it ought to be'. Has it yet dawned on them that their electors might turn them out of office at the next election? If so, honourable members opposite may want to be assured that, if at some time in the future they again poll 50 per cent plus one of the two party preferred vote, they will win government, for, as Mick Young said, `That is the way it ought to be'. </PARA>
<PARA> If the representation in Parliament is to truly reflect the wishes of the people, the boundaries of any State should be drawn in a way that is truly sensitive to the electorate's opinion as expressed through the ballot box. One of the criteria which the electoral commissioners are required to apply when redrawing boundaries prohibits malapportionment. It imposes upon them the responsibility of ensuring that, as far as practicable, the number of electors in each electorate at a specified time are equal. </PARA>
<PARA> But the criteria do not prohibit the practice of gerrymandering. Giving each elector's vote equal weight in electing a member of parliament does not guarantee that each elector's vote has equal weight in electing a government. Redistribution commissioners are not at present required to ensure that government is comprised of members with a combined vote in excess of 50 per cent plus one of the total vote. To achieve one vote one value on a nationwide basis as well as on an electorate-wide basis, gerrymandering as well as malapportionment must be prohibited. </PARA>
<PARA> Malapportionment occurs where the number of electors in each electorate diverge from the State-wide average number of electors per division. The term `gerrymander' describes practices aimed at the manipulation of divisional boundaries to secure a disproportionate influence for some party or group of candidates. Under a gerrymander, the electoral divisions can comprise equal numbers of electorates, but the boundaries are drawn in such a way as to concentrate one party's votes in as few seats as possible while spreading the dependable majorities of another party over as many as seats as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> There is nothing in the Electoral Act 1918 which prohibits premeditated or inadvertent gerrymandering of boundaries. Although electoral commissioners are expected to be politically impartial, the paradox is that they cannot do their job fairly without having some regard to voting patterns. The legislation I wish to introduce is designed to require electoral commissioners to apply a fairness test to electoral boundaries because `this is the way it ought to be'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The motion before the House concerning security and cooperation in East Asia and the Pacific bears reading again because of the period of time which has elapsed since the beginning of the debate. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>That, in view of the recent dramatic improvement in the global strategic environment and of the importance of facilitating extension of those improved conditions to the East Asia and Pacific regions, this House supports the establishment of a Conference on Security and Cooperation in East Asia and the Pacific to increase collective security . . . and steps towards disarmament. </PARA>
<PARA> The turmoil, trauma and tragedy of the Gulf war has underlined the fragility of peaceful relationships around the world in the absence of the countervailing influence of the super powers and the comparative stability of regional agreements of some kind on matters of security and trade. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable members will recall that this motion was first discussed on 11 October last year at which time the mover, the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), spoke concerning the arrangements pertaining to the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, and he argued the importance of establishing a similar mechanism for the achievement of mutual security understanding within the region of East Asia and the Pacific, of which Australia is, of course, a part. In his contribution to the debate at that time, the honourable member for Fraser said that a number of nations in the region had indicated their interest in some such proposal. For instance, Indonesia had advocated a South East Asia nuclear free zone and a zone of peace, freedom and neutrality. This is clearly support for a similar type of proposal for part of the region. Malaysia also has explicitly called for confidence building measures in the region. </PARA>
<PARA> In the same debate, the comments of the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Darling) were particularly apt and almost foreseeing. She said:</PARA>
<PARA>It is surely not pessimistic but an inescapable reality to observe that no sooner does one war exhausted region slump into an uneasy truce than another conflict is being conceived to take its place in the fabric or culture of war.</PARA>
<PARA>Sadly, her forebodings were followed by the outbreak of conflict in the Gulf. Whatever the form and forum advocated, the goal of an Asian-Pacific security conference should be to increase mutual trust between the countries in the region. We have to start the process for a lasting peace somewhere. Why not here; why not now; and why not via this type of vehicle for dialogue and better understanding? Already our region has had its share of conflicts. We do not want any more. Consequently, the negotiation of confidence building measures, as suggested by Malaysia, would be an essential initial task to any such undertaking. </PARA>
<PARA> Concern has already been expressed in this House and elsewhere about the fact that some of our neighbour nations were annoyed with Australia's decision to become involved in the Gulf blockade without reference to them. Given the coincidence of interests in the region, under most circumstances such complaints might have been seen to have some validity. Certainly, it is possible that our failure to consult or examine the possibility of a regional response may have damaged our standing to some degree and tarnished our ability to intercede on other matters in our vicinity which may require Australia's involvement from time to time in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I am personally hopeful that Australia's standing as an honest broker in the region has not been irretrievably diminished by our involvement in the Gulf. I do confess to some concern over Malaysia's decision to downgrade its relationship with Australia in recent days. Perceived racism could be the cause of this change. Certainly, much discussion has occurred in Malaysia about the racial attitudes of Australians in recent times, and this comment echoes similar misgivings in other Asian countries and should signal a warning to those who would wish to advance the causes of friendship and trade with our regional neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA> Allegations of racism have become more prevalent of late. I give as an example the Tan case where the widow Tan's comments made the Asian news. She was indicating to the people of the region that she felt Australia still had a very severe racial discrimination problem. Whilst I would dispute that, I think that her comments may well have been taken to heart by some of the nations in the area. The World Council of Churches attention to the problems of Australian Aborigines could also have had a negative impact in our region in the context of such perceived racism. </PARA>
<PARA> The type of conference that is being proposed in the motion moved by the honourable member for Fraser would assist us as a nation to overcome problems such as these and to talk through obvious difficulties or misconceptions. It is hoped that trade and security would be the outcome of such a conference. I do not know whether other members have received a letter recently from the Psychologists for the Prevention Of War, but I have and, in the context of the suggested conference, I think it is worth making the points that this organisation has made in a couple of the paragraphs. It says:</PARA>
<PARA> Press reports and statements by political leaders in the months leading up to the present Middle East war strongly suggest that existing scientific knowledge about conflict resolution was not used by either side during that time; examples include inflammatory rhetoric by both sides, the apparent lack of willingness to consider all issues raised by the other side and the confusion of talk about solutions with talk about issues. </PARA>
<PARA>This is from Dr Ann Sanson, who is the Convener, Psychologists for the Prevention Of War. She further states:</PARA>
<PARA>My colleagues and I have noted over the last few years the application of psychological principles in the reduction of tension between Communist countries and the NATO allies. We are also aware that the apparently secure peace between Egypt and Israel was only reached after many days of painstaking mediation and negotiation at the `Camp David' talks. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been impressed by the psychological soundness and practical usefulness of the Interest-Based Negotiation model, which suggests well-researched strategies to assist the parties in a dispute to go beyond their stated positions to a detailed analysis of the underlying `interests'- (i.e. concerns, needs, wants and fears) of each party. This analysis is followed by creative problem-solving in which solutions fulfilling each party's major interests are developed. </PARA>
<PARA> This model (and others) helps us to understand why the apparently simple goal of `winning' a conflict can often turn out to be the pursuit of a mirage; not only does the winning party usually suffer immediate losses (such as loss of life and property and hostile relations with the losing country and its allies) but the underlying issues are highly unlikely to have been resolved to the satisfaction of both parties and so may arise again in another way on another day. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it is important in the context of this suggested conference to consider those points because, whilst the interest-based negotiation model in this letter is referring to a specific conflict or conflicts, there is nothing to prevent it also being used in the interests of the region's continued harmony; and we do in our part of the world have sometimes a slightly xenophobic attitude to our neighbours-and I obviously do not dismiss the xenophobia of New Zealand in that either. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, I thank the honourable member for Macquarie. I think we do have to consider very seriously that we have quite distinct cultural differences from our neighbours and that this may lead on many occasions to serious misunderstanding which could jeopardise not necessarily the peace of the region but certainly the harmony of the region. I think that in the interests of better understanding, the concept being put to the House by the honourable member for Fraser in this motion is certainly one that we would all be thinking of supporting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I myself have no doubt that the model in Europe has worked very well and, whilst it would be difficult to translate it in its entirety to the east Asian and Pacific region, it would certainly be something that we should consider trying to do. It is not a new idea, obviously, as I said before. There are other nations in the region which have considered such conferences before and I think that Australia should be taking a leading role in achieving some sort of a conference or dialogue on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> In a working paper entitled Increasing Security in the East Asian Pacific Region, delivered to a conference fairly recently by the honourable member for Fraser-I think late last year-he made the following point in the abstract at the front:</PARA>
<PARA>Although the Cold War is now over, there is little sign in the East Asian Pacific region of a reduction in military spending or of an awareness of a collective approach to security. </PARA>
<PARA> He makes the point in the paper that security is not necessarily always defence and that defence has, in a sense, hijacked the agenda on security. Security can be economic security, environmental security or resource security, as we now know in this House-other aspects apart from defence. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, the expenditure on military aims does tend to undermine a nation's attempts to and better the state of its people. Given the poverty or relative poverty of the region itself and the nations that surround us, I would suggest that anything we do as a nation to reduce the emphasis on defence expenditure would be a very substantive step in the right direction towards improving the quality of life of the millions of people in our region. I commend the motion to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a bit disappointing that more time has not been allocated to a debate as important as this one. I hope that more time will be allocated at a later date. Ever since the end of the Cold War in Europe, moves have been made to initiate a mechanism for the reduction of arms in the Asia-Pacific region to allow a process of consultation between the nations in this region. In this debate today a conference similar to the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, the CSCE, is being proposed. It might be called the CSCAP-the conference on security and cooperation in the Asia-Pacific.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) stated in Hansard on 18 October last year that:</PARA>
<PARA>Europe had offered a precedent, since a forum for security measures had existed in Europe since 1973. </PARA>
<PARA>If Europe is able to do it, why not Asia, he implied. Then he went on to elaborate in his debate. A number of speakers-I thought not enough-followed in the debate with different points of view.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I beg your pardon; I am getting mixed up with the Sea Eagles. I would like honourable members to keep in mind the point that the honourable member for Fraser made-if Europe is able to do it, why not Asia?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At a recent conference in Canada-I am not sure of the name of the conference-numerous possibilities in regard to this were discussed, one being: what may be true and good for Europe may not be true and good for the Asia-Pacific region. That was one of the topics on the agenda that received some attention. </PARA>
<PARA> The CSCE was born out of a specific set of circumstances related to European history and political dynamics, and that has to be kept in mind very carefully, as other speakers have mentioned. Furthermore, the CSCE has been the result of painfully slow, hard-headed and often low-key negotiations. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen), mentioned the fact that there are a lot of dissimilarities between the CSCE and what is proposed for the Asia-Pacific area. I agree with her. </PARA>
<PARA> The driving force of the European process has been the knowledge of prosperity and the preservation of a lifestyle unmatched in its history. On the other hand, in the Asia-Pacific region, poverty and ancestral motivations still seem to rule the roost. I well remember a couple of very interesting trips that I have done probably around most of the area that the honourable member for Fraser considers be incorporated in this particular conference. I visited Japan, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Malaysia, Borneo, New Guinea, Bougainville and all the Micronesian islands, from Palau, through Truk and Yap and Ponape and Kosrae, up through the Marshall Islands and down through Wallis and Futuna Islands, Tonga, New Caledonia and most of the Pacific islands. I am able to affirm that the statement I made with regard to the poverty and the ancestral motivations in the Asia-Pacific area underlines a very important limiting consideration on the short term success of a conference such as the one proposed by the honourable member for Fraser. Nevertheless, I think that he has sown the seed and even though we can see tremendous limitations, difficulties and problems occurring, we ought not to sweep that seed away into oblivion. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the Asia-Pacific defence region, which extends from Burma onwards to include east Asia, north Asia, South East Asia, Australia and the presence of the Soviet Union and the United States. There may be some who would be more restrictive with regard to this configuration; however, I ask the question: how can the Asia-Pacific region be compared with Europe, where there is the division of two opposing camps, east and west? We cannot in any way, shape or form bring into our minds or imagination how the Asia-Pacific and Europe can be compared, however reduced the tension that existed in Europe may be. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us not forget that since the end of World War II, Asia has experienced more wars-even though they have been of a limited nature-than the rest of the world. In view of the volatility of this region, it would appear that there is a clear need for some control or possible arms reduction, particularly in the light of the Gulf war and the possibility of a new international order as perceived by Bush and partners. I think a lot of people are talking about the new international order; President Bush talks about it almost every five minutes. People have different understandings of what the new international order is about. A conspiratorial line is taken by a lot of people in terms of their suspicion of what the new world order is all about. They get it confused with the new age movement and so on. We need to be a lot more understanding and we need to find out much more about what the intents and purposes are and what the end results of this new world order might be. </PARA>
<PARA> To achieve a new security arrangement in the Asia-Pacific region, and in view of the ongoing conflicts in the area, either the use of force or arms control or arms reduction would appear to be the answer to the problem. They are three conflicting points that are made there. We can look at this from the point of view of the collective security that we are now seeing exhibited by the United Nations Security Council at last functioning, in terms of what its intended functions were, perhaps for the first time since World War II. The Security Council is now able to function from the point of view of collective security; we have this agreement amongst the allies and amongst the nations of the world to come to grips with the problems that occur in the world-for example, when we have aggressors moving into areas that they have no right to move into, such as we saw in the Gulf conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that time is very limited; I had a lot of other things I would have liked to have said. But perhaps I will end on the note that before we set up another conference with any speed, we ought to bear in mind that we have a situation in the world today where the United Nations Security Council has shown that it can work. This is not just with regard to warfare; it is with respect to all the things that pertain to the capacity of the Security Council. That is something that we really ought to look very hard at, and we should concentrate on ensuring that it is a continuing success, so that all the negotiations that have been associated with this current conflict can be developed in a better way, and perfected, so that the force which needs to be there as an ultimate deterrent is included in the whole parcel of apparent success that the Security Council now enjoys. I end with that particular point that needs to be taken care of with regard to this motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support this motion with a great deal of enthusiasm. I have read all the comments that have been made by other members, and I certainly join with the previous speaker, the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster), in expressing my regret that there is not more time available for this important issue. I have been allocated only a very short time this morning. Because of that I want to say at the outset that I adopt all of the comments made by the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) in his speech in support of the motion. In doing so, to all those people who may be listening and who intend to write to me saying `Why didn't you mention this, that or the other thing?', I say in a pre-emptory fashion, `Please read the speech of the honourable member for Fraser so that you can see that I adopt all of the matters he has dealt with'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to deal with only one point this morning. If I can summarise the difference, such as it is, that has emerged in this debate, it is not about whether we need a conference on security and cooperation in this part of the world; it is really an issue of timing. If such a conference is to occur, when it should occur is the nub of the difference between the various speakers who have contributed. </PARA>
<PARA> I say to the House and to the nation that we should not take time in this Parliament to debate whether such a conference ought to take place and when. We should say, `The idea is a good one, and our Government and our nation ought to join those people of goodwill around the world who will push for such a conference'. In my view, we should not spend time dealing with timing and such issues. We ought to be in a positive frame of mind and in a positive mode, and we ought to say, `This idea has worked in Europe. It has taken a long time. We ought to start the process now. We are back-footed because we did not start it in 1972. That is no reason for us to delay any further'. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to spend the few moments available to me dealing with the question of timing, because the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) and others who have spoken in this debate, such as the honourable member for Warringah (Mr MacKellar), have expressed the view that the timing is not right, for a wide range of reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to go into those issues particularly. We should not concentrate on what have been described as the dissimilarities. We should not say that this will not work here because there is more poverty in the Asia-Pacific region than in Europe. Let me point out that in eastern Europe-in the Second World, as it used to be called, the wrong side of the Iron Curtain-there is a heap of dreadful poverty. I have been to Romania recently. Seeing the poverty there, one could be in any Third World country and feel quite at home with the level of poverty. I think it is a bit of furphy, a bit of a red herring, to see that sort of issue as a problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I have very quickly drawn up a list of the problems that exist in Europe today. This is not an exhaustive list; it is a list of things that come to mind, and I want to deal with it very quickly. If we look at a snapshot of Europe today and at the problems that exist there in spite of the end of the Cold War, we can see that they have patiently overcome or excluded a vast number of those problems from the exercise in order to get the exercise in confidence building going. </PARA>
<PARA> Consider the internal and external problems in southern Europe. The Basque region of Spain has problems of independence or some sort of autonomy. Then there is Ireland: I need say nothing more about that than that an interesting effect of the confidence building has been a subtle but increasing amount of pressure on Britain from external friends to try to find a solution to the Irish question. </PARA>
<PARA> Canada has problems in Quebec. Canada is part of the European Conference on Security and Cooperation. Albania was dealt with quite effectively: it was simply left out of the conference. I do not know whether that was because the Albanians did not want to be part of it, nonetheless, the problem was overcome by that mechanism. Turkey has problems internally with the Kurds and various other groups. There is the problem of the dispute between Greece and Turkey over Cyprus. Cyprus itself is a country, of course. But those problems did not stop this process from getting under way in Europe. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there is Yugoslavia, with all of the problems that exist internally, and some externally in relation to Greece and the Macedonian question. I have mentioned Romania in terms of poverty, but I also mention it in terms of the continuing problems of the Hungarian minority. In Czechoslovakia there are problems between the Slovaks and the Czechs. Then there is the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. In the time available I will not say anything further about it except that there are so many problems there that, in proportion, the problems of Asia look as if they are almost manageable. Spain and the United Kingdom are having a continuing debate over Gibraltar. Many problems in Europe have been overcome or have not been allowed to stand in the way of this process of building confidence. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to run very quickly through the issues that might arise in our part of the world. They include Fiji and democracy; the role of France in the Pacific; the border between Papua New Guinea and Indonesia; for Papua New Guinea, the problem of Bougainville; Timor; the Celebes and the problem of the liberation movement; Cambodia; China and Vietnam; China and the Soviet Union; Japan, the Soviet Union and the northern territories; internal problems in the Philippines; Taiwan and all the problems associated with it; North Korea and South Korea; and the United States and Micronesia. </PARA>
<PARA> Even though these problems are great and many, when we compare the overall situation in the Asia-Pacific region with the situation in Europe in 1972 when the process started, I believe that our problems in this part of the world pale to insignificance. We ought to get such a conference going at an early date. It is not a case of simply saying, `Before we go off to another conference, we should do something'. We ought to get this conference going, and at an early date. Australia ought to play a prominent role in pursuing and pushing the idea that this conference ought to get going in our part of the world to ensure that we have the same security and cooperation procedures as are available in other parts of the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this House:</PARA>
<PARA>(1) impresses on the Government that the lack of appropriate resource security legislation is holding back urgently needed resource development projects; and</PARA>
<PARA>(2) requests the Government to introduce appropriate resource security legislation as a matter of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA>I bring forward this motion because of the way in which the Government has mishandled the whole of the resource security debate. On Tuesday we heard the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) foreshadowing that the Government intended to introduce so-called resource security legislation, but I put it to the House that, on the notice given by the Prime Minister, the legislation that the Government intends to introduce will be totally inappropriate. It will not assist urgently needed resource development projects in Australia and in fact it will lead to a greater shambles for resource security projects than we have seen in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> I guess the role model for mishandled resource security projects is the Wesley Vale project, but from my view of the projected legislation foreshadowed by the Prime Minister the Government would produce an even worse shambles for each prospective project than we saw with the Wesley Vale project. I am not alone in this view. In fact I am supported by the present Treasurer (Mr Keating). I wish to quote from an article which appeared in the Australian Financial Review of last Friday, 8 March, written by Geoff Kitney:</PARA>
<PARA> Federal Cabinet's gruelling battle to reach agreement on resource security legislation will produce a result which will institutionalise a wider `green' influence into government decision-making and could have disastrous consequences for industry. </PARA>
<PARA> But this will be achieved at the cost of a loss of the Government's credibility with the environmental movement because it will be seen as a breach of commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> This startling assessment of the Government's proposals for a new system of resource security-which is being widely seen as a major victory for development over the environment-was given by the Federal Treasurer, Mr Keating, during Federal Cabinet discussions this week. </PARA>
<PARA> Although involved in an alliance with the pro-environment ministers, Mr Keating's position in the Cabinet discussions has been characterised as pro-green and by some of his ministerial colleagues as being driven by his leadership ambitions. </PARA>
<PARA> But it has now become clear that Mr Keating believes the proposed resource security legislation is misguided and will make the process of industry gaining government approvals for new projects even more tortuous. </PARA>
<PARA>I fully agree with the conclusion reached by the Treasurer. The legislation proposed by the Government is totally inappropriate, and it will make resource security development even more tortuous, even more difficult, than has been the case in the past. I would like to expand on that just a little. </PARA>
<PARA> We saw in the Wesley Vale experience that the company, North Broken Hill Peko Ltd, invested in excess of $20m in order to develop plans and research to come up with the proposal for the development, only to have the project rejected despite the fact that it had come up with the cleanest and most environmentally sound pulp mill development ever seen. It would have set new standards for pulp mill development right around the world. Despite that, the Government rejected it. It rejected this proposal for one reason only-to garner votes for the forthcoming election. It wanted to keep the votes of the green lobby on side, so for purely political reasons it rejected the proposal.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is now proposing that each new development project will definitely become another Wesley Vale because each project and the resources required for it will be assessed on a case by case basis. Each project will become a political battleground, with the environmental lobby and the development lobby coming to even greater loggerheads than has been the case in the past. That political battleground will occur at both State and Federal levels because complementary legislation will be passed by both levels of government. </PARA>
<PARA> On the assumption that a developer can finally have its project approved by governments at both State and Federal level after there has been an intense political battle, even after that process we would then have a situation where there would be court action. Because legislation would be on the statute books at both State and Federal level, it would open the way for court action to be taken by those opposing any resource development project. That was not available in the case of Wesley Vale, but in future it would be. One would assume that if there is complementary legislation on the statute books at both State and Federal level, the court action would be required at High Court level. That is a very expensive and tortuous process, but that is what the Government intends introducing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's proposal is not designed to get urgently needed resource development projects under way. It is not designed to stimulate the Australian economy or to help get our balance of payments into better shape. The Government is now attempting to hold electoral support from both the environmental movement and the development lobby. It is trying to have a foot in both camps by saying, `Here it is, fellas; we are going to put resource security legislation on the statute books and it will allow resource development projects to proceed'. But at the same time it is going to give the green lobby, the environmental lobby, even greater access to involvement in Government decision making, and it will give it even more capacity to oppose resource development projects. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government cannot have it both ways. Either it is going to support resource development projects and lay down the guidelines required for such development, or it is not. At the moment it is trying to have a foot in both camps. I put it to the House that we urgently need the Government to lay down the guidelines required for resource developments so that potential developers can know with certainty what government requirements will be. </PARA>
<PARA> Having laid down those guidelines-which should include environmental standards, foreign investment and export guidelines, and all of those factors-it should then be incumbent not only on the developers but also on the Government and all of the lobby groups to comply with those guidelines. That would give some certainty to potential developers that simply does not exist at the moment. It has not existed in the past and there will certainly be no certainty under the Government's proposed legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I am being followed in this debate by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow), who has a keen interest in this matter because a pulp mill has been suggested for his electorate. I suggest to the honourable member that if he is giving support to the legislation proposed by the Government he is about to turn his electorate into another Wesley Vale. There will be a proposal coming forward in due course for a development of the timber resources in his electorate, and if he supports this legislation he is opening the way for his electorate to become a political battleground in the same way that my electorate became a battleground over Wesley Vale. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no certainty under this proposal that other urgently needed projects-such as Coronation Hill and the development of our uranium resources, or any other type of development-will proceed. It simply turns them into a political battleground. I put it to the House that if the environmental lobby were serious about trying to raise the standards of our environment, to raise the level of our environmental protection, improve the cleanness of our waters and air in Australia, it ought not be opposing this type of resource development. It should in fact concentrate its mind on those industries that already exist in Australia, where environmental standards have been laid down but those existing industries have been given exemption by State governments so that they do not have to comply with those standards. </PARA>
<PARA> If the environmental movement was fair dinkum in trying to clean up the Australian environment, it is that type of thing it should concentrate on. We have not heard from the environmental movement complaining about the standards of sewage disposal into the ocean, into the coastal areas around Australia, but surely that is a much more important issue than simply trying to stop a few trees being cut down and subsequently replanted. We have not heard from the environmental movement about the urgency of improving soil degradation in Australia. Nor have we heard about any proposal to reduce hydrocarbons being put into the air, particularly around our cities in Australia. What the environmental movement has concentrated on is a political campaign to try to stop development, to try to stop investment in this country, and to try to stop jobs from being created. </PARA>
<PARA> I put it to the House that the proposal that is now being brought forward by the Government will not arrest that campaign by the environmental movement, but rather the Government is playing into their hands. I strongly urge this House to reject the proposals being brought forward by the Government, and to tell the Government to go back to the drawing board and to come up with appropriate guidelines and appropriate proposals for resource security development. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whilst I do not oppose the motion forthrightly, I do not see the motion as particularly appropriate in view of the fact that the Government is prepared to legislate as soon as possible to achieve the sorts of outcomes that the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr) has described. He described the legislation that has been proposed as a shambles, as totally inappropriate. Why did the National Association of Forest Industries not call it a shambles? Why did the National Association of Forest Industries not say that it was inappropriate? It said that it was appropriate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable member indicates a problem that the Opposition, particularly the Liberal Party, has in this place-where we have hardly heard a word from it on the forest industry. The only word we have heard is from honourable members from Tasmania. There has been no support for the timber industry or for considered resource development from the Liberal Party in particular, or even from the National Party of Australia. We have heard very little in this place. We have seen the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) try to have two bob each way. We have had very little at all from the Opposition on the forest industry. </PARA>
<PARA> It is this Government which has been doing all the work on the forest industry for the past eight years, while the other side has just been sitting back and doing nothing. We are trying to make sure there is a green input. The honourable member for Lyons talks about this legislation institutionalising a green input. Why not? It was necessary for the Gordon below Franklin; it has been necessary for the Great Barrier Reef; it has been necessary on matters of coastal development. Why not institutionalise a green input? After all, if we are not going to be concerned about the environment, we certainly are showing no concern for our children, for our grandchildren, and for people living into the next century. It is very important that we institutionalise a green input.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Lyons talked about Wesley Vale. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Kerin) would not have rejected it in his own mind unless there were good reasons for doing so. The Wesley Vale proposal was not the cleanest that we could have, and it did not give us the new standards that we needed. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy was concerned about the fishing industry, for instance. There were fishermen in Tasmania who were concerned about the future of the fishing industry with the standards that were to be adopted by the Wesley Vale proposal. So it was, and is, continually important to have a green input, and I do not mind it being institutionalised. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member opposite said the legislation is not designed to get urgently needed projects under way. It is stated clearly in the Government's statement that the Government is prepared to legislate as soon as possible to achieve the outcome, and it is doing that through a five-stage program. That is why, in the south-eastern forests, for instance, we should see pine timber that is now lying around in the forests, waiting to rot or waiting to be burned, being chipped, perhaps at a mill in Eden. So there is an opportunity for us to add value here in Australia, and to stop that rot, to stop the pine plantations-in some cases up to 50, 60 or even 70 per cent of them-being covered with fallen timber that is not being used at all because it is not suitable for sawmilling. The legislation is certainly designed to get urgently needed projects like that under way. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation is designed to ensure that sawmills, knowing their security, can develop towards better equipment in their sawmills so they can utilise the timber better and send less to the woodchip industry. It is designed so that we can pulp here in Australia. There may well not be a pulp mill in Eden; it may be a pulp mill in Orbost; it may be an extension of the Maryvale pulp mill in Victoria. Certainly we can pulp more in Australia instead of exporting our woodchips, relatively cheaply in comparison, overseas. In other words, we can add value here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> We can work towards a recovery mill so that timber which is at present being chipped can be recovered. There will be added value in south-eastern New South Wales, and there will be added value in Tasmania. It will be done in a way which will assist the environment. I would say to the people who are thinking about the action taken by the Field Government in Tasmania in conjunction with this legislation, the action being taken by the Federal Government, the action being taken by the Victorian Government, that we will ensure that we have a sustainable timber industry which looks at all the environmental concerns-water catchments, flora and fauna and the danger of fires. I do not mind Eden-Monaro being a battleground if we are looking at a pulp mill in Eden. So it ought to be if fish are going to be hurt. All the questions ought to be asked. This is part of democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> The people in Tasmania voted for the first time decisively for greens-farmers included-and against a conservative government, because they knew that Wesley Vale was not a satisfactory proposal. The solution of the honourable member for Lyons is to lay down guidelines for resource development. That is what has been done. Have we not been through it for the last eight to ten years? There was an environmental impact statement by the industry; we have had studies done by the New South Wales and Tasmanian Governments; we have had Federal studies; there was a joint scientific study in the south-east region with environmental scientists, foresters and others all joining to come up with that proposal; and now we have public servants in forestry areas in both levels of government laying down the guidelines for resource development. Surely we have done enough. We have kept the industry waiting long enough. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to pass the legislation that is being proposed to ensure that we can add value here in Australia. We need to adopt the five-stage program that was outlined in the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke): a commitment to legislate; a forest conservation and development process; an integrated Commonwealth-State assessment of environment, heritage, cultural, social and economic issues designed to identify and resolve, prior to the commencement of a project, as many policy impediments as possible; a Commonwealth-State agreement ratified by the respective governments to define the project and its associated resources, as finally agreed, to incorporate and to provide for certain related matters along the lines indicated. That agreement would include a whole range of important points among its provisions. The final stage is to identify the wood supply catchment area; the best estimate of volume; forest management prescriptions; periodic review of the operation of management; environmental protection practices; safeguards to accommodate major unforeseeable contingencies-that is important-and provision to ensure that where there is agreement to remove any area from that previously available the lost resource will be made good. </PARA>
<PARA> We are at last telling an industry, we are at last telling people who are paying off mortgages and we are at last telling people who have only one job skill-perhaps in a sawmill industry-that they have a secure industry. Is it not high time that we legislated for that? I am very pleased that the Government has decided to support the industry and the environment through the proposed resource security legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on this motion put forward by my colleague the honourable member for Lyons (Mr Burr), because this is a very important issue facing Australia today. At the start I want to go straight to the heart of the issue. This is all about trust. We would not have had this resource security legislation coming into the Parliament-it was proposed on 12 March this year-if the industry people in Australia could trust this Government. Over the last seven or eight years, every time the industry in this country has tried to proceed in these types of major projects, such as Wesley Vale or Coronation Hill, the Government has welshed on its promise to those people. It has absolutely welshed on its promise! Finally we now have legislation to keep the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) honest. That is what this is all about; we need legislation to try to keep the Prime Minister honest.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BI4">Mr MILES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly! As the honourable member says, it would be voluminous. In fact, it cannot be done. This legislation which the Government is proposing is actually very weak and only covers some of the industry people. It only covers big projects worth more than $100m. Not only that, the very point on which the Wesley Vale pulp mill went down is still not covered. Not all powers are constrained in this proposal by the Government. The Foreign Investment Review Board is the very point on which Wesley Vale foundered. Yet it is not covered in this proposal by the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If people think that what I am saying is due to a lack of trust, let me just go through the record of this Government. On 12 June 1986, in regard to the forest and woodchip industries in Tasmania, there was a memorandum of understanding between the State Government and the Commonwealth Government. I have the document here: the memorandum of understanding between the Commonwealth and the State. This was going to solve all the problems relating to the woodchip industry. The Government made an agreement with the State Government, just as it is proposing in the resource security legislation, that everything would be bedded down and we would have these understandings. </PARA>
<PARA> In October 1986, three or four months later, the Australian Labor Party State secretaries met in Sydney and said, `We need to win back support'. Political decisions had to be made. In December 1986 the Commonwealth Cabinet made the decision that there would be no logging in the Lemonthyme even though, under this proposal, it could go ahead. Within six months the Government had backtracked. It is for that very reason that today we have the resource security legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> In February 1987 we found the then Minister, Mr Cohen, giving public support to guaranteeing that the Government would back up the report of the inquiry into the Lemonthyme. In this House on 18 March the then Minister for the environment assured us that the Government would accept the inquiry's recommendations. When the Lemonthyme inquiry reported, we found that the Government had backtracked again. Instead of accepting the finding of the inquiry that about 30,000 or so hectares be placed into the National Estate or away from wood production, the Cabinet incorporated about 370,000 hectares. </PARA>
<PARA> Again the forest industry saw a Minister get up here in the Parliament and guarantee to accept the results of the inquiry. But what happens when the matter goes to Cabinet? Cabinet turns it over. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BI4">Mr MILES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable member for Lyons has rightly interjected, it will do the same again. The fact is that this Government, in regard to the forest industries, cannot be trusted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us go to 17 October 1988 when the pulp mill go-ahead was announced. In a joint statement, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) said:</PARA>
<PARA>We welcome the decision by North Broken Hill Holdings Limited and Noranda Forest Inc of Canada, to proceed with the building of a world scale pulp mill in northern Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> In many ways the investment decision is a watershed. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government was fully supportive of this project going ahead. Yet what did we see? Within about a year, on 15 March 1989, the mill was abandoned owing to political considerations. There was no other reason. It was a mill that would have had the toughest environmental standards in the world. Yet for political reasons this Government backed away from it. There is no way in which legislation can guarantee the Prime Minister's word in this Parliament. It is just impossible; if political considerations come into play, he will backtrack, and that is the reality of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Then, just to confirm that the Prime Minister cannot be trusted, we find that on 6 December last year, three months ago, the Prime Minister had a meeting with the Australian Conservation Foundation President, Mr Peter Garrett, and Director, Mr Phillip Toyne. What did he say to them? Have all honourable members read the papers this morning? He said there would be no resource security legislation. That is what he told the environmental movement. Now, three months later, what do we find? Things have changed. The Prime Minister gets another perception of what is happening out in real Australia, Paul Keating says this is the recession we had to have, and Australia is headed for an enormous overseas debt crisis. So the Prime Minister has to change. </PARA>
<PARA> Just this week, the Prime Minister said on page 1.16 of his statement Building a Competitive Australia:</PARA>
<PARA>Concern about future access to the resource has made investment uncertain. </PARA>
<PARA>Who made it uncertain? It was this very Government, this very Prime Minister. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA>Accordingly, the Government has decided to provide resource security for major new wood processing projects . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He said that undertakings will be backed by legislation. Who can trust this Government to do anything? The environmental movement cannot trust it now and the forest industry cannot trust it now. They are absolutely exasperated. The final result is that the forest industry wants some backing in resource guarantee legislation in a last-ditch effort to get this Government to honour its word. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that legislation being proposed in this place will not give the security and the confidence that is needed in Australia in these times of crisis. It is a great tragedy that this has occurred. We need to give confidence to these industry people. There is no doubt about it; confidence has to be restored. But, unfortunately, what is being proposed here is not appropriate and will not restore that confidence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To commence my contribution to this debate I will quote a very famous former Australian Labor Party (ALP) Prime Minister, now deceased, who must be spinning in his grave these days. In his famous speech to the ALP in June 1949 he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>We have a great objective-the light on the hill-which we aim to reach by working for the betterment of mankind not only here but anywhere we may give a helping hand. If it were not for that the Labour movement would not be worth fighting for. </PARA>
<PARA>He must be spinning in his grave-when we consider that in both Western Australia and Victoria left wing members of the Labor Party have resigned from the Party and are sitting on the cross benches as independents because of their disgust and bitterness at the way in which the ALP in government has betrayed its origins and its principles. I used that quotation because today we are discussing what must be one of our common concerns, that is, the unequal distribution of income in our country. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the motion moved on 13 September 1990. In particular, paragraphs (1) and (2) note:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the scarcity of information on the distribution of wealth in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA>(2) recognising that concern regarding inequality is shared by all major political parties in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA>I would have to agree with those two points. The motion goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>(3) noting that the most recently published survey on the distribution and composition of personal wealth in Australia, Dilnot Australia Economic Review-1st quarter 1990, has concluded that over half the total personal wealth in Australia is held by the wealthiest 10 per cent of the population and the effective tax rate on income from savings falls as wealth rises; and</PARA>
<PARA>(4) sharing the sentiments expressed by the Prime Minister in his maiden speech to the House-</PARA>
<PARA>In his maiden speech the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we have moved inexorably towards that destabilised and dangerous position described by Disraeli as `two nations', the nation of the privileged and the nation of the poor. </PARA>
<PARA>I would have to agree with the sentiment expressed by the Prime Minister. But the Prime Minister has been the Prime Minister in a government that has exacerbated that situation, and we now see a situation where the wealth of this country is more concentrated in the hands of a few than at any time in our nation's history. However, I must disagree with the final two paragraphs of the motion, which state:</PARA>
<PARA>this House calls on the Government to:</PARA>
<PARA>(a) collect and publish national statistical information regarding the distribution of wealth in Australia; and</PARA>
<PARA>(b) commission a study to give detailed consideration to, and to report upon, measures available to reduce the inequality of wealth distribution in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>I disagree with those paragraphs for a variety of reasons. Let us look at some of the evidence of this inequality of distribution of wealth and income in this country today. The Australian Labor Party Government is answerable for the increase in the inequality of income and wealth through its economic and social policies. According to a study conducted in 1990 by Dr Andrew Dilnot of London's Institute for Fiscal Studies, the richest 50 per cent of Australian income earners hold 98.4 per cent of Australia's personal wealth, leaving the bottom half on the wealth scale with only 1.6 per cent. The richest 10 per cent hold more than half of the country's wealth and the poorest 30 per cent hold none. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1984 household expenditure survey showed that household income of the rich was 8.2 times that of the poor. By 1985-86 this figure had increased to 9.7 times. So between 1984 and 1985-86 it had increased from 8.2 times to 9.7 times. The study went on to say that among industrialised advanced nations Australia ranked amongst the least equal in income and wealth distribution. A survey by Raskall and Piggot which appeared in Australian Society in March 1986 and May 1987 estimated that between 1984 and 1986, when total wealth in Australia increased by about 20 per cent, the wealth of the top 100 wealth holders increased by around 250 per cent. So there is evidence of a huge increase in personal wealth at the top end of the scale. </PARA>

<PARA> The Government is directly responsible for the increase in the quality of wealth and income distribution through its taxation legislation, ownership of huge, monopolistic public utilities and involvement in business with its entrepreneurial big mates. Big business entrepreneurs have fought each other to win contracts from these government-funded utilities, to reap their share of the profits. As an article by Ted Wheelwright, a known commentator on unequal distribution of wealth in Australia, states:</PARA>
<PARA>Certainly many of the recent fortunes have been made in sectors which depend on governmental controls of licensing arrangements which create near-monopolies, such as the electronic media, airlines, lotteries, land use, and banking and finance. This coupled with feeble trade practices legislation which doesn't prevent near-monopolies in other areas, allows a select few to dominate so much of the Australian economy and accumulate enormous wealth which they can lawfully pass on to their progeny without hindrance. </PARA>
<PARA>The process known as rent seeking involves expending resources to chase these abnormal profits with little to no productive activity involved. Resources are wasted in the fight to support quotas and licenses and the only effect is a redistribution of wealth from one bureaucratic body to another. </PARA>
<PARA> In this country corporate corruption has gone relatively unchecked and the consequent redistribution of income and wealth has occurred at the taxpayers' and shareholders' expense. The Labor Government has been a bedfellow with several of its big business mates, the likes of Alan Bond, Connell, Kerry Packer, Abeles, Rupert Murdoch and the list goes on. This has been responsible for ensuring some devastating long term effects for the Australian economy that are only now becoming well and truly apparent to the majority of the Australian community. For instance, during the term of this Government, the Labor Government, allegedly the party of the working man, Kerry Packer has seen his personal wealth increase from $100m to billions of dollars. As Mr Hawke is quoted as saying in the Canberra Times on 19 January, 1991:</PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased as Prime Minister of this country to count as a close personal friend and to measure as a very great Australian, Kerry Packer . . . and when you talk to Kerry you almost inevitably lead to Allan Bond . . . to you, Alan, congrats for all your achievements and may I thank you for your generous comments about the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>This Government's hand in hand relationship with the big mates, the big entrepreneurial mates, and its failure to competitively manage industries that have been subject to corporate abuse, are very well recognised in overseas circles. We have all seen that corporate corruption within Australia has led to our reputation overseas being on the decline. Of course, that has disastrous effects on the reputations of our businessmen when dealing in overseas financial markets. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian entrepreneurs who are involved in corporate corruption and who default on overseas loan payments are responsible for longer term implications for Australian investors overseas. Australian companies' credit-worthiness overseas has diminished as Australian companies are viewed as more risky. At the expense of a few corporate raiders who in cahoots with the Government have abused the Australian economy and increased wealth inequality in Australia, the majority of small businesses have to fight for overseas sources of capital and the premiums on loans that they have to pay to overseas interests are increased. Therefore they have to pay more for their capital and subsequently incur greater costs which are, of course, passed on to the ultimate sufferer which is the poor long suffering taxpayer. </PARA>

<PARA> The honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell) mentioned an area of taxation. In view of the time concern, I do not have a great deal of time to go into the matter, but one of the great impediments to a fairer distribution of wealth in this country is the inequitable taxation system that we have seen developed and, according to the Government, refined over the last nine years. </PARA>
<PARA> The non-indexation of allowances and tax thresholds is clearly of a regressive nature. The public's average tax burden as a proportion of real gross domestic product is on the increase. This redistribution of income away from the private sector to the public sector is directly responsible for worsening the distribution of income within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I will conclude because my time has almost run out. The answer is not another great study, another source of income for people who involve themselves in taking long, detailed studies of what is happening within our society; the answer is a change to economic policy. Of course, we have seen in the Prime Minister's industry statement a failure to pursue the sorts of micro-economic reforms that are necessary to get our economy working properly, fairly, and allowing small businesses, their investors and shareholders, and the great bulk of Australians to participate in the economic process. </PARA>
<PARA> The answer is not in another study, not in another source of lucrative income for those who are involved in those types of studies; the answer is in basic changes to economic policy. Having seen the failure of the Prime Minister in the industry statement on Tuesday, I cannot see that happening before the eventual installation in government of the next Liberal-National Government in 1992 or 1993, whenever the Government decides to go. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have pleasure in supporting the motion first moved by the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) on 13 September last year and then debated earlier this year on 14 February. I am sorry that the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), whilst bemoaning the disparity in the distribution of wealth, could not see fit to support the action called for in the last two paragraphs of the motion. Australia simply does not have a comprehensive profile on how wealth is distributed in the community. As the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones) stated in this debate, apart from sample studies, all there is at best is guesswork, hunch, suspicion and superstition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The results of two of the more recent sample studies point to enormous disparities in the distribution of wealth. In 1984, John Piggott, an economist at Sydney University, concluded that the top one per cent of adult individuals hold around 25 per cent of private wealth, and the top 10 per cent about 60 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The most recent sample study, the Australian Bureau of Statistics 1986 Income Distribution Survey (IDS) of about 12,000 income units, confirms this picture of tremendous inequality in the distribution of wealth in the Australian community. Analysis of this income distribution survey, by Andrew Dilnot, Downing Fellow at Melbourne University, shows that the top one per cent of the survey group held 19.7 per cent of private wealth; the top 10 per cent owned 55.2 per cent; the top 20 per cent owned 72 per cent; and the top 50 per cent possessed 98.4 per cent of all private wealth. As American economist, Paul Samuelson, once said:</PARA>
<PARA>If we made an income pyramid out of a child's blocks, with each layer portraying $1000 of income, the peak would be far higher than the Eiffel Tower, but almost all of us would be within a yard of the ground. </PARA>
<PARA>The bottom 50 per cent of the IDS group owned less than 2 per cent of the wealth. The bottom 30 per cent possessed no wealth at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The IDS data also allows for an examination of the taxation of wealth. As Dilnot concludes in his article in the July 1990 Australian Society:</PARA>
<PARA>The broad pattern is clear. Effective tax rates are high for those with relatively little wealth; for the rest tax rates are low. </PARA>
<PARA>Superannuation savings were not included in the IDS survey. Dilnot goes on to say-and this is a point that I have made in debate in this place on previous occasions:</PARA>
<PARA>To the extent that superannuation savings receive a tax subsidy, and thus an effective tax rate of less than zero, the inclusion of superannuation would further reduce the average effective tax rate, taking the overall average close to, or even below, zero. </PARA>
<PARA>Figures contained at page 155 if the Australian Taxation Office publication Taxation Statistics 1988-89 show that in 1988-89 there were 660 Australians with an income of between $1m and $2m, and a further 275 with an income of over $2m per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> According to Richard Farmer in his commentary on these figures in the Australian of 6 February 1991, the total earnings of these millionaires was $1,201m, and the total taxation $224m-18.7 per cent. Farmer asserts that the gap between rich and poor has widened in the last decade. Between 1982-83 and 1988-89, according to Tax Office figures, the after tax incomes of the top 20 per cent of taxpayers have increased by 57 per cent, whereas the bottom 20 per cent have increased by a mere 14.1 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also apparent from Taxation Statistics 1988-89 that the tax credits for share dividends were received by only a tiny minority of Australians. Eighty-three per cent of the $3.76 billion worth of tax credits were given to a mere 122,000 taxpayers who earned more than $50,000 per annum in 1988-89. </PARA>
<PARA> These are fragments of the picture of the distribution of wealth in Australia. They cause concern to many on this side of the House. They are, however, only fragments. We cannot know the full story until we have a proper wealth inquiry in this country. This is the only way we can dispel the suspicion and the mythology. This is the only way by which governments can properly plan and assess the impact of policy decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision not to proceed with the wealth inquiry in 1987 was regrettable. It did, however, give rise to an inquiry by the Catholic bishops of Australia through their Committee for Justice, Development and Peace, the report of which was recently released under the title Common Wealth and Common Good. At the outset, it is important to welcome the involvement of the church as an important community organisation in the debate over social policy. The report concludes with a set of important recommendations, the aim of which is the creation of a fairer society for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendation that received the most media coverage was the radical call for the introduction of an inheritance tax. In relation to this proposal, the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) commented:</PARA>
<PARA>Inheritance taxes are consistent with the democratic principle of attempting to move closer to equality of opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia is one of the few western countries that do not have any form of tax on inheritance. In both the United States and Great Britain, inheritance is a most important contributing factor to the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few. </PARA>
<PARA> A 1979 study of Britain showed that 60 per cent of the top one per cent of wealth holders had wealthy fathers. We have no data for Australia. As the honourable member for Denison when moving this motion said:</PARA>
<PARA>None of us would wish to see the imposition of a tax regime on inheritance which would affect ordinary Australians in a way that would prevent them from making a proper disposition of their property to their family and children. </PARA>
<PARA>We are simply not talking about ordinary Australians. Inheritance tax could be collected on estates over a fixed value-the honourable member for Fraser suggested $1m-so that it would not make an impact on the vast majority of Australians. It would ensure that massive sums of inherited wealth were not passed on with little or no taxation. It is time, as Australia proceeds towards the new century, that we re-examine this important question. </PARA>
<PARA> The other important recommendation of the bishops is for a wealth inquiry-a call which has been widely supported in the community. A point made by the honourable member for Lalor in his contribution to this debate is worthy of emphasis. What we are discussing is an inquiry into private wealth. As he pointed out, we each have an equal stake in the public wealth of Australia in the form of government business enterprises. Our share in these public assets to some extent counteracts the gross inequality in the distribution of private wealth. He went on to observe:</PARA>
<PARA>Privatisation is a shift in ownership away from the perfectly egalitarian distribution of public assets . . . . </PARA>
<PARA>My opposition to the move from public ownership is on record. If, however, any government proceeds to implement forms of privatisation, it is critical that care is taken about who acquires the assets. The transfer of wealth from the public sector to the private sector must not exacerbate the gap between the rich and the poor. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Lalor has urged the Government to limit shares of government business enterprises to employees and to superannuation funds to ensure that things owned by us all do not fall into the hands of those who already own most of Australia's wealth. Shelley once wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>Wealth is a power usurped by the few to compel the many to labour for their benefit. </PARA>
<PARA>Wealth is power and in this sense the redistribution of wealth is a matter that is important for democracy. An inquiry into the distribution of wealth could also answer important questions about the geographic distribution of wealth between the States and across regions. Some sense of the inequality between regions can be perceived by an examination of figures in Taxation Statistics 1988-89. This publication contains data relating to taxable income by postcode. When I examine the relevant data for two postcodes within my electorate I discover that there is over $7,000 or 33 per cent a year difference in the mean taxable income. </PARA>
<PARA> In his maiden speech, referred to in the motion, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) referred to the danger and destabilisation of two nations. There is a need for us to understand the extent to which Australia continues to be two nations in order to devise strategies to ensure that we can become one nation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What a faux pas to start off with! I meant to say conservation movement. That made Government members laugh; we will come back to it.

We, the ones who care for the needy, the poor and the sick-human needs-should stick just like glue to the heart of people, and then we might get somewhere. Perhaps I am old-fashioned, but I have no time for single issue politicians, no time at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We live in a complicated society and it would be foolhardy for me at this time to completely blame the Hawke Government for all our problems. Am I not fair? People are going broke; families are breaking up; crimes are committed and there are suicides and road deaths with the accompanying trauma to the families of the victims of horrific accidents. But we all, including me, must share some of the responsibility for some of our fearful problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now discuss one of the greatest problems confronting Australia. The aim of all governments should be to care for the total person. Sometimes I believe that mental illness of one form or another is treated as out of sight, out of mind. The impact of mental illness on modern societies is staggering. It is claimed that in Australia one person in five at any time is suffering a mental illness debilitating enough to significantly affect their ability to live full and satisfying lives. One in 10 Australians will spend some time of their lives hospitalised because of mental illness. </PARA>
<PARA> A report in the US Journal of Occupational Medicine in 1985 estimated that at any one time some 8 per cent to 10 per cent of the work force are experiencing disabling emotional or psychological ill health; up to 30 per cent suffer from psychological discomforts and physical ailments; and stress related symptoms contribute to absenteeism, loss of production and company health care expenses costing between $70 billion and $75 billion annually. Similar statistics could be applicable to Australia, where the impact of mental illness in some form or another could cost an estimated $10 billion. </PARA>
<PARA> There is, of course, another reason why we should all care when it comes to a discussion of mental health in the community. It is simply this: none of us-including me and my good friend the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles)-is immune from the pressures of the world around us. None of us, including the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), is able to cope with it. The prospect of unemployment, family breakdown, stress, bereavement or invalidism may lead to some disruption in our mental well-being or even more serious psychological disorders. Sad, but true. I was more than surprised to discover the extent to which Australians have some degree of difficulty with their mental health, ranging from minor conditions such as anxiety or depression to the more acute mental illnesses suffered by quite large numbers.</PARA>
<PARA> In her report to the Australian Government in 1984, Professor Beverly Raphael noted:</PARA>
<PARA>Psychiatric disorder is prevalent, extensive, affects all age and social groups and is associated with chronic and often major disability, handicap and invalidism. </PARA>
<PARA> I was horrified when I read the statistics. We think about it when we see somebody in our office-and we all see people, do we not? We do not just see people who want to talk about conservation-the birds and the bees. We see people and ask them about their human problems. Some of the people who see me are depressed. A couple of people whom I went to school with have seen me; they are manic depressives now. Such people may have lost their jobs or their family may have broken down. We think very seriously about it. That is why an old, embittered politician like me becomes very cynical when he hears the conservationists, the greens-not all of them-talking ad infinitum about what they believe Australia should be like. We all believe in conservation; we all look after our gardens, homes and families to the best of our ability-that to me is the environment, not just, I repeat, the birds and the bees. Professor Raphael went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>For instance, 25 per cent of the population may suffer from moderate to severe disturbance at any one time. 12 per cent of children may suffer from psychiatric disorder. 40 per cent of all hospital beds-</PARA>
<PARA>alarming again-</PARA>
<PARA>are devoted to psychiatric patients. One third or more of those attending general practitioners do so for problems of mental ill health. Mental ill health is one of the major causes of invalidism in the Australian population. </PARA>
<PARA>Who could afford not to care about information such as this? I read it and thought to myself what a lucky person I am. We are blase about certain things. We do not seem to worry about what is going on out there; we all come into this political hothouse and talk about the Australia that we would like, but there are immense problems out there. It is easy for me to be political and blame the other side for people going broke and marriages breaking up; it is a simple way of passing the buck. But it is not as simple as that. My good friend the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), who has watched me for about 16 years-worried about me at times too-smiles, but he knows exactly what I am talking about. Some of us are pretty good actors . We come in here and we start spouting about certain little things that we believe. It may get us a few votes back in our electorate, but most of us deep down really care for people and try to the best of our ability in our electorates-in Braddon, Tasmania, for example-to do the best we can for them. </PARA>
<PARA> Sometimes we do not get the media attention that we should. It is very simple to get on a soapbox and talk about a specific interest item like the single issue politicians and get a helluva lot of publicity as a result of it. But I think they fall like leaves from trees; they do not stay around very long, being just a passing phase. One day there will be a realisation that politicians are not as bad as people think they are. Most of us care for what we are trying to do; most of us do the best we can. That is the reason I draw attention to this specific problem of mental illness and the problems associated with what is happening in our beautiful country, Australia. Unfortunately it is going to be very hard to stop, but we will do our best to do it. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to also mention in conclusion that one of my mates in the journalistic field, Paul MacDonald, is retiring today. He is going into better fields. He is in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation box over there-I hope they have the cameras on me. I wish him all the very best; he has done a dashed good job and he is one of those fellows who make a big contribution to this House. I thank the House for listening to me and for grieving with me. I am sure honourable members understand the point I draw. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unlike the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Goodluck), I am a dedicated environmentalist. My belief is that mental illness is very much a product of man's abuse of his natural environment, but that is not my grievance today. My grievance today relates to some aspects of the Child Support Agency which have a number of my constituents hopping mad. I should preface my remarks by saying that I am an enthusiastic supporter of the principles behind the scheme. It is trite but necessary to note that marriage breakdown is common and that divorce or estrangement frequently sees a dramatic drop in the living standards of the innocent children forced into a sole parent family.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That suffering is deepening in this time of economic recession. Increasing unemployment and falling living standards mean that some half a million children in sole parent families are feeling the pain of the recession. Child poverty, unfortunately, is still with us. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the few rays of hope for these children and their supporting parents is the child support maintenance and the family allowance supplement. When the first stage of the child support scheme was launched it was calculated that some 30,000 applications would be received and the scheme was funded and staffed accordingly. These estimates were based on the number of maintenance orders in our court systems. When the second stage was introduced in November 1989, some growth was anticipated and extra staff were recruited by the Australian Taxation Office. However, one of the many serious problems created by using Taxation Office personnel to run the scheme was that, because of their lack of experience in this very specialised area, they failed to appreciate just how the applications would burgeon. </PARA>
<PARA> Stage two allowed the social security processes of family allowances to set in train automatically the child support applications. The old court orders were only the tip of the iceberg. There were many sole parents who could not afford or be bothered with the hassles of litigation. There were tens of thousands of parents existing on amicable mutual agreements as to the quantum of child maintenance. The change saw the number of applications increasing at a rate of over 1,000 a month. We now have almost 100,000 applicants and no sign that the rate of new registrations is slowing for the foreseeable future.</PARA>
<PARA> The staffing of the scheme has always been inadequate and, quite frankly, has now got right out of hand. My constituents advise me that it is taking over six months from the time of application to the point the claim commences to be processed. Another long delay will then occur before the first payment arrives because the collection process involves long delays in notifying the taxpayer, serving the employer with the order, waiting for the employer to pay the tax, and processing the money through the Taxation Office and the Department of Social Security. All that must be done before a cheque finally gets to the supporting parent. We could easily be looking at another four to six months delay here. Children in poverty should not have to wait for up to 12 months because of the maze of red tape and bureaucratic procrastination. </PARA>
<PARA> My second grievance with the scheme relates to the injustices that are being created by an inflexible, insensitive system of administrative assessment and the lack of a realistic system of appeal or review. The assessments are made on the basis of four different formulae, depending on whether the custodian's income is below or above average income, whether the custody is split or shared, and where there is more than one custodian. </PARA>
<PARA> Human relations are always complex, and financial relationships tend to be the most difficult of all-as any marriage guidance counsellor will tell you. Rote application of rigid formulas to such relationships is guaranteed to lead to anger and injustice. There are some notable exceptions from the credits given to liable parents that also need to be re-examined. For example, in situations where the custodial parent and children remain in the matrimonial home, the liable parent's mortgage payments on that home are not taken into account. School fees and payments for uniforms are not credited; nor for that matter is provision of food or payment of medical, optical or dental expenses.</PARA>
<PARA> On the other side of the ledger, there is no satisfactory method of determining the real disposable incomes of self-employed liable parents who could hide their real earnings behind corporate veils and business expenses. Complaints about assessments are currently dealt with on the basis that an aggrieved parent can appeal to the courts. I have had the sad task of advising non-custodial parents who were assessed so harshly that they were actually left with a negative income, so that they would have to rely on savings or borrowings for the next two years or so before their court cases came on for hearing. </PARA>
<PARA> A couple of examples from actual cases in my office are useful to explain the points that I am making. Take the case of Mr X from north Gosford. He is a liable parent who came to my office to explain that prior to the implementation of the second stage of the scheme he was already paying his estranged wife $150 per week to support two children. His wife was perfectly happy with that arrangement, fully understanding his financial situation. However, his wife applied for the family allowance and that meant that Mr X was assessed by the Agency. The assessment required my constituent to pay almost double-so much that he found that his disposable income was negative to the tune of about $40 per week. This was because of an unrealistic assessment of local rents and because he was given no credits for other regular and occasional payments he was making on the children's behalf. Luckily for him, his family law case was coming on and he did not have to wait the usual two years. The court reduced his payments to $80 per week. His wife was $70 a week worse off than under their mutual arrangement, and certainly there was a huge difference between that and the assessment. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Y, who was a fireman, supports four children. He had to leave that job as a fireman because he could not care for the children in that sort of arrangement. His wife was ordered by the court to pay maintenance for the children but she did not do so. He put his application into the Agency for assessment in July 1990. He gave full details of the court papers, the orders, her employment and her whereabouts. Despite frequent calls from both Mr Y and my office, his application is yet to be processed. Eight months later, not a pen has been put to paper. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, I would submit, some simple, inexpensive solutions to these problems. One, of course, is an appeal system similar to the one in relation to Veterans' Affairs, where panels, very quickly and in my view efficiently, assess complaints that people have about Veterans' Affairs pensions and the like. I suggest that such an appeal system would be very good in this regard. A lot more staff are obviously needed. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not like standing here and taking on the role of a whinger-which I suppose is what a grievance debate is about-because we are dealing with children, their lives and their support. A child who is living in poverty because of no fault of his or her own, because of a marriage breakdown and the failure of one party to the marriage properly to support the child, should not have to wait 12 to 14 months before the application is processed. There should not be all of this red tape and nonsense associated with what is a very good scheme, a scheme that I believe in and support. However, having said that I do not want to be a whinger, I think I am, because I think that the administration of the Child Support Agency is verging on the scandalous, and it is about time that someone said so. </PARA>

The move towards self-assessment of tax liabilities and the associated increase in reliance on audit activities by the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) demands that there be an explicit and comprehensive understanding of the rights and obligations of both taxpayers and the Tax Office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A 1990 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development survey indicates that there are a number of significant omissions in the entitlements conferred on Australian taxpayers when compared with what occurs in other countries. Also, in recent years several countries have sought to give greater codification to taxpayers' rights. The question of a bill of rights for taxpayers was an issue in the 1988 United States presidential election campaign and legislation was passed. The United Kingdom published a taxpayer charter in 1986, as did France in 1987. New Zealand has had a statement of principles since 1986 and Canada a declaration of taxpayers' rights going back to 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of these measures is not necessarily to extend the rights of taxpayers beyond those already in existence, although this has been achieved in the United States; rather, the main purpose has been to bring together in one document a concise statement of the rights and obligations that can be referred to by all those concerned with the observance and administration of tax laws. By ensuring that people are better informed of their rights and by providing ATO officers with more explicit and binding guidelines for carrying out their work, a statement of taxpayers' rights in Australia would help to ensure that justice is done in the area of tax administration. </PARA>
<PARA> A knowledge of taxpayers' rights is particularly important in view of the continuing poor performance of the ATO in a number of areas. As recently as December 1990, the Institute of Chartered Accountants released a report which was highly critical of a wide range of Tax Office practices. Without a well-defined and enforceable understanding of rights it is difficult if not impossible for taxpayers and tax practitioners to remedy unfair treatment at the hands of a powerful Australian Taxation Office. </PARA>
<PARA> The OECD has identified the following six basic taxpayers' rights: the right to be informed, assisted and heard; the right of appeal; the right to pay no more than the correct amount of tax; the right to certainty; privacy; and confidentiality and secrecy. While the Tax Office might aspire to respect similar rights in theory, in practice they are often overridden by the extensive powers of the ATO. </PARA>
<PARA> The following table compiled by Sydney solicitor, Mr Peter Roach, compares the rights of citizens with the powers of the ATO and other authorities. I seek leave to incorporate the table in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. The table strongly suggests an imbalance between the rights of taxpayers and Tax Office powers. The rights of taxpayers have little prospect of prevailing over the extensive powers of the Tax Office where the Tax Office is determined to use or abuse those powers. It would be the purpose of a compilation of taxpayers' rights to come between these powers and taxpayers and so regulate the use of those powers. As Mr Peter Roach argues-and I quote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>We should review the standards whereby we have conferred greater authority on the state in relation to revenue matters than we have in relation to matters of crimes against the person and other traditional areas of criminal activity.</PARA>
<PARA>Many of the deficiencies in the rights of taxpayers stem from the fact that the move to partial self-assessment for individuals and full self-assessment for companies has occurred within a legislative framework which is largely geared to assessment by the ATO. Many of the penalties under existing tax law are no longer appropriate where the taxpayer has responsibility for assessing taxable income. This problem is greatly compounded by the uncertainties in tax laws that result from legislative complexity and the vast discretionary powers of the Commissioner of Taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of areas in which taxpayers should be afforded greater consideration than is presently the case. It transpires that there has been a considerable decline in the number of taxpayers requesting an independent review of their assessment by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. As Peter Roach has pointed out, this does not necessarily reflect greater Tax Office efficiency; rather, it may well be that-and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . taxpayers find the investigation more burdensome than the prospect of settlement on the Commissioner's terms. </PARA>
<PARA>Also, he says:</PARA>
<PARA>The hazards of not `settling' may be too high in that further resistance may result in the strict application of the law, (while) the costs of even securing the right of access to independent review has been made prohibitive for many taxpayers in relation to many matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Roach has pointed out that the fees levied on taxpayers in exercising their appeal rights are greater than those that apply to small claims tribunals and lower civil courts, despite the fact that many of the matters appealable by taxpayers are of the same value or of less value than would be found in claims before small claims tribunals and the lower civil courts. </PARA>
<PARA> There needs to be some relief from the current regime of AAT fees. The detailed provisions in a codified statement need to be arrived at in consultation with tax practitioners and the ATO, and need to take account of new issues as they arise. Consideration would also need to be given to the manner in which such a statement is to be given effect. Legislative measures would be essential if one is to be given the force of law, but some provisions and procedures may not require legislation and could take the form of binding guidelines or codes of conduct administered by an independent authority, such as a tax ombudsman. </PARA>
<PARA> It is often argued in this place that we should legislate in government to bring ourselves up to scratch with something that has happened, or is happening, in a comparable country. In this area of a commitment to the rights of taxpayers as individuals we are lagging behind comparable countries, and the time is ripe for us to do something about it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Charles Dickens was the equal of any writer in the English language, and that stamps him as being no mug. In fact, he was a very smart cookie-a genius, most people would agree. Dickens knew the world. He knew its people, their whims and inconsistencies. He knew all about wealth and poverty, about right and wrong, about joy and anguish. He knew about good and evil, and justice and injustice. He did not have a string of legal letters after his name and he did not puff around in a gown or a powdered wig, but he had a better feel for the law than any queen's counsel that I have met.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In his knowledge of the law Dickens was a long way ahead of the Perry Masons and the Rumpoles of television fame. In truth, he was up there in the big league with guys like Daniel and Solomon. Read Dickens-read Little Dorritt or Bleak House and one will agree that Dickens was no slouch when it came to legal matters. </PARA>
<PARA> What did this great man think of the law? He did not need a month to bring in his verdict. `The law is an ass', he said, and that statement is noteworthy for being both succinct and factual. `But that was the law more than a century ago', I hear the wigs cry, `we've come a long way since then, and the law is not an ass in the modern age'. Well, I really wonder. I know that the law is a complex study and that mistakes will occasionally occur. I do not have sufficient time available to discuss all aspects of the law, so I will speak about people going to gaol because they cannot pay debts. </PARA>
<PARA> Remember the old Gilbert and Sullivan line about the punishment fitting the crime? Well, it did not always in the time of The Mikado, and it does not always now. I am pleased to see that there are two legal men at the table-the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) and the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock). </PARA>
<PARA> A guy in Sydney went to gaol for refusing to pay parking fines. He was put in with hardened criminals and was bashed near to death. Maybe that person did have hundreds of unpaid parking fines, but did the punishment fit the crime-particularly when we have dozens of high-fliers walking free after frauds which rip millions of dollars from investment and property schemes funded by battling families? Those creeps were dealt with by the law and received a slap on the wrist. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us concentrate on tax matters and look at a couple of cases. Did honourable members read last week about the case of a Canberra solicitor who escaped a $230,000 tax payment because a decimal point on the writ was in the wrong place? This solicitor defended five years of tax assessments and his objections were disallowed. But because of a crazy legal system and the incorrect placing of a decimal point, the solicitor escaped tax payments of $230,000. No gaol for that solicitor. No gaol either for those bottom of the harbour rip-off merchants who fleeced the Australian Taxation Office of millions of dollars. Because of the sympathy for the rich that those opposite have, this Government was not able to make those crooks pay back the tax they owed. Wealthy people cheated the Tax Office and should have been gaoled, but those wealthy people had political clout and were not gaoled. Instead of being gaoled, they benefited. Does the punishment always fit the crime?</PARA>
<PARA> Allow me now to refer to the case of a poor person who could not pay a tax bill and who went to gaol. Honourable members should compare this case with others they know of and decide for themselves whether fairness is the cornerstone of the legal system. I confess that I am no genius when it comes to legal matters. I was so ignorant as to believe that if one could not pay a debt, one would not be gaoled. I was wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1989, this Labor Government did amend the Crimes Act so that a person who is convicted of a Federal offence cannot be sent to gaol if it is a first offence or if the amount involved does not exceed $2,000. That amendment was a step in the right direction, but $2,000 is a piddling amount and the amendment did not go nearly far enough. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now tell the story of a woman in my electorate, Mrs Dot Moorby, and her husband, Joe. For some years, Dot and Joe operated a small business in Branxton, a beautiful little town in my electorate. However, the business ran into difficulties and Dot and her husband did not lodge a taxation return for the year 1986-87. She and her husband lodged two returns the following year, but they ended up owing the Taxation Office nearly $5,000. Dot and Joe were worried about the debt, but there was not much they could do because their business was going down the gurgler. In an effort to improve their finances, the husband went a couple of hundred miles away to another city to find work. That produced further complications and resulted in the break-up of the marriage. Dot Moorby was left as a single parent with a dependent son and a dependent daughter. </PARA>
<PARA> Dot is a highly respected member of my electorate and has never committed a crime in her 41 years. Despite her efforts to resurrect the business, all failed and she was declared bankrupt in 1989. When she was declared bankrupt she thought, as I probably would have, that the debt to the Taxation Office would have been wiped, but it does not work that way. So Dot was getting these letters. She had no husband and was getting all the bills sent to her place. In desperation she found a job which did not pay much, but she settled some of her smaller debts. </PARA>
<PARA> She was not as wise as perhaps she could have been. She went to see the Taxation Office and made promises to pay by instalment. She kept up the payments for a while but then fell behind again. Finally, warrants were issued against her and she appeared before the court. I think the warrant was withdrawn and then-she should have done it earlier-she eventually came to my office and we made desperate attempts to make representations to the Tax Office. It sent a letter to the court saying that it was prepared to accept $25 per week in instalments but it was decided that, because Dot had broken so many other promises to pay, the warrant should stand and she was sentenced to 4 1/2 months in gaol. I will read what she said in a letter to me:</PARA>
<PARA>The verdict that I would have to go to gaol for four and a half months was quite devastating for my children and myself. That afternoon, the local policeman came to my house and said he would be picking me up at 7 p.m. that night, because there was transport arriving at Maitland police station at 8 a.m. the next morning. So at 7 p.m., he picked me up. </PARA>
<PARA>She talked about how her kids were crying their hearts out while she was put in the back of a paddy-wagon, taken to Maitland prison, given two blankets, and put in a cell. She said that it was the most degrading time of her life. She was fingerprinted, handcuffed, put into another paddy-wagon, taken to Mulawa gaol, body searched, and made to take a shower in front of a guard. She goes on and on. It is really a tragedy. This woman, 41 years of age, with two kids, was arrested in front of the kids, put into a paddy-wagon and carted off to gaol. I will continue reading her letter:</PARA>
<PARA>I realise this letter won't help me now, but with a bit of luck it might help someone else. </PARA>
<PARA>She says that there is something wrong with the system and it should be changed. I say to Dot Moorby that I and a couple of million other Australians would agree with her. A system which sends a highly respectable woman to gaol because she is too poor to pay her debts should be changed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I feel for the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon) for having to conclude his remarks, as he was expressing some quite heartfelt concerns that we all share and that we all come across from time to time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In October last year, I expressed a grievance-a very real concern-for the private health funds in Australia and in particular the great hardship that is being experienced by these funds as a result of the impost, as I said then and I do now, of the reinsurance trust legislation. As I stated previously, the feedback that I am getting from health funds all over Australia and from some local health funds in my electorate, or associated with my electorate, is that the large amount of reinsurance that is being paid by these funds on a compulsory basis is disadvantaging the viable funds in favour of the less viable. </PARA>
<PARA> At a recent reinsurance seminar held in Melbourne on 23 February this year, a number of speakers addressed the meeting in relation to this very serious issue that can have a disastrous effect on the private health funds of Australia. I understand that at that seminar there were seven speakers at the rostrum, six to speak in favour of reinsurance and one against. This seemed to me upon reflection a great imbalance in view of the serious situation that exists in the health funds today. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the reinsurance levy, private funds are being forced to raise their charges to accommodate the levy. As a result of this fact, large numbers of contributors are opting out of the private health funds and are now relying on the Medicare system. </PARA>
<PARA> This situation is likely to worsen, as I think any thinking person would agree in the light of the poor economic situation in Australia today, particularly the increase in unemployment because people are simply not going to be able to afford to belong to a private health scheme. The Minister for Community Services and Health, the honourable member for Batman (Mr Howe), has stated on numerous occasions that the vast majority of Australians support the Medicare system. He said that surveys show that seven out of 10 Australians are in favour of Medicare. He also said that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . not only is Medicare the most popular health system that Australia has ever had, the clear majority of health users are in favour of it. </PARA>
<PARA>The question I ask is: why are they in favour of it? I think the reason is patently obvious when we start to look at the situation confronting the ordinary public today. Families cannot afford to belong to private health funds and they have to opt for the Medicare system alone for financial reasons, not because the system is a better one. They throw up their arms and say, `What choice do we have in this day and age because of the cost that confronts us in making ends meet? It makes it impossible for us to belong to private health funds which we would dearly like to belong to. Because of the increasing contributions that we now have to pay to these funds, and a lot of it is due to the impost of the reinsurance trust levy, we cannot belong'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister claims the survey indicated that 66 per cent of those who have been in a public hospital in the last two years were satisfied with their experience there because of the good standard of care, et cetera. Who would deny that? That is a patently obvious fact and we know that the public health service is doing an excellent job. There is no question about that and I commend those people in administration and those who serve in the public hospital system for the excellent service that they do give. </PARA>
<PARA> But the problem is getting oneself into the public hospital system. The waiting list is staggering-anything up to five or six months just for a gall bladder operation. I mentioned in October that a member of my own family was very much in need of a gall bladder operation and was told there would be a 12-month wait to get into the public hospital for the operation. However, it was possible to get into a private hospital next week under a private health scheme that covered the condition, and fortunately that person was covered. Not so long ago my own secretary's wife had a gall bladder attack and was told that it would be five or six months before she could get into hospital under the public system, but that she could get into the private system next week. So I make the point that even though the Minister says that the public hospital system is excellent, and of course it is, we all know you cannot get into hospital unless you belong to private health funds. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very important to point out the need to have in this day and age a system of private health funds that is affordable. This is absolutely essential, not just for those who have the ability to pay, but for the average person in the street. The average person in the street is no different from the person who has more means in terms of the diseases that people get. People on lower means get gall bladder problems just as people who are wealthy do. The requirement for treatment is immediate, not six months down the track. </PARA>
<PARA> Medicare, in that respect, cannot be seen to be doing a good job and it is absolutely essential that more effort be made by the Government to make it possible for people to participate in private health schemes. We are seeing the demise of the private health system and, as I said earlier, a lot of that is due to the fact that it is becoming increasingly difficult for private health schemes to continue to operate in a viable way. This is due largely in some cases to the reinsurance trust levy that is imposed upon them. </PARA>
<PARA> The point that I wish to make is simply this: the private health funds are feeling the pinch because of the reinsurance scheme. Some are claiming that they will have to close their doors as a result of this fact-and some have. We have already seen the demise of three registered organisations, namely, Health Australia, which was absorbed by Medibank Private; Hospital Benefits Association Ltd; and Mutual Community, taken over in effect by National Mutual. This has occurred despite the fact that the firms that took them over benefited greatly from the reinsurance scheme, yet the organisations that I have mentioned still went under. </PARA>
<PARA> How many more will go? I predict that unless the current reinsurance arrangements are modified, more will go under. Let us ponder the size of the reinsurance pool and the distribution. For the 12 months ended 30 June last year the pool totalled $745m, with a distribution of $99.4m. It is not as though it was going broke. Contribution rates have risen substantially as funds that make large contributions to the scheme-for example, NIB Health Funds Ltd contributed $3m-meet their reinsurance liability. </PARA>
<PARA> The windfall experienced by funds benefiting from the arrangement have, in the main, been used to fund increases in benefits to contributors. That seems to be a strange turn of events. It is also being used by the funds which benefited from the reinsurance payments to increase their reserves and to undercut contribution rates of many of the funds paying into the pool. This seems quite ludicrous when one thinks about it. </PARA>
<PARA> The general feeling in the industry is that the funds that are being subsidised got themselves into difficulties through their market losses, computer company losses, expansion into capital intensive diversification activities and property development. </PARA>
<PARA> I intend to pursue the matter of reinsurance with the Government until a satisfactory result is achieved, with regard to the massive impost being placed on private health funds today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not long ago I visited Indonesia to attend a conference of the Society for Overseas Development. While I was there I was told about an article which appeared in the Indonesian press in Indonesian, and I have had that article translated. I would like to read the central part of it because it illustrates the reason why Australia gives overseas aid. I would then like briefly to describe a project that I visited while there which is entirely successful and which illustrates that overseas aid can be very valuable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This article was written by a man called Goenawan Mohamad. It appeared in the Indonesian press and it has been translated for me by Dr Terry Hull from the Australian National University. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA> On that day Iyut made a decision. She sold one of her valuables in an act of desperation. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> She is 32 years old. Her full name is Darmasiah. She has five children. She's widowed-or rather a former widow. A year ago she remarried with a construction worker . . . </PARA>
<PARA> They live in a bamboo house and didn't own anything of real value other than a bedspread and a crockery shelf. Four of their five children had to be sent to live with relatives, leaving only the youngest at home. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite its now small size, the household is still unable to support its three members. It is not unusual for them to go whole days without food-unable to buy rice much less some meat or vegetables to accompany it. Iyut wanted to work and was willing to take any job in order to add to the family income. But her husband-the construction labourer-refused to give her `permission' to work. Finally she despaired. It was at that point that Iyut sold the bedspread. </PARA>
<PARA> She obtained Rp. 4,000 [approx. $A3.00] for her penultimate possession. From the used household goods dealer she carried the money directly to another shop where she bought a can of Baygon insecticide. Then she returned home to her bamboo house, where she quietly drank the can of poison. She wanted to `pass away'-or more specifically she wanted to `leave behind the world she had known to that point'. </PARA>
<PARA> She failed. As she slipped into unconsciousness and as the darkness closed around her, she was discovered by a neighbour and rushed to the nearby general hospital. They were able to save her life. She spent a few days in hospital, longer in fact than was medically indicated. The reason? She didn't have the money to pay for her medical care. </PARA>
<PARA> Her husband . . . tried a number of times to obtain her release from the hospital-and this obviously involved some costs. As a result he was forced to sell their last possession-the crockery shelf on the bamboo wall of their home . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That story illustrates the extent of poverty in Indonesia-poverty that is quite widespread. There are estimated to be 30 million people living in absolute poverty in Indonesia, nearly 50 per cent more than the total population of Australia. By absolute poverty, I mean people who never have enough to eat, as in that story. </PARA>
<PARA> There are things that we can do, and are doing, about that. While I was in Indonesia I visited what I think is the most successful aid project that I have ever seen. It is at the Institut Pertanian Bogor (IPB), which is the premier agricultural university in Indonesia. One might say this does not have much to do with urban poverty and that, in a direct sense, is quite true. But in a country where the great majority of people live in rural areas, the best possible aid that we can give is to help them increase the productivity of their agricultural sector. That is exactly what we have been doing in this project at the IPB at Bogor, which is one of the old colonial cities about 40 kilometres from Jakarta and a bit higher up in the mountains. </PARA>
<PARA> At this university there is undergraduate training and postgraduate training and we have been involved in both of those. We have a project costing $15m which has lasted for five years and it comes to an end in late March of this year. It has involved 18 full time advisers working in Indonesia and also Indonesian students coming to Australia to study, particularly at the University of New England, but also at some other Australian universities. The project has involved increasing the capacity of that institute to upgrade its postgraduate training for other agricultural universities. This is the best and most prestigious of the agricultural universities. We have been contributing to the university's capacity to educate the trainers, so it is quite clear that it is a very well designed project. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been involved in supporting postgraduate lecturing and research on animal sciences, agricultural economics and graduate school administration. We have also been supporting the undergraduate programs in basic sciences, chemistry, biology, physics, mathematics and English language training. It is a very well targeted project. </PARA>
<PARA> The project has had excellent counterpart support from Indonesia, which has given equivalent funding to ensure that it is rooted in its educational structure. The counterpart staff have been of very high quality. I met the counterpart Indonesian director. She held a doctorate from an American university. She was one of the leading administrators at Bogor and she was a lively, very capable and clearly a very creative person. The fact that we are able to give her support in what she is trying to do is a clear indication of the value of this project. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as being involved in postgraduate teaching and research and undergraduate teaching, we have also set up a demonstration farm at Jonggol, which is close to Bogor. I visited that farm. It was run by an entirely practical, good-natured Australian. He was a very straightforward person of great technical ability, it seemed to me, and just brimming over with commonsense. He was very practical in what he was doing; he was studying ways of improving pasture, improving the quality of cattle, improving feed and demonstrating that to both the students of the university and to the people in the villages around. Again, this was a very practical and sensible part of the project. </PARA>
<PARA> He felt he needed a few more months. When I returned to Australia, I approached the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau and got his contract extended for another three months. I think that a project like this could well be longer. The only criticism I make of it is that five years may not be long enough to do the job that is required. But that is the pattern we have at present. Some other countries have projects for up to 10 years and, provided there is adequate counterpart support, that may well be justified. </PARA>
<PARA> It was a delight to see such an entirely successful and well-targeted Australian project aiming to improve the productivity of the agricultural sector in Indonesia. As the benefits of that project spread out, more people will be attracted to stay in their villages and someone like Iyut might not have been attracted to Jakarta. That is one of the solutions to the urban poverty problem. That is an example of the benefit of our aid program, and I hope the House will give our aid program its wholehearted support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) was established in 1932 it had the particular role of providing services to rural and regional Australia. The task of providing information and entertainment to country Australians was especially important because most of those listeners had no access to alternative commercial radio stations. When television came along, again it was only the ABC which was able to provide a service to hundreds of thousands of regional Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> In a recent letter to members of parliament, the Melbourne branch of the Friends of the ABC explained that the ABC was attempting to secure, or had secured, centralised control over all State symphony orchestras; all classical music programming, through networking; all arts funding, most of which is now being allocated to Sydney; sports programming, through Grandstand; all television production; the national network for JJJ; all late night radio, through networking; and all national news services. </PARA>
<PARA> Morale amongst ABC staff in provincial areas is abysmally low. They see an empire being built in Sydney, while they are unable to obtain basic necessities. Their opinions and wishes are arrogantly disregarded. What some manager in Sydney thinks they should have is what they get. Every ABC regional staff officer can tell seemingly endless stories of waste and mismanagement within the ABC. I have been told of expensive but useless equipment sitting in basements while staff are unable to obtain essentials such as telephones and travel. </PARA>
<PARA> I have seen studios designed by remote engineers which are impractical and fail to accommodate local needs. Recently, in my electorate, the ABC opened a new studio in Maryborough. The building holding its former studios was sold and the ABC was given plenty of notice that it would need to relocate. The ABC dithered for so long, regularly flying in staff to look at the same buildings-no doubt a part of its million and a half budget spent on travel last year-that eventually an interim shift was required because no new studios were available at the time it had to leave the others. If the local staff had been permitted to make decisions, the new studios could have been built more conveniently, better, and in only a fraction of the time. </PARA>
<PARA> Now the city has new street front ABC premises, but there are so few staff that they are not even occupied for most of the day. When the senior journalist is not out doing his job collecting the news, he has to man the counter-a job any junior could do. There are many excellent people in the ABC in regional Australia. Some have decades of experience and are real stars who enjoy a tremendous local following. They are trusted and seen as authority figures and are listened to attentively every day. Their natural creativity and flair is being sadly dulled by growing bureaucratic oppression. </PARA>
<PARA> A popular local news commentary program on ABC 4BU was axed by capital city management apparently because some other regional stations did not have a journalist to do this kind of program. Why should one station have its popular program terminated just because another station was unable to provide a similar service? Local talent available at the time should be utilised to fill a local need. Surely that is what regionalism is all about. Regrettably, that seems to be a concept that the ABC bureaucrats are completely unable to grasp. Just because a program is made in Townsville or Cairns rather than Brisbane or Sydney does not make it regional, particularly to the people in Maryborough or Toowoomba. People in Gympie or Dalby are, in fact, probably less interested in a program emanating from Townsville than they would be in one coming from Brisbane. </PARA>
<PARA> The ABC is preferring to network its programs, eliminating local and even State input, by transmitting identical material to all listeners irrespective of their geographical location or interests. If a program is not popular with Sydney management, no-one else can see it. Because Sydney does not want Sheffield Shield cricket, Queensland cannot have it. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr David Hill and the ABC management like to blame the Federal Government Budget cutbacks for this elimination of local programs; however, while the ABC may not be receiving as much funding as it would like, its parliamentary appropriations continue to rise. The amount has increased from $431m in 1988 to $450m in 1989 and $473m in 1990. Even the much talked of staff cutbacks are also largely a smokescreen. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the availability of all the new technology, electronic equipment and communication systems, the number of ABC staff has actually decreased by only 5.7 per cent over the last 10 years. In reality, the ABC is redirecting its resources to different areas and the ABC's bloated and multitiered management structure certainly does not seem to be too adversely affected. Ample funds have been available to construct a new $200m-plus Taj Mahal at Ultimo in Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> On 6 December, I asked the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) a question about the number of ABC staff and their locations. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a chart indicating the number of ABC staff in each State compared with the population in that State. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that the honourable members opposite, who are both Queenslanders, would be interested in the figures this chart reveals. With over 17 per cent of Australia's population, Queensland has only 7.5 per cent of the ABC staff. South Australia, with half Queensland's population, has more ABC staff. Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia each have double the number of staff per head of population to that of Queensland. New South Wales has more than three times the number; Tasmania, five times; and even the Australian Capital Territory has three times the number. What is more, the ABC is making no effort to redress the staffing imbalance in Queensland. Despite the rapidly increasing population in that State, the ABC has actually reduced the number of staff in Queensland over the past 10 years by 91 compared with an increase of 178 in New South Wales where the population share is declining.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Much of the best television equipment has also been siphoned out of Queensland. The ABC no longer has the capacity to televise any major sporting or community event in the State and has to fly staff and equipment from Sydney even to cover a club football game. The ABC's 1989-90 annual report included a number of graphs on ABC service, all of which showed the extent of discrimination against Queensland. Queensland had the lowest population covered by ABC radio of all the mainland States, the lowest coverage by Radio National, the lowest coverage by ABC-FM and no JJJ at all, although my colleagues tell me that might be a blessing in disguise. </PARA>
<PARA> These statistics also demonstrate how little importance the ABC places on regional programming. Queensland, by far Australia's most decentralised State, should have more staff than the other States if the ABC has any real commitment to providing proper local programming. The ABC has different priorities. It shows no desire to provide the types of programs which its audiences want. When the ABC makes program cuts, it seems to attempt to extract maximum political advantage from the reductions by axing the favourite programs, the ones not available from commercial broadcasts. </PARA>
<PARA> Sadly, the ABC's priorities these days seem to be extremist social revolutionary programs, bizarre cultist radio and television broadcast and the promotion of fringe ideologies and crudity. Minority groups such as feminists, Aboriginals, mystic religions, homosexuals, et cetera, all get their own regular taxpayer-funded programs, while the views of the predominant white Anglo-Saxon Christian conservative Australians are given no air time. Even many of the long-established ABC departments seem to be expected to follow this new ABC ideology. </PARA>
<PARA> By centralising its programs and networking them throughout the country, the ABC is able to better guarantee that the editorial philosophies developed by its management are transmitted to all Australians. No-one in even the most remote regional area is permitted to have any creative originality. </PARA>
<PARA> The ABC is becoming an elitist cocoon, feeding arrogantly on self-congratulations and a cloistered oblivion to the wishes of the public. The ABC rarely responds positively to criticisms or suggestions. Complainants invariably are dismissed with a `we know best' attitude. </PARA>
<PARA> The ABC has many friends; many listeners, many viewers, many members of parliament, many people in rural and regional Australia love the ABC and would do anything they could to get it back on track. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ET4">Mr BEVIS</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Brisbane)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(1.37)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier this year, my attention was drawn to a circular distributed by a child-care centre within my electorate, the Nurseryland Early Childhood Learning Centre. The circular that was sent to parents informed them of a number of important events. Firstly, it says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Families-as of the first of January, 1991, parents of our centres will receive-fee relief-50 hours of care could cost as low as $15.00 a week. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed that circular properly advertised the very worthwhile initiative of the Hawke Labor Government to introduce fee relief extending the opportunity for child-care to many low income families. However, the circular had a bite in the tail when it went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>At present, a wage increase for the staff is being arbitrated. Administration of fee relief will be more time consuming and will add further cost. Taking into account the above, there will be a `fee increase'. </PARA>
<PARA>Now the magnitude of the fee increase introduced by this particular child-care service went well beyond the bounds of that applying elsewhere and well beyond the bounds of the justification to which I just referred. </PARA>
<PARA> I have received a number of complaints from my constituents about this child-care centre and its intentions-in fact, its practice now-to increase fees. I might just relate one of those to the House. In a letter from one parent to the centre, the parent wrote:</PARA>
<PARA>I must say, though, I was astounded to receive your Newsletter advising that After School care would be increased to $100 a week for 2 children from the $59 which I am presently paying. This represents an increase of over 69%. </PARA>
<PARA>The parent went on to point out that in school holidays, the increase in cost was 43 per cent. It was also pointed out that inquiries to other centres in the vicinity had revealed that their fees were lower for full time care and, in fact, they provided meals which this particular centre did not provide. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to examine the claims of the centre in seeking to extract from my constituents additional moneys over and above what is the case elsewhere. They advanced two grounds: firstly, administration of the fee relief scheme is a burden and an administrative cost; secondly, wages have gone up and, therefore, they have to increase the fee. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to the first point, it is patently obvious, if only by reference to other child-care centres, that that is not the case and, in fact, there is a very limited administrative burden and negligible cost, if any, imposed upon child-care centres in being able to administer the scheme. As the letter says elsewhere, it is in fact a boon to the industry. It is an assistance to the industry in expanding the clientele and in expanding the use of the centres. It is in no way a cost or overhead that should be used as an excuse for passing on increased profit-taking. </PARA>
<PARA> That leaves the second point about salary increases. That is the normal catchcry we hear any time any producer or supplier wishes to increase the price to the consumer. Somewhere along the line they will tell us that wages have gone up; therefore we have to pay more. </PARA>
<PARA> I did some investigation about what was happening with wages of employees of these child-care centres in Queensland and discovered that those employees were receiving wage increases. In December last year the Industrial Commission in Queensland approved a second increase for child-care employees, in line with the structural efficiency principles of the Commission. The increase for the director of the centre and the group leaders was $15 per week and for all other employees-and that is most of the people engaged in these centres-the increase was $12.50 per week. That represents an increase in salary of only approximately 4 per cent. That is certainly nothing paralleling the 59 per cent increase the centre is seeking to pass on. </PARA>
<PARA> There was an increase in allowances of 3 per cent, but again that could hardly be used to justify the sort of increase which is claimed by the Nurseryland Child-care Centre. After telling parents that their fee would be increased for 1991, the circular said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . however, I will cover the costs of such increases until the 1st of January, 1991, so that no burden will be placed on you over Christmas. </PARA>
<PARA>How magnanimous is that? With an increase of 3 per cent and 4 per cent and no additional costs in the administration for fee relief which is being used as the basis for an increase, the management then turns around and says to the parents of these children, `We will look after those additional costs until the first of January'. </PARA>
<PARA> The real crunch, though, is that the salary increases did not apply until 4 February, five weeks after the fees were increased on the justification of increased salaries. Not only was there no justification based on salaries for the extent of the increase, but the excuse given and the magnanimous hand held out to the parents that, `We will look after those additional burdens; we will bear the brunt of those costs for you until the first of January', is a blatant misrepresentation of the true situation because, in fact, there was no salary increase until February-five weeks later. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to say that this matter has also been drawn to the attention of the Queensland Government and that the Queensland Minister for Family Services has also commenced action to ensure that this sort of practice, which I understand has occurred in a couple of centres in Queensland, is put to rest-and so it should be. </PARA>
<PARA> I wrote to the centre management on 5 February when I was first informed of this situation, telling it of my serious concern about the reports. I sought from the centre on 5 February a reply seeking its urgent response to the concerns raised about the fee structure and the issues which I had mentioned. To date I have received no response whatsoever from the Nurseryland child-care centre and I imagine that, in the light of the investigations that I have undertaken, I am unlikely to receive a response in the future. But it is clear from the information that has been made available that the magnitude of the increase initiated by the child-care centre is without justification. There is no doubt that as with other things there would be, in the normal course of events, an increase in the cost to parents. There is, however, no basis for the claim that the increase is based on wage increases. That is not the case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the past two weeks my office has made representations on behalf of textile specialist, David Powers, and the people of Seymour to retain an important industry in their town. Last year Ansett Knitting Mills went into receivership. The mills had been contracted to process extra fine wool into high quality garments using two 27 gauge</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>fully fashioned knitting machines, which were the only ones in Australia capable of handling such superfine yarn. </PARA>
<PARA> David Powers saw the opportunity to continue to use the factory and its machines but these machines, leased by Ansett, were sold prior to auction to an overseas buyer. Mr Powers tried every avenue to stop this happening. When there is a demand for fine wool and the value added products, it is incredible that these machines, costing half a million dollars each to import as replacements, should be lost. This Government, which says that it wants to build a competitive Australia, did nothing to help. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased to announce that a group of businessmen, headed by the State Liberal politician Jeff Kennett, believe that they are able to purchase one machine and that by later this afternoon the matter should be resolved.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For much of our history since Federation, Australians have been buffered against the processes of government. At election after election, voters have been patted on the head and given election handouts funded by borrowed money in exchange for votes. Who foots the bill for these exercises in short term political expediency? The taxpayer-the very person who has since suffered from the lack of foresight and long term planning of earlier Australian governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Hawke Government has striven to rectify this position. For the first time in the history of government in Australia, our domestic Budget produces a surplus, rather than a deficit. In these difficult times this should be acknowledged.

<PARA> Many people will be familiar with the product glace apricots. Glace apricots in South Australia are produced at the Gawler Park factory of Mr Cliff Thorn. Glace apricots are not unlike dried apricots except that they are a much sweeter and much fleshier form of halved apricot. You will be pleased to know, Mr Speaker, that this labour intensive horticultural industry is in fact unable to meet the demand for its product in the United States of America. I was surprised at that because labour intensive industries have invariably found it very difficult to survive. Yet here is Mr Thorn who, as a result of the quality of his product, is unable to meet the demand for that product in this niche market in the United States of America. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the way the United States of America conducts its business, I think it is a particular commendation of Mr Thorn that he can take a labour intensive horticultural industry and find that he is successfully not only meeting an export demand but finding that demand is exceeding his supply. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a good one, all right. It asserts that, `if a goods and services tax were used to replace the present wholesale sales tax system, then gross domestic product would increase by between 0.5 and 1 per cent or by up to $4 billion'. The Deputy Leader relies on an Orani analysis commissioned by the Business Council of Australia reported in the Australian on 15 January. As it happens, I have a copy of the study.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For the benefit of honourable members, it shows that `if nominal wage rates did not change'-that is, if prices rose but wages stayed the same-`the consumer price index (CPI) would increase by 1.72 per cent'-in other words, real wages would fall by 1.72 per cent-`the Government's surplus would increase by 0.53 per cent of outlays, real GDP would increase by 0.7 per cent and aggregate employment would increase by 0.97'. That increase in real GDP of 0.7 is what the Deputy Leader of the Opposition relies upon. This is with a totally uncompensated increase of 1.72 per cent in the CPI, which is his model.</PARA>
<PARA> But the study went on to say that it-the study:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . recognises that assuming constant nominal wage rates in the presence of such a substantial increase in the CPI is unrealistic. It therefore computes what would happen if, instead, real wage rates were unchanged, which is the most plausible assumption, given an uncompensated consumption tax.</PARA>
<PARA>This is what would happen by contrast: `the CPI increases by 2.54 per cent; the Government surplus falls by 0.85 per cent; real GDP falls by 0.58'-rather than rising by 0.7 it actually goes down by 0.6; `aggregate employment falls by 0.79 per cent; rural output falls by 1.21 per cent; mining output falls by 1.65 per cent; and the textile, clothing and footwear industry falls by 1.22'.</PARA>
<PARA> In other words, here we have straight into print the Deputy Leader of the Opposition saying that GDP is rising by 0.5 to 1 per cent. But, if one reads the study further, one will see that it says that it is basically unrealistic to believe that a 1.72 per cent rise in the CPI would produce anything other than an adjustment to real wages. With real wages maintained, we actually have falls from a goods and services tax by 0.58 per cent of GDP. The fact is that the Liberals cannot do a deal with the trade unions and so real wages would rise.</PARA>
<PARA> But the most interesting part of the study-which is linked to the same point-is this:</PARA>
<PARA>With wages linked to consumer prices, increases in consumer prices have strongly adverse effects on employment and output. Thus, in an environment of fixed real wages, the concentration of the goods and services tax on consumption goods is a disadvantage for this tax relative to the wholesale tax.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the study damns the consumption tax against the wholesale tax if it has an emphasis on consumption goods if real wages are maintained. The study goes on to say this:</PARA>
<PARA>As we have just explained, with wages linked to consumer prices, the relatively heavy incidence of the wholesale tax on capital goods gives it an advantage-</PARA>
<PARA>it gives the wholesale tax an advantage-</PARA>
<PARA>(not a disadvantage) relative to the goods and services tax.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition quotes the study, but the study actually says that, if real wages are adjusted and maintained, the wholesale sales tax is superior to a goods and services tax. This is in the study he quotes. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition cannot help himself. Talk about a hapless amateur! The Deputy Leader of the Opposition goes and quotes a study. I have the press statement and I will get it; I do not want to leave anything out. Here it is:</PARA>
<PARA>The GST would boost national output by up to $4 billion.</PARA>
<PARA>That compares with over $1.7 billion for the March Statement estimates . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The fact of the matter is that the same study says it is unrealistic to believe that we can lift the consumer price index by 2 per cent and not see real wages rise by 2 per cent. After all, we do not want any conversation with the unions, so there will be no agreed adjustment. So wages equilibrate with the movement in the consumer price index and what happens? Gross domestic product goes down, but then the study says that the wholesale sales tax is superior to the consumption tax.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is another press statement from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition. He raced in with the help of one of the accountancy firms to make these fallacious claims. He said that `goods used in most pre-production activities were already exempt'. That is dead wrong. The majority were not sales tax exempt. The second point he made was that `goods relating to the ordering of raw materials were exempted in the last Budget'. That is wrong. The exemption was related solely to computers. The third point he made was that the proposed exemption for training will only apply to manufacturers. That is wrong. It also extends to mining and primary industry. So three charges, dead wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But the fact is that he goes on to argue that we should be further relieving business inputs from taxation-that is, that there should be further relief to production beyond those measures. Yesterday he was talking about wholesaling, about the relief of business inputs. Now in doing so, he advocates the introduction of a goods and services tax and points to the Business Council of Australia study, which I referred to a few minutes ago. That study, prepared for the Business Council by two academics, was used by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition to support the replacement of the wholesale sales tax with a goods and services tax, but the study reveals the true implications of removing any more of the tax burden on business inputs.</PARA>
<PARA> In the study which the Council had commissioned, it has a goods and services tax simply replacing the wholesale sales tax. So that is one at about 6 to 7 per cent. In other words, it is a very modest consumption tax. The study shows the increase in taxation due to the GST over certain categories of consumption goods and services; in other words, if we want to relieve business inputs, we have to put them somewhere else. This is what it shows: a 7 per cent GST on meat, dairy products, fruit and vegetables, margarine, flour and cereals, bread, cakes and biscuits-that is, total groceries-raises $1 billion. On clothing and footwear it raises $357m; on mechanical repairs, $222m; on banking and insurance, $1.5 billion; and on welfare and religious institutions, $200m. In other words, if we want to relieve taxes on business inputs, we relieve them at the expense of putting them on to food, clothing, mechanical repairs, banking and religious institutions.</PARA>
<PARA> This is a study which the Deputy Leader of the Opposition quoted from. It relates to all food.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Including baby food. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition would like to relieve the tax on business inputs. He is going around saying, `What the Government has done by relieving tax on production is not enough. We ought to be relieving tax on wholesaling and a whole lot of related activities with a goods and services tax. This Government will not bite the bullet on a goods and services tax'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But of course, money does not come from thin air. The money to relieve the tax on the business inputs has got to come from somewhere else. Let us say it was a GST, a full blooded one, of the variety that those opposite want to introduce, at about 15 per cent. We would not be looking at $1 billion on groceries, but $2 billion; $700m on clothing and footwear; $500m on mechanical repairs; $3 billion on banking and insurance; and $400m on welfare and religious institutions. That is what those opposite are about. But they will not specify what the tax rate would be, or what the breadth of the goods and services tax would be, because they do not want to admit that they want to relieve business inputs and cut the top marginal rate by taxing groceries at $2 billion; clothing and footwear at $700m; mechanical repairs at $500m; banking and insurance at $3 billion; and welfare and religious institutions at $400m.</PARA>
<PARA> In other words, the visiting professor should show some of the courage that he talks about by putting something specific to his idea as he visits the goods and services tax about all of these things. He should get up and tell the welfare and religious organisations how he is going to take $400m from them. He should go and tell Australian families how he is going to take $2 billion from them, and he should go and tell the clothing and footwear industry how he is going to take $700m out of the ordinary family's pay packet. He should go and tell them that he is going to take $3 billion out of their banking and financial services, and he should explain that that is to relieve the tax on business inputs. Instead of talking drivel and in code, he should tell them what he really means. Tell them how he is going to rip them to pieces to provide so-called relief in the tax on business inputs. If he does not want to tell them that, he should not get up and criticise our measures, which are specific, with the waffle that he specialises in.</PARA>

<PARA> When people move into the house, the Opposition would then tax the meat they put on the table, the dairy products, the fruit and vegetables, the margarine they spread on their toast, the flour and cereals, the bread and cakes, the biscuits, the clothing and the footwear. When they go to the bank to pay their mortgage, they will pay a tax on the service of their mortgage at 15 per cent. The tax rate will be the same everywhere; all investment and financial services will be taxed at the same rate.</PARA>
<PARA> The welfare and religious organisations, which I understand are bearing the wholesale sales tax reasonably well, will then be up for about $400m as a result of the Opposition's goods and services tax-the one it will not own up to in detail; the one it talks about vaguely, trying to reflect some merit upon itself as having the courage to introduce; but the one it will not specify as to the range of goods affected, which goods are exempted, and what the rate of tax will be. This is the real goods and services tax, which the Opposition knows, without an adjustment to wage rates, will blow the inflation rate to pieces. It is that goods and services tax which the cowardice of the Opposition will not permit the Australian public to know about, but between now and polling day they will know anyway-from us.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable member for Gilmore. He popped up yesterday; we will deal with him again today. Of course, his views would be shared by the Leader of the Opposition. Unfortunately, as honourable members will see, they both have a bit of a problem. Let me inform the House of the role of the IRC, and the problem of the Opposition will become very clear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The IRC is specifically mentioned in the waterfront reform process document known as the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority (WIRA) in-principle agreement. Yesterday the honourable member for Gilmore did a bit of quick sleuthing-good on you, John-and obligingly the honourable member put out a press release. Unfortunately for him, he did a bit more. I want honourable members to dwell upon what the honourable member for Gilmore had to say; they should get it clearly in their minds. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister's representation of events would mean that the arbitration process, if part of WIRA, would be subject to the In-Principle Agreement, or bound by it, or was replaced or overtaken by it. This is plainly not so . . .</PARA>
<PARA>He concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>It would doubtless come as a great surprise to Commissioner Sweeney if it were so!</PARA>
<PARA>The only surprise Commissioner Sweeney would have would be to understand just how ignorant of the facts were both the honourable member for Gilmore and the Leader of the Opposition, because they have not gone to page two of the decision of Commissioner Sweeney. I am going to share with the House the words of Commissioner Sweeney. Before I share those words of Commissioner Sweeney with the House, let me just remind honourable members of what the honourable member for Gilmore said:</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister's representation of events would mean that the arbitration process, if part of WIRA, would be subject to the In-Principle Agreement . . .</PARA>
<PARA> It would doubtless come as a great surprise to Commissioner Sweeney. . .</PARA>
<PARA>What did Commissioner Sweeney have to say, on page 2? He said this:</PARA>
<PARA>In determining the issues I have had regard to:</PARA>
<PARA> - that the negotiations and final agreement shall be subject to the terms of the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority (WIRA) In-Principle Agreement;</PARA>
<PARA>So the honourable member for Gilmore says that Commissioner Sweeney would be surprised if he were to find this out, but he spelt it out in absolute detail. I repeat it for the House:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the negotiations and final agreement shall be subject to the terms of the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority (WIRA) in-principle agreement.</PARA>
<PARA>I conclude by inviting the honourable member for Gilmore to consider his press statement, go away and read it, and remember that this is what he said:</PARA>

<PARA> It would doubtless come as a great surprise to Commissioner Sweeney if it were so!</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YD4">Mr HAWKE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let met take up the last part of the question first, this snide throwaway line about my mates in the trade union movement. The fact that I have good relations and friendly relations with the trade union movement is not something that I resist or walk away from or am ashamed of, and I assert with pride the fact that not only I but also my relevant Ministers have excellent, friendly and cooperative relations with the trade union movement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It may be said that all we are saying is that that friendly relationship gives us a warm inner glow, but no, I prefer to test whether this country has benefited from the relationship between this Government and the trade union movement. I suggest that there are three or four objective tests that can be applied to test whether in fact the people of this country have benefited from the fact that, instead of the 7 1/2 years of massive confrontation between government and the trade unions which characterised the coalition's period in office between 1977 and 1983, we have substituted that with a cooperative working arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that the fact that there has been a 10 1/2 per cent reduction in real non-farm unit labour costs over this period could have occurred only because, as a result of the relationship between this Government and the trade union movement, the trade unions were prepared to substitute increases in money wages for increases in the social wage. It may not be beyond the comprehension of some honourable members opposite-it certainly will be beyond some-that that simply means that, instead of money wage costs being imposed upon employers, the community, the taxpayers, absorb through the social wage some of the money costs that otherwise would have been paid by employers in higher money wage costs. That is the only way in which we could have had that 10 1/2 per cent reduction in real non-farm unit labour costs. There has simply been an absorption by the community of some of the labour costs that would otherwise have been paid directly by the employers.</PARA>
<PARA> It did not end there. Because the trade unions, out of this friendly, cooperative relationship with the Government, were prepared to accept lower money wages, what we have witnessed in this period of government is a significant shift from wages to profits. When honourable members opposite left office, profits were at an abysmally low level, and it was this Labor Government, with its mates in the trade union movement, who effected a change in the distribution of national income from wages to profits. That is what the relationship between this Government and the trade union movement did.</PARA>
<PARA> The third fact, following from the first two, is that as a result of the fact that the trade unions, the mates of this Government, were prepared to accept lower real wages we were able to have a rate of employment growth in this country four times faster than those opposite when in government. That is because we had a favourable, friendly cooperative relationship with the trade union movement. So I dismiss the question with the contempt it deserves.</PARA>

Is this correct, and could the Minister inform the House whether the responsibility for such aids as burns suits is in fact a Commonwealth or a State responsibility?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2027" SPEAKER="Howe The Hon B.L." NAMEID="EH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BATMAN" MINISTERIAL="COMMUNITY SERVICES AND HEALTH" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EH4">Mr HOWE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for Phillip for the question. The Channel 9 report has been based on assertions that are demonstrably false, yet they were presented as if they were facts. Burns suits are not excluded under Medicare on the grounds that they are seen as having a cosmetic function, as was suggested in the news item. All States and Territories-and I repeat, all States and Territories-except New South Wales, regard burns suits as an integral part of a burns victim's treatment regime.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Burns suits have an essential function in the management of burns scars. The suits minimise and control the formation of disfiguring scar tissue and assist in the prevention of contractures. In fact, informal inquiries reveal that New South Wales is the only State which expects patients to pay for burns suits. All other States and Territories supply suits free via their public hospital systems. In fairness, however, New South Wales provides the first set of two suits free of charge. Thereafter, charges of up to $2,000 for replacement sets are levied. The New South Wales public hospital system also meets the ongoing costs.</PARA>
<PARA> The unfortunate thing is that burns victims in New South Wales are being financially disadvantaged because of the decision of the New South Wales Minister for Health, Mr Collins, to levy charges. It would seem, from the Channel 9 news item last week, that Mr Collins's discriminatory actions are being aided and abetted by the media.</PARA>
<PARA> Medicare is often seen as the most appropriate scheme to assist in the provision of aids and appliances, such as burns suits, wheelchairs and crutches. However, Medicare is intended to provide access to doctors' services and public hospital accommodation and treatment free of charge. While the value of these garments in the treatment of burns victims is recognised, there is no program within my portfolio which enables the funding of such items.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth provides around $3.5 billion a year to the States and Territories under the Medicare arrangements to facilitate the availability of public hospital accommodation and treatment, and State and Territory health authorities decide on the funding of services, including ancillary items such as burns suits.</PARA>
<PARA> If there is one thing that makes the life of a Minister for health difficult, whether it is at a Commonwealth or a State level, it is the kind of tactics that would promote an issue in which there is, in the community, a great deal of concern. As the honourable member for Phillip knows, and indeed as all members of this House know, there are circumstances in the health portfolio which are extraordinarily difficult for families, which require a deal of sensitivity and compassion, and which ought to be above politics.</PARA>
<PARA> At a time when the Commonwealth has agreed to discuss with the States the whole question of financial arrangements, including policy issues and financial arrangements in the area of health, I regret the fact that the Minister for Health in New South Wales has chosen to go in for shroud waving exercises to draw out in the community attitudes to this Government which are unfair, which do not reflect the truth of the arrangements and which set New South Wales and its conservative Government against all the other States and Territories in this country which understand the arrangements and certainly do not seek to score these kinds of cheap political points.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Treasurer. Ivanhoe is a small remote town in western New South Wales, which is isolated after rain. Its nearest neighbouring town is 150 kilometres away. Like many rural communities, it is suffering the effects of the rural depression. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia, the only bank in the town, is to be closed. Given that the Treasurer directed the Commonwealth Bank to bail out the ailing State Bank of Victoria, will he do the same for the Ivanhoe branch of the Commonwealth Bank or is its closure an indication of things to come in other rural centres of Australia as the Commonwealth Bank readjusts to pay for the Victorian State Bank?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2028" SPEAKER="Keating The Hon P.J." NAMEID="NH4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="BLAXLAND" MINISTERIAL="DEPUTY PRIME MINISTER; TREASURER" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But the honourable member wants to sell the Commonwealth Bank and make it `efficient', as he says. He wants mass closures across the country. He wants to privatise it and he wants mass closures-but not in Ivanhoe. Is that right? Is that what he is about? There is always a dichotomy between the song he sings in rural Australia and that which he preaches at the highest levels of the coalition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the highest level of the coalition we always see hard nosed, vicious attitudes, whether they be in relation to privatisation or to social policy, as my colleague the Minister for Community Services and Health just mentioned in relation to burns suits. After Budgets we always hear how the National Party would do something else in its local constituencies to buy itself a vote, but down on the front line the Leader of the Opposition and his deputy are trying to outline the toughest prescriptions that one could imagine. They advocate that any sort of social amenity which is supplied and provided by banks such as the Commonwealth Bank be basically stripped away so that their asset value and their return can be maximised. That is what it is all about.</PARA>
<PARA> We are the people who have kept the Commonwealth Bank going. We are the only people who ever gave it a capital injection. We are the only Government which ever took an interest in the bank-let alone the fact that we established it. We have now made it the largest trading bank in the Commonwealth. The fact is that the management of that bank produces a strong profit for the Commonwealth every year. The return on the people's funds is strong. Questions of management of the bank, which go to the value of each particular branch or the service to that community, is a matter for the bank board.</PARA>
<PARA> In deference to the honourable member, I will pass on his query to the Commonwealth Bank board and its management. I will do that for him. But every time his colleagues opposite start giving us the hard-nosed policy of privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank I want him to stand up and tell them that they should not be closing small branches which the honourable member believes provide a service to remote rural communities. If he can sing that song consistently then we will take him more seriously when he asks his questions.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the honourable member for his question, and yes, my attention has been drawn today to a press statement issued by the Leader of the National Party in which he says that the Prices Surveillance Authority should be abolished and that excessive regulation and interference in industry has been responsible for pain currently being felt right across Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Apart from the fact that he is wrong, let me state from the outset that this Government will not be abolishing the PSA. Let me tell him why, and in addition indicate that not only will we not be abolishing the PSA but also, together with carrying out reviews of the Trade Practices Commission and other regulatory mechanisms, we will be looking at more effective ways by which this Government can ensure there is effective competition in the community and by which the benefits of micro-economic reform will be passed on to consumers.</PARA>
<PARA> Let us just look at the role the PSA has played in this regard. Take petrol-and this is very important for the Leader of the National Party. What the Prices Surveillance Authority did after the Government froze the price of petrol following the invasion of Kuwait was to change the formula and stagger the increases by which world parity price would have flowed through. The consequence was that, through the period of the Gulf crisis, petrol prices in this country were between 2c and 8c a litre lower than would have been the case had the PSA not intervened.</PARA>
<PARA> Is the Leader of the National Party going to tell members of his constituency in rural Australia that, by the abolition of the PSA, they can pay more for petrol? That is what those opposite would have brought about if they had abolished the PSA. Whose side is the Leader of the National Party on? He comes in here with stupid statements from a press release, statements which are not thought through and which ignore the facts.</PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what the PSA has done in recent times in relation to micro-economic reform. Because this Government is serious not just about implementing micro-economic reform but, in addition, ensuring that the benefits pass on to consumers, we have revamped the role of the PSA. The PSA has been involved in the monitoring of coastal shipping, harbour towage, waterfront and airlines-all of the areas that honourable members opposite want to tackle us about from time to time. We are not only introducing the reforms; we are ensuring through the PSA that the benefits of those reforms will be passed on to the consumers. What would those opposite do? Apart from not being able even to tackle the reforms, except by talking about them, they would abolish the very mechanism that can ensure that the benefits do go back to consumers.</PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the National Party also says that there is excessive regulation and interference in industry. Let me just remind him of recent decisions that the PSA has taken. First of all, it recommended deregulation of petrol pricing and the pricing of liquefied petroleum gas. It has argued by way of a report and recommendation to this Government that restrictive copyright provisions in relation to books and records should be reduced. Is that excessive regulation? Is that not freeing up the opportunity for these markets to operate more effectively?</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Leader of the National Party is completely out of step. I want to quote from a report that I have just happened to receive from Price Waterhouse. I notice that on a number of occasions the Treasurer has been saying that those opposite have been getting some of their information from this group. Price Waterhouse has this to say in relation to the PSA:</PARA>
<PARA>Given the recent profile of the Prices Surveillance Authority as a key part of the competition policy armoury, we would expect even greater involvement by the PSA, in concert with the Trade Practices Commission, in scrutinising the pricing behaviour by firms benefiting from microeconomic reform and other policy changes which lower their cost structures.</PARA>
<PARA>If that is not enough, let me just ask the Leader of the Opposition: who speaks for the coalition in relation to this matter? On Wednesday in the Age in an article dealing, interestingly enough, with the PSA's report on records, the honourable member for Higgins, who I understand is the shadow spokesman in relation to these things, was referred to in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA>The federal Opposition once said that it would get rid of the PSA, although its consumer affairs spokesman, Mr Peter Costello, is now not so sure.</PARA>
<PARA> He thinks the PSA's role has `changed for the better', from one of regulation to providing research and advice on micro-economic reform.</PARA>
<PARA>All I can say is that he ought to come down to the other end of the shadow front bench, because he might learn something. He has picked up things as a result of our banter, and this is one of the important ones. I congratulate him on it, but I think it demonstrates again the confusion that reigns on the other side of the Parliament. Who speaks for those opposite in terms of policy initiatives?</PARA>
<PARA> All I can do is repeat the point I made at the outset: this Government not only will not be abolishing the PSA but also it will be ensuring that it plays an ongoing, continuing and strengthened role in ensuring that the benefits of micro-economic reform are passed on to the consumers. We will look to their interests; the other side will not.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NH4">Mr KEATING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course I regret any hurt that members of the public suffer by the operations of economic policy. The fact is that, as I have said often in the House, those impacts reflect on the Government and on me. Again, I am not here to be popular; I am here to do what is right. What was right was to cut the level of spending back within gross domestic product (GDP). The Government tried to do that in the most sympathetic way possible so that a more catastrophic adjustment was not imposed upon Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the slowdown in the economy was exacerbated to become a recession by virtue of the very rapid withdrawal of credit by banks, by the war in the Gulf, and by other pessimistic influences in the economy. The correction in credit growth from a rate of 20 per cent a year over the last five years to an annual rate of 10 per cent for the last year, but an annualised rate of 5 per cent for the last six months, is one of the reasons why there has been a greater problem in the economy as distinct from-as the Governor of the United States central bank said recently in a similar sense-the credit crunch which is occurring in that country. Exactly the same conditions obtain in the United States.</PARA>
<PARA> We ought to remember that the recession in Australia is repeated in the United States, Britain, Canada, New Zealand and a number of other countries. It is flowing basically from the correction of economic policy following the stock market crash of 1987 and the terms of trade boost to national incomes in Australia following the increase in commodity prices in 1987 and 1988. Because of those factors-because of the monetary conditions that were established so as to avoid an international depression in 1988, just as there was an international depression in 1930-31 coming from the 1929 stock market crash, and this crash was larger than the fall in 1929-I think the world economy and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development economies generally succeeded in avoiding a depression; but the result was, two years later, a recession.</PARA>
<PARA> Better a recession than a catastrophic depression. It just shows that international economic policy has, on this occasion, worked well in avoiding an international depression. But it has not worked to the point that the smoothest of adjustments can smooth down demand without cutting into GDP.</PARA>
<PARA> I am quite happy to say that I regret any pain which the Australian public is wearing, but I have never heard such declarations from the Opposition about the one million unemployed, the smashed profits, the broken investments, and the smashed lives that resulted from its years of indolence and neglect. Perhaps we could hear some belated mea culpa from the Opposition for its tardiness in running this economy over the last 40 years, particularly over the seven years before 1983.</PARA>

He met the Emir of Kuwait and, in fact, he visited Kuwait City itself where he spoke to the Prime Minister and other senior Ministers and officials planning the quite mammoth task of reconstructing Kuwait. All the people Dr Blewett met made a point of thanking him both for the contribution that Australia had made to the liberation of Kuwait and for the fact that Australia was among the first to make such a contribution.

<PARA> The sincerity of Kuwait's gratitude for Australia's principled stance on the Gulf crisis was evident in the warmth of the reception received by Dr Blewett and in the assurances that Dr Blewett received that Kuwait was eager for Australian companies to participate in the reconstruction of Kuwait. Dr Blewett and his delegation, which I am pleased to say included representatives of a number of Australian companies, emphasised the ability of Australian companies to provide goods and services which Kuwait will undoubtedly need in the coming months and years.</PARA>

The figures show in particular that there has been a dramatic decline in full time employment of over 90,000 which has been substantially offset by a rise of 61,500 in part time employment. In the package of measures announced on Tuesday, what is the Government going to do for those workers facing retrenchment and for workers being forced to work reduced hours?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2032" SPEAKER="Dawkins The Hon J.S." NAMEID="9E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="FREMANTLE" MINISTERIAL="EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge that there has been a decline in employment in the last month. It is important to recall that we should not necessarily think that the statistics of one month will be repeated in future months. Nevertheless, there has been, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister says, a dramatic decline in full time employment in this country. As he also indicates, this has been partially offset by a strong rise in the number of people in part time employment. So the net effect is not as great as would otherwise have been had we not had that increase in part time employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before indicating the measures that the Government intends to take, I should say that these figures are not entirely unexpected because, as I have said on other occasions, the labour market tends to be the last to show up the effects of the recession. Similarly, it will be the last to show up as the upturn in the recovery takes a hold. Nevertheless, the Government is concerned about the consequences of these declines in the labour market and has taken some measures which were announced by the Prime Minister last Tuesday.</PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the measures of assisting employers to keep on apprentices who might be at risk of retrenchment, and apart from increasing wage subsidies under Jobstart and the period during which those subsidies are payable, the Government has already increased the number of places available under the Skillshare and Jobtrain programs.</PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer to a particular program which is entirely new-TASK, or Training and Skills. Here, we are going to give assistance to employers to keep on people who otherwise might be retrenched who might be engaged in realistic or additional training opportunities. In other words, we recognise that at a time of downturn this is a good opportunity for employers, if they can, to put some of their employees who are perhaps not fully engaged on production into training activities. This program is designed to assist those employers who might not be able to fully occupy their employees but who otherwise might be prepared to place them in some realistic, on-the-job training. The motor vehicle industry is such an industry where this might be appropriate. We look forward to proposals coming forward from industry, because we think that this is a realistic way in which we can keep people in the labour force who otherwise might have been removed from it.</PARA>

However, as the Prime Minister again failed today to include that piece of relevant information, why was the Prime Minister allowed to repeat his answer today in response to a dorothy dixer and will standing order 146 be policed in future?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome this opportunity very much to respond to the industry statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) last Tuesday. I will begin by attempting to set that statement in perspective-the perspective that I have gleaned in recent months as I have gone all around Australia talking to workers, managers and company bosses. It is a perspective I have got from the workers at SPC Ltd, who have fought for a new wage deal at the enterprise level to save their company and their jobs. It is a perspective that I have got by going well over one kilometre down a mine in Mount Isa; by walking the assembly line and factory floor at the Ford Motor Company of Australia Ltd in Geelong and at Nissan Australia's manufacturing plant in Clayton; by walking through the timber industry, from the forest to the plantation, to the sawmill, to the timber plant, to the woodchip mill in Western Australia; by talking to those who want to build pulp mills in northern Tasmania and Gippsland; by talking to those who mine uranium at Ranger, and those who add value to the mineral sands in Western Australia, and those who want to mine Coronation Hill or build a space station at Cape York or a very fast train project along the eastern coast of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I report with regret to this House that the people of Australia are scared-they are genuinely scared. Their confidence has been shattered by the recession they were promised would not happen, but that they then had to have. They clearly recognise that we have problems that are very real and very deep seated. But they are more than prepared to pitch in, do their bit, change their ways and lift their game, provided they are given a clear sense of direction and provided, of course, that others pull their weight too. But they are crying out for honesty and they are crying out for genuine leadership-not rationalisations of the past, not false hopes, not more hypocrisy and certainly not more false claims about ministerial courage. </PARA>
<PARA> Right now, there are a lot of things that they simply cannot understand all over Australia. They cannot understand how a country that had everything going for it in a world which had been growing for longer than at any other time in the postwar period, has now been plunged into recession-the deepest and most protracted recession in this country since the 1930s. They cannot understand why the Prime Minister and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) are always measuring our performance against our past, when they know that we do not have to beat just ourselves but the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> People around Australia particularly cannot understand why the Treasurer continues to make false claims about how well we are doing, how far we are on track and how beautiful are the numbers. They know that if the Treasurer were the captain of the Titanic he would tell the passengers that he had just stopped for ice. In this sense, they just cannot understand an industry statement that simply does not deal with most of the problems that are affecting their industry-a statement which ignores exchange rates, interest rates, transportation costs, telephone costs, wage and industrial relations problems and understates the problems in other areas, such as on the waterfront. </PARA>
<PARA> Those in the car industry, for example, cannot understand why the industry statement would deliberately heighten their fears by foreshadowing further tariff cuts but fail to boost their confidence by addressing major infrastructure cost disadvantages that they know stopped them from producing and exporting more. For example, at Ford, they know that 30 per cent of the cost disadvantage comes from interest rates and exchange rates, 40 per cent from industrial relations and people factors, and 30 per cent from scale technology and other infrastructure factors. They have seen tariff cuts before which just seem to shrink their industry and, in some cases, cost them their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> The SPC workers just would not be able to understand how the industry statement could ignore the need to boost productivity, to trim labour costs and to change wage contracts in order to preserve jobs. Equally, they still cannot understand why the Victorian Government and the Federal Government sat back and let John Halfpenny and the Victorian Trades Hall Council thugs try to undo the deal they had done with the SPC management. Similarly, the workers at Heinz cannot understand why an unjustified union action meant that a significant amount of the tomato crop was lost and not canned. Indeed, workers generally cannot understand why they should boost productivity when the Government gives them a wage increase every year anyway. </PARA>
<PARA> They also cannot understand how the Government would be satisfied with boosting our waterfront productivity by 30 per cent-its objective-when other countries which were already more competitive than we are have boosted their productivity by up to 100 per cent. I cite as an example our near neighbour New Zealand. Equally, they cannot understand why, even if the Government achieves its projected productivity gains on the waterfront, the port of Melbourne will still be just 20 per cent as competitive as Singapore and 50 per cent as competitive as Yokohama. Car industry workers simply cannot understand how they are supposed to boost exports to New Zealand, yet they have to live with a shipping cost disadvantage which means it is cheaper to ship the cars via Japan than it is direct across the Tasman. </PARA>
<PARA> Others cannot understand, when the Prime Minister has committed to achieve five million international visitors a year by the year 2000, why he cannot deliver the third runway at Sydney Airport in eight years, especially when they read that Kuwait is about to build a new airport in just 100 days. They cannot understand, when the Prime Minister has committed to what he has described as sweeping reform of the nation's transport infrastructure, why the Government has failed to finish the national highway and cannot make a decision on the very fast train. </PARA>
<PARA> Australians cannot understand why, when we desperately need to export more, the Government sticks to its three-mine uranium policy, even when the Prime Minister himself admits that that policy is illogical. They cannot understand, when we need exports, why the Government cannot approve the mining of Coronation Hill for gold, especially when it was mined for uranium in the 1950s and 1960s. And they are even more appalled as they find out that the Government has created the illusion that Coronation Hill is in the tourist paradise of Yellow Waters, when it is actually 75 kilometres away. </PARA>
<PARA> They cannot understand, when we need more exports, why the Government played politics with the pulp mill at Wesley Vale and has allowed unnecessary environmental vetos and delays to block billions upon billions of dollars worth of worthy projects. Nor can they understand why effective competitive is precluded from Telecom Australia, when it could reduce telephone charges by 15 per cent on average. </PARA>
<PARA> They cannot understand why, when so many government business enterprises are, by standards of their competitors, performing so badly-for example, Qantas Airways Ltd-the Government does not put them fully into the private sector's hands and subject them to market disciplines. Equally, they cannot understand, when Labor governments have lost so much money in business ventures in Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria, why the Hawke Government can now actually contemplate doing it all again with another equity fund. </PARA>
<PARA> They cannot understand how we have a clever country, when the Government consistently debases the standing of our education system towards the lowest common denominator, thus losing our chance for excellence. They cannot understand why, when they are doing their bit, the Government is prepared to do only part of its job in last Tuesday's industry statement. </PARA>
<PARA> They cannot understand why, when they are tightening their belts, they can see State and Federal governments frittering away their budgets. They cannot understand how they are expected to save more, when the Government is so visibly saving less. In simple terms, average Australians cannot understand why they are losing their jobs but the Treasurer is still hanging onto his. </PARA>
<PARA> Few Australians would be unaware of our major economic problems. Inflation is still at around 7 per cent and our balance of payments deficit is some $18 billion, or still 4 1/2 per cent of our national production. Our debts are, in net terms, $131 billion, even though we are now in the midst of the deepest and most protracted recession in 50 or 60 years. Equally, most now accept that there are effectively just two options for dealing with these problems: either to continue to cut living standards, as this Government has done, to run up more debts overseas and to sell off even more of our country to foreigners; or the preferable alternative-to boost our national production, our exports and our capacity to compete with imports sufficiently to eliminate inflation and stabilise and ultimately reduce our debt. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, the second is the only acceptable option for most Australians, but what is not recognised is just how big a task it is to turn our country around, to turn its trading performance around. For example, our balance of payments deficit, as I said, is running at about $18 billion a year and national production is somewhere around $400 billion a year. In those terms, in effect, we need to boost our net exports by roughly $8 billion so as to reduce our balance of payments deficit to 2 1/2 per cent of national production, which the Treasurer himself has claimed is the minimum required to stabilise our debt. </PARA>
<PARA> To provide some sort of order of magnitude, to set that boost in perspective, that would be equivalent roughly to tripling the size of our recent wool exports; more than doubling our coking coal exports; boosting our manufactured exports by twice the increase since the middle 1980s; or achieving nearly 100 times the car exports of the Ford Motor Co. of Australia Ltd. Everyone should pause for a moment and focus on the extent to which we need to build new industries or to rebuild old ones in this country to achieve the export performance required to turn our country around. We have not faced anything like that sort of challenge at any time during the postwar period. </PARA>
<PARA> Against this background, it is absolutely essential that we accept that the only way we are going to achieve that sort of boost to our trading performance is for us as a nation to adopt best international practice as our objective; and that should be in everything we do-in labour productivity by industry, in the efficiency of our waterfront, in the efficiency of our transport system, in the efficiency of our telecommunications system, in everything we do. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not want to have just the No. 1 golfer in the world and we do not want to have just the No. 1 one-day cricket team in the world. We also want to have the No. 1 port in the world, the most cost effective airline system in the world, the most cost effective rail system in the world, the most cost effective telephone system in the world, and so on. In this regard, a very useful future role for the Industry Commission could be to identify, measure and monitor best international practice industry by industry and to set about educating workers, management and government as to just what needs to be done if we are to match the best in the world. John Ralph from the CRA group has produced a very interesting example of the sorts of comparisons that can be made. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>We benchmarked an Australian smelter with a US smelter. It allowed us to identify that, in the Australian operation-out of a total workforce of 830-we have to employ 108 people just to satisfy the additional holiday entitlements of the Australian workforce system compared with the American. </PARA>
<PARA>In my view, the Industry Commission did a fantastic job in educating people about tariffs. Why not have it do that in regard to best international practice? Given the size and the urgency of our need to boost our international competitiveness to best international practice, the single greatest failing of Tuesday's industry statement was its failure to embrace a full-blown package of structural reforms. The reason for this is clear. In fact, it is given indirectly in the statement on page 1.12. It said that we bear the onus to show how in a practical way faster change could be achieved:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . without poisoning the better industrial relations and investment environment we have created-without, in short, bringing the whole reform process to a grinding halt. </PARA>
<PARA>That was clearly meant to be an attack on the Opposition, but it is indeed the most revealing statement of just why this Government has failed to deliver what was required of it in this industry statement. It is really a statement of the limitations and the inadequacies of the Government's own policy position. In effect, it says that the Government cannot do any more; the Government cannot accelerate the pace of reform. Why? Because of the accord. The Government boasts, as did the Prime Minister in Question Time today, of its special relationship with the union movement. Ironically, it is this very relationship that is now stifling real reform. People do not have to believe me. They can go down to SPC Ltd or Heinz, taking two recent examples, and ask the workers. </PARA>
<PARA> The accord has failed in my view in three important respects. First, it has consistently given uncompetitive wage outcomes. Nominal unit labour costs have been roughly double those of our trading partners through the 1980s. Secondly, it has failed because it does disadvantage workers, the people it is most supposed to help, as they have had to endure five successive years of flat or falling real wages. Its third major failing is that is elevates the union leadership to de facto Cabinet Minister status, to where it has an effective veto over this Government and the reform process. </PARA>
<PARA> In simple terms my proposition is that this country cannot afford the accord. We desperately need to boost our productivity, and the accord provides little or no incentive for workers to do so. It has completely stifled the process of reform. For example, the only reason the Government did not adopt the broad-based goods and services tax in 1985 was that Bill Kelty and his union mates said no. This is undoubtedly why it was left out of Tuesday's industry statement, as well. The Government prefers instead simply to fiddle around with minor changes to the ramshackle system of indirect tax, thereby increasing its complexity. </PARA>
<PARA> Ironically, it was the Treasurer who ruled out this sort of fiddling in 1985. Our Treasurer no longer has the courage to do that. Unfortunately, as a result, Australians and our industries are denied the benefits of genuine taxation reform. Similarly, the main reason why the reform of the waterfront continues at a snail's pace, despite the Prime Minister's efforts in recent days to create an impression to the contrary, is again pressure from union leadership, reflecting the power of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU) and the Waterside Workers Federation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is obviously acutely sensitive to criticism about the snail's pace of its waterfront reform. Tuesday's statement saw the Prime Minister taking credit for the Conaust deal, and exaggerating the effectiveness of the retrenchment program and productivity gains. But in fact the whole waterfront reform process is in a shambles. As a result Australian industry is denied an efficient waterfront, and in the end Australian consumers pay. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, the road to reform in telecommunications was blocked by another left-wing union, the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association, which has steadfastly resisted privatisation and reform. So again genuine reform was blocked, and again the Australian consumer is stuck with paying, by world standards, ridiculous telephone and other telecommunications charges. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a host of other examples. If we take a look at the key areas of the Australian economy where reform is essential, we will find that it is frustrated by large, influential and mainly left-wing unions. We find this obstacle at all critical choke points of the Australian economy. Full privatisation is effectively blocked by the ACTU and a range of unions. Genuine land transport reform is hindered by, among others, the Transport Workers Union. The full potential gains of deregulation of the airline industry will be limited by the industrial power of the same union, and everyone knows about the militant and uncaring actions of the airport refuellers. In power generation and mining we have to deal with the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association, another large left-wing union, and of course in construction we have the militant Building Workers Industrial Union. </PARA>
<PARA> The power and the influence of the leaders of those unions extends beyond their industrial relations role. It extends to influencing Australian Labor Party policy through the unions' 60 per cent majority membership at ALP conferences and through the informal backroom deals by which the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have to check first with Bill Kelty and the ACTU to see just how far the unions will let them go. Even Bob Hogg, ALP National Secretary, can see political dangers in the undue influence which unions and their leaders wield within the ALP, and he wants to reduce the 60:40 ratio of union representation at Party conferences. </PARA>
<PARA> When we add to that the ridiculous deals which this Government has done with leaders of the green movement in relation to the environment and which have blocked major export projects even when they met the world's toughest environmental standards, we begin to understand the full extent of the policy paralysis of the Hawke-Keating Government and begin to understand the full extent of our lost opportunities as a nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister in the early part of his industry statement issued a number of challenges to the people of Australia. One particular challenge was:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . to make decisions and adopt the practices and attitudes which will enable this and succeeding generations to achieve those basic goals. </PARA>
<PARA>My challenge to the Prime Minister today is to live up to that rhetoric. Specifically I call on the Prime Minister to show the sort of leadership that people all over this country are crying out for, and that they certainly did not get in Tuesday's statement. </PARA>
<PARA> Since I became Leader of the Opposition roughly one year ago, the coalition has worked hard to provide leadership from opposition, to take decisions that are visibly in the national interest, rather than simply reflect the views and desires of particular sectional interests. </PARA>
<PARA> An essential part of this process has been to look forward rather than backward. Indeed, in a sense, it has involved jettisoning some of our past. In the last 12 months, for example, we have announced three major decisions: first, to effectively remove tariff protection by the year 2000; secondly, to pursue full-blooded competition in telecommunications with the privatisation of Telecom; and, thirdly, to adopt a broad-based goods and services tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Each of these decisions represents a significant step forward relative to our past. On industry protection, for example, although we have long supported lower protection, we have always stopped short of setting specific objectives. Last year we committed ourselves to the objective of negligible tariff protection by the year 2000. We did that as an essential part of a package of reform measures that we have advocated for some time. We feel it is important that protection be reduced in the context of other structural reforms designed to eliminate cost disadvantages on the waterfront, in shipping, in land transport, in the public sector, in taxation, in the labor market and so on. But to be clear, our commitment to lower protection is absolute. So is our commitment to genuine structural reform absolute. We simply believe that, to get maximum benefit, the two should be done in tandem. </PARA>
<PARA> I was, therefore, most pleased to see that the Prime Minister had moved towards-and I emphasise `towards'-our tariff decision in Tuesday's statement. I congratulate him on his move in this direction, although he will still have 25 per cent protection in the textile, clothing and footwear industries and 15 per cent protection in the auto industry by the year 2000. However, his major failing was, of course, not to put in place the appropriate package of structural reform measures to accompany the decision to reduce tariffs. </PARA>
<PARA> Our second decision in the course of the last year was to introduce full-blooded competition into the telecommunications industry and to privatise Telecom. Again, this was a decision which represented something of a break with the past. It has often been difficult for coalition parties to deal with the issue of telecommunications, and in particular Telecom, because of concerns about community service obligations and control of the Telecom ground network. We have now put these difficulties behind us, and in doing so we have taken a decision which is in sharp contrast to the Government's two-telephone policy. It is clearly one that is in the best interests of the people of Australia, offering us our best hope of achieving best international practice in telecommunications. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, there was our decision to adopt a broad-based goods and services tax as an essential structural reform, and as an essential part of the much needed reform of the total tax system. On this issue we have jettisoned quite a long history. I am told that Sir William McMahon, when Prime Minister, had Treasury officials consider overseas experience of the consumption tax. The idea was proposed but rejected by the Fraser Cabinet in 1978, and again in 1980, and it was taken out of our package for the 1987 and 1990 elections. While again it is a difficult political decision, it is overwhelmingly in the best interests of the people of Australia that such a shift in the tax system be achieved; and it is again a key element of achieving best international practice in taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has comprehensive policies-and I will wipe the smile off the honourable gentleman's face in a moment-on privatisation, transport, shipping and waterfront reform, taxation, macro-economic management, education contracting out and, most notably, labour market reform. In all cases we are putting more and more detail into those policies so as to continue to lead the policy debate in Australia, in the context of the leadership vacuum coming from the Government side, as well as to have a fully specified mandate for when we go into government. </PARA>
<PARA> Against this background I issue two formal challenges to the Prime Minister. Just as we have concentrated on the future, and what needs to be done in this country, I ask him to begin the same process as well. In some cases where we have jettisoned our past, I challenge him to have the gumption to do the same. In particular, I challenge him to put behind him the fact that he was the president of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and, in the national interest, to put aside his special mateship relationships with the leaders of the union movement. </PARA>
<PARA> My first challenge to the Prime Minister is to embark on a process of genuine labour market reform-this will be the single most important reform he could embark on in his remaining two years-to genuinely move the focus of wage negotiations back to the work place level and to ensure voluntary unionism; to act in the best interests of the nation, not simply to protect the power base of his union mates. In doing this, I challenge the Prime Minister to listen to the workers. For example, he should not just listen to John Halfpenny and his other mates from the Victorian Trades Hall Council. He should listen, for example, to Barry Driver, a shop steward at SPC Ltd in Shepparton who was interviewed on AM recently. He was asked:</PARA>
<PARA>But you did take some stick from the Victorian Trades Hall Council, didn't you?</PARA>
<PARA>His answer was:</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, we did, yes. We took a bit of stick, but we can take that. We're sitting back here getting our pay every week. We're doing all right. We've been promised profit sharing at the end of the season. I think they've got to give and take a bit. Yes, they've got to bend a bit. Just look around this country now. How many places are closing down? Look at all the car industry. Like, none of those chaps have got jobs. You've got to give and take a bit. We've got to keep this country going. </PARA>
<PARA>I really could not have put it any better myself. I would also point out to the Prime Minister that this attitude at SPC in Victoria has seen a 48 per cent increase in productivity during this canning season alone. As one worker put it to me, `There's plenty more that we can do yet'. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Prime Minister does not want to stick to one particular example, he should check the attitudes in a host of other places around Australia, including Powers Brewing, Southern Aluminium, Tubemakers of Australia Ltd, and many others. </PARA>
<PARA> My second challenge to the Prime Minister is to introduce the broad-based goods and services tax as an essential part of tax reform. In doing this, I point out to him that the political landscape has never been easier for him on this issue than it is at present. The Opposition is firmly committed to doing it and is quite happy to fight the next election campaign on it if he does not do it before then. There is also a wealth of editorial opinion in support of a goods and services tax. The Prime Minister can just look at today's press as an example. Yesterday I noted that 17 major organisations have called on the Prime Minister to introduce a goods and services tax, including the Chamber of Commerce, the Business Council of Australia, the Confederation of Australian Industry, the Australian Mining Industry Council, the National Farmers Federation and the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia. Seventeen organisations are calling on the Prime Minister to show a bit of leadership. </PARA>
<PARA> I put it to the Prime Minister that these two specific challenges offer him a unique opportunity to achieve substantial reform in these two areas in particular. He can be sure that as the remaining days of his term expire I will continue to issue more and more challenges. But as I said at the beginning of my speech, the people of Australia are scared and their confidence has been shattered by your recession. They are looking for leadership. My challenge today to the Prime Minister is to show some. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I inform the House that the Clerk of the House, Mr Alan Browning, will retire on 22 March this year. Today is therefore the last scheduled sitting day for Alan in this chamber. Alan first commenced Commonwealth employment in the then Commonwealth Department of the Interior in 1946. He served in the Australian Imperial Force with the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces in Japan as an interpreter at the conclusion of World War II from 1947 to 1949 before he joined the staff of the House of Representatives in July 1954.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Browning has occupied a variety of positions in the House of Representatives Department, principally as the Sergeant-at-Arms from 1959 to 1969, as a senior parliamentary officer from 1969 to 1971, as a Clerk Assistant from 1971 to 1976, as the First Clerk Assistant from 1977 to 1982 and as Deputy Clerk from 1982 to 1985 before he was appointed Clerk in July 1985.</PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious to all honourable members that Alan did a long and arduous apprenticeship to reach the exalted office of the Clerk of this House. During his service in the Parliament he was secretary to the Select Committee on the Voting Rights for Aborigines in 1961, the Select Committee on the Grievances of the Yirrkala Aborigines in the Arnhem Land reserve in 1963 and the Joint Committee on Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA> He was also appointed the first Clerk of the Legislative Assembly of Norfolk Island from 1979 to 1980 and was responsible for drafting the Standing Orders of that Assembly. An interesting aside to that is that at a Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA) conference, the Clerk of the Norfolk Island Assembly stated that when we were looking at splitting the Australasian region of the CPA into a Pacific region and an Australian region, including the Commonwealth and the States, the Clerk of the Norfolk Island Assembly said that he thought its members would want to go with the Pacific states. Maybe Alan turned them all into a bunch of secessionists!</PARA>
<PARA> As assistant editor, Alan also made a major contribution to the first House of Representatives Practice, which was published in 1981, and of course we all know he was the publisher of the second edition of the House of Representatives Practice, which is recognised throughout the wider Commonwealth of Nations as an outstanding work.</PARA>
<PARA> He has served as the Honorary Secretary of the Commonwealth of Australia branch of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association since 1985 and he had overall responsibility for the arrangements of the CPA conference hosted here in Canberra in 1988. He has visited a number of Commonwealth countries as the secretary to CPA delegations.</PARA>
<PARA> He is one of that small band of people in the Department of the House of Representatives whom we might sometimes refer to as full time athletes and part time parliamentary officers! He is probably one of the best tennis players in the place, but he also had a very low golf handicap and played two codes of football, as well as baseball. He is a very active player in the veterans tennis organisation and is the Australian Capital Territory representative in veterans tennis.</PARA>
<PARA> Alan has given 36 years of outstanding service to the Australian Parliament. His time here as the Clerk has been marked by a number of innovations and improvements in the practices and procedures of the House in respect of which he should be very proud. More recently, he and his officers have been engaged in a complete review of the Standing Orders for consideration of the Standing Committee on Procedure. The Parliament owes him a good deal for his service to this institution.</PARA>
<PARA> It is an indication of the esteem in which both current and former members of this House hold Alan that Les Johnson, who is the President of the Former Members Association, has asked me to incorporate in my remarks some remarks from him and his Association:</PARA>
<PARA>The National Executive of the Association of Former Members of the Parliament of Australia would like to be associated with any expression of good will which the House may make to Alan Browning who will be attending his last sitting day as Clerk of the House on Thursday, 14th March 1991.</PARA>
<PARA> As an association we have greatly appreciated Mr Browning's support which has helped us become a strong and efficient component of the parliamentary institution since our inception on the 9th May, 1988. Many of our members have received the benefit of Mr Browning's friendship, counsel and advice over his long period of parliamentary service and in particular during his six years service as Clerk of the House.</PARA>
<PARA> We acknowledge his contribution to the process of relocating the Parliament in its new building and his success in publishing the 2nd edition of `House of Representatives Practice'.</PARA>
<PARA> In particular we express appreciation of the manner with which he has maintained the tradition of competence and impartiality, long associated with his high office.</PARA>
<PARA>On behalf of all members of the House and those former members of the House who are members of the Association, I would also like to thank Alan for his long and dedicated service to the Parliament and for the friendship that he has shown me as a Speaker while I have been in this position.</PARA>
<PARA> Alan, I am sure that we will miss you. I do not know whether you will miss us all that much, but I am sure that in your retirement you will become an even more active tennis player than you are already. Our loss will be the veterans tennis circuit's gain.</PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that your wife, Beth, son Kim, and mother, who are with us in the gallery here today, will see a little bit more of you now that you do not have these late nights here. Beth said to us at a little dinner the other evening that her idea of one week on and one week off is where you do the housework one week and she does it the next. I think that is a commendable proposition from her point of view, but one we hope others will not follow.</PARA>
<PARA> Alan, I thank you once again for the work you have done on behalf of the Parliament. On behalf of all honourable members, I wish you well in your retirement and say to you that you will always be welcome to call back and see us whenever you feel like it. We wish you a long, healthy and happy retirement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That this House places on record its appreciation of the long and meritorious service to the Parliament by the Clerk of the House, Mr A. R. Browning, and extends to him and his wife and family every wish for a healthy and happy retirement. </PARA>
<PARA>I am aware that a very large number of members-certainly the Party leaders and others-want to speak to this motion, so I will try to make my remarks as brief as possible; but not too brief not to express my sincerest appreciation, as Leader of the House, for the way in which Alan has conducted himself as Clerk, for the assistance he has provided to members, and particularly for the assistance he has provided to me. </PARA>
<PARA> Nobody in this place will be able to present a proper personal appreciation of Alan Browning's career because it started in this place in 1954, and the closest approximation to that in length of service is the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), who began here in about 1963. </PARA>
<PARA> However, I do have personal memories of Alan Browning. When I was a young whippersnapper, taking advantage of the fact that Western Australian members of Parliament were allowed to bring their families here once a year, I frequently came to this place and sat in the Speaker's gallery to watch the debates. One of the sights which always impressed me enormously was the most exotically dressed person in the chamber. That was not, in fact, the Speaker, even though in those days Liberal Party Speakers used to wear wigs and gowns-that simply made them look like characters from the High Court of Australia; it was the Serjeant-at-Arms, who in those days was definitely exotically dressed. </PARA>
<PARA> It was extraordinarily difficult for me to comprehend, at least in the early stages, the role of the Serjeant-at-Arms, who at once looked highly ceremonial and slightly dangerous-and certainly his title was extremely dangerous. My father's initial explanation to me was that Alan's job was to make absolutely certain that when members were suspended from the chamber they actually left. This was a role which, at least at the time, fitted the title and which therefore I was able to comprehend. In later years I learned politics under Professor Gordon Reid-who I think was a predecessor of Alan's as Serjeant-at-Arms-and I came to comprehend the role a little more clearly. </PARA>
<PARA> Alan will leave this place not only with the affection of the people here but also with a number of records that are very important to all of us. The first is that he is in that important category of people who hold first and last records. Those are records that can never be taken away: sometimes longevity of service can be taken away but first and last records cannot. Alan Browning was the last Clerk in the old Parliament House and the first in the new Parliament House, and probably not for at least 200 years will somebody be able to notch up a rough equivalent of that. That will be well beyond the requirements of personal satisfaction for Alan and his family. So he will live with that record, and his family will live with that record, for as long as he lives. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is the case that honourable members in the chamber over the years, as the pressure of government business has built up, have come to know Standing Orders less and less. I remember, again when I was a whippersnapper visiting this place, enormously lengthy Standing Orders debates and very clever parliamentarians, in the strict parliamentarian sense. There are not terribly many around the place, on either side of the House, who nowadays conform to that; the needs of this place are different. Therefore we rely enormously on getting accurate, timely and impartial advice from the Clerk for the proper conduct of business in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> When we are in the situation, as we are now, where almost invariably governments do not control the other chamber and, particularly at the end of sessions, there is an enormous amount of bouncing of legislation out of this chamber and the other one and enormously tight schedules, to actually produce a legal outcome is a most difficult task as we handle legislative problems. To have the knowledge of the Clerk of the House in that area is absolutely essential in order for us to be able to conduct business effectively. Alan has been outstanding in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> He and his family must also share personal joy in that Alan has been in a position to contribute in a major way to a special Australian understanding of the operation of the Westminster system-as one of the assistant editors in the pro- duction of the first edition of House of Representatives Practice and as a supervisor in the production of the second edition. That is enormously important. In order to be able to rely totally on House of Commons practice, which is practice not necessarily totally suited to the operations of the chamber under constitutional government as opposed to customary government, it is absolutely essential that we have such a document. The first that was produced, and the second, will live in the minds of parliamentarians here for years and years. It is a standard text in the study of politics. It is a standard text for every member of this House to read when he or she is elected or through the years. It is a totally reliable guide. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing one does notice when one becomes Leader of the House and starts to swim in unfamiliar seas-until one finally works out that nobody else knows the Standing Orders either-is that the Standing Orders do not cover the vast bulk of parliamentary practice and one has to rely on such books as the means of actually getting at the nuance of the Standing Orders. That is an enormous contribution. Both in the longevity of Alan's service and in all the senior portfolios, if you like, in the service of this House, Alan Browning has distinguished himself and has left a permanent mark. </PARA>
<PARA> This must be a day of great wistfulness for Alan and his family as he leaves this chamber. He leaves with our very best wishes for his retirement, knowing that his sporting activities will ensure him of a capacity to escape the household when it becomes too difficult for an active man to bear in the immediate aftermath of retirement. But he and his family will enjoy that retirement most enormously and deservedly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have much pleasure in rising to support the motion. The Parliament stands at the centre of the affairs of this nation and at the centre of the operations of this House stands the Clerk of the House of Representatives. His role, as we all know, is central to the processes of this place. In fact, during the period in which the House elects a Speaker, after a Federal election or at other times, the Clerk is in control of the House. He certifies every piece of legislation, decision or activity in this place. He oversees its efficient running. He provides advice to you, Mr Speaker, including of course on our orderly conduct or otherwise. I know that you find, as Speakers beforehand have found, his advice absolutely indispensable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a quite rare and a striking event in the life of the House of Representatives when a Clerk retires. There have been only 12 Clerks since Federation, yet in that time there have been 36 parliaments. You are a sporting man, Alan, and I thought I would get in the parlance of horseracing: Clerks are obviously stayers. May I say that this place is all the better for their experience and for that great continuity of knowledge which they are obviously able to bring to this job. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know whether this is quite fair, but I would like to quote Browning on Browning, because this comes from your work and it is a very accurate way of putting it. You say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Clerk and his staff must also assist in the smooth running of the Chamber by the provision of attendant services, documentation and advice. To do this adequately the Clerk must have extensive knowledge and experience in the interpretation of standing orders, in parliamentary practice and precedent, and in the requirements of the Constitution insofar as they affect the role of the House and its relationship with the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>That is indeed a very accurate statement. </PARA>
<PARA> I had the chance yesterday to have a private chat with Alan in my office because I wanted to take that opportunity to express directly to him the feelings I have for the great contribution he has made. It was an entirely private conversation and I simply want to say that out of that conversation one thing that came through profoundly was the enormous knowledge that he has of this place and the very significant detailed recollection that he has of the activities of a large number of people over the years. I had the feeling, Alan, when that was all over-because I was enlightened and entertained by what you had to say-that it all needs to be recorded. So let me say this: given your success in producing and re-editing the House of Representatives Practice, I am sure that if you were minded to sit down and put pen to paper and produce such a history in between such robust activities as playing tennis, golf and all the other things that you have to do in looking after the house and so on I quite seriously suggest to you that it would be a very important addition to the histories of the House. I know that it would be thoroughly researched and I can assure you that it would be obligatory reading for all members of parliament, intending members of parliament and all those members of the public who have an interest in the operations of their parliament. So it may be something to which you will give consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> While we are saying goodbye to Alan, in a sense we are also welcoming Lyn Barlin. The Clerk of the House of Representatives does not necessarily have to play a fine game of tennis, Lyn, but I am sure you will give it close attention because you will have to give consideration to your new role as the defender of the traditions of this House. I want to take this opportunity, before closing my remarks to you, Alan, to say that I believe Lyn is an excellent choice as Clerk. We on this side look forward to working with him for many years to come. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying to you, Alan, that my friend and colleague the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) said that this day must be a day of very mixed emotions for you. So many memories and recollections must be flooding back into your mind at this time and the thought of knowing that it is now coming to an end, as I say, must leave you with very mixed feelings. You must obviously in some senses be looking forward to the joys of retirement, but you would be less than human if you were not feeling that in many ways you will miss the experiences, the pleasures, of this place which you have graced for so long. </PARA>
<PARA> I would just like to say to you that at this time of such mixed emotions as you must be experiencing I want you to know that you leave this place with the unqualified gratitude and affection of all its members and with the very sincere hope that in the years ahead you will have the opportunity of enjoying many happy years of retirement, not just in your own right but with your family, who have so much sustained you in these years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Opposition, I am very pleased to join in support of this motion to the Clerk, Alan Browning, on his retirement. There are about five key features of Alan's service to the Parliament that I would like to mention. The first is one that others have mentioned, which is the longevity of that service-some 37 years. The detail of his time as Clerk, Deputy Clerk and Serjeant-at-Arms have been put on the record. There is one element of his past that was not recorded and that was the fact that he served for three years as the first Clerk of the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly from 1982 to 1985. Peter Coleman, who was my predecessor in the seat of Wentworth and the then administrator of Norfolk Island, wanted it put on the record that Alan was a `very flexible and patient Clerk who gave the new Assembly invaluable guidance in the first days of the Westminster style Parliament'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second feature of Alan's career has been the tremendous advice and guidance that he has given to so many people. I am only fairly new in that regard, but many of my colleagues have spoken very highly of the tremendous source of objective and patient advice that was given over the years. Many of us will carry that memory with us, apart from anything else, as Alan leaves. </PARA>
<PARA> The third feature is his role, as has been mentioned, of assistant editor and then editor of the bible of this place-the House of Representatives Practice. I agree with the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) that we could all spend more time reading it than we do, but there is a long way to go to get down to the detail of the knowledge that is not only in there but also behind a book of that order of magnitude. It will stand really as a monument to the encyclopaedic knowledge that Alan Browning has of parliament and parliamentary procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth feature of Alan's career that has not been mentioned is that he supervised the second move since Federation of the Parliament from the old Parliament House to the new Parliament House. I think that we would all want to record our tremendous thanks and appreciation for the very effective way in which that whole process took place. I guess that we are all getting used to the very big and informal nature of this place. We put on record our tremendous thanks to Alan for his supervision of that move. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, there is Alan's reputation as a sportsman. The range of sports in which he has excelled has been mentioned. I have never had the privilege of being a victim of him in any of those sports, but I have heard lots of stories. I am told that, due to the special sitting of Parliament in January this year, Alan was disturbed in one of these activities where he was playing in a veterans' mixed doubles tournament in Newcastle. He had to come back to Canberra but was able to return to Newcastle and take out the title. We congratulate him for that as well. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I wish you, Alan, well in retirement. I gather that you will continue with sport and in sport administration. We gather that you are going to spend a bit of time travelling in other parts of the world. In some respects, the deepest parts of Africa may well remind you of this place. </PARA>
<PARA> We wish you well, and on that note we welcome Lyn Barlin who has established already a tremendous reputation. We look forward to the challenge that is now set before Lyn, which is to emulate the steps of Alan Browning. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, on behalf of the parliamentary National Party, I support the comments made by the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and yourself with regard to our retiring Clerk, Mr Alan Browning. When one totals up all the contributions that Alan has made directly and indirectly to the well-being, procedures and modus operandi of the House of Representatives in particular and the Parliament as a whole, one realises that he has given outstanding service over not much short of four decades.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Quite apart from all the other comments, which I do support, there is just one other area which I will focus on, and that is the contribution that Mr Browning made both under Doug Blake and previous Clerks and then in his own right as a Clerk to what were and what are called `new member seminars', which were events which commenced somewhere down the path from the 1960s. I do not think the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) and others of that seniority had the benefit of those seminars, but those of us who came in the late 1970s, early 1980s, the 1980s generally and, more recently, after the elections last year did have the benefit of the one-and then two-day new member seminars so that we were not thrown in at the deep end in terms of our arrival in the Federal Parliament. There was a friendly face or two or more amongst the Clerks of the House, even if there were not necessarily at all times friendly faces amongst party colleagues-who always seemed to be too busy to guide new members-let alone amongst colleagues opposite. The advent of that forum has been a very worthwhile one. It is one that I commend to the Parliament. I commend not only your role with regard to that but also your role ranging right across the whole of the activities of the Clerk of the House. </PARA>
<PARA> On a personal note, I know that at times you have corresponded on matters of mutual interest with regard to the form of the Parliament and the like and given some very thoughtful comments both at large and directly. I have always appreciated those. I place on record my deep appreciation of that guidance and wisdom that you brought to the office of Clerk of the House. </PARA>
<PARA> We wish you well. I did not realise that you were such a keen tennis player and, previously, footballer. I recall that Doug Blake was also very keen on football and umpiring in his case. You leave with the commendation and respect of both sides of the House and certainly on behalf of my colleagues in the parliamentary National Party-indeed, all members. We wish you well in your deserved retirement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am also pleased to support the motion before the House and support my colleagues in their remarks. I begin by quoting from the House of Representatives Practice. In the foreword is written:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Through our publications we are not only able to provide Members with a comprehensive statement of the procedure and practice of the House but also able to draw their attention to the basic principles and considerations upon which the detailed rules and practices have been built. It is our belief that a well-informed membership on these matters is important to the ability of the House to continue to discharge its responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA>Alan Browning concludes his comment by saying:</PARA>
<PARA>I accept it as a duty and have found it a pleasure and a privilege to promote one of the world's strongest democracies through this project. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that sums up very succinctly the view I have of Alan's contribution to this House and it reflects the remarks that colleagues have previously made. </PARA>
<PARA> I also add that we ought to recognise the professional role that the Clerks of the House of Representatives as a collective group play and to recognise the balance that Alan Browning brings to his role and the balance that I know Lyn Barlin will bring to his role. By that, I mean that whichever side of the House a member comes from, that member can be assured in the House of Representatives that he or she is counselled, briefed and guided and that the procedures are carried out thoroughly and completely professionally. That may not always be the case in all chambers, but it certainly is the case in the House of Representatives. All of us here owe great thanks to Alan Browning for that. </PARA>
<PARA> I also say that at the personal level I found Alan to be a great source of guidance. My team of Deputy Chairs, if I can refer to them as that, find that we get guidance and have the ability to work in a way that I hope means that members can feel that they can operate within this House fairly and freely. Certainly, when I talk to Alan Browning, the guidance that I get and carry forward to others is always reinforced. </PARA>
<PARA> I also make the observation that it is important that we in this place understand the role that the Clerks perform in basically setting the tone, character and conduct of the Parliament. It is important to note that, no matter whether one is a new or old member, we are always able to feel that we can operate freely and thoroughly within the forms of the House. It is fair to say that the Clerks are often tested by members of the Parliament. That is what goes with a robust democracy. That is important. </PARA>
<PARA> People have referred to reforms today. The reform that has been most significant is-and it is appropriate that today is a Thursday-private members' Thursday. There are colleagues who have been here some considerable time who can look at the change that has occurred for Thursdays and private members' capacity to get up and contribute in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> We need to acknowledge the work put in by the current Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Fife), as well as the work put in by Mick Young, who was previously the Leader of the House, and certainly the work of Alan Browning, in ensuring that private members' Thursday is an opportunity for backbenchers to make a major contribution to this place. </PARA>
<PARA> Alan, I know that in one sense you are leaving one stadium, but I understand that you will be found at another stadium-that is the Bruce Stadium-seeing how the Canberra Raiders fare from time to time and, on current indications, it looks as though you are going to have a promising year in that area as well. I wish you and Beth and your son, Kim, well and, on behalf certainly of my team and myself individually, I thank you very much for the contribution you have made and for the warm and professional support you have given me. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Manager of Opposition Business, I wish to associate myself warmly with the motion that has been moved by the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) and also to endorse the remarks that have been made by previous speakers. There is nothing more important to the proper conduct of this House or the Senate than the integrity of the Clerks of the Parliament. Alan Browning is a man of immense integrity and for that we should all be grateful. It is his integrity that has carried him through and earned him the respect of members on both sides of the House over a period of some 37 years in the various posts that he has held.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Previous speakers have, of course, well documented the record of service which Alan has given to the House of Representatives. His name will stand along with those other great officers, such as Frank Green, Allan Tregear, Alan Turner, Norman Parkes, Jack Pettifer and Doug Blake-all of whom have served this nation's interest with quiet but determined dedication and manifest skills. Along with them, he has been an upholder of parliamentary standards and traditions. His concern-and I emphasise this-has always been to provide continuity and stability in our parliamentary system. This he has sought to do not just by holding the status quo, but by endeavouring to improve and refine the procedures and practice to facilitate the better functioning of the House in the interests of the members and the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus his service has been marked not only by a high degree of professionalism which has already been referred to, integrity, to which I have referred, and application, but also by his innate creativity. This of course has been evidenced in a variety of ways, especially through his writings on parliamentary subjects. Some of these have been referred to, but I believe that I should place on record that the most important ones include both the first and second editions of the handbook, House of Representatives Practice; Broadcasting of Parliamentary proceedings in Australia, which was published in 1968; and The Mace, which was published in 1970. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, Alan has been responsible for discussion papers prepared through his office on a wide range of topics, including procedure for the opening of Parliament, division procedures, electronic voting, Question Time in the House of Representatives, sub judice, development of a committee system and the right of reply. I am sure that all honourable members will agree that that list of contributions is a list that will probably not be surpassed for many years, and it is a list that reflects great credit on the professionalism, the dedication and the determination of our retiring Clerk. He was also responsible for a review of the Standing Orders being conducted by House Officers for consideration by the Procedure Committee. But I have no doubt that the achievement which means most to Alan Browning during his six years as Clerk has been the publication of the second edition of House of Representatives Practice, which he edited. He had, of course, done a great deal of work on the first edition as the assistant editor. </PARA>
<PARA> On a personal note, I wish to thank Alan Browning, through you, Mr Speaker, for his tremendous support over the years. I have looked to him for guidance in the various positions I have held in this Parliament on both sides of the House, and that professionalism was always evident as, indeed, was his integrity. I cannot emphasise too much the importance of the integrity of the Clerk, because the Clerk is here to serve the Parliament-not any individual member, or one side more than the other. So I say thank you, Alan, for your tremendous assistance to me personally. I congratulate you on the service that you have given to the Parliament and, through Parliament, to the people of Australia. I join with others in wishing you a long and happy retirement, and I am sure that during your retirement you will reflect on those 37 years of service and, when you do, let me assure you that you have every justification to reflect on your service with pride. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to be associated with the remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and other speakers in wishing Alan the best in retirement. I suppose we all have lingering memories of Clerks and the Office of the Clerk and his assistants. The one I have is that it was always my impression that the Clerks gave new members a feeling of belonging to the place-particularly in opposition. I came here in opposition and, as you know, the Westminster system is a winner-take-all system. When you win, you run the show; when you do not, you play the game for three years hoping to get another chance at it. Part of that game is the parliamentary game, and the Clerks have always made the new and young members comfortable here-particularly young members who, I think, feel a difficulty in coming to this place. The Clerks have always made them feel as though they had a place in the institution and that it meant something.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The continuity which the Manager of Opposition Business, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife) just mentioned in relation to the Clerks, from Frank Green onwards-and I think he was the first Clerk here in 1927; no, Lyn tells me not, but I know he came from Melbourne to Canberra-is there in the sense that this is a part of, if you like, the Public Service where people are not advertised for in the Sydney Morning Herald or any other paper. They are actually part of a long tradition. In fact, there are fewer Clerks than Prime Ministers, as the Prime Minister just observed to me. Twelve is a very small number in the history of this Federation, and I suppose to find anything comparable with that, you would probably have to look at Justices of the High Court of Australia or something of that nature. But there is a continuity about the place, a feeling of parliament, the importance of the institution which I think threads into the lives of members through the Clerks. They give advice and they give it without fear or favour. I think we all appreciate that, whether we are in government or in opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> For my own part, I must say that I have had the best of relationships with everyone in the Office of the Clerk. I have valued their friendship. The group of people in the Office of the Clerk have been particularly friendly and, of course, Alan is no exception to that rule. They have taken a great interest in the Parliament, particularly with the building of the new Parliament House. I served on the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the New Parliament House for seven years, during which we examined the design requirements of this building, and I had much to do with the Clerks Office in those days. Both Alan and Lyn were involved in those processes from time to time, and they were very interested in the chamber. We had long debates about the nature of the chamber. I always wanted to be nearer my opponents than most other people in the building, and I do not like the fact that they are a long way away over there. I would have liked this table to have been a lot narrower and for members of the House to have been a lot nearer to it. </PARA>
<PARA> But that was not to be, and the place is a bit large and to some extent it lacks the close feeling that one has from, say, the New South Wales Legislative Assembly or some of the other State chambers. It has, I think, probably too much space and volume to it. But it is the national Parliament and many people come here, and all those matters have been considered. But a lot of those design issues were taken on by Alan in those years, as they were also taken on by his predecessors. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to round off by thanking Alan for his personal friendship; one does value those things in an institution like this. I also congratulate Lyn on his appointment. I remember him as a very young man; I was an even younger man. We always used to feel that because he was such a young fellow he would be rather easier to approach than some of the older people, from the Clerk down, but we all grow older in this place and his time has come and it is a great tribute to him to become Clerk of the House of Representatives, as it has been for Alan. </PARA>
<PARA> Alan, I wish you the best. I am sure that you have now heard enough from the Government and from the Opposition to know that you have been appreciated in this place. You go out not just with part of a proud tradition but a record without flaw and one that I think you and your family can be very proud of. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to join in support of the remarks made by you, Mr Speaker, and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), party leaders and other members in this House this afternoon. I think it is worth while looking at Alan's record and also looking at the role that he plays. Like the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Keating), I have had fairly strong views about the nature and character of this place and the change it has been through. Alan has played a very important part in ensuring that we have fitted into this place. As I said to him in private the other day, we are still to develop a character-at least the character that the old place enjoyed-and I guess at a personal level that I feel rather sad that those few continuing members who had an association at the old place are, day by day, reducing. With Alan's departure, of course, they are one fewer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is of interest that chapter 1, standing order 1 of our Standing Orders still refers to the fact that, if there are no other procedures or practices within our Standing Orders, we should resort to the practice of the Commons House of the Parliament of the United Kingdom and Great Britain and Northern Ireland in force for the time being. </PARA>
<PARA> People tend to forget that the Clerks are part of that Westminster heritage. They are the intermediaries between us who are adversarial in our daily political lives; you, Mr Speaker, who sits between us; and they who continue. Importantly, they are the interpreters of the Standing Orders and the practice and the procedure. Fortunately, Erskine May's Parliamentary Practice is no longer the bible which it once was. Erskine May is replaced by Pettifer's House of Representatives Practice, in which, as the Manager of Opposition Business, the honourable member for Hume (Mr Fife) so rightly said the other day, Alan, as Clerk, played a notable part. Now, of course, we have Browning's House of Representatives Practice, which is the bible, as the Leader of the House-the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley)-said, from which new members, existing members and continuing members turn to more and more as their reference source. So that first introductory standing order no longer has, perhaps, the relevance that it once had. </PARA>
<PARA> The important part of the role of the Clerk is that he sets the tone, not just for this House, but for the way in which democracy and public debate function in so many other forums around the country, for the procedures and practices of this place necessarily are the bible from which all others follow. Alan, your role in that has been significant indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Deputy Prime Minister said, there are aspects of the character and design of this place which concern me. I share totally the Deputy Prime Minister's view that I would like to eyeball my opponents. I would like to see this place as close together as the House of Commons in the United Kingdom. I find myself at somewhat of a disadvantage back here. I find it hard even to see the colour of the Prime Minister's eyes; but no doubt time will change. I feel, however, it is important that we understand that, however close to or far we are from each other, it is those who wear the wig and gown-neutral that that colour be-who provide to us the advice that ensures that, if there is an argument or a feeling or a prejudice that we wish to express, there is a vehicle by which they can explain to us the way it can be done. </PARA>
<PARA> Alan, you have been a loyal and noted servant for many years to the Parliament. The Prime Minister referred to the fact that you were only the twelfth Clerk in the thirty-six parliaments since 1901. Thirty-seven years of service-it is a long time; it was an effective time. It is one in which you have made a wonderful contribution. I am sure that in your role you have helped significantly to enable this new place on the hill to develop a character which will foster further and develop further as the years pass. </PARA>
<PARA> In sport I know something of your prowess. Indeed, I know that you and my former senatorial colleague Glen Sheil have on occasions crossed the net in international veterans tourneys around the place. I think you are still the reigning South Pacific champion as a result of your excellence in a tourney in Fiji a little while ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Above all, to you, your wife and Kim, I would like to say good health and long life and I hope we continue to see you coming back from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA> To Lyn Barlin, your successor, I would like to say welcome. I have had a very close association with Lyn. Indeed, the Prime Minister may not be aware that Lyn was, I think, the only member of the parliamentary staff who was actually seconded for a time to the parliamentary section of the Prime Minister's Department. That is a practice that I would like to see pursued from time to time. I think there is a need by the nature of the Leader of the House's role and the legislation that must go through this place to have one of the more junior members of the establishment of the Parliament gain an understanding of the way in which legislation is produced within the Government. That is not to taint such a junior member of the establishment with the prejudices of government; it is just to ensure that there is an understanding of the way in which our laws are developed, for fundamentally the role of this place is to produce laws and to ensure that those laws are adequately developed to meet the needs and perhaps to challenge the electorate at large and to provide for those laws the background against which the courts can decide upon them in the maintenance of our democratic tradition. I think the idea of having somebody from Parliament working for a time in the Parliamentary Counsel's section of the Prime Minister's Department worth while. </PARA>
<PARA> So, Lyn, I do compliment you on your appointment and wish you well. You have a great and noble tradition to maintain, and I have every faith that you will do it, like Alan Browning before you, with great distinction. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to wish Alan Browning well in his retirement. I probably have the distinction at this stage of having served more time in opposition than any other member in this Parliament, even though at the moment I sit on the Government side. I have also had the opportunity of serving as Speaker. I was the first person, that I am aware of, to hold the position of Manager of Opposition Business. There had previously been a role for the Deputy Leader, but because of events in our Party, I got the job rather than Mr Uren.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Alan, I think it is fair to say that, as Clerk, you have always been a person who has given the advice that you believed the person asking you for it should receive, not the advice that the person asking for it wanted to receive. Whilst, over a period of time-and I have had a fair bit of experience in this Parliament as far as its procedures and such are concerned-we may not always have agreed, I think it is fair to say that, except for one year, your view and the view of your colleagues has prevailed. You have seen some of the major historic events of this Parliament, in particular, the House of Representatives. I will not go into them now, but I seem to recall that about mid-term of my time in this Parliament crises were the name of the game rather than the exception. </PARA>
<PARA> The Clerks were placed under tremendous pressure twice in 1975 and they performed their duties as one would expect. The advice which is asked for-and some of it is highly political-is given impartially and honestly and given to any member who seeks it with equal impartiality and honesty. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is true to say that House of Representatives Practice, which Alan was seconded for some time to prepare, is a major achievement for the House of Representatives. I am glad that the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) drew attention to standing order 1. I do not think it is now correctly couched, and I think we might have to alter that. But it is something this Parliament needed. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst we adopted the procedures of Westminster as they applied at the time of the passage of our Constitution and the establishment of our Parliament, the Parliament of Westminster has evolved in a different way from our Parliament. We have a different set of rulings; we have a different set of precedents; and we have operated in a totally different way. We are not the Parliament of Westminster. We are a Parliament adapted from that. </PARA>
<PARA> Alan, the Clerk plays a major role in the development and implementation of the practices that make our Parliament work and have maintained it as the instrument through which the power of government and the legislature still perform. You have been here during most of the crises in the second half of this century. I hope we have all learnt from them. Certainly we have a written work to refer to and to base our future operations on, which is a major achievement. </PARA>
<PARA> I think most people have mentioned Alan's private activities. I can assure the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) that, whilst Alan is a good tennis player, there was a time when you would not put two shillings on yourself against him at golf either. When I came here I think he was captain of the Federal Golf Club and he was on a handicap of two. I might exaggerate a bit, but that is what I was told. As I could never achieve that sort of handicap, I certainly was not going to test it. </PARA>
<PARA> Alan, in your retirement, may I wish you well and may I say that, having been in this place for as long as you have, you are entitled to do all of those things that you wish to do. I am sure that your achievements and everything you have taken on will ensure that you do them well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Alan Browning has been a senior officer of this Parliament during the entire 17 years I have been a member of the House of Representatives. He was Clerk during the whole of the period when I was taking an even more active role here at the dispatch box than I am at present. It is with a real sense of personal gratitude that I associate myself with everything that has been said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a fairly rare occasion that brings together a conjunction of sentiment between my colleague and friend the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and me, but I also share the view expressed by those two gentlemen that perhaps some of the nostalgia we feel today at your departure is associated with the nostalgia some of us feel for the slightly more closely combative environment of the old chamber. Although this larger place has many virtues and plenty of comforts, there was something about the closeness of the other chamber that a number of us miss. Naturally, I very much associate my first recollections of people in the Clerk's position with that chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a difficult job; it is a job integral to the system. On occasions such as this we ought to remind ourselves that we take the institution of Parliament altogether too much for granted. Australians have a strange ambivalence towards their institutions. They like to sneer at them and bring them down; yet I believe that fundamentally, if the institutions were ever seriously challenged, people would rise very strongly to defend them. </PARA>
<PARA> Part of what keeps the institution of Parliament going is the people who carry on the impartial, dispassionate and professionally committed role of Clerk. It takes a special kind of character to sit without being able to intervene in a chamber such as this. I certainly would not be able to do it, and I do not think many people around this chamber would be able to do it. It does on occasions place enormous strain on people. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) referred, not unnaturally and I think entirely appropriately, to a number of very difficult moments for the old House and for those in it, particularly those in positions of professional impartiality, in 1975. Could I say in passing that in my view no person on the other side of the chamber has ever earned respect that surpasses the respect I felt for the honourable member for Corio in the position he then occupied on one of those occasions in 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> Alan, you have made an enormous contribution. I love the Parliament, and there are things about this place that we cannot find anywhere else. That is made possible by the members on both sides. It is made possible because, despite on occasions all the frustrations and perhaps the odd piece of humbug that we all encounter, whatever our perspective we feel that we are fundamentally trying to do something for our country through this institution. That is not possible without the professional, dispassionate commitment that you and your predecessors have brought and that your successor, Lyn Barlin, will bring to the job. </PARA>
<PARA> I join others in wishing you the very best of good health. We hope that you have a very long and happy life ahead of you. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support this motion wholeheartedly to thank Alan Browning for his reasonable, careful and also kindly advice on a number of occasions, but particularly to draw attention to the fact that perhaps the greatest reform of the House with which he has been associated is the introduction of a comprehensive committee system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Speaker, you will remember that, when after the 1987 elections the Labor Caucus agreed to set up a committee to design a new committee system, we received very detailed and careful advice from Alan. He had written a couple of papers about what a comprehensive committee system would be like, doing so after it was introduced in the Senate and again early in the 1980s. He gave us very careful advice about the structure of the new committee system-how it would work and so on-and once there was agreement on the system he supervised the designing of the Standing Orders for it. </PARA>
<PARA> That has been a very important reform of the House of Representatives which has strengthened the House in a number of ways. Honourable members may feel that there are too many committees and that too much time is taken up with committee work, but it does mean that now the House of Representatives can for the first time since 1987 deal with any issue that is the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government, whereas in all the years before that, from Federation, the House was limited in the number of subjects with which it could deal. It is a major reform of the House and Alan was integrally involved with it. That is another mark he has made. </PARA>

When we think of the amount of time he has spent here, he must have enough source material to prepare a true record of the goings on of the Parliament of Michener proportions. I recommend that to him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I speak as one of those-a dwindling number-who came here in 1975 and who is more senior in service to this Parliament than he would wish to be. I can reflect on the tremendous work that is done within the House by Alan and all of the Clerks and attendants. Very few outside this Parliament would understand that the Parliament is not really the master of its own destiny. It takes people like the Clerks, the Hansard reporters and the attendants to enable the continuing operations of the Parliament. That has been referred to.</PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer to the comment of the Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer (Mr Keating) that everything goes to those on the Government side-if you have the numbers, you are right, you have the power. But of the few resources that we in the Opposition have available, the greatest resource we can draw on is the Clerks. We seek their advice on legislation and amendments, and I want to pay a real tribute to Alan and all of the Clerks, who have assisted me materially where otherwise I would not have had that assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to place on record the sacrifice made by the families of people such as Alan-all the wives and families of all those in office.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion and wish Alan Browning all the best in his retirement. I want to tell a little story out of school about Alan's breach of the rules. It occurred in the old House. Your return to the House, Mr Speaker, was delayed as a result of some car problems. The bells had rung and I had rushed in because I thought these dreadful people opposite were going to start calling quorums. There was no-one in the chair. Alan was at the table but there were no Deputy Speakers, no Chairmen, so Alan said to me, `Jump in the chair, John'. I asked what I had to say, and he said, `Just say ``The Clerk'' '. When Alan got the call, he then proceeded to announce the subject for debate, and a few moments later in walked the Deputy Speaker at that time-as red as he is now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was reminded of the matter when going through some of my memorabilia. I still have the little note Alan sent to thank me for helping out. The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) might recall that the following morning he asked who the stranger was in the chair. He asked under what rule this had occurred, and Alan said to me afterwards, `The rule of common sense'. It was just one of the experiences that we have all had, especially those of us who were privileged to work in the old House, with all the Clerks and the Serjeants-at-Arms. Some of us who have been marched out by the Serjeant-at-Arms can relate to the earlier references to that. </PARA>
<PARA> I particularly want to mention that it was a privilege recently to be in Africa with Alan and Beth. I am always glad when honourable members refer to the families, and to the spouses in particular, who have to put up with so much. It is hard to keep a family together these days, with the pressures that are on us, and I hope that Alan can spend with Beth and his family a very worthwhile retirement. </PARA>

As other members have outlined, Alan has discharged his responsibilities at the highest level of competence and I join with others in recognising that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I especially want to mention his discretion. It has not been mentioned so far, but I have been in this place for about 21 1/2 years and have been playing tennis at lunchtime most of that time, and Alan Browning is a particularly good tennis player who has often walked along and stood outside the courts to watch the antics of the players. Not once in those 21 1/2 years has he come up to any of the players afterwards, to my knowledge, and endeavoured to give them any advice. That must have been tremendously difficult for him, with his prowess. He has joined in the success of the House of Representatives tennis team, which has consistently defeated the Senate, and has enjoyed as a result the hospitality of the President of the Senate in recognition of his prowess. </PARA>
<PARA> I, along with all the others, want to say to Alan how much I have appreciated the help, wisdom and guidance he has given me in his role as Clerk of the House, and also for the encouragement he has given the tennis players of the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> I would also like to say to Lyn Barlin how particularly pleased I am to see his elevation to the role of Clerk. I know of his dedication to the House and to the service of its members ever since I have been associated with the place. His role in so many different positions has been universally competent. He keeps the pecuniary interests register in a way and a style which I think have been very helpful to everybody. I am particularly pleased that he has achieved the position of Clerk. I wish him every success. Alan, I wish you a very long, happy and successful retirement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to associate myself with the motion and, to the extent that the Whip can speak for the back bench, to pass on to you, Alan, all our very best wishes and thanks for your advice and friendship over the years. As the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) said, you played a very prominent role in assisting new members. I remember your predecessor, Doug Blake. When we came here in 1983 we were all wide-eyed and very happy to be here, but the Clerk of the House was the one person-Doug in that case-I remembered. The advice he gave us has stood us in good stead. It allowed us to come into the House and function as new members. I know from the seminar held after the 1990 election that the tradition that Doug started was well carried on. I know certainly the members on this side, and those on the other side to whom I have spoken, appreciated the advice that you gave them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Alan did make it known to me by letter that he was standing down, and I responded to him in kind. One of the things I said in that letter I would like to place on the public record. The history books will show that Labor governments have not spent a long time in office up until this one, and therefore there have not been many Clerks in this House who have spent a long time under a Labor Government, but certainly I think we could say that the six years that you, Alan, have spent as Clerk have been all under a Labor Government. That record will not stand for a long time because I know that when Lyn Barlin comes in he will break the record after six and a half years. But do not feel too badly about that. </PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of myself and those members of the back bench who will not speak today, I hope that you have a very happy, long and healthy retirement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not take too much of the House's time, but I would feel very deficient if I, too, as possibly one of the more litigious members of this place, did not place on record my endorsement of all the remarks that have been made about Alan Browning and my congratulations to Lyn Barlin. The point I would like to make is that, above all, to me, the Clerks of this place have always epitomised the tradition of the place. I am sure that Alan Browning has not dented that belief in any way during his role as Clerk of the House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to put on record a small anecdote which I think does prove the impartiality of the Clerks in the advice that they give to the Speaker and the Chair. Mr Speaker, as you will be aware, there have been times when I have been in disagreement with the Chair and in fact prepared to argue my point as per the Standing Orders. I frequently notice the Clerk's great skill in getting the right reference out of the Australian House of Representatives Practice and handing it to the chair. Of course, notwithstanding my real knowledge that that would always be done with great impartiality, in the heat of the moment one often gets the feeling that they are really helping the Speaker out. </PARA>
<PARA> I have to admit that on one occasion, in the heat of the moment, I actually complained about this. I really did not think the Speaker needed the Clerk's help-I reckoned between the two of us we were doing reasonably well-and I made this point. But to my chagrin I discovered later that the advice, the reference, that the Clerks were handing to the Speaker was in fact supporting my position, and I can assure honourable members that I apologised profusely afterwards because I was quite wrong, and I was wrong in my original supposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The Clerks have given excellent and impartial advice. They are extremely skilled in finding the appropriate reference. I think when the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) mentioned our lack of knowledge of the Standing Orders, we only have to look at the thickness of House of Representatives Practice to admire the skill of Mr Browning-and Lyn Barlin, too, when he has occupied that chair-in finding the reference and handing it to the Speaker. I go on the record as saying that I am totally confident on every occasion it will be the right advice, and impartial, and I apologise again for the only time I doubted it. </PARA>

Thank you for your advice, guidance and good humour, both in the old House and in the changeover to this new House. It has been very much appreciated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Speaker, I am probably the member who has known Alan Browning the longest, because when I was a very young private secretary to the President of the Senate back in 1962 Alan Browning had joined the staff of the Parliament, and I have been able to observe him quite closely for many, many years indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it has not escaped Alan on this particular occasion, with all his years of experience, that it is a very rare occasion when the Parliament says, `Thank you for a job well done', to somebody who is still alive. We tend normally to eulogise those who have passed from us. In a sense that demonstrates so clearly the very real distinction between the role of the Clerks and the role of members of this House. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, in every sense of the term, Alan-and those who have gone before him, and no doubt Lyn Barlin and those who will go after him-has brought to this chamber a long tradition which goes back nearly 2,000 years. In the context of our own historical experience we have had marvellous Clerks. I think back to people like Turner and Blake as well as others of whom I was aware over those years. I do not recall any member of those parliaments ever questioning the integrity of the Clerks. </PARA>
<PARA> As one who was thrown out of this chamber no less than twice in two days-no doubt on the advice of Alan himself-I hold no grudge whatsoever, although Hansard will probably show that I was the only member of the House who was actually sitting up in the visitors' gallery when he was thrown out. Nevertheless, that demonstrates not only his eagle eye-because I should not have been there on that occasion-but also the quality of the advice he has always given. </PARA>
<PARA> Alan has told me privately that he regards his two most important contributions as, firstly, the work he did on the second edition of the Australian House of Representatives Practice, following in Pettifer's illustrious footsteps. He put in place a document which will no doubt remain as one of the fundamental texts of the Australian political system for decades to come; and, secondly, the move from the old Parliament House to the new Parliament House. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and others have referred to the love they have for Parliament. We all have personal views as to whether we like this building or whether we prefer the old building. To those motley few of us who still recall what it was like to be in the old building, I take the view that this is a grand monument to architects and engineers; it is not necessarily effectively designed as a Parliament. Nevertheless, Alan did play a major role in supporting the committees which were responsible for making the parliamentary contribution to the design during those very interesting years. We give to him the compliment that, in a very real sense, this building also stands as a monument to him and to those who worked with him at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been asked by one of the much newer members to say something that he would like recorded. The honourable member for Corinella (Mr Broadbent) cannot speak because there is not time. He asked me to say that Alan's help to new members, and the way in which he made them feel at home in this chamber and in this House, would be similar to `making an orphan feel comfortable at a father and son picnic'. </PARA>
<PARA> So with those words, could I just say thank you for a job well done. We all appreciate the substantial contribution you have made to each of us as individuals during our period in Parliament, and you will long be remembered for your contribution to Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a result of the last Federal election I was one of the 33 new members who entered this place. Whilst I have known Alan Browning for only a short time, I have been moved by the civility and courtesy he has shown not only myself but all members of this House, and all people with whom he has been associated. I have also admired the professional manner in which he has acted as Clerk of this House.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am also staggered at the tremendous loyalty that Alan has shown this place. He commenced duty to this Parliament in 1954. I was born in 1954. To have given service to this place for more than 36 years, to be able to leave this place with the bipartisan support that is being shown here today, to be subject to scrutiny and, in terms of that scrutiny, to come through unscathed is a credit to the professionalism of Alan Browning. He can be compared with those from the other place. For my part Alan Browning comes first and daylight second in any comparison. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Like the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham), I have not been in this Parliament for very long. That should in no way indicate any reduction in the respect in which Alan Browning is held by somebody such as myself. When I came into this Parliament just on three years ago from a very different environment of the Defence Force, I sought out Alan Browning and his Clerk Assistants to give me some assistance. Without that assistance the transition would not have been as relatively easy as indeed it was. We have heard mention of his predecessor, Doug Blake. Bearing in mind Doug's Navy background, perhaps I might be forgiven some levity this afternoon, and say that one element of Alan's success and the fact that he was well trained relates to the fact that he was Navy trained by Doug Blake.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A little while ago, in September last year, it was a pleasure for my wife and I to be in Zimbabwe with Alan. During that time it was a pleasure to mix with Alan and his good wife Beth, both professionally and socially. I can confirm his prowess on the tennis court. Although Alan would not admit it, I think I can tell the House that my wife Jan and I took a set off Alan and Beth during our time in Zimbabwe. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been searching for some words that would perhaps encapsulate what Alan stands for. If I could be forgiven for plagiarising what I said about my predecessor in this place in the first speech that I gave in the Parliament, I would like to put Alan in the same category. That category is of a manly man and a friendly friend. I wish Alan and Beth a long and happy retirement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will probably go down on record as being the person who spoke the least in this House. However, I must take this opportunity to speak today because I, like everybody else, have valued very much the advice, help, assistance and friendliness of Alan Browning. Not long after I came into this Parliament, during the time of his predecessor, we tried to take the gowns and wigs off the clerks and the Sergeant-at-Arms. When we were defeated-by about 99 to 1-Doug Blake said to me, `You've got no chance of winning that one. You may as well forget all about it. Concentrate on bowls. I will help you with that but I won't help you with the removal of the wig'.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very briefly, I would like to endorse everyone else's comments in relation to Alan Browning and to congratulate Lyn Barlin on his appointment and wish him well in his duties. I have enjoyed the occasional game of tennis with Alan. I must say that he has been as graceful on the tennis court as he has been to members in here. He never lets one get control of him but he never pulls out any more than he needs to simply manage the win on his side of the net, and he has always been like that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The comment I wanted to make to both Alan and Lyn is as a new member's reflection of the Parliament. I remember not long after I was first elected I was in that horrible position in which we all find ourselves from time to time. Almost every other member of the House was busy in some committee meeting or somewhere else and the Clerk was standing here addressing the Parliament by himself. I made my contribution and went back to my office. As an enthusiastic new member, I said to my staff adviser who was with me, `Gee, I must have made a good speech then'. She asked, `Why?'. I said, `The Clerk was intent on every word I had to say'. I have since come to learn that the most courteous people in the Parliament who listen to every word we say and even look at us-they pretend to be listening anyway-are the Clerks. We do value the fact that someone pays attention in those lonely moments. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="1" SPEAKER="Mr SPEAKER" NAMEID="10000">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">Mr SPEAKER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If no more members wish to contribute to the debate, before putting the question I might outline to the House two of the practices of the House. The first one relates to the appointment of a new Clerk. The Clerk is appointed by the Governor-General in Council on the recommendation of the Speaker. Prior to the Speaker making that recommendation it is traditional that the person who holds the Speaker's office should inquire of the Party leaders their views on the suitability of the person who is being put forward by the Speaker. Also, one should inquire of the Clerk either of his recommendation or the suitability of the person being put forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I guess the nicest thing that one could say about our new Clerk is that one would blush when one read the nice remarks that were made to me in the letters that I received from the Party leaders. I think Lyn Barlin will make an excellent Clerk of the House of Representatives. We will come to enjoy his company even more now that he will be in the most senior administrative position in the Parliament because the Clerk of this House is most certainly in a more senior position-at least in our minds and I think in the minds of the great majority of people-than the Clerk of the Senate. On behalf of all members, Lyn, I would most warmly welcome you to the position of Clerk of the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> I might also mention another tradition of the House which I asked Alan whether he would like to break. The tradition in the old House and in the Parliament in Melbourne was that the retiring Clerk asked the Speaker to make some remarks on his behalf after members had responded to the motion such as the one moved by the Leader of the House. Seeing we had moved into this new Parliament, I suggested to Alan that he might like to respond on his own behalf. He said he thought that members would not like that. I said that I did not think members would mind that at all and it might not hurt to create one new tradition in this place. However, in his modesty Alan said that he would like me to respond on his behalf. </PARA>
<PARA> With the leave of honourable members, I will just respond in the words that the Clerk has asked me to say to you. He says:</PARA>
<PARA>I am extremely grateful for the many kind words from members. Would you please inform the House that I leave with an undiminished faith in the institution of Parliament, believing that Australia now has a vastly superior House of Representatives to that of the 1950s. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a great deal of confusion in the minds of many of those who write about the House of Representatives and its functions. Let me remind them that ``it is not the role of the House to govern; that is the role of the Government. However, there is a responsibility on Government to inform the House of its activities and it is the job of the House to seek out the details of how the Government is performing its task. This is what parliamentary government is all about and there is no doubt in my mind that parliamentary government is alive and well in Australia today. Those who think otherwise are ill-informed and should look at the records of the operations of the Parliament in the 1950s and 1960s and compare them with the operations of today. They would be pleasantly surprised as to how far we have come. We have moved somewhat faster and further than most similar Parliaments throughout the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Reference has been made to my role in the production of the House of Representatives Practice. It is interesting to note that this publication is now used by senators . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I wonder if they would admit it. He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . and has become the major reference work in many Parliaments throughout the Commonwealth of Nations as well as our own State and Territory Parliaments. The attention of members is drawn to the fine review that the second edition receives in the latest edition of the Parliamentarian. The publication has brought great credit to the House of Representatives and this credit reflects on all of us. </PARA>
<PARA> I leave the House at a time of my own choosing, having completed the major tasks which I set myself in 1985. My sole regret is that I am leaving behind 148 friends who constitute the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA>Alan, on behalf of all members, we thank you for your counsel and your friendship, and we wish you and your family all the very best in your retirement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, I present report No. 308, The Parliamentary Information Systems Office (PISO) `Unofficial Account'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ordered that the report be printed. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SI4">Mr PUNCH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Committee's task in this inquiry was to examine the roles and responsibilities of the key players in the establishment and operation of the unofficial account and to assess what further action was required in response to the breaches identified in the report of the Auditor-General. Chapter 8 of the report summarises the Committee's findings in this regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The term `unofficial account' has been used throughout the report and the Committee emphasises that the account was clearly illegal. It was set up and operated by a small number of individuals within the Parliamentary Information Systems Office (PISO). The Committee considers it likely, because of the extremely unusual nature of the account, that, if it had not been for the actions of certain other individuals, the account would have remained undetected for a considerable period-and in fact it may never have been discovered. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the question of possible disciplinary action against those connected with the unofficial account, the Committee notes that this responsibility rests solely with the relevant delegates under the Public Service Act 1922. In the Committee's view, consideration of such action will need to take account of the advice of the Attorney-General's Department in relation to the breaches so identified by the Auditor-General as well as the findings of the Public Accounts Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee draws attention to the fact that, although it is concerned with issues of accountability consistent with its charter, this inquiry differed significantly from the Committee's usual inquiries in that the terms of reference called for an assessment of specific individuals' roles and responsibilities with regard to the unofficial account. The Committee wishes to emphasise that, while its evidence is taken on oath or affirmation, the Committee is not a court of law. Nevertheless, at all times during the inquiries the Committee attempted to ensure that the principles of natural justice prevailed. Witnesses were given every right of reply to allegations made against them. Ultimately, however, where there was a conflict in the evidence before the Committee, the Committee was required to make a judgment about whose evidence to believe, and has done so. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has concluded that poor management within both the Department of the Parliamentary Library and PISO, together with a lack of effective accountability mechanisms in a situation of devolved responsibility, created the environment which enabled the unofficial account to be set up in the first place and remain undetected for so long. The Committee was shocked to discover that at the time of the events under review there was no internal audit function within the Department of the Parliamentary Library or in any of the parliamentary departments. In the Committee's view, internal audit is a fundamental link in the chain of accountability. The Committee has recommended therefore that each parliamentary department that has not already done so should establish as a matter of priority an adequately resourced internal audit function. </PARA>
<PARA> The inquiry has also demonstrated the need for all new entrants to the Australian Public Service to be briefed on the financial legal framework affecting public servants' dealings with Commonwealth financial resources, and the Committee has made a recommendation accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the Committee has recommended that the Commonwealth Government examine ways to ensure that its major contractors comply with relevant Commonwealth legislation and operating policies which impinge on contracts. However, these last two recommendations in no way relieve senior public servants or contractors to the Commonwealth of their responsibility to be aware of and comply with relevant laws and regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has also recommended that the Department of Administrative Services review the guidelines and procedures regarding the disposal of surplus, unserviceable or obsolete assets to ensure that the arrangements currently in place are adequate, clearly understood and properly implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee emphasises that, while the sum involved in this investigation, a total of $88,100, may not be significant in terms of Commonwealth outlays, the principles involved are significant. Moreover, the Committee believes that its investigation has proved to be a salutary reminder, not only to officers of PISO but to all Commonwealth public servants, of the responsibilities involved in managing and accounting for the taxpayer's dollar. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Committee notes that in February 1990 the Presiding Officers transferred PISO to the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff and that since that time substantial measures have been taken to improve the management and accountability of PISO within this new departmental structure. The Committee is satisfied that the serious shortcomings it had identified in this area have now been properly addressed. </PARA>
<PARA> It remains for me to thank the other members of the Public Accounts Committee, particularly the members of sectional committee A, who worked so diligently on this report, and also, of course, our very hardworking staff, who spent many hours with this report. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Student Assistance Amendment Bill seeks to amend the Student Assistance Act 1973. The Act constitutes the statutory basis for the Austudy scheme and provides a debt management regime for student assistance schemes. </PARA>
<PARA>Tax file numbers</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> A major provision in the Bill is to provide that assistance will be paid only when students have provided their tax file numbers to the Department. The requirement will also apply to parents or spouses if the means test applies to the parents or spouse. This measure will help ensure that assistance goes to those genuinely in financial need. It is part of a broader package involving data matching of client records between the departments administering income maintenance schemes. The package has already been substantially implemented by the enactment of the Data Matching (Assistance and Tax) Act 1990 and amendments to the Social Security Act 1947. </PARA>
<PARA>Restructuring the late payment charge</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also addresses the problem of delays in the repaying of student assistance overpayments. The Bill will restructure the existing late payment charge to provide for a flat charge of $100; this reflects the fact that the cost of recovering an overpayment is independent of the amount involved. In addition, the Bill will provide that interest will run from the date when the debtor is notified of the debt. </PARA>
<PARA> I would emphasise that the charges for late payment are designed to encourage debtors to repay promptly. The late payment charge and interest do not apply if the debtor repays the money within three months of being contacted by the Department or arranges repayment by instalments. Additionally, the Minister and prescribed departmental officers can remit the charge or interest in appropriate cases. </PARA>
<PARA>Student Assistance Review Tribunal</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will require the Student Assistance Review Tribunal to give written reasons within 10 working days of handing down its decision. This change seeks to address concerns by the Administrative Review Council about delays in resolving appeals. </PARA>
<PARA>Annual report on the Student Assistance Act</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Section 55 of the Student Assistance Act requires the responsible Minister to present an annual report to parliament on the operation of the Act. The Bill proposes this should be incorporated into the Department's annual report. </PARA>
<PARA>Ministerial determinations</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> When the Student Assistance Act was last amended, the Senate Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills noted that ministerial determinations under the Student Assistance Act are not subject to parliamentary review. The Government accepts the Committee's concern on this point, and the Bill will rectify this situation. </PARA>
<PARA>Immunity of student assistance files from subpoenas</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Another provision in the Bill will protect personal information in student assistance files from subpoenas. The proposal parallels a provision in the Social Security Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Phasing out of postgraduate awards</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Student Assistance Act at present provides for the granting of postgraduate awards. These were competitive awards for study in masters and doctoral courses. They have now been phased out, being replaced by a scheme of institution-based Australian postgraduate awards funded under the Higher Education Funding Act 1988. The Bill accordingly will delete references to the former awards from the Student Assistance Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial impact</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> As I have mentioned, the provision of tax file numbers is part of a broader package involving data comparison; the package should lead to estimated savings for student assistance programs of $7m in a full year. Restructuring the late payment charge is expected to generate revenue of up to $1m in a full year, though the main impact will be to encourage debtors to repay promptly or arrange repayments by instalments. Incorporating the report on the Student Assistance Act into the Department's annual report will provide estimated savings of $12,000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA> The other provisions in the Bill will have no significant financial impact. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> I present the explanatory memorandum for the Bill, which gives additional details on the proposed amendments. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is an omnibus measure proposing amendments to six current bounty Acts as a consequence of the decisions announced by the Government in its industry statement of 12 March 1991. The proposed changes fall to four general categories, as follows: firstly, amendments to the three textile, clothing and footwear bounties to accelerate the phasing down in bounty rates up to the end of each bounty on 30 June 1995; secondly, amendments to the metal working machine tools and robots bounty to extend the bounty for a further six years, broaden its coverage to include machine tools for working advanced metals, and introduce various new eligibility criteria; thirdly, amendments to the computer bounty to widen its coverage to include printed circuit boards, which will be offset by a slight reduction in bounty rates over the life of the bounty; and, fourthly, amendments to five bounties to introduce minimum annual production threshold levels before bounty may be claimed, and amendment to one bounty to increase the minimum claim level. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the Three Textile, Clothing and Footwear Bounties</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Bounty (Bed Sheeting) Act 1977, Bounty (Printed Fabrics) Act 1981 and Bounty and Capitalisation Grants (Textile Yarns) Act 1981 introduce complementary changes to assistance for the textiles, clothing and footwear industries which, when taken in concert with the amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1987, will extend to the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA> The bounty changes incorporated in this Bill are designed to encourage the development of a more internationally competitive textile, clothing and footwear sector which will be viable with lower levels of community support. Australian consumers stand to benefit from better products at cheaper prices. Economy-wide effects will accrue from the more efficient allocation of resources. </PARA>
<PARA> In line with these objectives the textile yarn bounty will be phased from 30 per cent value-added on 1 July 1992 to zero by 1 July 1995 and replaced with a 5 per cent tariff; the bed sheeting bounty will be extended to 30 June 1995 without review but will phase down from 16c per square metre on 1 July 1992 to zero by 1 July 1995; and the bounty on textile printing will phase down to zero by 1 July 1995. </PARA>
<PARA> In line with the recommendations of the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority's review of textile yarn bounty administration, the Bounty and Capitalisation Grants (Textile Yarns) Act 1981 is also proposed to be amended beyond the previously mentioned phasing rate changes. The major additional change is an amendment to exclude from eligibility for bounty the beaming, warping and sizing processes which are preparatory to fabric production together with any repeat winding resulting from those processes. These activities are not genuinely involved in yarn production and their exclusion will lead to an estimated reduction in outlays of around $4m per annum. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the Metal Working Machine Tools and Robots Bounty</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Bounty (Metal Working Machines and Robots) Act 1985 provide for the continuation of bounty assistance for local production of certain machine tools and robots from 1 July 1991 to 30 June 1997. </PARA>
<PARA> The current metal working machines and robots bounty commenced in 1985 and is due to expire on 30 June 1991. In its recent review on this bounty the Bureau of Industry Economics (BIE) found that the present scheme had been largely effective in meeting its objectives of helping to maintain a viable machine tool industry and encouraging industry restructuring towards high technology areas and new metal cutting technologies, including the production of robots. </PARA>
<PARA> The provision of assistance to the local industry by way of bounty has also enabled user industries to have access to modern equipment at world prices, as imports can enter duty free. The availability of competitively priced, locally built equipment will make a significant contribution to improving the competitive position of our manufacturing industries. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to the proposed extension of the machine tools bounty, several other amendments to this scheme are proposed. It is intended to extend the bounty's coverage to cater for current and prospective advances in the area of processing technology for new materials, such as ceramics, polymers, and composite materials. While there is little local production at present in machine tools for the working of such advance materials, this measure should encourage tooling in such areas. Equipment of this kind designated eligible for bounty will also be duty free when imported, to benefit end-users. </PARA>
<PARA> To avoid distortions in production, the Bill also proposes to make eligible for bounty all equipment produced in the bountiable categories, whether sold in the domestic market or overseas. This is in line with recommendations made by the BIE to remove the current bounty restriction in the Act on some export production. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also introduces a minimum annual production threshold level before bounty may be claimed, which the Minister will provide information to be outlined briefly in the general remarks under the fourth general category of amendments to bounty legislation proposed by this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments to the Computers Bounty</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the Bounty (Computers) Act 1984 provide for the widening of the computer bounty to include local manufacture of printed circuit boards from 1 July 1991. At the same time, the tariff on imported printed circuit boards is being made `free'. </PARA>
<PARA> Printed circuit boards are a strategically important component used in the manufacture of a wide range of electronic microprocessor based equipment utilised by industry sectors which includes telecommunications, computer, aerospace, automotive, scientific and medical, and consumer electronics. </PARA>
<PARA> The tariff on printed circuit boards acts as a cost imposed on local electronic equipment manufacturers and value-added assemblers, which in turn impacts on their pricing and international competitiveness. The computer bounty is a preferable form of assistance which will help reduce the costs of locally produced and imported boards while encouraging increasing levels of international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA>Amendments relating to Minimum Annual Thresholds</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The amendments which introduce minimum annual threshold levels into the bounty schemes for machine tools and robots, textile yarns, computers, printed fabrics and bed sheeting are intended to ensure equity across the various bounty schemes which currently do not have provisions that ensure marginal producers are ineligible for bounty payments. </PARA>
<PARA> The primary objective of the threshold is to encourage efficient manufacturing in those sectors by eliminating from the schemes peripheral production by firms not significantly committed to bountiable production in the respective industries. </PARA>
<PARA> Actual savings will be minimal but the thresholds are designed to exclude small one-off claims where administrative costs can exceed payment. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Impact Statement</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The potential savings for the period 1992-95 as a result of the accelerated phase down in bounty rates for the three textile yarn bounties is $56m, at current prices. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendments extending the machine tools and robots bounty beyond this financial year are expected to result in an overall cost to 1 July 1997 of $38.6m, at current prices. </PARA>
<PARA> The bounty is estimated to cost $15m in 1991-92, at current prices, but will phase down to around $2m per year by the financial year 1996-97. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments to the computers bounty to widen its coverage to include printed circuit boards as from 1 July 1992 will be accommodated as far as possible within the current Budget forecasts by reducing the scheduled bounty rates by one percentage point as from the 1992-93 financial year. Total bounty outlays are therefore forecast to remain at $50.1m in 1991-92, $49.5m in 1992-93 and $48.7m in 1993-94. </PARA>
<PARA> The threshold amendments have no financial implications, as they are directed at creating efficiencies within various industries rather than being aimed at specific cost savings. </PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of the Minister, I commend the Bill to the House and present the accompanying explanatory memorandum. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will amend the wholesale sales tax law to introduce a system of quarterly payments of sales tax for small business. As announced by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in the 1990-91 Budget, the Bill will amend the sales tax law to give eligible sales taxpayers the option of lodging returns and paying tax on a quarterly rather than a monthly basis. This measure builds on the Government's previous initiatives to assist small business and it addresses, in part, the recommendations of the report on small business by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology as they relate to the wholesale sales tax system. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the current sales tax law, taxpayers who have any taxable dealings in a month are generally required to lodge returns and pay tax within 21 days of the close of that month. The Bill will allow taxpayers to pay sales tax on a quarterly basis if their annual sales tax liability for the year ended 30 June 1991 was $50,000 or less. </PARA>
<PARA> To protect the threshold from erosion by price increases and to ensure that the new system will continue to benefit small taxpayers, the threshold will be increased each 1 July in line with movements in the consumer price index. Eligible taxpayers will have the option of lodging one return for the quarter or a return for each month of the quarter. Such taxpayers may also make payments at any time during the quarter provided that their full sales tax liability for the quarter is paid by the twenty-first day after the end of the quarter. Taxpayers will be ineligible to become a quarterly payer if they have not lodged all outstanding returns and paid all outstanding sales tax liabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The new quarterly payments system will apply for taxable dealings that occur on or after 1 August 1991. The first payment of tax under the new system will be due by 21 November 1991 for taxable dealings for the months of August, September and November. This measure will result in a one-off revenue loss in the 1991-92 financial year by delaying sales tax collections for June of that year and an ongoing interest opportunity cost from delayed collections. The cost will be $49.8m in 1991-92 and $5.9m in 1992-93. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bounty (Citric Acid) Bill proposes new legislation to provide bounty assistance to Australian manufacturers of citric acid by fermentation. The Bill gives effect to the Government's decision announced in the industry statement to provide bounty support for the continued development and commercialisation of leading edge Australian fermentation technology in this area. The bounty arrangements contained in this legislation provide in clause 9 for a bounty to be paid at a rate of $700 per tonne in the first year reducing to $150 per tonne in the final year. The bounty applies to citric acid produced from 12 March 1991 to 31 December 1995. </PARA>
<PARA> While the support relates only to the production of citric acid by fermentation, it has much wider strategic implications for the development of an Australian fermentation based biotechnology industry. A particular opportunity for Australia, given its competitive advantages in agricultural production, is the production of organic chemicals based on the fermentation of carbohydrates such as wheat and sugar. These chemicals are widely used in the food, cosmetic and health industries and include: proteins, enzymes, antibiotics, vitamins, amino acids, gums and organic acids. </PARA>
<PARA> The world market for chemicals produced by fermentation is estimated to be in excess of $10 billion per annum and, in the longer term, the technology offers the opportunity to replace many petrochemicals with ecologically sustainable products as well as to develop export opportunities in the food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries. At the moment, however, the realisation of this potential is severely threatened by price distortions in both the domestic and overseas markets. </PARA>
<PARA> Domestically, the structural adjustment arrangements currently in place for the sugar industry substantially increase the price of sugar over that available to producers in competitor countries. In this regard, opposition by the coalition in the Senate precluded the adoption of the Government's original tariff proposals for the sugar industry which would have had less impact on domestic sugar users. Whilst a speeding up of tariff reductions on sugar was announced by the Government in the economic statement, domestic prices are likely to remain substantially above world prices for some time. This issue will continue to be addressed in the context of the forthcoming Industry Commission inquiry into the sugar industry due to report in March next year. </PARA>
<PARA> Internationally, governments are intervening to assist the production of citric acid and other fermentation based chemicals through subsidising the price of fermentation substrates and by providing tariff protection to their local industries. European Community producers, for example, are able to purchase sugar or other carbohydrate substrates at world competitive prices through a system of rebates on raw material costs. </PARA>
<PARA> In contrast to the duty free access of citric acid to the Australian market, tariffs of 30 per cent apply in Indonesia, 24 per cent in Japan and 6 per cent in the United States of America. Imports into Australia are mainly from Ireland, China, the United States and Indonesian producers which benefit not only from subsidised raw material costs but also a protected domestic market. In other words, a combination of domestic and international policies has distorted the operating environment. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1984, Sirius Biotechnology Ltd has been developing technology in this field, originally invented by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO). Some $14m of shareholders' funds has already been committed to the development of the technology and the commissioning of scale-up production facilities. The first product developed by Sirius has been citric acid. Sirius has also developed strong strategic linkages with industry and the research community. Research into a number of other applications of the technology is currently under way in collaboration with the CSIRO and the University of Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> In recognition of the strategic importance of the technology, its development has been strongly supported by the Government through the industrial research and development board programs. Sirius has received $375,000 in grants relating to citric acid production, and research projects with the CSIRO and the University of Melbourne are receiving a total of $932,000 in Commonwealth funding. The significance of the Sirius operation derives not only from the commercial opportunities for the technology. The skills and production facilities at Sirius represent a key base on which future fermentation based biotechnology potential can be built in Australia and are not available elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the importance of the Sirius technology and production facilities as the foundation of a carbohydrate based fermentation industry in Australia, the Government has decided to introduce this bounty assistance scheme. The bounty is to be payable on the production in Australia of citric acid by the high technology production process involving the fermentation of carbohydrates in air lift fermenters. This is contained in clause 4 and clause 6 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The bounty is not a protection measure but is a support mechanism aimed at offsetting the distortions which prevent the intrinsic competitiveness of the Sirius technology being realised, enabling the company to achieve commercial viability in citric acid production. This will provide a vehicle for the continued development and commercialisation of the technology in new areas and the maintenance of a unique production facility in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In reaching a decision to provide support for this high technology production process, the Government considers it appropriate to make the bounty assistance contingent on a number of conditions. This will be achieved by requiring bounty recipients to be registered under the Act, with registration subject to these requirements: firstly, that the bounty recipient continue to research, develop and apply the technology to the commercialisation of citric acid in Australia; secondly, that the bounty recipient contribute to research in new product development arising from or associated with the fermentation technology, the subject of the bounty, with a view to the commercialisation of those new products in Australia; thirdly, that the bounty recipient explore international market opportunities for the technology and the product; and, finally, that the bounty recipient take all reasonable steps to ensure maximum advantage is taken from the expertise and know-how associated with the development and production of citric acid and other new products in Australia by suitable licensing, franchise or other arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government considers that support in the form of a production bounty, incorporating the conditions I have mentioned, is the most appropriate form of assistance. The level of support will be linked to success in commercialising the technology in Australia and it directly addresses the pricing distortions.</PARA>
<PARA> Sirius will need to make substantial investments in plant expansion in order to benefit fully from the support. Its major shareholder, Bunge Industrial Ltd, has indicated that it will be commencing a program of research aimed at reducing the cost of wheat based fermentation substrates. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is firmly committed to realising opportunities to apply Australia's scientific and research skills to the development of new industries in this country. Few areas offer better opportunities than technologies which add value to Australia's intrinsic strengths in agricultural production, particularly in the food, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics sectors. The bounty, which is the subject of this legislation, is aimed at ensuring that the opportunity to capitalise on Australian developed technology for citric acid production, as well as to build a substantial chemical fermentation industry in Australia, is not lost overseas. In addition, the bounty will position Australia to develop a strong internationally competitive base upon which to achieve significant net export growth across a number of sectors. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the financial impact statement, the amount of money available for the payment of bounty or advances on account of bounty under this scheme is limited by that amount which is appropriated by the Parliament for that purpose. This limitation is contained in subclause 11 (2) and clause 30 of the Bill. It is anticipated that the total cost of this bounty will be $7.27m in current prices on a financial year breakdown as follows: $1.05m for 1991-92; $1.65m for 1992-93; $2.17m for 1993-94; $1.85m for 1994-95; and $0.55m for 1995-96.

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1990-91, together with Appropriation Bill (No. 5) and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2), which I shall introduce shortly, comprise the Additional Estimates for 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA> In these Bills, Parliament is asked to appropriate moneys to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures additional to the appropriations made for 1990-91 under Appropriation Acts Nos 1, 2 and 3 and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Act. Although the Budget figuring contained allowances for prospective wage and salary increases, these amounts were not then appropriated, and funds are now required to meet increases resulting from the structural efficiency principle and other award decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Of the additional appropriations in the three Additional Estimates Bills totalling $1,000.2m, $723.8m is sought in Appropriation Bill (No. 4); $274.4m in Appropriation Bill (No. 5); and $1.9m in Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2). These amounts are offset, in part, by savings in the appropriations made by Appropriation Acts Nos 1 and 2 of 1990-91, reflecting the Government's determination to improve the efficiency of continuing programs. These savings, amounting to $270.5m are detailed under the relevant appropriation headings in the document Statement of Savings Expected in Annual Appropriations, which will be distributed to honourable members.</PARA>
<PARA> The appropriations now sought represent a net increase of $729.7m in payments to be financed from annual appropriations in 1990-91, an increase of 2.3 per cent on the amounts made available at the time of the 1990-91 Budget. Including Appropriation Act (No. 3) 1990-91, which provided additional sums resulting from the Gulf war, the total gross additional appropriations for 1990-91 amount to $1,234.3m. In net terms this is $963.8m or 3.1 per cent of the initial annual appropriations made available for this year. </PARA>
<PARA> I now outline some of the main areas for which the Government has found it necessary to seek additional provisions in the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1990-91 to meet payments for the ordinary annual services of the Government. The amount of $119.7m, or an increase of 1.3 per cent, is included for increased running costs, of which some $65m is to cover the costs of the structural efficiency principle and other award decisions, while the balance is mostly the result of various minor initiatives and transfers between financial years. </PARA>
<PARA> Gross additional Estimates of $278.2m are sought for the Defence portfolio in Appropriation Bill (No. 4). The gross figures include $32.2m for running costs, reflecting costs associated with the Gulf deployment, approved civilian and service salary increases and increases in certain allowances for Defence Force personnel; $206.3m which largely reflects adjustments for price movements and variations in progress on a number of projects, including payments for Anzac ships and submarine refit; $29.6m for defence facilities, attributable to greater activity levels due to economic conditions and price increases; and $6.8m for Defence housing, reflecting an increase in the capital subvention to the Defence Housing Authority as part of the Government's commitment to spend $750m on Defence housing over 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Taking account of all transactions contributing to the Defence function, including offsets provided from increased revenues and a reduction in the provision for contingent salary and related increases, total Defence outlays are estimated to increase by $181m. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, Appropriation Bill (No. 4) provides a further $29.6m to meet insurance claims associated with defaults by Iraq on credit sales by the Australian Wheat Board, insured under the national interest provisions of the Australian Trade Commission Act; $19.1m to pay out borrowings by Austrade on behalf of the Commonwealth to finance national interest claims for rescheduled Iraqi cheese debt; an increase of $5m for emergency aid to meet needs arising from the Gulf war-this amount includes a $2m contribution to the International Committee of the Red Cross, a $1m contribution to the United Nations and $0.5m for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for emergency assistance for Palestinian refugees; $41.3m for the increased demand and fee increases for non-departmental hospital care for veterans, together with increased costs in veterans' medical services; $23m for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, including $8.2m for community development employment projects, and $9m for the national Aboriginal health strategy; a further $12.9m for trade training, of which $10m is for additional prevocational course places at technical and further education colleges, and $1.8m for out-of-trade training centres; an additional $28.7m for Austudy, reflecting increased numbers of recipients in the latter half of 1990, together with an anticipated increase in the first half of 1991; and $22.6m for a major new overseas marketing campaign by the Australian Tourist Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> These additional appropriations are required to meet commitments that have been made by the Government since the Budget, as well as unavoidable cost and price increases and other parameter changes since the Budget was prepared. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>In Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 1990-91, appropriations totalling $274.4m-additional to those made by Appropriation Act (No. 2) 1990-91-are sought for capital works and services, payments to or for the States, the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, advances and loans, and for other services. The proposed appropriations are needed to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures for which provision was not made in that Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The additional appropriations are sought to meet certain cost and price increases which have occurred since the Budget, together with other commitments that have been made by the Government. Areas where significant increases are sought over amounts provided in Appropriation Act (No. 2) 1990-91 include $25m in payments to the States and Territories as compensation for loss of revenue resulting from the new companies and securities regulation arrangements; $14m for a higher level of assistance for pharmacy restructuring; $75m for natural disaster relief and restoration, mainly in relation to the widespread cyclones and flooding in eastern Australia since March 1990. </PARA>
<PARA> This will bring the total Commonwealth allocation this financial year to $155m, a record level of assistance and about half the total expenditure expected to be made by the States on these measures in 1990-91. The bulk of this total allocation for natural disaster relief will go to New South Wales, $90m, and Queensland, $58m, largely for the restoration of essential State and community infrastructure, such as roads. Other beneficiaries will be those individuals who suffered personal hardship and distress, as well as small business people and farmers who are receiving concessional assistance for the restoration of damaged working assets. </PARA>
<PARA> The figure for New South Wales includes $28m for restoration work in Newcastle, reflecting the Commonwealth's long term commitment following the December 1989 earthquake; $32m payment to Victoria in lieu of petroleum royalties, as a consequence of the revised petroleum tax arrangements; and $25m for the purchase of Telecom Australia's equity in Aussat Pty Ltd. The Government has decided to purchase Telecom's 25 per cent shareholding in Aussat following the decision to sell Aussat together with the second network carrier licence. After assessment of the market value of Aussat's shares and the value of the shareholding to Telecom, it has been agreed that the shares be purchased from Telecom for $25m. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) started off his speech earlier today by saying that there were many things the people of Australia did not understand, he was certainly right in relation to many of the aspects of the Opposition's position. Having listened to his speech, the people of Australia would certainly not understand many things about the Opposition. For instance, they would not understand why the Leader of the Opposition, having the opportunity to address the whole nation on television this afternoon about what the Opposition would do to solve our economic problems, spoke for a quarter of an hour less than his allotted time. They would find that rather hard to understand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> They would also find it hard to understand what the Opposition means by its sloganistic policies. For instance, it rattled off things like `the need for real labour market reform', but it never tells us what that actually means. It never tells us how it would achieve faster micro-economic reform, which it continually calls for. It throws around slogans like `best international practice', as the Leader of the Opposition did this afternoon. It is okay to say that that is the Opposition's objective, but we need policies to achieve that; we are not ever told what those policies would be. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the people of Australia would also find it hard to understand why the Opposition is prepared to throw away the environmental protections given by environmental legislation and say that it would rush to decisions on things like third runways for the Sydney Airport, in breach of the provisions of the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act, which requires us to have an environmental impact statement, which is almost concluded. The Opposition would apparently override those provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> The people of Australia would also find it hard to understand why-if the Opposition now says that these issues are so incredibly important and whatever the Government does, it is not enough-the Opposition, when it was in office, allowed this whole dreadful mess to develop in the 33 years that it was in office before this Hawke Government came to office. That, indeed, is the starting point. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole need for large scale micro-economic reform in this country stems from the indolent, anti-competitive policies pursued by conservative governments for most of the postwar period. Their policies were highly protectionist. It is only Labor that has cut tariffs, both in the time of the Whitlam Government and this Government. The conservative governments allowed large segments of the economy to be uncompetitive. They presided over a system which tolerated grossly inefficient work practices and high levels of industrial disputation; a system which was marked by periodic wage break-outs, which led in the end to double digit inflation and unemployment simultaneously. </PARA>
<PARA> They presided over an economy with low levels of educational achievement, grossly inadequate vocational skills and a pathetically low level of research and development; an economy with severe structural imbalance, as shown by the fact that at the beginning of the 1980s, we had a current account deficit of 6 per cent of gross domestic product, with an abysmally small percentage of our exports coming from manufactured goods and services. So we had a very vulnerable economy, one that was exceedingly vulnerable to variations in commodity prices, unlike those of most developed countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Essentially, when the coalition was ejected from office in 1983, Australia was supposedly a developed country but one with a Third World pattern of exports and a Third World degree of vulnerability to the international economy. This Government has determined that all that had to change. But to turn all that around is a mammoth task. To change the production patterns, the industrial and commercial psychology, the workplace culture, the inward focus of business, the inefficient distribution of resources of capital and labour-all of which have been built up throughout our history, most particularly in the postwar years-is an enormous task. This Government has not flinched from that task. Indeed, we marked out the territory. We described the need for micro-economic reform and we have set about it in a dedicated way, as shown, of course, by the action in regard to protection, which everyone agrees has been substantial. </PARA>
<PARA> In other areas, particularly in relation to micro-economic reform in the service industries, the Opposition suggested that we have been sluggish and that we have not achieved a great deal. I will spend the rest of my time refuting that charge, because the fact is that this Government has achieved an enormous amount and has put in place an enormous amount which will go on bringing about achievement in respect of micro-economic reform of our service industries and of the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look firstly at telecommunication. When we came into office, this was a monopoly area. From the middle of 1988, we began to open this area up to competition. By the end of this year, we will have a full array of competition for all telecommunications services; that has been over the three and a half year period from mid 1988 to the end of this year. So that policy has meant full competition in an area of previously total monopoly. Already it has started to produce results with the various reforms that were put in place prior to the last array of changes. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1989, we saw that Telecom cut many STD rates by up to 31 per cent, saving consumers $100m. Last financial year, standard telephone charges fell by 9 per cent in real terms, saving consumers of the order of half a billion dollars. In the last financial year, OTC cut tariffs in real terms by around 14 per cent, saving consumers about $77m. It has made further real reductions since. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the major changes were the ones announced in November last year in which we indicated that Telecom would lose its first phone monopoly, so any licensed technician will be able to install a phone after the middle of this year. By next January when the new competitor is in place, we will have full competition on the local, trunk and international telephone service, as soon as the new competitor can put that network in place. </PARA>
<PARA> We will also have a second mobile telephone service coming from that competitor, plus a third mobile telephone service being established some time in the next two or three years. Once we have competition firmly established in 1997, we will end the duopoly and move then to open competition. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of telecommunications, it is undoubted that there has been a total transformation from absolute monopoly to competition across the whole array of services, building up a new competitor to Telecom and ensuring that that competitor gets established by giving it a period of duopoly but then opening it up to competition. That will give us one of the most competitive systems, if not the most competitive system, of any country in the Western world and one which will certainly bring great benefits to consumers. So do not let us have any nonsense about not doing a lot in the area of telecommunications. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the labour market, there are two basic themes. The Leader of the Opposition said today that the accord has failed-which of course is utter nonsense-and that there is a need to allow enterprise bargaining. The accord has been an enormous success, as just about everyone in the economy, except the Opposition, will agree. Certainly, most employers in this country regard the accord as being much better than the system that prevailed before the accord was brought into existence and as one that has brought substantial real wage reductions, which were required. It has also proved to be exceedingly flexible in coping with variations to the wages system, leading to a system that is going to bring us enterprise bargaining in a way that was never contemplated before in the history of wage fixation in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> To hear the Opposition talk, we would think that there was nothing happening in this area. When it throws around the term `enterprise bargaining', it is as though it is talking about some revolutionary new concept. In fact, in the current national wage case all of the parties-the Australian Council of Trade Unions, most employer bodies and governments, which means not just this Government but all of the State governments-are agreeing in a document that has been put to the Industrial Relations Commission that each award should contain an enterprise flexibility award modernisation clause so that agreed variations in award conditions and working practices or arrangements may be implemented. In other words, every award should have a clause in it which allows at the enterprise level some variations of the award provision to be put in place, if that is what suits the enterprise, so that the particular needs of the enterprise can be taken into consideration and so that the wage system can be focused much more at the enterprise level. This is something the whole system is now driving towards. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition talks as though it has some great new concept of enterprise bargaining, as though nothing was actually happening in the marketplace. It talks about what occurred at SPC Ltd as being a great example of what can happen. SPC happened under the present system. So did the arrangements at Southern Aluminium and Tubemakers of Australia Ltd, and other places mentioned by the Leader of the Opposition earlier today. It is all happening, and can happen, under the various flexibility provisions that are there and are continually being liberalised. </PARA>
<PARA> In the labour market we have a reform of a remarkable nature, one which could not have been imagined a few years ago. With the national wage decision, we can have every expectation of seeing that system put solidly into place, bringing about much greater scope for change at the enterprise level. </PARA>
<PARA> The third area I turn to is shipping. We were criticised in relation to shipping, but in fact reform in this area is running well ahead of schedule. When we came into office the average crew size on major Australian flag trading ships was 33. The objective was to reduce that to 21 by mid-1992. We set about our latest reform in mid-1989, by which time the number had got down to 29. The target of 21 has virtually been reached a year in advance. By mid-1991, it will be 21.8. So we will certainly have reduced the number to 21 before the end of this year, and quite possibly it will be well below that. As new ships are brought into the trade, with crews of 17 or 18 replacing ships with crews of 26, that average will continually fall. Further reforms additional to those still being implemented are quite possible, and so crew numbers will be further reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> Such levels of crew reductions are being achieved by a revolution in work practices on ships. This industry has led the way in award restructuring and multiskilling. It has developed the concept of integrated ratings that cover a multitude of tasks. It has required the retraining of many seamen, so the reform cannot all happen overnight, but within the practical limits set by such factors as training it is happening very fast and with no disputation. In fact, in 1982, 4.1 per cent of ship days were lost in disputes. Last year, 0.1 per cent of ship days were lost in disputes. </PARA>
<PARA> With these crew reductions-the 36 per cent reduction that will occur by the end of this year-we will have seen a 57 per cent increase in productivity at least. That is what is required with a 36 per cent reduction in crewing. To do the same amount of work, we need about a 57 per cent increase in productivity. But in fact a lot more work is being done because these new ships have a much greater capacity than the old ships, so we are looking at productivity improvements of well over 60 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Those improvements are having their impact on the industry, with cost cutting developments leading to renewed investment in ships. Since the latest reform program began in mid-1989, 20 new Australian flag ships have been introduced and another nine are on order; and yet we are told that we are not doing enough in the area of shipping. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the trans-Tasman route, we are told that we should be doing more. Half of the trans-Tasman costs are waterfront costs. They are being addressed by the waterfront reform, and I will come to that in a moment. Shipping costs are being addressed by the radical reform of crewing on Australian flag ships. The result is that trade with New Zealand that previously was denied to Australia is being won back, such as the gypsum trade, where supply to New Zealand from Mexico has recently been replaced by supply from Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the waterfront, the key element of the reform process, developed by the Inter-State Commission and accepted by the Government, was to move from industry employment, tolerated for decades by the previous Government, to a system of enterprise employment. We need enterprise agreements to put that in place and we are now getting those enterprise agreements. We have the National Terminals (Australia) Ltd agreement in place, which will result in productivity improvements of up to 60 per cent. The Conaust agreement will be in place by around the end of this month. Those two together cover 80 per cent of stevedoring activity in Australia. The Union Company will have its agreement finalised shortly. Trans-Ocean Terminals was waiting on one aspect of Conaust's agreement to be finalised before its agreement was finalised. So we see substantial change there. We have had a 70 per cent improvement in productivity in the grain handling area. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I just want to go to the matter of 30 per cent being our target for productivity improvement. That is a nonsense, a calumny which is continually paraded by the Opposition. We said that there would be at least a 30 per cent productivity increase because of the reduced number of employees in the waterfront industry. Obviously we expected a lot more, and a lot more is being achieved. We are looking at at least double that in the enterprise agreements which are now in place. As those enterprise agreements go on over the years, we can expect much greater productivity improvements than that. </PARA>
<PARA> So waterfront reform is now moving into the phase where very substantial improvements are going to be put in place. Over the next month or two, we will see the transformation of the industry and the beginnings of major productivity improvements in an industry that has desperately required it because of the policies put in place under the previous Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity of participating in this debate, and I want to devote almost all of my remarks to saying something about what has now become a besetting feature of the economic rhetoric of this Government, and that is to blame all of the existing problems of the Australian economy and of the present Government on the failings of former governments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to say particularly to the Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons), who is at the table, because he is a senior member of the Government, and to the Government generally that, if we are going to talk about the economic past in Australia, there is an obligation not only on the Government but also on the Opposition to be a little more honest about the past than occasionally is the case in debate that occurs in this House. </PARA>
<PARA> I also put it to the Minister that I do not think the average Australian in March of 1990 is terribly interested in who was to blame in 1975 or 1978 or 1985 or 1987. That average Australian is a lot more interested in finding out what both the Government and the Opposition have to offer in order to fix our current problems. But we do, nonetheless, have some obligation to reflect a bit on the past, and naturally in a debate on an industry statement we are driven to say a few things about the attitudes of the two sides of politics to the tariff debate over the last 20 or 30 years. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been correctly said that high levels of tariff protection were one of the three pillars of the Federation understanding about economic matters, and for decades high tariffs were an article of faith on both sides of politics. Anybody who objectively examines the evidence will know that on my side of politics there were profound debates in the very beginnings, the forerunners, of the Liberal Party between free traders and protectionists. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of the Labor Party will know that on their side there were some very profound debates, particularly before World War II and also in the 1970s, on the issue of tariff protection. If one is being honest about this tariff debate, one has to acknowledge that in the 1970s the general formal policy stance taken by both the Opposition and the Government, particularly after 1975, was one of great caution about tariff reduction. It is true, I acknowledge, that the Whitlam Government reduced tariff protection by 25 per cent. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZD4">Mr HOWARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate the free flow of the Minister's interjection. There were some people who called them cowards but the point I make is that many of the Labor Party's own rank and file called them destroyers of jobs and destroyers of manufacturing industry. I can remember in my early years in this House listening to Rex Connor, the late former member for Cunningham, getting up and lambasting the 25 per cent tariff cut. I can remember Labor member after Labor member lambasting it. I can remember at the first industry dinner I attended as Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs in 1976 that Pat Hills, the former senior Minister for Industrial Relations in the New South Wales Labor Government, got up and, in moving the vote of thanks, said that he was a high protectionist and was ashamed of what the Labor Government had done under Whitlam in order to reduce tariff protection by 25 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point I simply make is that if we go back over those years we will find many protectionist voices on both sides of this Parliament. We will find that the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) himself, when he was leader of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), once described the Industries Assistance Commission as the industries assassination commission. I had quite a lot to do with the present Prime Minister and other senior office bearers of the ACTU when I was Treasurer, and conspicuously absent from the submissions that they put to us during the 1970s and the early 1980s was any plan to reduce the general level of tariff protection in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are going to talk about the past, we have to be honest about the past. With the exception of people associated with the Industries Assistance Commission and a number of members of parliament-particularly the former Liberal member for Wakefield, Bert Kelly, who was one of the trailblazers of the low tariff debate, and a number of younger members of the National Country Party who came into the Parliament in the 1970s-the great bulk of people, the great bulk of members of parliament at that time, were at best neutral and at worst highly supportive of a high level of tariff protection. That applied in the Liberal Party, I acknowledge, in the Labor Party and certainly in the National Country Party. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we would pay a great compliment to the Australian people if we all acknowledged the fact that everybody has learnt a fair bit over the last 15 years about the nature of the Australian economy and about the nature of the challenges it faces in a difficult world. I am prepared to acknowledge that the Prime Minister has learnt and I am prepared to acknowledge that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has learnt, because my memory is good enough to recall the fact that when the Labor Party was in opposition before 1983 it totally opposed the then coalition Government's policy of pricing crude oil at the world level. I can remember when we brought that policy in that the present Treasurer said we had a branch of the Taxation Office at every petrol bowser. He said it was a wrong-headed policy, and I can remember some very vigorous debates between him and the former Deputy Prime Minister, Doug Anthony. </PARA>
<PARA> I can remember that the Labor Party in opposition opposed every single measure we brought in to reduce expenditure. The former Prime Minister used to have a saying-that the former Leader of the Opposition, the present Governor-General, had a view that if we proposed a deficit his deficit would be D plus one. In other words, he always added about $1 billion to the deficit we brought down. The then Opposition opposed every attempt that we made to broaden the indirect tax base. The then Opposition, particularly the present Treasurer, originally opposed the recommendations of the Campbell committee of inquiry into the deregulation of the Australian financial system. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention those things not in any way to gainsay the fact that different attitudes were taken by some of those same people after they got into government but merely to make the point that, if we are going to have a useful reflection of the past, it is important that it be an honest reflection and that we do not engage in this rather mindless exercise of trying to rewrite economic history for our own political advantage. </PARA>
<PARA> We had an example of that in Question Time today when the Treasurer quite dishonestly claimed there had been a million people out of work, unemployed, during the 1982 recession. The peak figure during the 1982 recession was 750,100, and in fact the number of additional people rendered unemployed by that recession never exceeded 396,400. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply make the point again that if we are going to talk about the past, we have an obligation to be honest about it. The Prime Minister has an obligation when he talks about these alleged 30 years of indolence and indifference and doing nothing about regulation to remember that in the 10 years he was President of the ACTU he, more than any other Australian, was responsible for putting into our industrial relations system many of the restrictive work practices that are now choking the competitiveness of this nation; that as President of the ACTU he demanded a 27 per cent wage increase for airline pilots; and that as President of the ACTU he refused to cooperate with successive labour Ministers in the Whitlam Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Go and ask former Senator Jim McClelland what he thought of the performance of the present Prime Minister as President of the ACTU. Go and ask Frank Crean what he thought of the present Prime Minister as President of the ACTU. Go and ask any Ministers in that Government what they thought of the lack of economic responsibility shown by the present Prime Minister. This man who now parades himself as the epitome of a courageous economic rationalist was a crude economic populist in the 1970s. His only agenda was his own political aggrandisement. He had no concern about the long term economic viability of the wage claims that he was exhorting from the trade union minions who supported him. </PARA>
<PARA> These are facts. They are not fiction or distortions. It is within the political experience and memory of quite a large number of people in this Parliament that those events actually occurred. Normally one would not engage in this kind of historical perspective but I have noticed a great desire on the part of the Government, as its own economic credibility disintegrates, to hark back more and more to a past that day by day it steadily distorts. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course in no area is there greater culpability carried by the present Prime Minister than in the area of building up labour market practices. When he was the President of the ACTU, he regarded company profits as a bottomless pit for extortionate wage demands without any economic justification or rationality. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister may now preach the virtues of restraint, and so he should, because we live in very restrained times. He should remember, as should every other member of this House, that there was another Hawke in another time, and that other Hawke in another time was an infinitely less responsible person than he now would encourage us all to believe. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), who was Opposition Treasury spokesman for almost the five years that I was Treasurer in the Fraser Government, will remember well that the economic plans of the Labor Party in opposition never included any reform of the waterfront; they never included any transport reforms; they never included any privatisation; they never included any financial market deregulation; they never included any taxation reform other than the imposition of new forms of capital gains or wealth taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister talks about privatisation and the revolution of the telecommunications industry. Has he forgotten when the Davidson report into telecommunication services in Australia was released in 1982 that he and his colleagues in the ACTU ran a vicious scare campaign about the introduction of the recommendations of that report? Has he forgotten that the Australian Postal and Telecommunications Union in particular targeted the seat of Diamond Valley, then held by the former member for Menzies, Mr N.A. Brown, who has recently resigned, who was the last communications Minister in the Fraser Government? Has he forgotten that during that election campaign it lied and distorted the intentions of the Government at that time regarding some changes to the telecommunications industry? Has he forgotten that in doing that it was hardly behaving as paragons of virtue and reform in that particular industry?</PARA>
<PARA> I mention all these things to sound a warning to the Government that there is no real profit for it in constantly and dishonestly harking back to the past. I am more than happy to engage in a debate about the past. I am more than happy to acknowledge that neither side of politics in the past in Australia has had a monopoly on virtue or perfection. I am prepared to acknowledge that for a long time in this country both sides of politics assumed that something would happen, something would turn up, and that something would be around the corner. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been an enormous change. We have all been mugged by the economic reality of the 1980s. All of us, some earlier than others, recognised that the world changed forever in the early 1970s when we broke away from fixed exchange rates, when we had the first oil shock, and Australia for the first time really began to be exposed to a very cruel and inhospitable international economic environment. If we are really concerned about a rational economic debate in this country, and if we are concerned to use the remaining two years of this Parliament to pay the Australian people the compliment of conducting that rational debate, both of us will observe rules of honesty and restraint when we talk about the past and, to the extent that it is necessary to talk about the past, to enlighten us about the future, we should do so with commonsense and, above all, with honesty and integrity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad to follow the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) in this debate. This statement on industry policy, Building a Competitive Australia, comes eight years too late. Industry policy should have been given the highest priority when the Hawke Government took office in 1983. Australia began the 1980s with a weak and immature industrial structure, overwhelmingly dependent on tariff protection with a culture fearful of radical change and large scale industrial innovation. We begin the 1990s with a weak and immature industrial structure, no longer able to rely on tariff protection, and exposed to competition not just on price but on quality.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our inventory of manufactured goods, especially elaborately transformed manufactures, brand name, high value added products, is threadbare. If we are not producing manufactured goods and services that the world wants, then changing the protection regime will not, by itself, improve the situation in the short to medium term. A blank inventory in a protected economy is unsaleable, but so is a blank inventory in a non-protected economy. </PARA>
<PARA> Sweden, with a population barely 55 per cent of Australia's, has at least 25 multinational corporations selling brand name goods and services at the top of the range, or near it, at a premium price, trading on their reputation for reliability, long life and style, aimed at international market penetration. Where is the Australian equivalent of Volvo, Saab, Scania, Bofors, Ikea, Orrefors, Electrolux, SKF, L.M. Ericsson, Hasselblad, Husqvana, Atlas-Copco and AlfaLaval?</PARA>
<PARA> There are several Australian multinational corporations, but their exports are generally invisible, simply transformed manufactures such as steel or aluminium ingots, which only gain visibility as part of some other nation's brand name products. Fosters is a rare exception. We sell cheap and buy dear. We export the simple stuff and import the clever stuff. This has been obvious for a decade, but successive governments have only nibbled at the edge of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> The value of manufactures exported has certainly increased in recent months-a trend to be welcomed-but there is need for caution. First, we start from an extraordinarily low base. Secondly, converting bauxite to alumina or exporting scoured wool is treated as manufacturing for statistical purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> In March 1983 the election of the Hawke Government was followed by the breaking of the drought, the end of an era of industrial confrontation, and the start of an era of consensus in which the prices and incomes accord was vital; 1983-84 was marked by a striking increase in employment and production creating a new mood of optimism. This mood reinforced the deeply held Friedmanite views of Canberra's senior bureaucrats-fundamentalists who proclaimed market force economic theories with a theological fervour-that the economy would recover without direct intervention. </PARA>
<PARA> At the National Economic Summit of April 1983-where I was `disinvited' because I prepared a paper which reflected my longstanding concerns about our industrial strength-the references to tariffs in the communique were vague and the references to our industrial base virtually non-existent. This encouraged the fallacy that Australia's economic base had enough inherent strength to become internationally competitive, provided that protectionist and interventionist measures were withdrawn, and that where there were weaknesses exposure to the bracing winds of market forces would fix them up. A three legged horse will not necessarily run much faster if exposed to competition in a race. </PARA>
<PARA> Useful industry plans introduced by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) preserved some sectors and streamlined others-steel, motor vehicles, shipbuilding, chemicals and plastics. Other schemes, such as offsets and industrial partnerships, have improved local capacity. The grants for the industrial research and development scheme and the 150 per cent tax incentive for research and development have encouraged some incremental changes inside Australian corporations, but in 1991 Australia finds itself further back in terms of international competition than it was in 1983. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) called this an era of breathtaking change, but the response of Australia's managers has been laid back rather than breathtaken. Even worse, the period 1991-96 looks far less promising for newly emerging manufacturing nations to penetrate world markets with new products than the period 1983-88 would have been. </PARA>
<PARA> While industry is spending more on industrial research and development than it did a decade ago-it could hardly spend less-Australia, despite the 150 per cent tax incentive, is actually falling in the comparative tables of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) for business enterprise research and development. We are now listed in category four, low tech countries, together with Argentina, Greece, Iceland, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain, Turkey and Yugoslavia. I seek leave to incorporate the table in Hansard. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="KH4">Mr BARRY JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is not a promising start for an explosive growth in Australia's capacity to produce high value added exports. In recent meetings of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris and Montreal which I attended, there has been a consensus that after 1992 the international economy, especially in industrial innovation and development, will be totally dominated by the triad. This triad-not a Chinese torture gang-comprises North America, western Europe and Japan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some experts argue that in the 1990s up to 98 per cent of all innovation and product development will be controlled by the triad, leaving the remaining 2 per cent to be competed for by China, India, Taiwan, Singapore, Hong Kong, South America, eastern Europe, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, Australia and New Zealand. Even if the figure was 10 per cent rather than 2 per cent, it would make for very stiff competition in which Australia is not well placed. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some significant omissions from the industry statement. The courage of a commitment to abolishing protection is welcomed, forcing us out of the economic closet, but it will not be enough on its own. There is no reference in that statement to the cost of capital, higher in Australia than in any OECD country except Spain. Interest rates are a major reason for corporations borrowing offshore and this, coupled with the cost of capital goods imported, compounds our adverse terms of trade. Prime lending rates in Japan, the United States and Germany are 8.25 per cent, 9 per cent and 10.5 per cent respectively. </PARA>
<PARA> An overvalued Australian dollar certainly reduces the cost of imported capital equipment where outright purchase is involved, but where funds are borrowed, either domestically or abroad, this advantage is lost and the value of the Australian dollar is a significant disincentive to exports. There is an urgent need to create a significant capital fund of patient money, at least $1 billion, to support industrial development on an equity basis, not as debt, where a short term return is not expected. This money essentially would be raised from the private sector. I am not suggesting that it should be government money. The need for it is obvious if we look at our recent history. It could have covered situations such as the gene shears fiasco, to which I will refer in a moment and which will be dealt with next Wednesday night at 8.30 on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's program Sheer Genius, or Don Metcalf's work on using hormones to simulate the bone marrow in cancer cases which received commercial funding from the United States because no company here would touch it. </PARA>
<PARA> I confess to some lack of enthusiasm for the term `clever country', which was not my coinage, I hasten to add, but has now been hallowed by frequent use. Certainly we must move away from being only the lucky country and the clever country might do as an intermediate step, but we need to aim to become the intelligent country. Dictionary definitions all suggest a slick, facile quality about the word `clever', as if all we needed was a quick fix. `Intelligent' means `thought through'. We did have a reputation for resourcefulness-we could fix up a leaking water tank, as I am sure all members of the National Party are taught to do, with chewing gum, and do clever things with fencing wire. But in the age of micro-electronics these skills are no longer particularly relevant. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer to some of the themes that came out of the February 1991 Montreal OECD conference, which I attended, re-enforcing some concerns about gaps and failures in our industry policy. The first relates to clusters. The key to success in industrial research and development is seen as the development of inter-related clusters of industries. Sweden and the Netherlands are examples of small countries where clusters of industries interact. For example, Volvo is directly involved as a developer, not just a consumer, with the metals, plastics, electronics, glass and paint industries. When research is developed it is shared by the companies in the cluster and collectively it provides both a critical environment, that is, checking and testing, and a critical mass big enough to be viable. By contrast, most Australian industries develop in isolation, lacking critical mass and inter-dependence. Our own corporations lack internal diversity, that is, providing their own clusters of activity. The Sarich engine is a classic example of a great technological development which operates in total isolation. </PARA>
<PARA> The second issue is that of raising funds from the banks. Raising capital for industrial innovation is extremely difficult here. Banks are in a poor position to form judgments about industrial developments because they see things in isolation, case by case, without any basis of comparison and the lack of clusters exacerbates this. </PARA>
<PARA> The third issue relates to intellectual centres in industry. Where is the intellectual guts in the world's major industrial sectors? Not here, other than in wool processing and some metallurgy. Our medical research does have great intellectual strength but it is not an industry; it lacks appropriate partners. Pharmaceuticals, vaccines and medicine ought to be very promising areas for us but 1990s competition will be much tougher than the 1980s would have been. It is not too surprising that our brightest people want to go off-shore to pursue their expertise. In a world context we look absolutely peripheral. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's industrial base is characterised by an extraordinary conservatism. There are only three countries outside the Third World which have essentially the same exports that they had 70 years ago-the Soviet Union, Australia and New Zealand. The world has changed but--</PARA>

It is essential that we analyse our strengths and weaknesses in this area to provide a national inventory, database or cadastre so that we know where we are, what the basis of international competition is and where we have strengths and weaknesses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fifth issue is disappearing frontiers. The industry statement emphasised that tariffs should be phased out but tariffs are essentially a barrier control and barriers are coming down everywhere. The distinction between micro- and macro-economic factors is disappearing, as is the distinction between science and technology, between public and private expenditure, and national and international industrial effort. With the disappearance of national boundaries there is an urgent need for new rules of the game. Australia may be the last country on earth to grasp this, next to Albania. We sense the growing conflict between the inertia of the present and the impact of global change but we do little to respond. </PARA>
<PARA> Sixthly, we are generalists in an age of market niches. Australia-growing up with a protected and isolated environment-tried to be self-sufficient, attempting to make everything. But we cannot advance along all fronts. That involves making choices. Leaving it all to the market is far too passive. We do not have much grasp of the extraordinary diversities of international markets and what they want. We must make choices, evaluating our options, even though this is against the prevailing paradigm in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> The seventh issue relates to picking winners. Can governments pick winners? The almost universal consensus in Canberra-and Montreal too-says no, but that does not mean that we cannot apply our accumulated knowledge to industry and to work in a cooperative way to develop broad general sectors in industry. I reject the concept that we are forced into a position of economic agnosticism, that we cannot apply our accumulated wisdom to make any choices anywhere. It is true that recent events in Victoria and Western Australia have put picking winners in a very bad light. It is important not to confuse the principle which can often work effectively, as it did when governments exhumed the Australian film industry under Gorton and Whitlam, with the practice, when appalling judgments are made by people totally unqualified to make them. It is certainly true that losers have an uncanny gift for picking governments. </PARA>
<PARA> The eighth element relates to governments as providers of long term vision. If we use the term `vision' in Canberra one is generally thought of as being certifiable. But we have to have that quality of vision beyond the next election and the election after that. </PARA>
<PARA> The ninth and final point is that we need to recognise the role of governments as variety generators or depressors. The Montreal OECD meeting put a heavy emphasis on the role governments can play in encouraging variety. This is not variety in product range, which we have done to excess, but variety is defined as a wide range of experimental behaviour-that is, governments say that problems can be handled in a diversity of ways, that there is no single set of solutions for every problem. Australia, with its long history of conformity and obedience, finds it hard to handle more than one paradigm at a time. But if ever there was a time for adventurous thinking, for lively debate in this Parliament, in the community and within industry, this is the time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight, in joining with my colleagues on this side of the House in response to the statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on Tuesday afternoon, I think I join with many other people around Australia when I say that there is justifiable criticism of the Prime Minister's statement, a statement for which a great deal of expectation had been created and from which, I believe justifiably, a great deal of disappointment has been generated as a consequence of its delivery.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The principal cause of that disappointment is the fact that the statement made by the Prime Minister does not address the micro-economic reform issues that confront Australia today. The Government has in its statement made a number of changes to the protection arrangements that exist for particular industries throughout the country, but whilst that might be welcomed by most in the community, except those who will be the recipients of that reduced protection, it is something that causes all of us a great deal of concern when we look at the other side of the coin of restructuring Australia, and that is the micro-economic reform which is necessary to reduce the barriers to competitive trade and competitive export activity here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a great deal of talk about micro-economic reform from the Government side of this House. After the last Federal election, the Government said that micro-economic reform would be the measurement of its success during this term of its government. That was a very bold and brave statement and one which any rational person would welcome. At this time, following the Prime Minister's statement on Tuesday, it is worth our while to judge and evaluate precisely how successful the Government has been in this crucial area of micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA> The most visible and most easily measured form of micro-economic reform is within our transport sector, because our transport sector is considered to be one of the most inefficient sectors of the economy, and within the total spectrum of our transport sector the waterfront and coastal shipping industries provide us with a very good window into how this Government is turning its rhetoric into action. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Government casts our textile, clothing and footwear industries, our motor vehicle building industries and others into a more competitive environment, we have to judge whether, in the process of doing that, it is making other sectors of the economy perform better to enable those who are losing their protection to be able to compete to give them some hope of viability and some hope of continuing in their present form into the future. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the pace of reform on our waterfront and the pace of reform within our coastal shipping industries, one can only say that this Government is moving at snail's pace. If we look particularly at the waterfront-and waterfront firstly because waterfront represents the greatest element of gain out of those two sectors of the transport industry, waterfront and shipping-we can easily measure whether this Government is doing the task that it set out to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> First of all, we would have to say that Australia's waterfront is probably the most inefficient waterfront that exists in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries today. In its report a couple of years ago, the Industries Assistance Commission said that Australia's waterfront is only 50 per cent as efficient as the average European waterfront. Australia's waterfront is only 40 per cent as efficient as the average Asian waterfront. There are many examples of just how inefficient Australia's waterfront is. </PARA>
<PARA> However, we have had a reform program that this Government started in 1989. We are now precisely halfway through it. Already we can quite easily measure that this Government has failed in its attempts to maintain any reasonable pace for reform. However, that complete and very obvious failure does not stop the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) from declaring, I noticed in today's paper, that the pace of waterfront reform would soon be ahead of schedule. Indeed, it has not stopped the Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) from declaring, as the Prime Minister did today in the House, that waterfront reform was on schedule and, indeed, moving ahead of schedule. </PARA>
<PARA> I am afraid Senator Collins is obviously in need of some rest. He is obviously showing signs of fatigue, because he is starting to hallucinate. How do we know he is hallucinating? We know because, if he is prepared to go out and say that the pace of waterfront reform is ahead of schedule, he is seeing things that nobody else in this country can see. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no question but that the pace of waterfront reform-by anybody's measurement, by any objective measurement-is way behind schedule. If we look at the Government's own measurements for its success in waterfront reform, we should have had 500 waterside workers made redundant by September of last year. The result last year in September was not 500 waterside workers; it was zero. No waterside workers had been made redundant, despite the fact that the Government had said 500 would have been made redundant. At this stage in the game, the program of reform on the waterfront would have seen some 1,000 waterside workers made redundant. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the score as at this moment? If all of those who have agreed to leave the waterfront do actually leave at the end of this month, we will have had 451 go from our waterfront out of a target of 1,000. There is no way in the world that anybody who is objective or rational or anybody who has a real grip on what is going on in this country could say that, when one sets a target of 1,000 and only achieves 451, somehow or other that puts one's program ahead of schedule. The program is not ahead of schedule; it is way behind. Senator Collins falls guilty to the claim of deluding himself and trying to mislead the people of this country in their claims that waterfront reform is ahead of schedule. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister's statement on Tuesday of this week made a number of claims. For example, he said that by the end of this year waterfront reform would see 1,500 waterside workers having departed. That statement in itself proves beyond doubt that the waterfront reform program of this Government is behind schedule, because in its own schedule 1,500 people should have left the waterside not by the end of this year but by September of this year. The Prime Minister's readjustment of the measurement of success indicates that secretly, in their own minds, Government members realise that their program of waterfront reform is behind schedule. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister bases his confidence on the fact that the Government can achieve these targets. Very few in the industry believe that it can achieve even the target that the Prime Minister announced on Tuesday. The Prime Minister bases his confidence on the fact that the National Terminals (Australia) Ltd and Container Terminals (Australia) Ltd (CTAL) organisations have been able to achieve agreements through enterprise based agreements (EBAs) between themselves and the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister said in his statement on Tuesday that he was pleased to announce that Conaust Pty Ltd had an agreement with the Waterside Workers Federation and that this would lead to significant improvements in productivity on the waterfront. If we look at the Prime Minister's statement and compare that with the reality of today, we will find that the Prime Minister has not told the story as it is. Indeed, it could be said that the Prime Minister has misled the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I will leave it to people to judge for themselves whether that is the case, because in reality there is no agreement between Conaust and the Waterside Workers Federation as a result of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission's ruling. That ruling creates an environment in which an agreement can be negotiated over the next month or so; there is no agreement as at this stage. But that did not stop the Prime Minister trying to delude himself and the people of Australia by saying there was an agreement. Indeed, even the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) earlier this afternoon on this same debate said that the Conaust-Waterside Workers Federation ruling through the Industrial Relations Commission virtually created an agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister's bold statement that we had an agreement and the comments this afternoon of the Minister for Finance, who said that we virtually had an agreement, I think tell the story of the way in which people such as the Prime Minister and Senator Collins are prepared to rearrange the truth in order to suit their own political arguments. There is no doubt that there is no agreement at the moment between those two groups. They have a ruling from Commissioner Sweeney which may lead to an agreement being established in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Prime Minister claims that it is actually Conaust which has that agreement. I make the technical point that it is not Conaust which has that agreement; it is a subsidiary of Conaust called CTAL. CTAL is a small part of Conaust's overall operations. The agreement-if it can be achieved-between the Waterside Workers Federation and CTAL will lead to some 120 redundancies being achieved on the waterfront. Conaust needs over 800 redundancies for it to satisfy its targets of reform on the waterfront. So that is the second incorrect point in the statement the Prime Minister gave to the Parliament on Tuesday. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point is that the CTAL ruling was achieved outside the Government's waterfront reform process. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport and Communications have gone to a great deal of effort in the last 48 hours to prove to the people of Australia that that is not so, that indeed the Industrial Relations Commission was somehow part of the overall plan for the Government's waterfront reform processes. How does the Prime Minister justify that? The Prime Minister justifies it by going to the in-principle agreement that established the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority (WIRA). That makes one very brief reference to the Industrial Relations Commission. What it did was ensure that those signatories to the in-principle agreement were not denied their right to go back to the Industrial Relations Commission if and when they chose to do so; if and when they found that the dispute they may have been confronted with at the time could not be resolved through WIRA. </PARA>
<PARA> The Conaust group decided, as a result of its very lengthy period trying to negotiate its EBA through WIRA, that it could no longer proceed, could no longer establish its goals through WIRA. It chose to step aside from WIRA and to move back to the Industrial Relations Commission. However, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport and Communications somehow or other claim that this was all a part of their plan, that WIRA actually involves and includes the Industrial Relations Commission. In actual fact it does not; indeed, if the Industrial Relations Commission was part of the waterfront reform process, why did we need to have a specially established entity called the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority?</PARA>
<PARA> If the Industrial Relations Commission, in the mind of this Government, could have achieved those sorts of reforms on the waterfront, why was WIRA established in the first place? The reason WIRA was established in the first place was simply because the Government did not think the existing means of industrial arbitration could achieve the goals it set out to achieve. That is the third point upon which this Government has deliberately attempted to mislead the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth point is terribly important for us. The Prime Minister and other members of the Government say that the national terminals agreement will deliver significant advantage to Australia. I draw to the attention of the House the words of the Chief Executive Officer of National Terminals up until a couple of weeks ago, when he retired from that post. At a conference in Sydney three or four weeks ago he said that, as a consequence of National Terminals' enterprise based agreement, he could see no tariff reductions to the users of National Terminals' services. Why? Because the cost of implementing National Terminals' EBA would probably outweigh the cost advantages of implementing the efficiencies that the EBA would be able to deliver. </PARA>
<PARA> What we can see from that example is that the Government, despite all its rhetoric, despite all the talk it goes on with, will not be able to deliver benefits to the people who actually use the waterfront, which was the whole purpose of having a waterfront reform program. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many aspects of this whole process, including shipping, which indicate that this Government is not capable of creating micro-economic reform, whether it is on the waterfront or within our coastal shipping services. The only people who have the will, the determination and the ability to deliver reform on our waterfront and in our coastal shipping industries and to deliver micro-economic reform across the board are the people who sit on this side of the House, and until such time as we have them in action we will not get micro-economic reform. </PARA>

<PARA> I rise with some concern because I am not a convert to the new faith. It seems to me that we have all discovered a new religious fervour which will solve all of our economic ills and which will take us through to utopia again: I remember it was minerals in the 1960s and 1970s. Apparently it is going to create in Australia efficient, competitive and prosperous industries under conditions that no other country in the world has adopted, except possibly Greenland or some country such as that. I am not certain that these measures will work, and I want to make that very clear. I certainly hope they will work and I believe that if in fact this is the way we should be going the measures have been spelt out in a way that gives them maximum possible opportunity to work. </PARA>
<PARA> It is notable that the Opposition has chosen to avoid debate on the issues in this statement and has sought to create diversions in order to justify its total lack of policy on anything. It is a coincidence-although perhaps it is not really-that in two major Western countries there have been for the last 10 years conservative governments practising policies similar to those that are now going to solve all of our ills and all of the ills of the Western world. </PARA>
<PARA> Today in the United States, which is now 10 years into conservative governments, they have poured $30 billion into bailing out the savings and loans associations. Unemployment is very high, their balance of payments is extremely poor and, to put it mildly, their economy is in a mess. Honourable gentlemen opposite would say that we should adopt those policies because of the great success they have not had in the United States.</PARA>
<PARA> Is anyone going to suggest seriously that Britain under Thatcher was prosperous? Their interest rates are higher than ours, their unemployment is higher than ours, their balance of payments problems are growing, and they are officially, by world standards, in recession. It does not sound as if the Thatcher policies, which those opposite would have us believe will cure everything, are working there. </PARA>
<PARA> More importantly, there are very substantial risks in this statement. We are reducing tariffs at a very rapid rate in two or our major employing industries: textiles and motor vehicles. In the case of the motor vehicle industry, with no credit, of course, being given by honourable gentlemen opposite, the unions came up with proposals suggesting reduction in tariffs and increases in productivity and efficiency at a rate higher than the car companies themselves. They did not support the final reduction to 15 per cent, but they certainly supported the first reduction to 25 per cent through to 1996. </PARA>
<PARA> The employment-the livelihood-of many members of the unions in the vehicle industry is on the line. They have put forward proposals that they have prepared, and I sincerely hope are able to deliver on, to improve the efficiency of their industry. This statement at least provides incentives for the skilled end of that industry-the end of the industry where the maximum value added and, therefore, the maximum value to Australia exists. The car companies now have to match what the unions have offered and both have to deliver. It is not a one-sided bargain. </PARA>
<PARA> We should not run away from the fact that, by increasing our dependence on imported motor vehicles, we are increasing our drawings on foreign currency, which we are not currently earning. We do not have the surpluses of foreign currency to meet the additional costs which will be involved in reducing the Australian input into the motor vehicle industry. The figure of $2.7 billion was given to me in answer to a question as the foreign currency cost. The offsets which are suggested by the Industry Commission in its draft report were that we increase access, remove restrictions from mining and remove restrictions from mineral and other forms of resource exports. Australia does not have a future as a quarry. Our future has to be in using the undoubted skills we have to add value to the products that we export and to manufacture for our own consumption those products which we can justify manufacturing at costs which are within reasonable world standards. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not true to say that because we remove tariffs we get cheaper items off the shelf or across the counter at the retail levels. I can remember that a few years ago that was done in respect of one of our fertilisers-it was going to save cost inputs to farmers by a large amount. It did not save a cent. As soon as the Australian industry disappeared, the price went up to what it was for the imported products: their end had been achieved. What the market will bear is what the price of goods is likely to be in Australia, irrespective of where they are sourced. </PARA>
<PARA> The car industry represents a very substantial part of our manufacturing industry. It also represents an industry which does not exist in any other country without protection of one form or another. I have heard the throwaway line that we should compete on equal terms. Whose equal terms? Italy has quotas on its vehicles; in Germany and the United Kingdom there are voluntary agreements; Korea used total import bans to protect its industry; and Japan has a myriad of protective measures which no-one has been able to find their way through in the 20 or 30 years that it has been a major industrial power. When we say `no protection' or `equal playing fields' we are not telling the truth, are we? We are using slogans to replace the truth. The facts are that all of the people with whom we compete against provide incentives and assistance and use other forms of tariff and non-tariff barriers in order to protect their industries and encourage their exports. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned that the rate of reduction in textiles can and will cause serious problems, especially for provincial and smaller communities where textiles have traditionally been one of the very few long running employment areas for people who remain in those towns and cities. A 3 per cent reduction in tariff is a lot, but it is nowhere as significant as the removal of quotas. Because most of our competitors are prepared to subsidise exports to cover increased or substantial tariff protection, and most also use various forms of protection to protect their own industries, it will not be difficult without quotas for any level of tariff to be offset. There is a great risk that our textile industries-and that means the basic employment base in substantial parts of Australia-will disappear without any offsetting benefits to Australia whatsoever. Goods are now being imported into Australia at prices well below that at which they are being marketed and importers are pocketing the difference. They will continue to do so whether there is an Australian industry or not. Those who believe that the benefits of these changes will flow through into our economy are deluding themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the assistance measures contained in this statement are of some value. The sales tax exemptions and other measures which will financially assist those people who are prepared to commit money in this country will be of assistance. But there is no quick fix. There is no way that by transferring the policies of the United States, which have failed there, or by transferring the policies of the United Kingdom, which have failed there, and having them fail here will do anything for our economy. People have made commitments and I sincerely hope that they are successful. </PARA>
<PARA> I make it absolutely clear to this House that I do not have the religious fervour, and I do not believe anyone doubts, that the current conventional wisdom is the be-all and end-all of knowledge. It is an idea, an untried idea, and an idea that is as likely not to work as it is to work. If it does not work we have done mortal damage to our economy and standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I make one other point: in this experiment there will be winners and there will be losers. The statement mentions that some things will be done to cushion the blow of the losers. The last time we went down this track-and it has to be said that no Liberal government in office has ever done anything of this nature-large numbers of people lost their jobs in the textile industries in particular. Despite the rhetoric, they did not get jobs ever again. In Geelong, the weavers who walked out of the factories went home and they never worked again. They were not looked after. They did not believe then that someone had given them a benefit by allowing them to stay home when they would have preferred to have gone to work and contributed towards this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to once more go over the failure of the statement, Building a Competitive Australia, by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) of two days ago. That failure has been well described by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and to some extent in some aspects, although I do not agree with them, by the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes). The statement has been also roundly criticised for its gaping omissions by, amongst others, the Business Council of Australia, the National Farmers Federation, the Australian Mining Industry Council, the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and the Australian Chamber of Manufactures. Many thousands, if not millions, of words, no less laudatory, have been written about it. Even the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) now almost agrees with the criticisms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I can understand the Government's dilemma and its internal problems in getting this matter right. The Minister who represents the Minister for Industry Technology and Commerce in this House, the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean), was reported in 1983 in the Australian as telling the Australian manufactured exports seminar that the trade union movement was opposed to any reduction in protection levels. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>Australia would be `living in a dream land' to talk about free world trade while countries had `all sorts of sophisticated systems' to protect their industries. Scaling down of protection levels would be `crazy' because of the adverse effects on employment levels. </PARA>
<PARA>I can understand that the Government has had some trauma in coming to this decision which goes no more than halfway, or not even that far, into correcting the ills of this country. However, instead of discussing the general dilemma of the Australian Labor Party, in the short time that is available tonight I will comment on the specific measures affecting Australian industry that the statement did contain. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the remarks by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) yesterday, the Government has virtually adopted the coalition's tariff policy-and we welcome that. The coalition, as we have said many times, considers that it is unreasonable to reduce protection without accompanying comprehensive, synchronised structural reform. Most importantly, we are committed absolutely to removing gradually all forms of protection to all industries and to comprehensive micro-economic reform. The Government, however, has omitted the other side of the equation-micro-economic reform-which means that the Treasurer's warning last year about wiping out industries with regard to our policy will come true, not as a result of our policy but as a result of his. </PARA>
<PARA> To get to the particular concerns, it is encouraging to see that the Government has adopted precisely our policy on developing country preferences-namely, to freeze and then phase out the preference margin for newly industrialised countries in tandem with general tariff reductions. The Government has also moved some way towards our proposal to reintroduce the much shorter, pre-1989 time limits for anti-dumping investigations, although we consider that 135 days before provisional measures can be imposed is still far too long. We say it should be 55 days. </PARA>
<PARA> Acceptance of most of the Industry Commission's final recommendations for the automotive industry is also a step in the right direction, although the coalition would prefer to see the car industry receive the same level of assistance as everybody else by the year 2000. More specifically in that regard, we support, somewhat reluctantly, the continuation of export facilitation in this industry because it would be far too disruptive to withdraw it now. Moreover, the subsidy implicit in the scheme will dwindle as the tariff comes down. </PARA>
<PARA> However, whilst we have the scheme, we support measures designed to make it more flexible. Some of those measures are the abolition of the base year hurdles, unfettered transferability and sale of credits and the abolition of ceilings on the level of export credits. We support the abolition of restrictions on the direct use of credits by component producers and the removal of eligibility of exports to New Zealand. Trans-Tasman relations would be improved even more if the Australian Government agreed to challenge the Trans-Tasman shipping agreement which costs us, in the Prime Minister's words, $70m a year. </PARA>
<PARA> As for the new automotive value-added criteria, who knows whether this will improve industry efficiency. The Industry Commission did a complete back flip on this between the draft and final reports, highlighting the fact that there is probably no right or wrong answer. The only comment I make is that the scheme is so complex-and now the criteria is to be changed again-that I wonder how much time, effort and money is spent trying to, firstly, understand how it works and, secondly, modify behaviour to get the greatest benefit. It becomes an industry in itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Overall, the potentially absurd impact of export facilitation is illustrated by the cancellation of the rear axle contract between the Ford Motor Co. of Australia and BTR Engineering (Australia) Ltd which, I am advised by some industry sources, is due to Ford's desire to use up its bank of export credits. The main protagonists in this story are not confirming or denying this, for obvious reasons, and I am not suggesting that under the current arrangements Ford is doing the wrong thing. But if this is the result of export facilitation, then the sooner the scheme goes the better. </PARA>
<PARA> The volume sanctions currently in place have been retained for another four years. In line with long held coalition policy, we oppose this extension because who knows whether the Government's model of an efficient industry would equate with what would happen in a genuinely competitive market. Mitsubishi Motors Australia Ltd was forced to cease production of its Colt under these requirements and it says that it cost the company $10m in bottom-line profit last year. If that is true, it does not seem very bright to me. </PARA>
<PARA> After persisting for nearly a year or so with the sales tax on luxury motor vehicles, to prove some point of ideology or to win an election, the Government has finally conceded its mistake and returned to the 20 per cent and 30 per cent sales tax regime. This is still not good enough, but it will help stop the rot in the importing sector, which has suffered a major downturn of more than 70 per cent in sales and broken many dealerships. As a result, it is possible-probable in fact-that the Government has lost revenue of maybe as much as or even more than $200m from a tax it claimed would raise an additional $100m. Apparently, the Treasurer does not know what that loss is, as he quite clearly advised the House earlier this week. This tax was a reminder that this Government is not immune to sacrificing economic good sense for a few votes, something the resource-based industries are well aware of. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the area of textiles, clothing and footwear (TCF), once again the Government has gone some way towards adopting the coalition's policy to reduce all forms of protection to all industries by the year 2000. We have said since 1989 that the TCF plan would need to be hurried up. However, as with the car industry, as with all industries, the TCF sectors will pay a heavy price for the Government's failure to address micro-economic reform. So, whilst we agree with the proposed reductions as far as they go, we also agree with Mr George Innes of Bonds Weaving Mills, who is President of the TCF Council, that many firms will go to the wall because they will not be given the opportunity to reduce their costs of operation by comprehensive and synchronised reform. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government, therefore, has not delivered the changes necessary to generate the additional $40 billion from micro-economic reforms and industrial relations changes that were outlined by the Business Council of Australia in its recent report Developing Australia's National Competitiveness. Instead, it has promised a new import credit scheme which, although quite ungenerous compared with the car industry's export facilitation program, will create new distortions, penalise efficient exporters in other industries and seriously undermine Australia's credibility in arguing for freer world trade. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is probably not GATT okayed at all. In fact, there is plenty of doubt about that and, as I understand it, the Government had advice to that effect before it started it. Like the Industry Commission, the coalition does not regard these export subsidy schemes as viable alternatives to reducing impediments to export, and we strongly oppose the new TCF proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are several other measures which will affect industry. By introducing the limited sales tax exemptions, any benefits of which I fear will be swamped by bureaucratic requirements, the Government is tacitly conceding we need a comprehensive goods and services tax. The accelerated depreciation schedules earn the Government a tick, but this is small beer in the current hostile investment climate. The promise of resource security legislation demonstrates a very belated change of heart, one must say, on the Government's part, but it really must be a case of `too little too late'. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two interesting aspects in the promise of a venture capital fund to help small and medium businesses, and the continuation of the application of the research and development tax concession indefinitely at 125 per cent. The former has so far failed to get off the ground-bombed out, I suppose we could say-presumably because the leading institutions seem to have held their ground against such an unwise investment proposition. This is extraordinary. If those banks and other institutions are not prepared to invest in those operations by themselves, how on earth could they be coerced into investing in a joint venture and how would the trustees of those superannuation funds uphold the purposes of their trust? In any case, it seems to me that that proposal has gone in the proper direction and will not appear. The latter proposal as to the 125 per cent tax concession is not the answer to Australia's poor commercialisation of research. Lower interest rates, lower taxation of risk and lower inflation are. </PARA>
<PARA> A few dubious industry planned sops to appease the junior Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean) in the aerospace and information industries have appeared, and the coalition has grave reservations about these. Finally, a couple of new surveys designed to work out where we are going wrong in workplaces and in key service sectors of the economy compared with those overseas made their appearance as well. Whilst it is good to see that international best practice is finally recognised by the Government as the appropriate yardstick-although we would not have believed that listening to the Prime Minister yesterday-we need action to close the gap, not studies to measure it. As I said yesterday, the unintended consequences of this statement are that industry will demand immense changes to every workplace in the country, and I foresee the end of the centralised wage fixing system-the sooner the better. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The task we have before us is the building of an efficient, competitive industrial sector which will enhance Australia's economic growth through strong export performance. The statement made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) this week establishes a positive framework to achieve this goal. The Government has addressed a broad range of structural constraints to our competitive capabilities and these initiatives are welcome. The ball is now very firmly in the court of the private sector. Instead of the constant process of excuses and blame seeking, which has often marked the business sector's major contribution to economic debate in this country, let us have some action. The Government has cleared the decks and prepared the way for business. The real challenge now is to see if business is up to the task.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No government since Federation has reformed the macro-economic framework like the Hawke Government has in its eight years of office. We have brought the Australian economy kicking and screaming into the twentieth century and, with the new range of measures announced by the Prime Minister and other Ministers, this Government is building on that foundation to take our economy into the twenty-first century as a strong, viable, competitive and structurally sound operation. The record of achievement in macro-economic reform-of deregulation of the finance sector, restructuring of the tax system, reduction of protection, reductions in labour costs, and restructuring of awards and work practices-contrasts starkly to the period of non-achievement when the conservative coalition was in power. </PARA>
<PARA> In the micro-economic reform agenda, this Government has achieved substantial efficiency and productivity improvements in the waterfront, shipping and aviation sectors, with planning and progress well under way for even greater reform in land transport and telecommunications. More can and will be done in the weeks and months ahead to restructure these areas to enhance our competitive performance. </PARA>
<PARA> The statements of the Prime Minister and other Ministers contain a number of specific features which warrant further discussion. One of the most important elements is the attention to the enhancement of our export performance. I recently travelled to Asia as part of a parliamentary delegation which visited Hong Kong, Singapore and Indonesia. During that trip the members of the delegation spent a considerable amount of time discussing trade issues with local business people, expatriate Australian business people, Austrade and Australian diplomatic staff, and government Ministers and officials. A number of important themes emerged from that trip which are relevant to our consideration of this industry package. Of course, the complete report of the trip by the delegation is yet to be finalised and presented to the Parliament, but I am sure my colleagues who were other members of the delegation will not mind my making some observations during this debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian products are well considered by business people throughout Asia. On a number of occasions we were told that of the four key elements of a product's export success-that is, quality, price, reliability of delivery and costs of delivery-our goods rate very well on the first two measures. Australian produced goods have a good reputation for quality of product and the prices at point of production are often quite competitive. The areas where improvements are necessary are reliability of delivery and transport costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The views on the problems associated with these two areas were often associated with impressions or general feelings about Australia's performance, rather than specific examples of difficulties that had been encountered. But there are two points which are reliable. First, many Australian business representatives do little research or preparation before embarking on a mission to sell their product in an Asian country. They fail to appreciate the way Asians do business, to ascertain the market tastes or habits or to build up a working relationship with their possible clients or business partners. Too often, we were told, an Australian salesman will arrive at the door of Austrade in Singapore or Hong Kong with a bag of goodies under his arm and two days to sell them. After failing miserably to make any sort of impression, he returns to Australia to inform the management of his company that there was no market in Asia for the company's products. If Australian companies want to build an export trade in Asia-and I can assure all honourable members that there are plenty of opportunities to do so-they need to make contacts, develop those friendships, understand the needs of the market, process and package their product to suit the specific needs, tastes and habits of the particular target consumer group, and be prepared to supply the product on a long term basis. </PARA>
<PARA> This is where Austrade can and does provide positive assistance to Australian business. With the implementation of the McKinsey recommendations to further improve Australia's trade performance, there are no reasons for Australian companies not to prepare fully their groundwork before attempting to enter the Asian market. </PARA>
<PARA> Too many businesses see Asia as a place to off-load their excess or unsold production at a particular time. Asians are no different from Australian businesses and consumers; if they are going to purchase a product and establish a liking or need for it, they want to know that it will be regularly available, otherwise they do not want it in the first place. This is an important component of the reliability of delivery question. </PARA>
<PARA> On the second question of transport costs, there is no argument that our waterfront and shipping areas have long needed overhaul. Honourable members opposite have no right to lecture the Government on this matter. They sat on their hands for 30 years and allowed our shipping and cargo handling facilities to deteriorate. It has been this Government that has tackled the questions of staffing on shipping and waterfront labour restructuring, but the costs of transport are not high purely because of labour costs or work practices. There are considerable areas of reform required in management structure and practices as well. There are major inefficiencies, a lack of skills and urgent issues of cargo and container tracking and dispersal which need to be tackled immediately. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us get some balance in this debate about shipping and waterfront reform. The Government this week released details of new measures which will lead to significant productivity and improvements and time and cost efficiencies. The union movement has recognised its responsibilities and has actively participated in negotiations with government and management to reform work practices and wage levels. </PARA>
<PARA> One issue which was raised with our delegation in Hong Kong was that there are no direct shipping links between any Australian port and Hong Kong. All ships stop off at either Singapore or Taiwan or the Philippines before travelling on to Hong Kong, thereby causing delays in arrival and increased costs. This has a detrimental effect on our trade with this vitally important trading centre and needs to be rectified. This is a shipping management issue and it highlights the point I made about the need for review of management skills and practices. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious that in many areas in our economy, the private sector has not fulfilled its own responsibilities to look to the future, to the long term. This is especially noticeable in the area of high technology and scientific products. Despite handsome tax concessions, little in the way of scientific manufacturing and development is carried out in Australia at present. Many in business seem more concerned with finding taxation loopholes and making company takeovers than scientific innovation. As Dr John Kemp, former director of the Australian Institute of Engineers, has stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Australian management is technologically ill-informed, deficient in entrepreneurship and more concerned with taxation advantages of negative gearing to finance unproductive take-overs than through the actual creation of wealth through innovation. </PARA>
<PARA>Many in the business community continually argue that Australia cannot expect to produce quality scientific products because Australia has little scientific research. This argument is completely fallacious and flies in the face of known evidence. Australia is one of the world's most productive nations in terms of its scientific research. As a nation we produce 2 per cent of the world's scientific papers with only 0.3 per cent of the world's population. This compares with Sweden, which produces 1 per cent of the world's scientific papers with 0.15 per cent of the world's population. </PARA>
<PARA> However, private expenditure on industrial research and development is pitiful. There are only three counties in the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development which spend as small a percentage of gross domestic product on industrial research than Australia. In Australia only 0.21 per cent goes towards research, compared with 1.26 per cent in Sweden, 1.26 per cent in the United States and 1.5 per cent in Japan. The institutions which clearly spend the most on scientific research and development are the publicly owned institutions, most significantly, the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Problems occur in the manufacturing of these developments and taking this research to an exportable, elaborately transformed product. It is largely publicly listed companies which fail to reinvest in Australia's future and it is technological control which is vital to Australia's future. Australia must maintain its technological sovereignty if it is to have any serious effect on the balance of payments problem. The Government, in the industry statement, has decided to permanently provide a 125 per cent tax concession for research and development in the private sector. As the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce (Senator Button) said in his statement on Tuesday:</PARA>
<PARA>A strong commitment to research and development is essential if we are to create and maintain the competitive edge necessary for success in the 1990s. </PARA>
<PARA>Australia has the skills, the resources, the infrastructure, the labour and the location to be a major exporter to the developing nations of the Asia-Pacific region. This industry statement provides the private sector with new opportunities to capitalise on these natural advantages. Time will tell, however, whether the business sector in our nation has the commitment and the skills to maximise the benefits for the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other broader issue of importance to this debate, and that is the question of direct Government intervention in the economy. The arguments are often put by those opposite that by promoting greater deregulation and further free marketeering we will fix the Australian economy. That is simply not true. The world's great and emerging economies are characterised by greater government involvement, not less, and by greater channelling of private funds, under government fiat, towards industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Those who rail against government involvement in industry by citing the failures of some programs in a couple of States are simply economically myopic. They fail to see the stark difference between casino capitalism, which has been the weakness of these States, and the proper role of government involvement as has occurred in countries such as Germany, Japan, Korea, Taiwan and Singapore. </PARA>
<PARA> Those who argue for the totally free market approach should look at the success of these countries. It is these countries who came from a base far below that of Australia to attain a level which is equal to or often ahead of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> On my recent trip I was most impressed with the level of industry and activity of business which was taking place in Singapore. Singapore is remarkable for a country of only 2.7 million people. Unlike the economies of many other countries in the region, the Singapore economy is not driven by employing large numbers of low paid and low skilled workers. It operates by offering companies-predominantly foreign owned countries-an educated and technologically literate work force and modern efficient infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA> The Singaporean Government actively encourages the work force to undertake further education, whether they be shop floor workers or senior level managers. By educating the work force, the Government can offer business a valuable commodity-a skilled and highly competent work force. This is the continuing challenge for our nation which has been taken up by this Government and which is very much part of the thrust of the industry statement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was indeed interesting to listen to the last speaker. I congratulate him on having found science, because there are few on his side of the chamber who have found science. He may have taken the time to listen before dinner to a very interesting speech from a former Minister for science, the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones). Is it not ironic that the honourable member for Bass traced a little bit of history to explain how he was not invited to that great summit several years ago? He prophesied that we needed to address the issue of tariffs-which the Government finally addressed in the industry statement and which we welcomed. He also addressed the problem of science-over which he ultimately paid the penalty of losing his ministerial position because he kept on harping on and on and on about it and no-one on the Government side would listen. But he went on yesterday; he was at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and he made an interesting observation. He said that it was too little, too late. And he said it again tonight. He pointed out that we needed high value exports; we needed to develop niche markets; that 98 per cent of innovation would come in the years ahead out of the triad-the United States north America area, western Europe and Japan-and therefore there was only a small niche available to Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The emphasis we needed to place on training and acquiring skills-all those issues should have been dealt with when you came to power. We were dealing with them when we went out of office. You sat there and you did not listen to people such as the honourable member for Lalor. So as a new member I congratulate him for finding science and recognising its importance, because he is a member of a team that ignored it. The person who best articulated the needs of science and the interrelationship between science and innovative policies that foster those issues was ignored by his own government. It ignored all the things he said in Sleepers, Wake! It ignored its own disciple on its own side. He had his own back tonight, and I congratulate him on standing up and saying it, and I hope others in the Government listened to him. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing he said-and I was not going to speak about this issue-is that we needed a lively debate in this country about these issues and that the challenge was to look beyond accepted dogmas and to provide a little vision and policy innovation. The industry statement on Tuesday did not provide that. That was his point. It missed the opportunity; it missed the challenge. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) said today in his reply that the challenge had been missed. You had a brilliant opportunity to seize the difficulties and address them with new and imaginative policies. You went a little way down the road, but you did not go the full way to address those problems. That is the point the Leader of the Opposition was making today. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a question of honesty and leadership. It should be recognised that the Australian people are scared. As to the false claims by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) about everything being right, the lovely numbers, everything being effervescent, people do not believe those any more. It is interesting that tonight he was up there with the team in the dining room. I have not seen the Treasurer in the dining room for a long time, but he was there tonight and we know why. He was either counting the numbers or trying to make sure that he does not get shifted out of his portfolio. Would it not be ironic if he was sent to science and the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Crean) was moved into Treasury? We would be very interested to see that take place. There also needs to be an emphasis on export performance. There needs to be an addressing--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GJ4">Mr SMITH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know who will be more surprised. Welcome to the chamber. What I was about to talk about, before I was sidetracked by the issue of science, was the question of communications and the lack of any mention of communications in the speech by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). It was not until the matter of public importance that afternoon that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) had something to say about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> He told us that major reforms had been put in place and that they were under way, and indeed some reforms have been announced. But the question that really arises is how successful they are at the present time. Are they ultimately going to be successful and are they on target? A longer period is required to discuss these matters than is available tonight, but quite clearly the Government is in trouble, as I will illustrate in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been a number of selective leaks about elements of the communications package, and I think a lot of questions remain to be answered. Interestingly, I note that the Minister is to give a speech tomorrow at a function in Melbourne. It is regrettable-and I think it is a growing trend-that major statements concerning these vital micro-economic areas are now being made out of the Parliament rather than the Minister coming into the Parliament and telling the nation exactly what is proposed by the Government in its reform packages. </PARA>
<PARA> Some issues are subject to discussion. For example, the Aussat sale is the first major privatisation that has been undertaken by the Government. We supported the legislation when it came in here because it has long been our policy that Aussat should be privatised. It was to form the basis of a possible second carrier, a competitor to Telecom Australia. We have long taken the view that Telecom could do with a competitor, and perhaps more than one competitor. In any event, this is the path the Government chose to take in its statement of 8 November. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister would have us believe that everything was going extremely well. Indeed, the former Minister, the present Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), in his contribution to this debate tonight explained quite forcibly that in his view there had been major changes, that everything was proceeding well, that there had been some reductions in Telecom's prices in the subscriber trunk dialling area, that everything was proceeding, and that by 1997 `we will end the duopoly and move then to open competition.'</PARA>
<PARA> If we compare that statement with some of the leaked material that is coming out of the office of the Minister for Transport and Communications, it is quite clear that this whole process is under question. Issues have been raised as to whether or not the 1997 duopoly period may be extended or whether that date should become a review date rather than a cut-off date. Questions have been raised about pay television, which has long been denied to this country. On this side of the House we have always wanted it, and suddenly it is back on the agenda. It is being used to dress up Aussat, to provide it with a way of attracting a bidder. I think that policy is fraught with danger. It has not yet been explained by the Minister. It was taken off the Cabinet agenda last night because the Minister needed to talk with more of his colleagues to gather support for what he was proposing to do. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole matter of cross-media ownership rules is now being discussed by the Government. It has been mum about that, not explaining what it wants to do. Interestingly, in the Sydney Morning Herald today a leading communications writer, Mr Fred Brenchley, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . It also points up the hypocrisy of the Government's stated aim behind cross-ownership-to encourage the entry of new media owners. Treasurer Keating, the undisputed architect of cross-ownership, told Parliament this week the policy was responsible for a `massive increase in media diversity' It was a fib on the grand scale. </PARA>
<PARA>There is clearly a great deal of division in the Government about how it is going to address these issues. I believe that the Minister should have taken the opportunity this week, given the importance of communications. When we look at communications as an industry, we look at the cost to business of accessing communications services, which are primarily in the public sector in this country. That is the difference between the Government and us: we want to produce a very competitive marketplace and put communications into the private sector ultimately, but the Government wants to keep it in the public sector. In so doing, the Government is creating a lot of problems for itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, the marketplace has finally recognised what is going on, as I long predicted it would once we started to go down this track. In this respect we should look at the leading communications journal in Australia, Australian Communications, which is a monthly publication. I am only new to this job, although I watched and spoke on communications issues for some considerable time while I was in the privatisation shadow portfolio, so I do not come to it totally untutored. It is interesting to read the views of some of the experts in this country. The headline in this month's edition is `Avoiding a Farce'. The article is about Aussat and it states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there are already rumblings from deep within the bureaucracy that it may have to be recast. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>Where it would appear that Mr Beazley must take some of the blame is in the notion that a purchaser would willingly take on Aussat with or without its debts. </PARA>
<PARA>There are debts of about $500m. It further says:</PARA>
<PARA>If there is only one serious bidder for the second network licence then the whole process clearly becomes a farce. Rather than see it through, Mr Beazley should call a halt and recast his policy. </PARA>
<PARA>This is from the editorial of that magazine and these are people who watch these issues very closely. A little further on in this expert Australian communications magazine there is a heading `Confusion Out Of Chaos-The Aussat Sale Saga Continues'. The article goes into some detail and raises concerns about the direction in which the Government is going. On the opinion pages there are two interesting opinions. An article by Mr Tom Amos is headed `Bounding Away with Re-regulation'. The other article by Professor Bill Melody is headed `Contradictions in the New Legislation?'. </PARA>
<PARA> There are concerns about this policy and where it is today. This is a central part of micro-economic reform. Two Ministers have come here this week and said that everything is on track. Clearly it is not. The point I wish to make is that these issues should have been addressed in the micro-economic area, which has been neglected by this statement. Indeed, it is extremely unfortunate that the first opportunity for the Minister to address this matter is in Melbourne tomorrow rather than in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one final point I wish to make about this whole area, which was touched upon by the Leader of the Opposition this afternoon, and that is the role of unions in the telecommunications area. We need to get a competitive environment as quickly as we can in this country to be able to reduce the cost to business of accessing communications services. It is a dynamic industry. It is a growth industry. Australia must be part of it. We have seen the recent English duopoly come to an end, as announced in the House of Commons last week, while here in Australia we are creating a duopoly. </PARA>
<PARA> One area which is important to draw attention to, as my Leader did, is the role of unions in the telecommunications area. I have long held the view that there is a union threat to reform in this area, and it is one of the unspoken outcomes of the megacom saga that we are seeing created-the Telecom OTC Ltd merger. Privatisation ultimately will be an issue that will be debated but certainly the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association, with some 24,000 members-the largest union in Australia-was able to roll the more competitive telecommunications model proposed by the Treasurer and it forced the capitulation of the Government to a duopoly structure. </PARA>
<PARA> All acknowledge that this will entrench Telecom's power and position, and will not produce the benefits that could accrue to consumers under a more competitive structure. Indeed, in the Spring 1990 issue of Commercial Issues, a trade magazine, it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA>At the end of the day, the future of Australia's telecommunications system is being played out in a caucus committee where the dominant force is the ATEA. Good economic sense has once more rolled over and died, as so often it does when it's Telecom on the line. </PARA>
<PARA>My point is quite clearly that the strength of the unions in the Telecom area, as they amalgamate, will provide a stumbling block to reform. I believe that is recognised by the management within Telecom. It is certainly recognised by us. What is happening is that we are responding to vested interests-the vested interests of the employees within Telecom-rather than addressing the fundamental problems that we have with Telecom; that is, it is a featherbedded organisation which has admittedly made improvements but which can make far greater strides in terms of efficiency and productivity. What we are going to see is a battle-exactly the same battle we saw at the special privatisation conference when this policy was evolved. It will be a battle between those who want to go down the greater efficiency and productivity path and those who want to stay and re-regulate, protecting existing systems and existing job patterns. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement this week has given us the opportunity to address those problems head on. The Government again missed that opportunity, and what is going to happen is that we will not see the benefits accrue through decreasing prices for communication services, as we should have in this country, because the Government is going to tie one of the hands of competition and it is not going to allow that reform to happen. It is going to re-regulate, to put in place a duopoly. Probably it will review that period set down and will try to leave it in place longer. It has expressed all these flowery words about wanting competition but they are going to be compromised in the technical detail that will go into the Acts of Parliament that are supposed to facilitate that very competition. </PARA>
<PARA> I put the Minister on notice that every single clause of that legislation will be studied very carefully to ensure that the first priority is competition, greater efficiency and productivity because that is the direction in which communications policy in this country needs to go. It does not need to be hamstrung by powerful unions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the statements on industry made by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating). The first point I would like to make is that they are not counter-cyclical policy speeches. The counter-cyclical policies are already in place, and we are starting to see an upturn in the economy as it comes out of the trough of this recession. These structural adjustment programs are part of a continuing process, and I would like to talk about them in that context.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would also like to point out to the previous speaker, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), that we have taken action in the area of science, most recently at noon today when the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean) announced the first 15 of the 50 cooperative research centres to be established in a $100m program. I am pleased to inform the honourable member, and I am sure he will be delighted to know, that two of these will be in the seat of Adelaide and two more involve associates from surrounding areas in the metropolitan area of Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make three points about these statements. Firstly, I note that these industry statements announce a number of initiatives to improve our international competitiveness, but we have not been trying to pick winners. We have removed sales tax from business inputs, reformed depreciation allowances, maintained tax deductibility for research and development, reduced tariffs, and reformed the transport and communications infrastructure. These are all indirect measures that represent the Government's view that its role must be limited to creating an environment in which business can become internationally competitive, a situation that has not obtained for two generations. </PARA>
<PARA> Where there have been attempts to pick winners in this country by the channelling of government funds to selected enterprises or through the use of cheaper government-guaranteed loans, these attempts have resulted only too often in spectacular losses of public money-losses which have then had to be made good by ordinary taxpayers. Other forms of assistance have included tariffs, bounties or cheap loans from publicly owned banks, but these are made available only at cost to other areas of the community or the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very hard to follow a logic that has Christopher Skase subsidised by the Adelaide taxpayer, or a Melbourne shoemaker fed on profits created by Brisbane customers' money behind a tariff wall. What we are trying to do is channel assistance to all industries by reducing those costs over which they have little or no control-indirect taxes, transport, communications and so on-and those that are associated with excessive government regulation so that the market, and bearing in mind that the people create the market, can then be freer of distortions and featherbedding and go on to pick its own winners rather than have politicians and bureaucrats pick them. </PARA>
<PARA> These statements by the Prime Minister and the Treasurer cannot be seen in isolation. The process of reform is a continuing one of adjusting our economy to the changing circumstances of technology, international trade and investment, and the needs of our community. We have not done this very well over the last 70 years, and it is often noted that only three countries have the same export goods structure that they had in 1920-New Zealand, the Soviet Union and Australia. This has changed a little over the last couple of years but we still have to forge ahead, making it change more quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> The statements follow many others that have recently been released on, for example, transport and communications and the structure of government in this country, and they will be followed by further statements on other areas of the economy as it becomes necessary. There is no light on the hill in the form of a fixed condition at which this country can arrive and then stop and rest, any more than there is a regulated dirigiste future with the kind of regulated economy that the coalition bequeathed to us. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is now in a world changing very rapidly. We have to change with it, and the process of change is continuous. If we do not recognise this, if the community as a whole does not recognise this, and act on it by accommodating these changed circumstances, we will continue the process of economic decline which we have witnessed over the last generation. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I would like to make concerns the Opposition's criticisms of these statements, which have been essentially that the statements-and that by the Prime Minister in particular-do not go far enough. Much of that has been echoed by the press, although not by my local metropolitan newspaper. Certainly that has tended to be the criticism the Opposition has made in this House of all Government statements. I think essentially this is because the Opposition has been embarrassed by the speed of change that this Government has undertaken, its record of economic reform, and it is stung by these statements, as it is by other statements and Budgets. They have all contained measures which the Opposition parties either never contemplated or did contemplate and were afraid to implement when they were in government. Now, in opposition, they have reacted by going to exactly the opposite extreme and claiming that the Government has not done enough and that they would do much more. The credibility of the Opposition is greatly dented by the fact that it did little when in office. </PARA>
<PARA> In any case, I think the Government's activities are misjudged by the Opposition. The Opposition appears to believe that it is possible for the Government to move at the same pace on issues such as tariff reform and micro-economic reform. With tariff reform it is relatively simple to issue a statement saying that tariffs will be reduced at a particular rate over a particular period and get people to comply with that because it is an area over which the Government has control. In the areas of micro-economic reform we encounter obstacles in the form of State governments, employers, employees, federations of different kinds and cartels who will be opponents of changing their behaviour. We have to go out and negotiate with these people in order to achieve results. </PARA>
<PARA> In the area of the waterfront, for example, this is not difficult. We are facing work practices and systems of organisation that have been in place for a generation and are jealously guarded. However, agreements reached recently will lead to productivity gains of 70 per cent, achieved in part by the elimination of 1,500 jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very hard to undertake these micro-economic reform programs. They cannot be done, as the Opposition appears to believe, by edict. They have to be done by a continuous process of negotiation with the people who are in those sectors of the economy. In other words, it is a process of persuading people to do things, much of which they do not wish to do in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, it is persuading universities to rationalise their structures, to take more students and to teach new subjects. It is not just about mouthing the complaints of those opponents to change in those universities, which is what the Opposition spokesman does every time he gets up on the subject; it is about getting competition in our domestic airlines by changing work practices and not by crying foul and pleading for the Government to surrender by negotiating with the recalcitrants who would not change their work practices, as was the case for six months during the pilots dispute. </PARA>
<PARA> It is taking on resources security policies and backing them-not by kissing the loggers when you are outside the House and by being nice to the greenies in matters of public importance inside the House. It is by reducing public expenditure by 7 per cent of gross domestic product; by actually withdrawing public money from people who do not need it; by using assets tests and means tests, which are then continually criticised by the Opposition in every measure of that kind that I have witnessed introduced in this House over the year that I have been here. The Opposition claims it is going to do better, and more of it, than we do. It is by actually cutting tariff subsidies by looking workers in the eyes, by looking bosses in the eyes, and saying to them, `Sorry, chaps, this is to the short term disadvantage of the security of the job that you have been used to doing, but it is desperately needed in the national interest'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not by going about saying, `We do not know if we can do it', as the honourable member for Barker (Mr McLachlan) explained to the National Press Club. It is by imposing civilised environmental standards on obdurate industry, despite the opposition of State governments, and not hiding behind, `We cannot run an environmental policy because of States' rights', which was the policy on which the Opposition went to the last Federal election. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, micro-economic reform is not done by edict; it is done by going out and doing the hard yakka of talking people into micro-economic reform. It is hard work; it is incredibly hard work. It takes guts. It takes guts by a front bench to devise the policies; it takes guts by backbenchers to explain to their constituents why what is happening is in the national interest and the long term good of this society, and it is not by squibbing it at every opportunity. </PARA>

<PARA> Thirdly, I would like to clarify my position as a South Australian member of this Parliament. The industry statement has not been met with universal joy in South Australia, and the State Government has understandably been rather nervous about the adjustment policy that we are requiring of the automobile industry in particular. I do not criticise it for that. The role of the State Government in our Federal system of economic management is rather different from that of the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the nervousness of the South Australian Government is misplaced. The car industry has in fact lifted its game enormously over the last 8 years under the reform programs of this Government: tariffs have come down; cars have improved; and their prices have reduced. We are a much more competitive automobile industry as a result. </PARA>
<PARA> I am delighted to see that after a few early criticisms the South Australian Government has now announced the establishment of a task force to ensure that the readjustment process will be undertaken in the South Australian automobile industry. I know from a recent tour of the Mitsubishi plant and from looking over the new model Magna, which was launched this week, that it will be up to the task. Not only that, it will be exporting. As we reduce the cost of moving motor vehicles out of South Australia into the international marketplace, we will be exporting many more. In any case, for the next 10 years the automobile industry will continue to benefit from substantially higher levels of protection than is the case in other industrial sectors. The impending reduction in the value of the dollar-which I should think would move downwards by a few percentage points more over the next few months-is likely to offset those tariff reductions which do take place in the next couple of years. </PARA>
<PARA> South Australia, the State that I come from, was, with Victoria, the principal beneficiary of the dirigiste State protectionist-cum-subsidy structure developed by Sir Robert Menzies, Sir John McEwen and Premiers Sir Henry Bolte and Sir Thomas Playford in the 1950s and 1960s. As a result, Victoria and South Australia, particularly my State, are still very heavily dependent on the protective industries that were established in that time. </PARA>
<PARA> Even without the elegantly constructed arguments of the Industry Commission under the Garnaut report, anyone walking around Canberra would know that protected industries are not going to survive in the political climate of the 1990s. The Opposition is at one with most of the intellectuals, most of the economists, most of the bureaucrats in this town and most of the members of the Labor Party who come from States other than those with heavily protected, domestic industrial bases constructed a generation ago and finding it hard to survive. The fact is that we in South Australia must change our economic structure into more high value-added, high tech, modern industrial outputs whilst reforming our automobile industry to ensure it can compete. </PARA>
<PARA> That is why I welcome so enthusiastically the multifunction polis (MFP)-a horrible name but a great proposal-and why I will do everything I can to represent it here and elsewhere. That is why I have been so disappointed that so many people in South Australia initially reacted in such a hostile fashion, for a whole variety of reasons, against the MFP, including the Australian Democrats, one of whom said that we would have to take the top off the Adelaide Hills in order to fill in the site where it was proposed to put the MFP; the left wing outside the Labor Party; initially, unfortunately, sections of the Liberal Party; and a swag of academics fanned by a very good local newspaper in all other respects called the Adelaide Review. </PARA>
<PARA> South Australia's numbers are small and they are growing smaller because the growth rate of our population is lower than that of the nation as a whole; we are an ageing population, perhaps the oldest of any State; and we receive fewer migrants than our percentage of the population as a whole would warrant. Maybe some of these facts are related to the protected nature of the industry and the low rate of growth that it has in the State; maybe it is related to natural resources; maybe it is related to the sunspot cycle, for all I know. </PARA>
<PARA> But the fact is that in this environment it is quite clear that we as South Australians have no option but to change away from the heavily protected manufacturing base that was built a generation ago by Tories who had good reasons, in the climate of the time, to build that heavily protected manufacturing base with good markets for primary products, ensuring that the balance of payments was kept ticking over. Those days have changed. I see no option to change. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition, if we can believe its efforts, and if we can believe it would do it, only offered to change us at a faster pace by reducing tariffs and subsidies more quickly. If we can believe that that is what it would undertake, that is what it is promising. Indeed, the statement is already slower on the reduction of auto tariffs than was recommended initially by the Industry Commission-and I would have to say this is to some degree as a result of representations by members such as myself. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be remembered that we are now not moving from a 1950s-1960s economy to a 1990s economy; we are moving to a situation where our economy will have to be continually in flux. We are not moving from a nation in transition, from a province of the British Empire to a province of some other empire; we are moving to an economy that has to be continually reformed-an economy in a nation that must be in continuous motion of dynamic accommodation to changing international circumstances of technology, of flows of capital, of growth of markets. We have to register these things and we have to respond to them. We need new products, new processes, new ideas; we cannot freeze. We cannot say, `Not in my backyard'. I am afraid that the situation has changed and we have to take advantage of it. </PARA>
<PARA> This statement, far from saying `There is the light on the hill, here we go to join it', is one post on a long road which we are now taking as an independent, sovereign nation with no guarantees in the international marketplace other than those that we seize. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because of the limitations of time on our particular contributions tonight, I would like to concentrate my comments on my direct areas of responsibility in the shadow Cabinet, namely, tourism and aviation. From that point of view, the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) of a couple of days ago left a very great deal to be desired, because the real pity about that particular statement was that the word `tourism' was mentioned once. `Aviation' was virtually not mentioned at all. `Privatisation of the airlines' was not mentioned at all. `Reforms to the industrial system in Australia' were not mentioned at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems strange to me that Australia's biggest export industry-tourism-which has really been plagued by troubles over the last few years and is in quite a state of flux at the moment, was completely ignored. Yet of all Australian industry, it is the tourism industry, and the tourism industry alone, that in the short term has the potential to provide much needed foreign exchange but, most importantly, has the capacity to be able to provide jobs in big numbers for our young people. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1988-89, 21,000 new jobs were created in the tourist industry, and that was despite airline disputes and some of the economic downturn overseas. It proved that the tourist and hospitality industry was in fact the biggest private sector employer in Australia, employing some 600,000 people. In all, $22.5 billion was spent by tourists; $16.3 billion of it was directed by domestic tourists, the rest from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government benefited to the tune of $2.7 billion in indirect taxes, and tourism contributed 5.4 per cent of this nation's gross domestic product. Yet we are in trouble because the industry has been plagued by airline disputes, by the downturn in economic activity, both here and overseas, by the Gulf war and, in the case of northern Australia, by cyclones and floods. We have a real difficulty in that many of the major investors in the tourist industry are now getting out of it. No consideration was really given in the economic statement at all to what is happening in this industry and no contribution was made to try to revive that industry so it could reach its true potential. </PARA>
<PARA> Its true potential is simply this: based on conservative tourism forecasts provided by the Bureau of Tourism Research, there will be a demand in Australia for hotel rooms of 132,721 in 1995 and 163,816 by the year 2000. That means that by 1995 there will be a shortfall in Australia in the tourism stock of 16,629 rooms, or we will need another 167 average-sized hotels around Australia requiring a capital injection of $3.34 billion if we are going to get the tourist industry back on its present growth mode. That represents a total of 40,665 extra jobs for Australians, both in the construction and operational phase of that particular development. </PARA>
<PARA> What did this particular statement do for tourism? We had an analysis done of what it could mean in terms of the depreciation benefits that were announced by the Prime Minister. That is quite interesting on examination because the announced depreciation charges will apply only from 1 July this year and will not be applicable to earlier investment in plant and equipment. From July new plant and equipment can be depreciated over the effective life of the items. The definition of effective life is left to the taxpayer. However, a realistic definition must be used as claims will be audited. The plant and equipment which can be depreciated at escalated rates will include such things as refrigerators, air-conditioning equipment, light fittings, furniture, television and carpets. </PARA>
<PARA> No changes have been made to depreciation of the actual building structure itself or to any refurbishment work on the actual structure. The problem is that these changes are going to produce some inequality in that existing tourism infrastructure will, in effect, cost more by virtue of the allowances for new plant and equipment as from July. However, with the rapid obsolescence of much tourism equipment, it may well be that current establishments replace their plant and equipment within a relatively short time. </PARA>
<PARA> That is virtually the only help that we had in a direct form from this particular economic statement, except in one other area. The tax deductibility was given for environmental impact statements. This was generally described as a welcome move because the costs of providing some of these statements are very expensive indeed. The changes announced allow for these costs to be written off over 10 years or the life of the project, whichever is the shorter. However, the problem is that there are so few new tourism developments proposed now it does not really matter. Recent research has shown that no fewer than 173 tourism projects totalling $10 billion have been put on hold due to the tourism and economic downturn. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government undertakes a $54m promotional campaign for tourism starting within a few weeks. The Opposition has always said that it will welcome that. That campaign could well be too late. The industry really needs major micro-economic reform in a whole number of areas. It does need that incentive to get investment back into the industry. The problem is that tourism entrepreneurs are currently geared to the maximum banks or lenders could allow. The average gearing in the tourist industry 12 months ago was about two-thirds of asset value. As a result of a lack of profits last year because of the market fluctuations and the high interest rates we have seen an exodus of the major investors out of the industry and as a result of the fall in these valuations, many tourist projects have been forced into liquidation. Consequently, the average gearing of Australian tourism projects has risen from two-thirds to in some cases between 90 and 100 per cent and that is the real difficulty that is facing the industry at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> It is all very well for the Government to spend the $54m and we wish it well, but the major areas of micro-economic reform that affect tourism and affect so many aspects of trade and commerce in Australia were completely ignored in this particular statement. Obviously, I refer to the second part of my portfolio responsibilities-that is, aviation. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look over the first four months of domestic airline deregulation in Australia we see that there have been a couple of bright spots. But there has been no attempt in this statement to try to rectify some of the wrongs of domestic deregulation or make any reference at all as to how a level playing field can be brought about so that we can get true competition into the industry. There is no doubt that the granting of the terminal leases to Ansett Australia and Australian Airlines Ltd on the eve of the announcement of domestic deregulation has been a major inhibitor in getting true competition into our system. </PARA>
<PARA> If we believe that there is true competition, to a degree we are probably right. On the major trunk routes there is some price competition at the moment, but in most cases because new carriers have not been able to enter into the market because of the airline terminal situation and the economic downturn, we see a situation where the same old `heavenly twins' arrangement that was with us for many years still exists. </PARA>
<PARA> It is amazing that come the beginning of next month when Compass Airways enters the Cairns run we will see return tickets from Melbourne to Cairns for about $500. It is amazing that one carrier, namely Ansett, has already decided to match that fare proposed by Compass, but it will be flying over Mackay and Townsville and all the points in between where the same old air fare regime still exists and the people in those areas are paying maximum dollars. That has been brought about simply through the fact that the Government was never game to take the bit between its teeth and make sure that we did provide a level playing field in terms of domestic deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA> I was absolutely amazed to realise that although we are looking at increasing the number of people coming into Australia, and we are spending $54m on promoting Australia overseas, nothing has been done to ease the international airline regime. Nothing is going to happen because just a few weeks ago the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) told the House that as far as he was concerned nothing would happen in the life of this particular Government. A dorothy dix question was put to him about liberalisation of international airline regimes in terms of a study that was done for the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The Minister at that time said that that particular report on tourism policy and international aviation was `a fanciful reflection of a utopian world'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that the Minister knocks the OECD study on the head. He also knocks on the head the new head of Treasury who, in the Industries Assistance Commission report into tourism and travel, said that the greatest restriction that we had in terms of the development of tourism in Australia was the web of regulation that bound the international airline regime. </PARA>
<PARA> While the Minister might think this is all fanciful stuff, it is interesting that the managing director of the Australian Tourist Commission himself, Tony Thirlwell, said in September last year that the biggest obstacle to turning American travel interests into actual booking was the high air fare structure that existed into Australia. The Minister for Transport and Communications was even at odds with his own Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories (Mr Simmons) who on 16 October last year, when he was speaking at the Australian Tourism Industry Association's annual convention in Melbourne, said that he was prepared to promote a further relaxation of capacity constraints on international routes, the extension of interlining rights in Australia to all international carriers, the extensions of services protocol of Closer Economic Relations to include aviation-allowing Australian and New Zealand carriers the freedom to operate the trans-Tasman routes and domestic sectors-and the abandonment of separation between domestic and international markets for Australian carriers. That is word for word with the Opposition's tourism and aviation policy prior to the last election. The Minister for the Arts, Tourism and Territories sees the need, but the Minister for Transport and Communications says that this is all fanciful stuff. </PARA>
<PARA> I was in Perth last week, where the Minister resides. I was taken to task on the situation that exists there. Western Australia has a reasonably healthy tourist industry. It is starting to build up its services from Japan but it has a real problem. The loadings on the Qantas flights from Japan to Perth are 91 per cent full. It is assumed that an aircraft is full once it hits an 80 per cent load factor. Can the West Australians get any extra services? No way in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister, of course, does not realise that, unless we have enough capacity and unless we have a competitive airline regime, Australia will never reach its full potential in terms of tourism and aviation. At the moment about 2 per cent of the Japanese market and about one per cent of the American international market come here. If we could double those figures, it would be worth an additional $2.6 billion a year to our economy. But no; in the interests of protecting Qantas and preparing it for privatisation, we are not prepared, the Minister says, to look at any loosening up of the international airline regime. </PARA>
<PARA> The real problem is that our formerly great national carrier Qantas is a basket case purely because it has been protected to the hilt for so long and has lost its will to compete. I am horrified when I read press reports at the moment that the expected losses of Qantas for this particular year will be in excess of $360m. That means that Qantas at the moment is losing on average $1m per day. It is a dreadful situation when, in a desperate sense, Qantas has to fire not 1,200 people or 2,000 people, as earlier reported in the press, but up to 5,500 people in the next 12 months. That has come about because we have had a protected situation and Australia has lost the will to compete. That is very sad indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> There was an opportunity in this statement to take the aviation industry by the scruff of its neck and allow real competition to come about. The great pity was that the privatisation of Qantas did not happen a couple of years ago when profits were on the up and up and we had a chance to get some return on our investment. </PARA>
<PARA> What do we have to do? Do we have to look at an investment where Qantas, which contributes 0.2 per cent of our gross national product, is protected to the hilt and we cannot see the growth of further tourism, which is worth 5.6 per cent of GNP, purely because the Government has not got the intestinal fortitude to act?</PARA>
<PARA> That was the shame of this economic statement-that the real opportunities to provide jobs for Australians, the real opportunities for us to go out and be competitive in the world of aviation and international tourism, were missed. </PARA>
<PARA> We still receive only one per cent of international visitors to Australia. We have the potential of doubling that figure if we get our micro-economic reforms in aviation right and get to a situation in which the industrial relations system puts us on an equal footing with our major competitors and we can get out into the world and bring those international visitors into this country. We must never forget that every time we increase the net number of international visitors coming into Australia by 25,000, we create another 1,400 jobs. Unfortunately, in this statement the Government did nothing to provide those extra jobs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in support of the statement Building a Competitive Australia, which was delivered by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer (Mr Keating) on Tuesday. I believe it is a statement that on any fair test shows clearly a commitment, drive and courage on the part of the Government to do as the statement's title says-build a more competitive Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As we look at the various issues that were touched upon and dealt with in the statements last Tuesday, we see the Government showing its strength of conviction to ensure that in the 1990s we build Australia to a country which can compete effectively internationally and can meet the challenges that face us-particularly in our part of the world, which is one of the areas I want to focus on in my remarks tonight-and to ensure that over the next decade the decisions that were announced on Tuesday have the direct effect of creating an Australia which will be more prosperous, more resilient in times of challenge and, in times of difficulty such as we have today, will be more able to withstand the sorts of swings that occur with the reliance that historically we have had on commodities-on wheat, wool, agriculture and the like. </PARA>
<PARA> We really have seen that Tuesday's statement represented yet another passage in the Government's having the will and the conviction to ensure that Australia was opened up, that it was able to fulfil a proper international role, that it was a modern, contemporary and open economy and, at the same time, was one which recognises that the process of change has to be worked through rationally, has to be fully considered and implemented in a systematic fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> I will refer to tourism, because the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull), who spoke before me, referred to tourism. He also referred to aviation policy. I am really amazed at the gall that some honourable members have in debates in this place. In my view, my predecessor as member for Parramatta can claim as much credit as any person who has ever represented people in this Parliament for the creation of a tourism industry in this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He put it on the map. Before 1983 we did not have a tourism industry in this country. What have we got as a result of this Government's initiatives? We had the initiative first taken in 1983-84 to have the Hogan advertising campaign for tourism. That did more than any single thing to really develop and start the impetus for development of tourism infrastructure and to bring people from North America, Japan and elsewhere to this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government, as we will discuss when we deal with Appropriation Bill (No. 4), is making a further commitment towards tourism. An extra $23m is being provided in that statement towards a tourism advertising campaign, in this case using Greg Norman as the linchpin, again targeting North America, Asia and Japan as logical places from which to try to entice more people to Australia. I have no doubt that that campaign will be a very major stimulus again to our tourism industry. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had a discussion about aviation policy. For years we had a two-airline agreement in this country. Which Government abolished the two-airline agreement? It was this Labor Government which abolished the two-airline agreement, as it has dealt with so many of the other micro-economic reform issues. We hear people saying, `The pace of change has not been quick enough; we would be able to do it more aggressively' and all that sort of nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA> The two-airline agreement was in place until it was abolished late last year by this Government. What has been the effect? People talk about the effect in terms of tourism. We had figures recently that showed that more people travel on domestic aircraft than at any time in the nation's history. More people are travelling on aircraft than we have had in our history, including in 1988, with Expo and so on. That is a fact that is beyond dispute, and that is allowing for the fact that we are going through times that are difficult and times that we would all rather come out of as quickly as possible. Those things have been achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the question of aviation, we can also ask what were the respective attitudes when the pilots sought to go on their industrial action campaign. I was not here then, but I recall the discussions going on. I recall people on the other side getting up and being apologists for that sort of industrial anarchy. </PARA>
<PARA> We have ensured that our tourism industry is now on a footing that can be rationally looked at. It certainly has facilities and infrastructure the like of which we never saw. I can nominate my own electorate. As things stand today, there are three major hotels operating in the electorate of Parramatta. None of them existed before the Hawke Labor Government came to power. Another three are nearing completion. That will be six major hotels of at least tourist class or better standard which have developed just in my electorate alone. We can repeat that in many places around Australia. If people say that this Government has not provided the stimulus for the tourism industry, I simply say that those people do not know what they are talking about. That is the truth on that area. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to look at some other areas of micro reform. I will come to the matters that were raised by the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith) in telecommunications. For all of the time previously when we looked at questions relating to telecommunications, there was not any appreciable change in policy. Why was there not any appreciable change? I suggest that one of the reasons why there was not much change was reflected in the sort of question we had today from the honourable member for Riverina-Darling (Mr Hicks) about the closure of the Commonwealth Bank at Ivanhoe. </PARA>
<PARA> I can appreciate that a member of parliament representing that area would express concern. That is a legitimate thing for a member of parliament to do. But I ask honourable members to compare that with what we get from the Opposition, especially from many of the shadow spokesmen on these matters, who are very aggressive in their approach to privatisation issues. Their approach is to flog off the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> Who is going to worry about the folk at Ivanhoe, or anywhere else in remote and rural communities, if people take that sort of approach and do not consider the community service obligations that go as part of that micro-economic reform process? Who is going to look after those interests? Of course, no-one is going to. That is why we as a Labor Government want to ensure that change occurs, that we are able to make those government business enterprises more effective and more competitive. At the same time, we recognise the service and the facilities that they provide, which in many cases historically would not have been provided any other way. </PARA>
<PARA> We are taking steps to ensure that there is a competitive environment in the telecommunications area. We are taking steps to ensure that major things are achieved on the waterfront. I have actually spent a bit of time discussing these waterfront issues with people who know something about the industry. If only it were easy to achieve waterfront reform, as some honourable members opposite try to make out; but it is not easy. Honourable members opposite want to say, `Don't have a negotiated process, such as that through the WIRA arrangement. Don't approach things that way; let's take the unions head on'. They are looking for an industrial campaign, which is the way the tories always like to approach these issues. The truth is that the regime that built up around the waterfront arrangements was built up throughout all of those years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Absolutely. As the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel points out, it was Fraser Government legislation that set that regime in place. The truth is that changes in those areas can occur only through rational and painstaking effort and negotiation. I want to take the opportunity in this debate-because a lot of people, particularly in the media, are not prepared to do it-to commend the people in the trade union movement who have been prepared to confront these challenges in a real and sensible way and who are conscious of their responsibilities and obligations to ensure that waterfront reform is achieved, and will be achieved, through a process that is both rational and fair and recognises the important obligations we have to all sections of the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The next point I wish to raise, I think, is critical, and it has not had much analysis during the debate on this statement, particularly today. I refer to the labour market area generally and the need to ensure that as part of our process of reform, building a more competitive Australia, we recognise the critical area of skills and training. Regrettably, for far too long in this country we have not appreciated the importance of people having not only jobs but also skills, careers and employment structures in place that they can actually work to, that they can develop personally and, more importantly, through which they can make a real contribution to their employers. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is important that we establish the real value of what I would term the training wage, and it is referred to in the statement. It really is an integral part of ensuring that we are more competitive in this country. As I have said before, we cannot expect that the practices and attitudes that applied 10, 15 or 20 years ago can apply today. I am very pleased to see that so many people, particularly in the metals area, have recognised the importance of award restructuring, of multiskilling and of ensuring that, as structural adjustments occur, there are both training regimes and a recognition on the part of employers and employees that training must be real and sustainable. That certainly applies in the academic area, in the science and research areas, and the decisions taken in the Budget to extend taxation concessions for research and development are very valid and useful. </PARA>
<PARA> The announcement today of the 15 new cooperative science research centres again is a very positive step. So much of this skills base really comes back to the workplace. It is not just a case of saying, `We will fix all these problems by the deregulation of the labour market'. It is necessary to seek constantly to achieve flexibility in the labour market; that is not disputed. But it is equally important that we recognise that it is not just a case of saying, `The only people who have to make those sorts of adjustments and changes are those in the labour movement'. Frankly, the labour movement in this country has been very willing to take on that challenge. It has been prepared to develop attitudes which create careers and new opportunities and which give real aspirations to people who so often in the past, unfortunately, did not have those sorts of career opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> I say this because it is particularly critical, in my view, that we recognise the area of labour market and training skills, the great value of the traineeship system we are developing, and the importance of maintaining that skills base. When we have economic difficulties there is the potential for much of that training base and the opportunity to gain skills, particularly in the apprentice area, to come under real threat. I believe we want to encourage as many employers as possible to take what in many cases will be the difficult steps necessary to ensure that they retain that training base. </PARA>
<PARA> In this statement we have taken steps to introduce measures concerned with both job training programs and prevocational training, providing extra places in the technical and further education system. All of those things are very useful, but just as important are the efforts we are taking in concert with employers to encourage employers to keep their apprentices in these difficult times. As the economy comes out of the difficulties that have been experienced, we will have the skills base to ensure that our competitive position, particularly compared with those countries we have to look to increasingly in Asia, is retained. Far too often in the past this country has not taken advantage of these things. </PARA>
<PARA> I come from the western suburbs of Sydney and I remember the failure to appreciate the importance, firstly, of people being able to get a full high school education and, secondly, of having the opportunity to go on to either university training or technical college training. In 1983, when this Government was first elected, in the electorate I represent and in areas of western Sydney only one child in three completed secondary education. Very few of those children went on to university; it was very rare indeed. Today that number has doubled: two in three children now complete secondary education. That is a very significant achievement. We now have a university in the region into which the Government has put a great deal of effort and which is now a source of inspiration for people from the region to achieve all sorts of possibilities as far as their own personal development is concerned and as far as the nation's capacities are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has given priority to the critical areas of education and research and development skills, as we have to restructuring in terms of tariff reductions. These are positive moves. They are difficult and courageous moves, but they are important ones. At the same time, we have recognised that those sorts of policies are conducted against the background of an underlying belief in the social justice values that are important to ordinary citizens who in many cases need help. They should be able to get that help and a government should have the compassion and the conviction to provide that assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe this statement is a very important part of the Government's continuing desire and drive to create a more competitive environment in this country. For all of those reasons I believe it should be welcomed by all Australians as a very positive step forward in their interests and in the future long term interests of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition rejects the document Building a Competitive Australia as being deeply flawed. While the Government does go part of the way to implementing our policies on lower taxes on business inputs and on tariff reduction, it does not go nearly far enough. There are no plans to reduce tariffs to negligible levels and there is no broad-based goods and services tax. But, more importantly, the Government has virtually no plans or policies in the vital area of micro-economic reform. Its progress is pitiful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the statement the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said:</PARA>
<PARA>In telecommunications, in aviation, in road and rail transport . . . in national uniform regulations . . . we are achieving fundamental gains in efficiency. This activity amounts to the . . . most comprehensive sweep of micro-economic reform this country has ever seen. </PARA>
<PARA>This is gross, misleading rubbish. The very small gains that have been made have been made at a snail's pace. The telecommunications area is a disaster at present, presided over by one of the Government's senior Ministers-the Minister for Transport and Communications and Leader of the House (Mr Beazley). Qantas Airways Ltd is losing hundred of millions of dollars a year. The national rail freight initiative has stalled and there are no plans for our roads infrastructure. In the document there is no mention at all of that most important of all micro-economic reforms-namely, the deregulation of the labour market to enable employer and employee to enter into contracts that would be legally enforceable at an enterprise level. </PARA>
<PARA> The reaction of the press to the document is stunning in its condemnation of the Government. J. B. Were, the Melbourne stockbroker, says that there is `nothing in the statement for the market' and that there is `no major micro-economic reform'. F.W. Holt says, `Most of the Government's initiatives are cosmetic' and `will not result in any restructuring of industry'. </PARA>
<PARA> As if that were not bad enough, the most glaring omission from the Prime Minister's document is that there is no mention of privatisation as part of micro-economic reform or as part of building a competitive Australia; there is no mention of privatisation at all. It is clear that the Government cannot bring itself to utter the `P' word. We know what the Government is like when shying away from words that it does not like. For months, even though most of us knew that Australia was in a serious recession, the worst since the Second World War, the Government could not bring itself to use the `R' word. It is only in recent weeks that the Prime Minister, the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and other senior members of the Government could bring themselves to admit that the country was in recession. Now they are shying away from the use of the word `privatisation'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is hard to know why the Government has made this extraordinary omission. The Government is, after all, engaged on a privatisation program which should, in the end, result in the raising of several billion dollars for the Treasury. It is not as if there is no work being done on privatisation. The Government's failure to mention privatisation means that it simply does not regard that process as fitting together in any way to build a more competitive economy. </PARA>
<PARA> We do rate privatisation as an important part of micro-economic policy. The fact that the Government does not indicates that it is simply carrying out its privatisation process for the money. Government members are just a bunch of money-grubbers. They have no interest in using the privatisation process to make our economy more efficient; they simply want the money to shore up government finances where the Government's surplus is shrinking so fast that it is disappearing at the speed of light. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition believes that privatisation is of immense benefit to the community. A properly implemented privatisation program will deliver substantial benefits such as lower prices and better services to a large number of Australian consumers. A properly implemented privatisation program means that the enterprises concerned will be freed up to compete on an equal basis with the private sector; will have more managerial autonomy; will be more flexible to raise capital; will be better placed to overcome restrictive work practices; will be less liable to complacency; and will be removed from the difficulties they sometimes face in pursuing political rather than economic priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> A properly implemented privatisation program will preclude the necessity for the enterprise to go back to the taxpayers for additional funding when capital requirements arise and will permit a broad spread of employee participation in the ownership of the enterprise in which they work. A properly implemented privatisation program will mean less government, more effective capital markets, better productivity and more appropriate remuneration packages for those who work in those enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> The coalition is committed to a very significant privatisation program, including the remainder of Qantas that the Government does not sell-if indeed it sells anything of Qantas-airport terminals, Medibank Private, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Commission, Telecom Australia and the remainder of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia that the Government does not sell, if indeed it sells any of the Commonwealth Bank. In this respect, the coalition has before both this House and the Senate a Bill designed to achieve the objective of full privatisation of the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to challenge the Government to allow us to bring that Bill on both here in the House and in the Senate and debate it fully this time instead of doing what it did last time, which was use the guillotine to close off that debate after two hours. It was a privatisation program worth $1.6 billion and the Government closed off and guillotined that debate after a mere two hours. </PARA>
<PARA> We also plan, as part of our significant privatisation program, to privatise the remainder of the Australian Industry Development Corporation, the Australian National Line, the Pipeline Authority-on a proper basis-and the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation Ltd. This is the extent of our privatisation plans at present. But there will be other enterprises that we will seek to privatise and there will be other functions performed by government that we will seek to contract out. In due course we will be working with the States to cooperate with them should they wish to privatise those enterprises that fall under their control. </PARA>
<PARA> Our privatisation program is part of our grand sweep of micro-economic reform, not a naked grab for dollars, as is the case with the Government. Our privatisation program plans to return ownership of these government business enterprises to their employees and the people of Australia and not leave their control in the hands of the bureaucracy and the public sector unions. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has failed dismally to treat privatisation as part of a more competitive Australia. Our plans will achieve what any sensible privatisation program should achieve-namely, benefits to consumers in terms of lower prices and better services and a more productive and efficient nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the most important elements of the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is that concerning resource security. I would like to explain the Commonwealth's concept of resource security and to illustrate some of the debate as it has occurred and arisen in Tasmania. We know that the Government took a decision on a new forest and conservation development process involving a commitment by the Government to provide resource guarantees for major new industrial wood processing projects, which provides significant value adding and involves $100m or more in new investment. It is our desire that the decision will lead to the phasing out of woodchip exports from Australia and their replacement with higher value added timber and paper products. Most importantly, a key element of the decision includes an up-front, integrated Commonwealth-State assessment of the relevant environmental, heritage, economic and social issues involved in any development proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The new process also provides for an extension of codes of forest practice, safeguards to accommodate new scientific discoveries-such as rare plants and animals-and a joint assessment of development proposals under the Environment Protection Act by the Commonwealth environment and industry Ministers. Just as importantly, the Government's decision also provides for the establishment of economically feasible hardwood and softwood plantations in agreed areas and within agreed time frames to provide for long term timber supply, with the object of phasing out woodchip export through value adding and relieving pressure on native forests. </PARA>
<PARA> For me, the concept of resource security is probably more accurately stated as security of decision-making. I will explain in a minute the sort of debate there has been over the actual resources in the Tasmanian context. But it is really the security of decision-making that the Commonwealth wants to bring to this area of previously intense conflict. We really want to be able to say that once agreements are signed between a State government and a proponent of a project-say, a pulp mill-they come to the Commonwealth to seek our concurrence with that agreement, we use legislation to secure it, and we go through all the environmental analyses that we need to. Then and only then will there be a security of decision-making-that is, that we will not change the rules of play, we will stick by the agreement, and the project will ensue.</PARA>
<PARA> The second major aim of this concept of resource security is that we get a better return on our forest products. We use the concept here of `value adding'. Value adding is all very well, but we want to make sure that the return on the investment we make justifies itself. Nevertheless, there are significant reasons for seeking a better return on the forest that we do decide to use for wood production. Of course, ultimately, we all wish to take pressure off our native forests, but I suspect the major gulf between conservationists and foresters is just how readily we can take off that pressure and how feasible it is to establish either softwood or hard wood plantations. </PARA>
<PARA> The concept of resource security seems to me to have arisen probably from a number of sources, but certainly it came out of a book Secure Futures for Forests and People, which was a result of the Tasmanian forests and forest industry strategy. It is to that strategy that I want to speak for a couple of minutes. This strategy was initially worked on by trade unionists in the industry and foresters and a combined environment group. But towards the end of negotiations, the environmentalists pulled out. They have appended their own reasons for pulling out of that-and I will go to that in a moment. But I want to read the major recommendations. The point I want to stress really is that we need to bring a sense of perspective into this because if we go back a couple of years and then come forward and measure the amount of forest that has now been saved absolutely in Tasmania, we find that it is really enormous.</PARA>
<PARA> I think we need to bring that sense of perspective to the current debate. Really, a great deal has been gained by the conservationists and a great deal more can be gained. There can be a change in practices, there can be a significant increase in relieving the pressure on native forests through plantations; but there are real limits to the extent to which we can do that. I think this report, Recommendations for Tasmania's Forests and Forest Industry Strategy, at least gives us a decent lead in that regard. As to the recommendations, one of them is, for instance:</PARA>
<PARA>Recommends an approach to protect additional areas of highest conservation value and provides a strategy to move away from predominantly oldgrowth forest harvesting to harvesting from managed regrowth forest stands. </PARA>
<PARA>In the Tasmanian example:</PARA>
<PARA>Four categories of forested lands have been agreed upon. </PARA>
<PARA>1 Additional State reserves of about 4,300 ha, which add to the 600,000 ha agreed by industry in the Salamanca Agreement for addition to World heritage areas</PARA>
<PARA>2 Existing and new Multiple Use Reserves of about 150,000 ha in which timber harvesting is excluded</PARA>
<PARA>3 Deferred Forestry Use areas of about 580,000 ha which does not impact on recreation or mining activities</PARA>
<PARA>4 Register of Wood Production Forests of about 1,100,000 ha. </PARA>
<PARA>The Strategy-</PARA>
<PARA>in essence-</PARA>
<PARA>recommends substantial areas previously available for commercial timber harvesting to now be protected . . . </PARA>
<PARA>They add up to 155,000 hectares. </PARA>
<PARA>Further areas (580,000 ha) are allocated to a deferred category and are subject to further study and allocation as part of the Transition Strategy. </PARA>
<PARA>By `allocation' we mean that, in fact, some will be put into the forest production category and others will be put into a conservation category. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting that there are recommendations about the forest industry itself which we ought to have some regard to. The conclusions in this respect state:</PARA>
<PARA>Resource security is to be upgraded through a new Register of Wood Production Forests. A new Tasmanian Forest Agreement with the Federal Government to ratify the State's legislative approach to wood security is recommended. </PARA>
<PARA>So we can see here, I think, some of the genesis of the recent Federal Cabinet decision to seek resource security-that we had a definite program and policy from the State Government of Tasmania, and we are now seeking to work in with that. But that is only one example; we have not exclusively modelled our decision on this sort of process. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, to bring this into perspective, let me go to the sorts of areas of land which have been preserved for all time in Tasmania. Really, the current debate is about the use of those areas which have not yet been determined or the areas which have not been locked away safely for all time. If we look at land tenure in Tasmania back in early 1988, we find that 39 per cent of all land was in private hands; 21 per cent was unallocated Crown land; 24 per cent was State forest; and 16 per cent was World Heritage area or national parks or other Crown reserves. </PARA>
<PARA> Now we move to that further debate. By December 1989 after the Inquiry into the Lemonthyme and Southern Forests, otherwise known as the Helsham inquiry, and the Salamanca agreement, the area allocated to World Heritage, national parks and other Crown reserves jumped from 16 per cent to 25 per cent. There have been significant gains in Tasmania in areas that have been protected, preserved for all time, under these sorts of schemes-Commonwealth Government as well as State Government schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> Now in the most recent recommendations of this forest strategy, we find that the World Heritage area-national parks category lifts again from 25 per cent to 27 per cent, and that there is now a new arrangement: there is not just that area of State forest which has been reduced to 21 per cent; there is now a definite wood production forest area, reduced to 16 per cent, but there is also this 9 per cent area of deferred forest which is an area where there will be further debate. Also, 9 per cent of all land is unallocated Crown land. So I think it is important to bring perspective to the notion of just how much has been gained during a significant and, at times, bitter debate and conflict in Tasmania over the future use of forests. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting though, because there is some further evidence that is brought to bear under the heading of `Management Strategy Recommended . . . for Public Eucalypt Forests'. There are two graphs here which indicate that in the not so near future, probably through to about the year 2040, in the saw log area, there will be a phasing out almost to a level of zero of the use of old growth forests, but a phasing in of areas called regeneration forests, which are based on logging on an 85-year rotation. For pulp wood production, there is a phasing out of old growth forests again to a level of almost zero just after the year 2040, and only a minor reliance on eucalypt plantation. That comes as somewhat of a surprise to me. I was rather hoping to see that there would be a more optimistic transition towards the eucalypt plantations, and I know that this Government will have to turn its attention to those sorts of issues. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Cabinet's decision of a couple of days ago we talk about-I think the term is `feasible'-economically feasible hardwood and softwood plantations. That has to be kept in mind. If we cannot in all good conscience and in rational economic terms have a complete transition from native forest to plantations, then we cannot; that is the end of the matter. It does not mean to say that we should not strive very hard to make sure that we get the greatest transition that we can in order to take the pressure off native forests. </PARA>
<PARA> My remarks are threefold in this area. If we take Tasmania as a case study, we see that there have been significant gains in taking pressure off the environmental values of native forests in Tasmania because so much of them has been locked away for all time. There have been significant gains in that area. Secondly, under the resource agreement legislation that this Government would hope to bring in, where we have before us a proposition-for instance, a pulp mill-which will seek the security of a certain quantity of wood, then we can go to an area for definition and within that area secure a sufficient quantity of wood to make the mill a viable proposition. This is a sensible and reasonable idea. The details have to be worked through over the next couple of months, and therein will lie a great deal of debate; there is no doubt about that. </PARA>
<PARA> From the evidence I see, the gains will not be as great as I had hoped for on the issue of some sort of massive transition out of current wood production areas, forest production areas and into plantations. But where we bring an agreement with legislation, we can at least provide the security to investors that ensures they will work as hard as is feasible to have this second means of taking pressure off native forests, that is, getting into plantations, to move as far as they can down the track. </PARA>
<PARA> The environmentalists are to be congratulated on the enormous pressure and change in public attitude which they have brought to bear across the entire nation, particularly in Tasmania. They have done a great deal. The next step now is to finally put to rest and to save what we can of native forests, but in the end, to also make the forest industry a decent industry for Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been said that the first white Australians were hand picked by the best judges in the world. However, I suggest that it is not those convict ancestors but their children who have had the greatest impact on our way of life. It was the birth of a new breed, the next generations following the arrival of the First Fleet. It was their interaction with the Aboriginal people and the impact of the Great South Land itself that has largely shaped our nation. At the first muster of the colony some 15 years after the First Fleet landed, there were 958 children, 400 of whom were orphans. These children became known as the currency lads and lasses, a demeaning term, because they were not considered British. They were fiercely independent, felt completely at home in the bush and resented any forms of authority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A battling Aussie pioneer woman, Maria Anne Smith, was midwife for the township of Eastwood in the early days of that colony. Present at the birth of so many young Australians in the region, she developed a special place in their affections, hence the name `Granny Smith'. Because of her husband's illness, she had the task not only of raising her own family and being a midwife but also of running a small farm and an orchard. </PARA>
<PARA> On one occasion, after delivering her produce to market, she bought a barrel of crab-apples to make apple tarts. On bringing them home, she found that she could only use half the barrel; the rest had gone bad. She emptied the bad apples onto a bit of garbage pile she had down near the creek at the end of the property. Some months later, she returned to discover a small tree pushing its way through the rubbish. She transplanted and nurtured the tree, and later harvested the world's first crop of green apples. The apples became popular around Eastwood, where they were affectionately called Granny Smith's apples, and that Aussie green apple has become accepted throughout the world. When asked to explain how the tree grew, she said, `Isn't that just like God? The very stuff we chuck away, He uses to bring in a new thing'. </PARA>
<PARA> A couple of months ago, I was invited to be the joint patron of the Reclaim Easter Celebrations in Toowoomba on Sunday week, Palm Sunday. This I gladly accepted, along with the Catholic and Anglican Bishops and other leading celebrants of the local Uniting, Presbyterian, Baptist and Reformed congregations. Together we will celebrate the unity of our Easter faith under the symbol of that Granny Smith apple, one of which will be given to each of the anticipated 3,000 in Queen's Park on that day. </PARA>
<PARA> The congregation will be asked to consider the following notions: that from the dying of an English crab-apple came a delightful new Aussie life form; that Easter is about what God can do with what others think of as rejectables; that Easter is about new beginnings, turning death into life; and that Granny Smith's apple is a very appropriate symbol of the gift of Easter. I hope that as many people as can will share the occasion with us on Sunday week. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the wake of Australia's involvement in the Gulf war, which for many has not ended as its tentacles reach out to adversely affect hundreds of thousands of people for some time to come, it is appropriate for us as elected representatives to seriously consider the way in which we wish governments to approach similar conflicts, for conditioned reactions born of traditional military wisdoms on which we cut our eyeteeth and based on the acceptance of the supremacy of might have quite obviously not worked in curing our globe of the chronic disease of war. If we wish to free our children and our grandchildren from the negative heritage of accepting the state of war as a constant, the normal environment into which we are born, we live and we quit only upon death, we must consider radical changes to our responses to aggression.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been demonstrated that rational consideration of the issue is regrettably not possible when we are at war. It is thus all the more important that the debate be put on the parliamentary and the public agenda in this time of comparative normalcy in Australia, particularly given the fact that the support for Australian involvement in the Gulf was bipartisan. </PARA>
<PARA> One more strategy which has drawn diverse responses since last August when Saddam Hussein militarily attacked Kuwait is the effectiveness of sanctions as a non-combat means of thwarting aggression. There is no internationally agreed way of measuring the success or failure of sanctions. Evaluation is usually a politically loaded exercise. Opponents of sanctions typically argue that the sanctions in question are not effective and proponents argue the opposite. Internal politics in the country imposing sanctions play a strong part in influencing the assessments of the strategy in that country. </PARA>
<PARA> I noted that in November 1990, the Labor spokesperson for foreign affairs in the United Kingdom was reported as contending that the application of trade sanctions against Iraq were biting, while in the same month our own Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mr Gareth Evans) declared his faith in the application of economic sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet by December 1990-January 1991, government and opposition in both the United Kingdom and the Australian Parliaments joined hands in bipartisan support of the allied military thrust against Hussein. One of the arguments presented in justification of the allied position was that the sanctions against Iraq were not biting. In Australia rhetoric raged as the proponents of might proffered four months as a more than adequate time to trial the effectiveness of the strategy, while those who opposed the action as precipitate held to the belief that 12 months or more was needed. </PARA>
<PARA> The real issue is how much we really want non-combat strategies such as sanctions to succeed, for it is apparent that their perceived success or failure is subjective, dependent on what the imposing country wants to achieve, what the targeted country wants to prove, and the variables of war which affect any strategy-military or non-combat. Certainly, the reputation of sanctions as a tool of foreign policy is quite high at present because of their apparent success in forcing South Africa into reform. </PARA>
<PARA> Sanctions imposed by the United States (US) and its allies on communist countries during the 1950s and 1960s may have caused some difficulties for the target countries, but there is little evidence that they brought about policy changes. In the case of Cuba, sanctions were singularly unsuccessful in bringing down the Castro Government because the Government was supported by the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). But sanctions against Rhodesia certainly succeeded in economically isolating the country. While this was undermined by the support of South Africa, when South Africa decided the political and economic cost of supporting Rhodesia was too great and opted to impose sanctions, the Smith Government was forced to capitulate rapidly. </PARA>
<PARA> Every case is different, but there are some generalisations that can be usefully made. As a general rule, sanctions are usually effective only when the enforcing country is much larger than the target country and where economic and other links between them are strong. The US sanctions against Latin American countries have generally been effective for precisely these reasons. Rhodesia could survive international sanctions, but quickly collapsed when South Africa, with whose economy and polity it was intimately linked, withdrew support. </PARA>
<PARA> So might is not only effective in military strategies, but can be harnessed to make non-combat strategies work. Sanctions against South Africa really had an impact only when the US, Britain and Japan were pressured into abiding by them. So the massed allied initiative against Iraq, including as it did the big players-the US, the USSR, the United Kingdom and France-could possibly have achieved the desired goal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today in Question Time the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) referred to the matter of burns suits and promptly launched into a vitriolic attack on the Minister for Health in New South Wales, Peter Collins. I might point out that these suits are a valuable way of diminishing contractions and scarring in victims of severe burns and are indeed a vital part of the treatment of these patients.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Today the Minister claimed `that charges of up to $2,000 were levied' for those suits by the New South Wales Government and, again, that Peter Collins levied charges for those suits and was guilty of discriminatory actions. The Minister must have been aware that only this morning Peter Collins made an announcement in the New South Wales Parliament that his Department would fully fund all necessary jobst garments-that is, burns garments-in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> I am a reasonable fellow, so I went over to the Minister during Question Time, pointed out his error in a very reasonable way and invited him to correct this. It turned out that the Minister had with him what he claimed were the details of the announcement from Peter Collins. That announcement clearly said:</PARA>
<PARA>I am able to announce that the New South Wales Health Department will foot the bill for all jobst garments. </PARA>
<PARA>The annual cost will in fact be around $260,000. If that is indeed the case, I can draw only one of two conclusions: either the Minister deliberately misled Parliament or he cannot read. I do not know which is the answer; I do not know which is the most likely. I have a suspicion that it might just be the latter.</PARA>
<PARA> Whilst services offered to outpatients are, by and large, the responsibility of the States, the Federal Government just cannot escape its moral responsibility in this area. It cannot completely cut payments to States, as it has done, from, for example, $983m in 1985-86 to $890m in 1989-90 in 1985-86 dollars-a decrease of 9 1/2 per cent-and still expect these extra burdens to be borne by the States. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister said today that the suffering of burns victims and the financial struggle of parents to find money for medical purposes requires a `deal of sensitivity and compassion and ought to be above politics'. How the Minister can then be so hypocritical as to launch into a tirade against Minister Collins is beyond belief. He accused Minister Collins of `shroud-waving exercises'. This is a Minister who says that it should be above politics and in the same breath goes onto attack somebody for shroud-waving exercises. It is a matter in which Minister Howe should accept the moral responsibilities of the Federal Government and not continue to palm off the costs of difficult cases to the States. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very clear what the Minister should do. After today's display, he should return to the House and do his duty. His duty is to withdraw unequivocally his comments in regard to the Minister for Health in New South Wales, Peter Collins. Not only were they unnecessarily vitriolic, but they were actually patently misleading to this House. He should apologise to the Minister. Peter Collins, I might point out, has successfully dragged the health portfolio in New South Wales out of the doldrums it was in under the previous Labor Government. He, along with the rest of the Greiner team, is bringing to New South Wales reforms and improvements that were only the stuff of dreams of the former Labor Administration. He should return to the House; he should withdraw his statement; he should apologise to the House; and he should apologise to Peter Collins. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I would like to talk about a very special person in my electorate by the name of Marie Stokes. Marie has recently been named an Order of Australia medal recipient for her work with homeless youth. This is very important because it is the first award to be given in this category.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over the years, Marie has worked very hard and with great dedication to help people in the Bayside community of my electorate cope with the kind of crisis that unfortunately is becoming so commonplace these days. Family breakdowns create young people with problems and, thankfully for the people in my electorate, Marie Stokes has been on hand to help many of them with these problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Marie is a fighter, a lobbyist who never gives up, a person who believes in the common good and a person who has a keen sense of justice. In her dealings with young people who have been emotionally, physically and sexually abused, Marie has been a rock. She has been a lifeline for children who have lost faith in this society and have nowhere else to turn. </PARA>
<PARA> Marie believes in professional help for young people in these situations, but she also believes that ordinary people should stand beside the professionals. Marie would class herself as one of those ordinary people, but she is far from ordinary, as her award testifies. She is a human dynamo who has been involved in community work since she was 18 years of age. Now she has three children, Lisa, Debra and Allan, who are in their twenties; and another daughter, Clare, who is 12. She is also foster mum to 13-year-old Allan. In fact, one of her sons is serving in the Gulf on HMAS Brisbane, and I am very hopeful that she will be able to see him when he comes back very shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> She works part time in the family services Department in Queensland, is a full time wife to husband Paul, but still manages to do more for the plight of homeless youth than any other person I know. Marie is a founding worker for Bayside Adolescent Boarding Inc., commonly known as BABI, which the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission recommended as a model for other youth organisations. There is no doubt that, without Marie, BABI would not have survived those early days, which means in turn that many young people in my electorate have survived who in previous circumstances may well have become victims of the disposable lifestyle we now live. </PARA>
<PARA> Brian Burdekin, the Human Rights Commissioner, has given national focus to the issue of homeless youth, an issue that we all need to look at-and not only look at but also do something about. Marie Stokes has given us a lead. I admire her greatly as well as her work and the work of BABI and take great pleasure in giving her the recognition she deserves by putting on record in this place that she is a person who is always thinking of the plight of others. She is the conscience that modern society needs, and she fully deserves to be awarded the first Order of Australia medal to be presented in this country to a person who works in the area of homeless youth. </PARA>
<PARA> In the remainder of the time allocated to me tonight I would like to talk further about BABI. BABI's purpose is to provide accommodation and supportive services to young people between the ages of 13 and 18 years in the Wynnum-Manly Bayside area and to provide supportive services to their families as part of the process. BABI has both subsidised and unsubsidised respite placement. It has boarding families who as a rule take in only one young person at a time. It has four community houses, supplied through the Queensland Housing Commission, one of which is funded through the crisis accommodation program. Up to 10 young people with a full time volunteer house parent can be placed in these houses at any one time, with each house accommodating a maximum of three young people. </PARA>
<PARA> The BABI office at Wynnum Central is funded through the supported accommodation assistance program. It has a management committee, a full time co- ordinator, one full time and one half time social worker, a part time youth worker and a full time youth development officer whose salary is paid by arrangement with the Wynnum SkillShare, in my electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> The birth of BABI can be traced back to 1982 when the Brisbane Youth Advocacy Centre approached local religious ministers in Wynnum for assistance in encouraging families to accommodate homeless youth. A meeting of interested families was held in January 1983, where six families volunteered and received counselling training, and in August 1983 placements of young people commenced. Thirty-nine referrals were received in the first 12 months, and now it has grown to such a degree that the demand on BABI has been unrelenting. Referrals have escalated from 39 in 1983 to over 600 in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would like to say that I am proud to have an organisation such as BABI in my electorate. It is unfortunate that such organisations have to exist but putting our heads in the sand will not make the problem of homeless youth go away. I commend BABI and I commend Marie Stokes, and I hope that BABI is used as a model for other homeless youth accommodation projects throughout the rest of Australia. </PARA>

<TITLE>Sugar Industry</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in his Building a Competitive Australia statement announced a slashing of tariff protection to the sugar industry. Canegrowers were shocked by this announcement, and were devastated by it. It broke an undertaking that the Government had given to the industry and to this Parliament in 1989 when the embargo was lifted. At that time, a clear and precise reduction of the tariff protection regime was put in place and the industry was learning to live with that program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was a tough program-much tougher than had been imposed upon any other industry in this country. The Government treated sugar vastly different from the way in which it looked upon the car industry or even many other primary industries. The sugar industry had taken the tough medicine and was learning to live with this reduction in its protection. It came, then, as a major shock that the Government should break the undertaking that it gave that this particular program would be put in place until 1992 and be reviewed this year to see what further reductions could be achieved in future years. </PARA>
<PARA> That inquiry has only barely begun and yet the Government has pre-empted its findings-worse than that, it has actually gone back on its word of previous years and savagely slashed tariffs even after the reductions that were already in place. The current tariff is $115 a tonne. It was to drop to $95 on 1 July, but that figure is now $76. There was a three months warning of that significant additional tariff cut, and by 1 July 1992 the figure was supposed to be $70, whereas it will now be $55. </PARA>
<PARA> So in just 15 months the Government has halved the tariff protection for this industry. Perhaps it might like to try the same thing on the car industry or the textiles industry. This has happened at a time when the world price has halved, from US16c a pound down to something less than US9c a pound. So at a time when the world price has halved, the protection for the Australian industry has also been viciously slashed. </PARA>
<PARA> The sugar industry had been given a timetable. It was working towards it, at considerable pain, but the Government has failed to honour the promises that it gave at that stage. The Australian sugar industry is already pretty well the least protected in the world. It has an 80 per cent exposure to the international market. Only the Thai industry compares with that. The Australian industry was in fact facing up to a difficult future without any kind of protection-the only sugar industry in the world that had to live in those kinds of circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> But that was not enough for this Government. It decided to inflict even further pain on those people in the industry, and further pain on their towns. It is regrettable and the canegrowers are shocked. The President of the Queensland Canegrowers Council has said that the Government has lost what remaining credibility it had with growers. What credibility can it have with any industry when it cannot honour the commitments that it gives? It is regrettable for the growers and it is regrettable for the country towns that are sustained by the industry. There are many of those centres in north Queensland, in particular, that are dependent upon the sugar industry and that now look forward to very much lower incomes. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, all tariff reductions reduce the gross income of the affected industry. An industry can live with that if it is accompanied by cuts in costs, but the Prime Minister's industry statement did not go far in that direction-there were some small juicy pieces but nothing of substance. There was no real effort to come to grips with the structural reform that is necessary for an industry to survive if it has no tariff protection itself. The hopeless workplace practices remain in place. There is no transport reform. The union rorts are still there, and indeed this statement adds another $1 1/2m to help unions involved in amalgamation processes. There is nothing to do with currency levels; nothing to do with taxes. The industry has to face all of its old costs, all of its old hardships but without any help for its side. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister talks about a clever country. But there is nothing clever about breaking promises, about going back on commitments that had been made to one of Australia's great industries. </PARA>

<TITLE>Death in Custody of Karen O'Rourke</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Karen O'Rourke, the daughter of Gerard O'Rourke of Mogo in New South Wales, died on 11 February 1980 as a result of burns to 100 per cent of her body at Rockhampton Base Hospital. Gerard O'Rourke is still distraught and grieving over the loss of his daughter. The report of the inquiry into her death was tabled in the Senate last year following hearings of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fatal burns that Karen sustained occurred when she was trapped in a security room set on fire at Birralee Children's Home earlier on 11 February. She was aged 14 years and three months, and had moved to Rockhampton from Sydney only six weeks before. Commissioner Wyvill reported that death was preventable. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It is a fundamental aspect of legal imprisonment that a prisoner be properly searched and deprived of all potentially dangerous items in order to obviate the possibility of injury or escape. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Regrettably, the inadequacy of the original investigation and coronial inquiry and the length of time since the incident, does not permit me to determine why Karen was not properly searched. It is self-evident, that had such a thorough search been carried out, then Karen's life would not have been destroyed in the way it was. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the fact that a proper search would have prevented Karen's death, her death may have also been prevented if suggestions made in a 1976 South Australian report had been complied with. </PARA>
<PARA>Commissioner Wyvill went on:</PARA>
<PARA> Despite the patent relevance and applicability of each of the recommendations to the situation at Birralee and the fact that the home in general was regarded as a fire risk, none of the recommendations in the South Australian report were acted upon in relation to the security room at Birralee. </PARA>
<PARA> Had the recommendations been adopted and put into effect, at least in the form of fire-retardant bedding and an observation window enabling proper surveillance, this death may not have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason for such inaction at the time, appears to be primarily that Birralee was a run-down building due to be demolished and a new remand facility built in its place. As a result most, if not all, requests for improvements of a capital nature were refused by the Department of Works. </PARA>
<PARA>Earlier in the report Commissioner Wyvill stated:</PARA>
<PARA> While neither the police nor the child care officers were required, pursuant to any written regulations or guidelines, to search Karen before she was placed in the security room, there can be no doubt that they were under a duty to carry out a proper search of Karen. </PARA>
<PARA> Although Margaret Manning gave evidence that she was extremely conscious of the need to thoroughly search all persons subject to confinement in the security room at Birralee Children's Home, and had in fact searched the security room before Karen was placed in it, the only search carried out on Karen was the cursory search by Detective Wegner while Karen was in the car. </PARA>
<PARA>There was a report already before the Queensland authorities that action should have been taken in South Australia when a similar type of offence occurred. That report had not been properly regarded. </PARA>
<PARA> So here we have a situation where a girl was known by several persons to be smoking, yet was not thoroughly searched; was not asked to hand over her matches or lighter; we have a security room which was not secure, although there was a fine for passing cigarettes or matches through louvres; we have many conflicting statements from staff and from firemen and girls; and two other girls were not brought for questioning. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that death could have been prevented. It is clear that Karen should have been searched. Yet now we have to wait for the final government reaction after all these inquiries. We cannot bring her back to life. We can prevent this sort of thing happening. We can properly inform the parents, as did not happen in this particular case. </PARA>

<PARA>What do you think about the state of this country? Have we lost our pride along with our high living standards and become a frightened race?</PARA>
<PARA>One letter appearing on 10 March is, I believe, particularly important. It was written by Mrs O. Newton, wife of the late Max Newton. Mrs Newton, I note, is also a constituent of mine in Dunkley. Her letter addresses the questions raised. I read the letter:</PARA>
<PARA>Oh, how I wish my husband had lived long enough to come back to his beloved country. To somehow lead us (the people) through his ``window on the world'' in the newspapers he wrote for. He would have been appalled at the way we have been so savagely raped and pillaged by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has taken (over the years it has been in power), every vestige of hope, privacy and decency that we, and our forebears, lived, worked and died for. </PARA>
<PARA> After being out of the country for many years, I came back and saw the devastation all around me. Frightened people. People who have done nothing wrong, but suffer from guilt. Afraid to go against the hand that feeds them, ``The Government''. </PARA>
<PARA> Many years ago, my husband, Max, wrote several speeches on: ``How this Government would abuse our basic rights and resources''. We used to be one of the top standard of living countries in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, just about 10 years from the time this bully came out of the socialistic unions to be the head of this country we are so far down the line, not even in the same sentence as Mexico. I believe we are down to number 42 on the world list. We used to be fifth. </PARA>
<PARA> In this country the people do not have a voice. We are a very frightened race. </PARA>
<PARA> Almost every sector of our economy, farming, banking, health, education, transport and manufacturing, is in chaos. Not to mention our slovenly work force. Our population has lost it's pride. </PARA>
<PARA> Bob Hawke is supposed to be our ``Chairman Of The Board''. Government is supposed to be in business to make our lives more tolerable. Most of us would get the sack if we did any of the things he does to us. But he gets away with everything. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) on Tuesday, he made the following statement:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is particularly satisfying to be able to report to the House on the achievement, just last week, of a new agreement that will deliver breakthroughs in waterfront productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> The agreement between the Waterside Workers Federation and Conaust Ltd, following an earlier agreement with National Terminals (Australia) Ltd, now means waterfront employees and the two largest waterfront employers are committed to a total restructuring of their industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In describing the significance of this latest agreement, Mr Speaker, I can do no better than to quote the words of Mr Richard Setchell, the Chairman of Conaust, who said it was `a win for the economy and the international competitiveness of Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA>I take the opportunity to draw to the attention of the House the fact that the Prime Minister is wrong in his claim that an agreement has been struck between the Waterside Workers Federation and Conaust. Despite the fact that the Prime Minister uses the word `agreement' three times in as many paragraphs, he cannot alter the facts, despite his attempts to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Even his Ministers, such as the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis), only this afternoon in the House were more cautious in the description of what has actually happened. The Minister for Finance said that there was `virtually' an agreement between Conaust and the Waterside Workers Federation. The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) last Thursday in the Senate was very careful not to make the claim that an agreement had actually been struck. </PARA>
<PARA> Captain Richard Setchell, the Chief Executive of Conaust-who the Prime Minister, as usual, selectively quotes in his statement-actually said that the ruling of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission `paved the way' and `had the makings' and also `created an atmosphere' that will lead to an agreement. Quite clearly, the Prime Minister's claim that an agreement has been created is wrong. All that has happened is that a ruling has been given by the Industrial Relations Commission, and now the Waterside Workers Federation and Conaust are sitting down together to establish the agreement. Whether they achieve that or not is yet to be seen. For the sake of the nation, let us hope that they do. </PARA>
<PARA> What is apparent, though, is that the Prime Minister, obviously aware of the facts, chose to ignore them and deliberately deceived the people of Australia and the Parliament by claiming an agreement had been struck when in fact one had not been struck. Why did he do it? Simply because he is hurt by the slow pace of reform on the waterfront under his Minister, Senator Collins. The Prime Minister has shown how desperate he is, how much the criticism of his progress on micro-economic reform hurts him, and how low he is prepared to go to score a political point. It is clear to any objective judge that the Prime Minister has blatantly misled the House and should apologise to it. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition to that, Senator Collins has been hard at work doing much the same thing. In an effort to salvage his tattered credentials, Senator Collins has apparently taken to rewriting the Opposition's press releases. He told the Senate last Thursday:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Sharp issued a press release last night once again attacking the WWF predicting that the proceedings in the Commission today would be a disaster because the WWF would not agree. </PARA>
<PARA>For the record, I quote from my press release from which the Minister was actually drawing: Tas Bull will doubtless have a tough time of it when he faces the Conaust rank and file tomorrow morning. And in fact he did. Further, the view was put in my press release that `the unions must come to the party quickly if a deal is to be set'. That was and is true, and fortunately so far the unions have done so. It is to be hoped that they continue to be cooperative because much depends on this agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> Those quotes from my press release, when compared with what Senator Collins actually claimed I said in my press release, prove that Senator Collins, in his usual sloppy way, substantially misrepresented what I said in my press release. Unfortunately, I am becoming very used to this type of behaviour from Senator Collins who, through his failure to achieve any reasonable success in waterfront reform, and reminded of his promise to resign by 6 May this year, is desperately striking out at anything in an effort to create the impression that all is going well. One hopes that Senator Collins will take the opportunity to apologise to the Senate for what is quite obviously a deliberate attempt to mislead it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -It is fortuitous that I was in the chamber to hear the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp) going through yet another of his peregrinations. Whether or not the Conaust agreement is an agreement, whether or not it comes under the framework of the Industrial Relations Commission or under the framework of the waterfront reform process, he does have an odd and schizophrenic attitude to this whole point. He does recognise, as his initial press releases on this matter indicate, that if the waterfront reform process is given credit for this in any way, the capacity for the Opposition to demonise the waterfront agreement will diminish rapidly. He understands that. He understands that Conaust has been the outfit of the stevedoring companies which has pursued a very tough line in negotiations and has been most reluctant to come to an agreement unless satisfied. What will be gained from it will be very substantial and real.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Therefore, it is important for the Opposition to try to demonstrate either that this is not an agreement under the waterfront reform process or that it is not an agreement that is going to succeed. The tack he originally took was that it was not an agreement under the waterfront process. I am grateful that at least in the five minutes of his remarks in answering the criticisms made of him in Question Time today, by implication he clearly conceded the point that the agreement is within the framework of the Waterfront Industry Reform Authority process. He is no longer prepared to argue the toss on that point. He now argues the toss on whether or not it is an agreement that will be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> The overriding concern that the honourable member has is, of course, the very point which does establish the value and the worth of the process that we have been through. The Opposition has to struggle hard to oppose it because if it accepts it is part of the process then it has no case. It has to move on from this point, as we do, to the facts of our waterfront organisation and what needs to be done about it-the fact that we are not a unitary state and the fact that the next major phase in reform must occur in the port authorities. Above all, it has to consider seriously that most progress in waterfront reform as far as productivity is concerned has invariably come not in the main from work practice changes, important though they are, but from changes in the infrastructure in the ports. </PARA>
<PARA> When it is all boiled down those are the essential differences between Rotterdam and ourselves, between ourselves and Yokohama and between ourselves and Singapore. Other countries have ports so structured to maximise the efficiency of their operations. We have historically been left with what we have. Unfortunately, ultimately we are going to come to a debate on dollar signs. All the bullying from the Waterside Workers Federation and all the standing up in this place and demanding this or that change makes not a darn bit of difference. A lock-out or a strike does not solve a problem where the problem happens to be infrastructure. We have to understand that the process of micro-economic reform is a hard slog. As the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) says, it never ends. </PARA>
<PARA> In the remaining minute or two I want to acknowledge the fact-it has already been recognised by the resolution passed earlier today-that this is the last couple of minutes that Alan Browning will spend in this chamber in any sort of official capacity. I cannot actually imagine him wanting to come back here and look at us all after having done that for 37 years. I would not blame him if we did not see him all that frequently in the Speaker's Gallery. </PARA>
<PARA> Alan's service has been terrific. He must think that the more things change the more they are the same. In the life of Parliament this has been a pretty humdrum old day and I suppose he can be grateful for small mercies. At least in terms of his own recollection of the place, he can look back on some of the events of this day with pride in the great tributes that were paid to him. </PARA>
<PARA> My ministerial colleague, the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths), wanted to add his best wishes to my remarks as he did not have an opportunity to do so in the earlier debate. But he is a bit shy in the presence of greatness--</PARA>

I did not take the opportunity to rise earlier in the day to make my salutations to the Clerk, Alan Browning. I would like to take the opportunity to do so now. In the process of doing it I am reminded of the fact that mine will be the last words Alan will hear in this chamber. I will speak long enough to ensure that I am the last speaker. I would like to say to you, Alan, thank you very much for what you have done over the years that I have been here. I have been six and a quarter years.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, just a whippersnapper, to use the words of the Leader of the House earlier today. We have just had a celebration for the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd) who has spent 20 years in this House. I am reminded of how short a time I have been here and how little experience I have in a place like this. The week before last I was having a drink with you, Alan, at a farewell celebration and I heard you say that you had come to this place in 1954. It reminded me of the fact that I was born at the end of 1954. You have been here longer than I have been alive. That must be a tremendous contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to thank you, Alan, for your contribution to the Parliament. Thank you for what you have done for us. You have given me in my first six years in this place an understanding of what this Parliament stands for, what the traditions and the standards of the Parliament are all about. I would like to wish you all the very best in your retirement. From what I have heard of your plans for retirement, it is going to keep you very fit, very active and very happy. Well done Alan; all the best for the future. To Lyn, congratulations on being given this very important post here in the Parliament. </PARA>
