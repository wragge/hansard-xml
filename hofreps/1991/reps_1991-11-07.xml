<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House that pensioners are being burdened with an increase in the cost of living and are receiving no compensation for it. Because the CPI is not specific to the spending patterns of pensioners, a decrease in the cost of living has been shown as 0.1% which therefore cuts out a rise for this September. CPI has shown a negative movement because within its basket of goods, are luxury items that have dramatically decreased in price and therefore cover the increase in basic consumer items that are relevant to the spending patterns of pensioners. Also the wage/tax deals that have occurred between the Federal Government and unions has meant that Australian workers have received an increase in their take home wage but we have seen no counterbalance occur for pensioners.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Some people are saying that they can perceive no alternative policies to those which we have at present being articulated which would ease the current economic malaise. It is true, of course, that we are in the midst of a severe recession. Over 850,000 people are unemployed and actively looking for work and at the same time the current account deficit remains high. Yet new ideas are emerging which could simultaneously increase employment and improve our trading position. Recovery will occur automatically but additional government policies could be introduced which would speed up that recovery. Faster growth and economic activity in employment can be achieved without substantially increased inflationary pressure, provided the incomes policy is maintained.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of weeks ago the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade tabled a report which analyses these issues and recommends new policies. The trade subcommittee which prepared that report has prepared the first comprehensive report on the Australian economy ever in this Parliament. While targeted at international economic relations, the report touches on many aspects of the Australian economy and in fact makes recommendations which encompass every industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current account deficit is central to our current malaise. It was the current account deficit which motivated the cuts in public outlays and the high interest rates which have dominated economic policies since the mid-1980s. It is those extremely tight fiscal and monetary policies which were the principal cause of the current recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Current account deficits have been a feature of most of Australia's economic history. However, during the 1980s the size of the deficit increased from 4 per cent of GDP to around 6 per cent. There was also a radical change in the nature of the current account deficit during the 1980s. At the beginning of the decade the deficit reflected primarily an excess of our imports over exports. By the end of the decade the deficit was dominated by our foreign debt servicing obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been an improvement during the last financial year caused by growth in our exports, particularly of manufactured goods. In fact, during the last half a dozen years, the real value of exports of elaborately transformed manufactures has grown by about 12 per cent a year. To have maintained that for about six or seven years now is really an amazing achievement, one of which all Australians can be very proud. That is a remarkable and an insufficiently recognised achievement. However, it was from a very small base and so it still does not make a sufficiently large contribution to the total value of Australia's exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, though, the recent improvement in the current account was not due to a substantial decline in imports. There is a considerable risk that, as the economy recovers, the value of imports will rise again, causing renewed deterioration in the current account. Australia's overseas debt grew sharply during the last 10 years, increasing more than tenfold to $165 billion, almost 44 per cent of GDP. While this debt has not yet reached the crisis proportions evident in some countries, it would certainly do so by the end of the 1990s if debt accumulation continued unabated at the rate we have experienced, particularly in the mid-1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This continuing large current account deficit and growing overseas debt makes Australia more vulnerable to global economic changes. With this background, the Committee recommended a package of proposals in three parts: firstly, positive support for Australia's export and import replacement industries, particularly those adding value to our exports; secondly, measures to increase saving and to reduce our reliance on capital from overseas&mdash;to change the direction of investment in the country so that it is better targeted at industries which build up exports or replace imports; and, thirdly, changes to macro- and micro-economic policies. The most important of these is the recommendation that real interest rates be lowered further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was delightful to see that yesterday the Committee's recommendation was accepted by the Government and that interest rates were reduced by one per cent. That brings the fall in interest rates to about 10 per cent since they peaked at the beginning of last year. But during that time there has also been a welcome fall in the inflation rate of about 5 per cent so that real interest rates have fallen only by about 5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This means that real interest rates are still well above those in the countries with which we trade, despite yesterday's fall, so that Australia is still an attractive destination for short term financial flows, that is, hot money. This is one reason for the continuing high level of the Australian exchange rate. The most obvious requirement for further improvement in our trading performance would be a devaluation of the Australian dollar. One of the most striking changes which occurred during the 1980s was the perverse movement in the prices of traded and non-traded goods. This is a particularly important point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last 10 years the average price of non-traded goods rose 50 per cent faster than the price of traded goods. That is partly due to the deterioration in the terms of trade, which is in large measure set by overseas forces. But it is also due to the high level of the Australian dollar and the high level of interest rates. Devaluation of the dollar would increase the incentive for investment in export and import replacing industries. A reduction in interest rates would contribute to that result as well as stimulating investment generally. That is perhaps the most important recommendation of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee also recommended a more flexible interest withholding tax which could be set at higher levels, as it is in Canada, when the Government wanted to reduce or remove the difference between real interest rates in Australia and overseas. This and the variable capital inflow tax which could be used when too much hot money was coming to Australia would give further instruments for influencing the exchange rate other than interest rates and open market testing and smoothing operations by the Reserve Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Use of the successful industry strategies like those for steel, motor vehicles and heavy industry should be extended into other sectors. Tripartite preparation of those strategies would enable identification of ways in which new goods and services could be produced or existing production expanded. Such assistance might include additional public investment in infrastructure, expansion of education and training programs for particular skills in demand or further support for research and development as well as the existing assistance with export development and marketing. Such increases in outlays would both increase exports and increase employment and are clearly justified even within a stance of fiscal restraint. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very important that we move beyond a rather rigid approach to fiscal policy which identifies cutting outlays as the principal goal to one which sees both outlays and revenue as counter-cyclical instruments and which would be used to stimulate the economy when it is recessed and restrain the economy when it is booming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A particularly effective way of encouraging investment in value adding or import replacing production would be by introduction of an accelerated depreciation allowance for such enterprises. That is a policy which is strongly supported by business. It would, of course, be a well targeted way of stimulating investment in export industries and so offset some of this perverse effect of the respective movements of prices in the non-traded and traded goods areas. It would not mean picking winners. It would simply involve offering an incentive for additional investment in those industries which would be of most direct benefit in improving our trading performance. Such targeted assistance would be cost effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Superannuation funds are becoming a major channel for Australian savings and investment, yet the superannuation funds have concentrated too heavily on investments likely to yield short term returns and have concentrated on risk minimising blue chip stock, with the effect that innovative small and medium firms have found difficulty in obtaining investable funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee therefore recommended establishment of a trade and industry development fund with one per cent of the resources of superannuation funds for use with innovative enterprises in which the returns would be received in the medium and longer term. This fund would be jointly controlled by the superannuation funds and government and would concentrate on development in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A tax exempt savings scheme should also be established to encourage additional saving. Such a scheme would also remove many retired, small savers from the tax net. There were many other recommendations but those described are high priority and give the flavour of the report. It is clear to everyone that past policies have not been adequate to simultaneously improve both employment and our trading position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report eschews both a highly interventionist approach on the one hand and a libertarian approach on the other. Rather, it concentrates on recommending selective cost-effective means of government intervention in ways which would increase the productivity and competitiveness of Australian enterprises. Such a cooperative approach is essential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The metaphor of the level playing field is inadequate when the contestants are David and Goliath. During the 1990s all parts of the economy must cooperate effectively so that relatively small and isolated Australia has the best possible chance of competing effectively with the global economic giants.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in support of the remarks of the Chairman of the trade subcommittee of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), on the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's Current Account Deficit and Overseas Debt</EMPHASIS>, which was tabled by him recently. I take this opportunity to commend my colleague on the manner in which he chaired a difficult and, in many respects, very far-reaching investigation of the Australian economy. To the best of my knowledge, the investigation was taken to a greater extent than any previously undertaken by this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member mentioned in his opening remarks, the situation facing the Australian economy today is, indeed, very parlous. Therefore, the issues which have been raised in this report are particularly pertinent. The Australian economy has run current account deficits over most of its history. We have tended over the past years to take this very much for granted and have assumed that the rate of foreign investment coming into Australia would to a major extent at least manage to balance the books. Despite this, however, in terms of invisibles on current account, the position has gone from bad to worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the report states, the apparent structural increase in the current account deficit is a significant economic event in Australia and clearly distinguishes the 1980s from earlier decades. In fact, not since the 1920s has Australia experienced persistent current account deficits of the relative magnitude of those experienced in the 1980s. Therefore, the writing is quite clearly on the wall. The question is whether we have the courage to face up to some of the alternative policy approaches which have been outlined in this report. The position is, in fact, so serious that Australia's current account deficit is very high by international standards. Among the highest of any members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the OECD. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The widening current account deficit over the 1980s also coincided with major changes to Australia's approach to macro-economic policy. Financial deregulation and the floating of the exchange rate, combined with further reductions in industry protection, led to heightened anxiety in some parts of the Australian community about the ability of government to take sufficient corrective action to address current account deficit problems. Sadly, it is quite clear, on the record of the last two or three years in particular, that the decisions taken by the Government in the earlier period of the 1980s to a very large degree have contributed to the current problems facing the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other major economic phenomenon that distinguished the 1980s from earlier periods was a rapid accumulation of foreign debt to unprecedented levels. In fact, Australia's indebtedness to the world increased more than tenfold in nominal terms over the 1980s to reach $145 billion by the end of the decade. There have been projections to the effect that if current trends continue we will be reaching a level of foreign debt of approximately $200 billion by the end of the decade&mdash;a position which is quite clearly unsustainable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The stock of gross overseas debt rose from around 11 per cent of GDP at the beginning of the 1980s to 43 per cent by the end of the decade. The level of overseas debt further increased to $165 billion by June 1991, which represents almost 44 per cent of gross domestic product. This situation therefore cannot be permitted to continue and the report contains a range of options as to what could be done in that particular context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition members of the Committee, while supporting the overall thrust of the report, do not accept some of the recommendations as presented because we regard them as overly interventionist in the Australian economic circumstances of today. We see them as mainly quick fix remedies which will not achieve the long term solutions which this nation desperately requires. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the current account deficit is due to inadequate national savings and inadequate international competitiveness. It is those two elements which make up the basic formula which has to be addressed if we are to improve the overall situation of the Australian economy in the long term. Putting it quite simply, the economy is in very bad shape and everybody in this nation appreciates that fact. In fact, as the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) said recently, `We are in the worst recession since the 1930s'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already stated, our international debt has grown more rapidly than any other comparable economy over recent years. Not only that; we have also surpassed all records in other measures of economic activity as well: personal bankruptcies, the collapse of the rural sector, our debt serviceability, and unemployment. The level of unemployment is now well above 10 per cent in real terms; if we take into account underemployment, it is probably around 15 per cent of the total work force. Roughly, that means that about one person in six is being affected by current economic policy and is suffering grievously because of the current state of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasury submission states on page 143 of the report and part of the minority report that the policy should be related to the medium term and policy instruments should be assigned to their area of greatest effectiveness. It also states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such a framework entails the following changes:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">monetary policy clearly enunciated and focused on reducing inflation and inflationary expectations but remaining very much alive to the implications of settings for domestic demand;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">fiscal policy targeted towards contributing to an appropriate balance between domestic demand and production, particularly through its contribution to raising national savings; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">wages policy aimed at restraining aggregate wage pressures to maximise employment growth and contribute to progress on inflation, while increasing labour market flexibility.</PARA>
<PARA>As we see it, Australian society needs to be prepared to rebuild the Australian economy using a breadth of structural change which, frankly, we have not seen before in this land. The policies which the Treasury has recommended are critical to achieving that structural change. I would like to add to its statement, however, and point out that tax reform is also critical to reforming the economy. One of the weaknesses of the report was that it did not give satisfactory consideration to that very important element. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the Prime Minister at the 1985 tax summit, reform of the tax system is needed. We say amen to that. He said it was necessary to achieve a fairer, simpler tax system which contributed to sustained economic growth. Anybody can see that in the private sector or elsewhere in this economy the Australian tax system is not simple, it is not fair and clearly it has not contributed to the degree of economic sustainability which this nation clearly requires. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason, we have recommended that a broad-based consumption tax, side by side with substantial reduction in personal tax and compensation for the disadvantaged and low income earners, would help to turn our country around, provided, of course, that the existing ramshackle system of indirect taxes is entirely removed. Unfortunately, the Government since 1986 has failed to address these issues adequately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition has put forward basically 12 points for economic sustainability and most of those points, I am pleased to say, are covered to one degree or another in this most significant report. In that context, tax reform is just one of a number of measures which we propose to transform the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already stated that there are three main Treasury policies which we support. Obviously, these measures will not only reduce our current account deficit, but also they will create jobs, reduce inefficiencies and make Australia a fairer society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer specifically to price stability. With inflation at zero or to two per cent, it would be possible to achieve an increase in exports. This would essentially mean that Australia's rate of inflation would be lower than that of our main competitors overseas. This would give us a comparative cost advantage, which is absolutely essential if we are going to increase the size of our exports and, therefore, improve our overseas debt situation. This point was emphasised so clearly by the honourable member for Fraser. Not only that, but an increase in exports is essential to help us stabilise our national debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of rebuilding financial relations between the Commonwealth and the States&mdash;an issue which is currently on the agenda&mdash;I regret to say that the report had nothing to say of any substance on that point. Nevertheless, the removal of duplication and overlapping of services is essential. Similarly, we must reduce industrial protection while, at the same time, ensuring that micro-economic reforms are in place to reduce the overall costs of production and, therefore, encourage exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labour market reform is an essential element of the overall package which again, regrettably, was not covered in this report. In Australia, it is estimated that our national production will be boosted by $21 billion if we can match or beat the best international practices carried out by our major competitors overseas. The minority report, therefore, emphasises the fact that wages growth has to coincide with a continued moderation of labour costs. It says that a shift towards enterprise bargaining provides an important mechanism by which lower unit labour cost growth can be achieved through linking nominal wage increases and other costs of employing labour more closely to productivity growth. I recommend this report to honourable members. It contains substantial statistical material and will certainly add to the debate. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I go on to the report, however, I want to say that I am rather amazed to hear the honourable member for Bradfield (Mr Connolly) suggesting that we solve one problem by creating another huge problem.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to this report, I say firstly that while it is true that we have had and continue to have problems with the current account, some of the analyses as to the nature of those problems and the solutions for those problems have been incorrect.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The table shows a comparison between 1989-90 and 1990-91. It also divides up the current account into four areas: goods and services, income, and unrequited transfers. The interesting thing about this is that, in terms of the contribution which is made to the current account problem, the overwhelming proportion of the problem&mdash;$17 billion of what was then $22 billion in the last year for which we have the figures&mdash;had nothing to do with the trade or services imbalance, but with income shifts. Most of that was the repayment of debt. A lot of our current account problem is really not a problem about trade&mdash;at this stage it is certainly not&mdash;but it is a problem about the imbalance in terms of the debt situation and the transfers out of Australia of capital as a consequence of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to that about $2,346m is actually unrequited transfers, that is transfers out of Australia from people who are earning money in Australia, and there are other such transfers. When we look at that difference, it is very significant. Effectively, nearly $20 billion of the $22 billion was in that category. I think that shows that the current account problem is more complex. The general response, the one that was suggested to the Government by everyone&mdash;the Opposition, the community and Treasury officials&mdash;was to clamp down on the economy. Unfortunately, as some of us indicated at the time, clamping down on the economy is a difficult exercise. If we clamp down on the economy a bit too much, we could actually have a recession which would be deeper than what was originally intended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Controlling the level of the recession is not an easy matter. We have to be very sensitive as to when we are going to start reducing interest rates and when we are going to start allowing the reins off the economy so that we can allow growth. That is the issue which whoever is in government at the time, whether it be Labor or conservative, will have to made a judgment about. Never mind some of the claptrap that goes on in the Parliament about economic management. The fact of the matter is that we will have to make a difficult judgment on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, each of us has his view about that. I, for one, would have liked to have seen interest rates come down earlier. I am happy that they came down yesterday, but I believe that we have to monitor that situation quickly. If the response is not adequate, we should be looking again at a further cut in interest rates. In my estimation, in Australia interest rates have still not come down sufficiently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I also want to indicate that I believe it is time that we had a very good look at the manufacturing process. This report is excellent from that point of view because it makes a number of very important recommendations. I suggest that the Government look at those recommendations and take some of them on board as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of manufacturing, it is time that we looked again at significant improvements in depreciation allowances specifically targeted for manufacturing and, in particular, for export industries. If we really are interested in doing something about this area, we should give a kick-on to our export industries by doing that. I believe that if we did that, we would really be making a very immediate and positive contribution both to investment and to export orientation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to that, I am very happy to announce that today we are introducing the Sales Tax Amendment Bill (No. 3). There are usually a lot of them. What is significant about this particular Bill is that it is taking up an announcement made in March but, in my view, again it is taking too long to come before the Parliament. This announcement is of a very important nature. It is saying that once this Bill is passed into law, all inputs into the manufacturing, and many agriculture processes, including things such as office equipment or stationery in the office&mdash;not just raw materials&mdash;will now be exempt from wholesale sales tax. That is a very important matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a nation we should have done something about wholesale sales tax a long time ago. We have talked so often about the so-called level playing field but we have not levelled it; we have put our manufacturers further down in the playing field and allowed importers free kicks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By bringing in these measures we can achieve the changes which I have mentioned: depreciation allowances; changes to the taxing arrangements so that everything that goes into the production process can be exempt from wholesale sales tax; and additional measures. The most important additional measure has got to be the encouragement of investment in manufacturing in the production process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the recommendation in this report which talks about the formation of an investment fund. It is time that we looked very hard at the bodies most involved in savings, such as superannuation funds, and asked them to make their contribution. They can do this through the formation of a fund which will be most involved in investment in the manufacturing process. We are not talking about the Government picking winners here; we are talking about a general fund whereby these bodies can invest in whatever manufacturing processes they are interested in. It seems to me that it is time that we at least got away from this total free market approach and said, `Let us have investment in manufacturing'. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

At the start of my remarks, I would like to commend all those associated with the main work in compiling the report, particularly the staff, who have to do such an extraordinarily difficult and important task in getting the material together, corralling all the members of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade as effectively as they can, and producing the draft, which is then eventually gone over by the members of the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been a very far-ranging inquiry, the number of submissions has been good and, in many cases, the length and the complexity of the submissions required a great deal of careful analysis. As honourable members would know, I am a signatory to the minority report because, in my view, the statement that we make accurately sums up the situation. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In our view Australia needs urgently a comprehensive program of policy reform to effect fundamental change to boost national production, productivity, exports and savings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not believe that this emphasis comes through in the (Committee's) report.</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Berowra (Dr Harry Edwards) in his contribution&mdash;the honourable member for Berowra, in his other manifestation, is a professor of economics&mdash;said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this country needs urgently an across-the-board program of reform to effect a fundamental change in attitudes, the law, institutions, attitudes to performance and work. We have to strive in every corner of the land for best international practice, and also reassert what one might call traditional, individual and corporate morality.</PARA>
<PARA>I say `Hear, hear!' to that. I am sure that a number of honourable members on both sides of the House would adhere to those views. The right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) in his contribution in the previous manifestation of this debate also referred to a number of issues which, we believe, point to the need to look more comprehensively not only at the analysis, but also at the means of responding to this very serious situation that the nation finds itself in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of particular concern to me was the emphasis in the report on what I would regard as several excessively interventionist remedies. For example, recommendation 11 asks the Government to establish an industry and trade development fund whereby all superannuation funds are required to lodge one per cent of all new assets from 1 January 1992 in the fund. The fund is to be used to provide loans to priority investments in accordance with a series of industry development strategies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second recommendation&mdash;I regard it as interventionist and wonder how it could be implemented&mdash;is recommendation 21, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government seriously needs to consider mechanisms that force&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I underline the word `force'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">individuals and enterprises to forgo current consumption in favour of compulsory savings. . .</PARA>
<PARA>I also underline the word `compulsory'. The recommendation went on to indicate a number of measures that could achieve this, including a superannuation surcharge and investment bonds. As honourable members would expect, the Opposition totally rejects the use of force and compulsion to achieve targeted economic goals. I strongly believe that they are anathema to the Australian people. We have seen many examples around the world where they have been tried and have failed dismally in almost every socialist country that has been established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that the single greatest problem facing Australia&mdash;and one that is not sufficiently considered or addressed in this report&mdash;is our inadequate international competition and the associated role of productivity. I am talking here not just about employee productivity, but about both capital and human productivity, with the latter ranging over all levels from management to the shop floor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not one who castigates the Australian worker for not working cleverly or hard enough; I think that we are all in this together. I think Australian management must bear a very great proportion of the blame because of attitudes and practices which, I believe, have not been conducive to a proper working environment&mdash;one which would encourage the maximisation of productivity of the whole enterprise, not just the workers on the shop floor. There seems to be a very great need for better management practices and employee and employer relationships to be developed if we are to achieve that maximum productivity which, I think everybody would agree, we must have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The magnitude of the problem facing Australia is enormous. One of the great things of this report, leaving aside the dispute about the recommendations, is the wealth of factual material contained in it, which I believe will be of very great use. It will be a rich source of information to those who have an interest in this area. As other contributors have said, there really is no quick fix to these problems. I particularly recall the right honourable member for New England talking about the need to look at the medium and longer terms rather than just concentrating on the immediate. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that there are a number of areas we should be looking at as a nation. I have already mentioned productivity. There is no real analysis of the exchange rate in this report. At present a number of commentators around Australia would point to the exchange rate that the Australian dollar is currently operating at as a real factor in the prevention, or slowing down, of the recovery that we would all like to see take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a firm view that, if the exchange rate were lower, this would be of great assistance to our export industries and would also have the concurrent effect of slowing down the emphasis on imports. I realise that the current thinking on both sides of the House is to let the exchange rate float, although even the current exchange rate is slightly dirty in its floating. There is no doubt in my mind that if we had a lower exchange rate it would have a very great impact on our capacity to export and would at the same time reduce the willingness or the impetus to import. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we should also be looking very closely&mdash;of course, the Opposition has put a great deal of emphasis on this&mdash;at the industrial relations area. If we could get that right and sort out the massive inflexibility and industrial relations problems which beset Australia we would be doing a very great deal to overcome some of the problems which have been so explicitly set out in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to mention in passing that I do not think that Austrade and the other associated groups which are alleged to assist Australian exporters do anything of that order at all. I have been extremely disappointed in the slow response and the inadequate performance of both Austrade and the AIDC, as well as the others, which allegedly exist to assist exporters. I think that they need, if not elimination, then a massive reorganisation. I do not think that they are doing their job at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I re-emphasise the great worth of the submissions which have been detailed in the report; there is a wealth of material. Again, I thank those people who have been associated with the report's production. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)notes that 39 nations recently signed a Protocol banning mining on Antarctica for 50 years;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)notes with pleasure that this Protocol came about as a result of an initiative by Australia's Prime Minister in 1989 to set up a World Park in Antarctica; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)urges all nations to respect the fragile environment in Antarctica and so preserve it for future generations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I ask honourable members to imagine a view of untrampled beauty, of stillness; a view of incredible beauty as far as the eye can see; a view encompassing the most incredible colours; a land of dramatic sunsets and sunrises. All this, and more, is Antarctica. In our ever-increasing search for minerals, some people have argued that Antarctica should be mined. Not satisfied with cutting down rainforests or desecrating some of the most beautiful and fragile parts of the world, the miners have cast their covetous, greedy eyes to the last remaining wilderness&mdash;Antarctica. Imagine the scene described above with a great overburden of mining waste. Imagine the whiteness spoilt forever by huge oil spills, or the silence of Antarctica pierced by the noise of mining activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently the 39 nations of the Antarctic Treaty formally banned mining for 50 years in this, the last wilderness continent. Antarctica has been designated as a natural reserve devoted to peace and science. The Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty on Environmental Protection is a substantial advance by treaty nations in seeking comprehensive protection for the Antarctic as the last great wilderness on earth. The Protocol prohibits any activity relating to mineral resources, other than scientific research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 22 May 1989 the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) announced that Australia was opposed to mining in Antarctica and would not sign the minerals convention; instead, it would work towards developing a comprehensive environment protection convention for Antarctica. The Prime Minister said the Government believed that it was both desirable and possible to seek stronger protection for Antarctica. He said that Australia would work within the framework of the Antarctic Treaty system to obtain consensus among consultative parties on the establishment of Antarctica as a wilderness park, while seeking also to strengthen and prolong the moratorium on mining in Antarctica. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's concern for the environmental aspects of the Antarctic is reflected in its current science program. It is interesting that in a world dominated by conflicts, of competing and conflicting ideologies and philosophies, long before there was international cooperation in other spheres there was cooperation on Antarctica. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know of no-one who has visited Antarctica who supports mining there. I know that some people who supported mining before they went to Antarctica changed their minds after visiting the area. Many members of this House have visited Antarctica. Regardless of where we are in the political spectrum, those of us who have visited the frozen land are totally opposed to mining. Indeed, who could support mining when looking across the fragile landscape and seeing the incredible beauty and colour of this frozen continent?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there are many arguments against mining. I do not believe that the economics of mining would stand close scrutiny. I draw attention also to the tremendous infrastructure that would be required, the harsh and changeable weather and the transport difficulties. There are also economic and legal arguments involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Antarctica is the last clean place of any size left on earth. How long it can stay that way is questionable because there will most likely be increasing numbers of tourists, ships, garbage and pollution in general. Already there are elements of pollution there. I pay tribute to the clean-up measures of the Australian Government at our Mawson, Davis, Casey and Law bases in Antarctica. I believe that our record in Antarctica is second to none. I must say that when I was in Antarctica, as well as visiting the Australian bases I visited the Chinese and Soviet bases. Our protection of the environment was better than that practised at those bases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those reasons I am opposed to tourism in Antarctica. There is little tourism in the Australian part of Antarctica, but last summer 17 ships operated from around the Antarctic peninsular on the South American side and two worked out of New Zealand to the Ross Sea. According to an article in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> there are already problems with overcrowding. Tourists pose a danger to wildlife, to fragile ecosystems, to scientific work and, not least of all, to themselves. That is something that people do not realise. When these so-called adventurers go to Antarctica, it is usually personnel at the Australian bases who have to rescue them when they get into difficulties&mdash;as, indeed, most of them do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was in Antarctica in early 1989, the Argentinean supply vessel <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bahia Paraiso</EMPHASIS>, with tourists on board, sank causing a major oil spill. To look out, as I did at that time, over the beautiful white landscape and to try to imagine it spoiled and stained by oil or, indeed, by mining waste, was a very frightening and sobering experience. This spill alerted all those people concerned about the integrity of the Antarctic environment to the compounding dangers implicit in mining activities, particularly those relating to transportation by sea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect which we should consider is that any ships coming to Antarctica to pick up freight or minerals would have to have ballast. As we have found on the south coast of New South Wales, ships from Japan and other places which come to ports such as Eden to&mdash;unfortunately&mdash;load woodchip release their ballast into the water. Ballast water has an effect on the environment, and it has had an impact on oysters in the Eden area. If ships brought ballast to Antarctica and released it into bays it could well affect sea life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter to take into consideration is the tremendous infrastructure that would be needed if any mining activities took place. Despite having safeguarding measures, it is inevitable that spills will occur. Bad as the spill was from the Argentine ship, the whole world was shocked two months later when, on 24 March 1989, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Exxon Valdez</EMPHASIS> disaster occurred off the Alaskan coast. It is interesting to look at the clean up measures that were undertaken at the time. Although there was some delay in undertaking the clean-up measures after the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Exxon Valdez</EMPHASIS> disaster, those measures were actually taken. They were taken because people could actually get in there and carry out the clean-up. They could get the equipment in there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Antarctic there are parts that cannot be reached for, say, 10 months of the year. When I was there in 1989 we were stuck in the ice for some three weeks. Ships on the first resupply trip of the year go to the ice edge, which could be up to 200 miles from the mainland or from the bases. Even in later trips&mdash;in fact as late as the January trip&mdash;ships may only get within 20 miles because the ice is still there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable members can imagine, if an oil spill had occurred in that area it would have been impossible to even get the equipment there, and it would take at least 14 days from Hobart to get to our bases, depending on the weather. As the honourable member for Cowan (Mrs Jakobsen) knows, it can well take more than 14 days if the weather is not kind. During those 14 days the weather can change very suddenly and very dramatically. It is frightening to think of any oil spill, or any damage to the Antarctic, because it would be impossible to get there speedily enough to clean it up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many kinds of pollution are cleaned up gradually by a natural process. An oil spill, damaging though it is, evaporates to some extent. It breaks down or it degrades gradually and finally disappears. We all know that this does not happen quickly and that before it degrades it often causes a tremendous amount of harm. Chemical processes tend to slow down as temperatures drop, so in cold weather the evaporation and degradation of the spill is slow. At the very cold Antarctic temperature the rate of evaporation and degradation may only be one-hundredth of what it is in warmer climates. Spills of this sort may make their effects felt for a full century or more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the continent of Antarctica itself is largely a frozen wasteland, the waters around it are the richest reservoir of life on the planet and they support the familiar large animals of the far southern seas&mdash;penguins, gulls, seals, dolphins and whales. The sea is also rich in krill, which unfortunately is being overfished by the Japanese and others. If we damage the region badly, which even with the best will in the world mining and tourism would inevitably do, we tear an enormous hole in the fabric of the planetary ecology and cause damage elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Antarctica is without doubt the world's greatest wilderness. This vast land and its surrounding seas are dominated by nature, by cold and wind, ice and snow. The continent itself is barren&mdash;in fact it is the driest continent on earth&mdash;and Antarctic wildlife depends for its survival on food from the ocean. Humans can exist there only with outside support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In such a place many countries have decided to establish bases in which people can live and work. They have done this for many reasons, but predominant is the desire for understanding. Antarctic research has brought new life to great questions about the earth, about its geophysics, its geology, its ecosystems, its atmosphere and its place in the universe. It has also provided the world with an unprecedented opportunity for cooperation between people of many nations in the peaceful pursuit of knowledge. The Antarctic region is valuable to the people of Earth because of its ecological role and as a mine of information useful to science. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, we have a responsibility to try to protect and preserve the Antarctic in as pristine a state as possible. This is not too high a price to pay, and the scientific and environmental integrity of Antarctica is infinitely too valuable to lose through inactivity or in the name of dubious short term economic enrichment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said in this motion, I pay tribute to the fact that Australia has played such a leading role in the protection of Antarctica. I know Australia did not do it alone. In the early days it was a very lonely path&mdash;we had only France for company, and I sometimes wonder why it was France because of what it did in Dumont D'urville on its own base, putting in an airstrip. That was not being particularly protective of the environment. Nevertheless, the French Prime Minister at that time, Mr Rocard, and the Australian Prime Minister led the campaign to preserve Antarctica when Mr Gorbachev announced at a meeting in Moscow in January 1990 that the Soviet Union would also support Antarctica being a wilderness park. Then gradually, but with some reluctance, the Americans came on side, although they still have reservations and sometimes one wonders about their commitment. </PARA>

Some people would argue that mining should have been banned in Antarctica forever&mdash;and that is my personal view&mdash;but tremendous steps have been taken and there has been a significant amount of cooperation.

The honourable member commenced his contribution in a most eloquent and poetic way and continued in that stream by then talking about the miners casting their covetous, greedy eyes over Antarctica. I suggest that it is a complete load of nonsense to castigate the mining industry of Australia or the world by saying that they were casting their greedy, covetous eyes over Antarctica. We all know that there are resources in Antarctica of some kind or another. We know there is coal. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow) and I have handled coal from the Prince Charles mountains; we know it is there. We also know of the great difficulty that would be involved in any mining. I think we should start with the stage completely bare and look at what has happened in view of the realities; and the realities are that it is most unlikely that there is going to be any mining in the foreseeable future. That does not mean that I do not totally applaud the action of the Antarctic Treaty nations in signing the Madrid Protocol&mdash;it had to happen.</PARA></TALK.START>

After all, we have a continent 2 1/2 times the size of Australia&mdash;a magnificent continent; everything he said about it is absolutely correct. But I am afraid that, while I emphasise that we must take absolute care and exercise great caution, I do not think there is necessarily a case for the elitist view that only the privileged, only the chosen, should be allowed to experience what takes place in Antarctica. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also surprised at what the honourable member for Throsby did not say in his speech. The motion consists of three parts. The first:</PARA>

<PARA>I accept that without query or quibble. The third part:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . notes with pleasure that this Protocol came about as a result of an initiative by Australia's Prime Minister in 1989 to set up a World Park in Antarctica.</PARA>
<PARA>What a load of rubbish! What a load of posturing! And the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) does not need the help of the honourable member for Throsby to posture on the world stage. Only yesterday we saw what the Prime Minister did in presenting his report on his performance in Harare at CHOGM. But he did not make any reference to the British press reports of `a foul-mouthed little man'. The Prime Minister of Australia comes into this chamber time and time again claiming to have achieved this, that and the other. I believe we will have the statement on employment next week&mdash;another `world's greatest', for sure. I am surprised that the honourable member for Throsby did not live up to my expectations and sing the praises of the Prime Minister, even though his motion does so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reality, in this country there has been a bipartisan approach to working for the protection of Antarctica. I do not want to pass up the opportunity of telling honourable members that in fact it was the National Party of Australia that was the first major political party in this country to adopt a no-mining stance on Antarctica. I take credit for being the one who led the fight at the 1988 National Party Federal Conference to get that adopted as policy. I am pleased also to say that our Liberal colleagues came in very quickly in support of that stance. </PARA>

I am equally very pleased that there will be no work on mineral research whatsoever, except for scientific purposes. I believe that is important. I underline the fact that this Parliament, comprising people from all parties, has done so much to make the world aware of the need to protect that wonderful environment of Antarctica.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Throsby made passing reference to krill. I know he is aware of the problems associated with its harvesting. This incredibly delicate animal is the basis of the food chain in the very rich Southern Ocean. It is very high in protein and, although there are difficulties in using it, it is being harvested. The honourable member for Throsby made reference to Japan and other countries which are harvesting krill. I believe the Soviet Union is harvesting 90 per cent of the total catch and Japan would probably come next, but other countries are harvesting it as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The biomass research program, which was set up in 1977, has finally come up with some first-rate results. In Hobart on 1 November 1991 an agreement on Southern Ocean fishing was signed by the 21 member nations of the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources, or CAMLR. The krill is a fascinating creature. One of the problems with using it is that the shell has excessive quantities of fluoride, which makes it difficult to use for human food. Also, because of various enzymes in its bodily make-up, it starts to decay very quickly and must be processed within three hours of being caught if it is to be used for human consumption or within 10 hours if it is to be used for fishmeal or other processed food for animal consumption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not even know how long krill live, so it is very appropriate that the biomass research program was set up. A lot more work still needs to be done, because we do not know how productive krill are, how many there are, or what they do in winter. But they are still fished on a fairly massive scale and are the most fished crustacean in the world. Regrettably, most people do not know a great deal about them. The krill fishery is the thirtieth largest fishery in the world. In the Great Southern Ocean the krill fishery is four times as large as the other fisheries combined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also interesting that once the shell is removed, if the tail is blanched, it ends up about the size of a grain of long grain rice. So we are not talking about an individual animal which is large in size, but in the very great masses in which they are found they are a very significant resource for the food chain in the ocean. We have to look to the long term future and not allow overfishing and overexploitation. That is why I am particularly pleased that in Hobart on 1 November we reached an agreement on Southern Ocean fishing which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A precautionary catch limit on Antarctic krill in the South Atlantic, including the Antarctic Peninsula and the South Georgia areas, where fishing is currently concentrated, has been set at 1.5 million tonnes in a fishing season.</PARA>
<PARA>The estimated volume of krill is 150 million tonnes, so we are looking at one per cent as a possible catch. I can go along with that, but it will need very careful monitoring to make sure that the resource is not overexploited, because it is of great significance to the future of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also concerned that, in terms of the research being undertaken in Antarctica, we continue on an international basis to research the hole in the ozone layer. The massive hole, now some 20.7 million square kilometres, has now opened for the third year in a row. As most honourable members would know, ozone is a molecule which is made up of three oxygen atoms. Its major function in terms of life on Earth is to protect us from ultraviolet rays and the consequent risk of cancer in humans and animals and damage to crops. The research must continue, and I certainly compliment the United States space agency, NASA, for being very instrumental in the work that is being done and for the information that is being provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short time left to me, I must make very complimentary comments about the work being undertaken by the Antarctic Division, which conducts the Australian bases at Casey, Davis and Mawson and, of course, a permanent base at the sub-Antarctic island Macquarie Island. The work being undertaken by the Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition, ANARE, I believe, is absolutely first class. ANARE is looking at a whole range of activities. It is looking at plant life, seals, sea birds, algae and mosses. Cosmic ray research is being undertaken at Mawson, which is the only place in Antarctica where this sort of research is being undertaken. The Antarctic continent is a pristine laboratory, absolutely beautiful, absolutely superb, occasionally terrifying and certainly an environment that nobody should treat carelessly. It is an indication of the history of this world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention in particular the work of Dr Pat Quilty, the Assistant Director, Science, of the Antarctic Division, and the various people who have been working with him at Marine Plain in the Vestfold Hills out from our station at Davis. A couple of seasons ago, Dr Quilty discovered the fossilised skull of a dolphin, which discovery was of great significance. Because dolphins are warm water mammals and not necessarily found in Antarctic waters, it is a further indication of the great change that has taken place in the climate of Antarctica. I had the very great thrill in February this year of being with Dr Quilty, again with my friend and colleague the honourable member for Eden-Monaro (Mr Snow). We were able to look at the fossilised skeletons of whales which had been found at Marine Plain. This is extremely valuable work for the future of the world, and I commend and compliment the Antarctic Division. If there is ever any suggestion of cutting back on the funding for the Antarctic Division, we should unite, and support and extend, in a bipartisan fashion, the work that is being done, because Antarctica and its future are vital to the future of this wonderful world of ours. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As seconder of the motion moved by the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), I am very pleased indeed to speak in its support. I am absolutely delighted to find us falling all over ourselves trying to take credit for the wonderful thing that has happened. The bipartisan approach is really superb and, as the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) said, it must last into the future. It is an understatement to say that the mining ban now in place has been a long time coming. The Madrid Protocol, which bans mining, is the result of a phenomenal amount of work by many dedicated Australians. As the motion correctly states, the Protocol came about as a result of an initiative by Australia and the commitment of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) to take the proposal onto the world stage and to argue forcefully and convincingly for its introduction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here in the Parliament, I wish to acknowledge the work of those who fought so hard for this Protocol&mdash;and I add to those who fought so hard the member for Cowper and those who were with him in the National Party. It has certainly paid off, as the objective has been achieved: mining is now banned on the Antarctic continent and the world park concept will become a reality. While many individuals and environmental groups have been arguing the case for the protection of Antarctica for years, the issue in the mind of the public received most publicity in early to mid-1989. At that stage, Australia was in the process of debating whether or not it should sign and ratify the Convention for the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activities, CRAMRA. This Convention would have permitted mining in Antarctica, albeit strictly controlled. But, as we have seen in so many cases, strict controls do not prevent accidents and environmental catastrophes from occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Throsby spoke of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Exxon Valdez</EMPHASIS> oil spill disaster in Alaska. Strict controls did not prevent it from happening. The result was an incalculable amount of environmental damage to the marine environment&mdash;damage we are still trying to repair today. The Chairman of Exxon had to apologise to the entire world in newspaper advertisements. The disaster underlined the fact that, in minerals and oil</PARA>
<PARA>exploration activity, there is a very real risk of accidents and ensuing damage to the environment. The argument, in fact, can be boiled down to the question: should the world start mining in Antarctica and take the risk that if there is an accident there will be no damage to the environment?  Many answered yes. In fact, it was said that CRAMRA reduced any possible risks to minute levels and that the world needed to gain access to the mineral resources in Antarctica. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The perceived economic benefits outweighed the risks, so it was claimed&mdash;and there were some greedy eyes cast on the mineral resources of Antarctica, because they are quite extensive. There are minerals besides oil. There is copper, chromium, platinum, lead, zinc, silver, tin, gold, coal and iron. But of course oil is the commodity needed most. As there is a world oversupply of coal, there is certainly no need to go to the Antarctic for it. But if the Alaskan tragedy proved one thing, it was that the risk was simply not worth taking. Antarctica is often said to be the earth's last great wilderness, indeed a wilderness continent of beauty and fragility. To risk its future would be unacceptable and would betray future generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Previous speakers have discussed the global significance of the Antarctic environment. Those who argued this view point in this Parliament and other forums are the ones we must congratulate. Australia, back in 1989, was in a position to use its influence as a major nation involved in Antarctic policy to protect that continent forever. If we did not sign CRAMRA, then it would not be implemented. Many said we should sign the convention because, if we did not, mining would go ahead anyhow. I remember all the arguments very well indeed. Mining would at least be controlled, it was said, and Australia would at least be in a position to bring pressure to bear on those nations likely to mine to ensure they did so in a responsible manner. But those who rejected the whole concept of exploiting the Antarctic for its mineral resources kept their eyes firmly on the vision of preserving the continent as a world park. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like particularly to acknowledge the work and commitment of the conservation groups and, in fact, of two former members of this House&mdash;Bob Chynoweth and Peter Milton. Both of them wrote excellent and convincing papers that were distributed to all members of this Parliament. Both had an enormous love of the Antarctic, having been there as my colleagues have. I am one who has yet to go there, and I have wanted to go from when I was a very small child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major groups that were involved, of course, were Greenpeace, the Australian Conservation Foundation, the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition and the Wilderness Society, all of whom lobbied strongly and vigorously to protect Antarctica. Their campaign was magnificent. The thousands of people, too, who made up those groups and campaigns told those who said that the Antarctic world park was an impossibility that, in fact, it was possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an enormously important message there to be got through to the rest of us. Certainly the odds were against it but, so long as it was possible, then we as a nation had to do all within our power to make it a reality. There were those in this House and there were many in my own Party who thought we should sign the mining Convention, if for no other reason than they thought the world park proposition just was not a realistic option. For arguing the case in favour of protecting Antarctica so convincingly in this Parliament, we have to thank again Peter Milton and Bob Chynoweth. Peter Milton, in fact, was the Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts. That Committee, while he was Chair, put out a report on tourism in the Antarctic to which I would like to refer the honourable member for Cowper. It says quite specifically:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee does not accept that the Antarctic experience should be reserved for the privileged few who are involved in Antarctic research and the establishment and maintenance of support facilities or others because of their distinguished visitor status or their positions in administration. The Committee supports tourism to the Antarctic provided it is conducted within a regime which ensures proper protection of the wilderness values of the continent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report that Peter Milton put out goes into the sort of regime very thoroughly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Abandoning the Convention was seen as a first step in the process for achieving the world park. Once that was defeated, the world park option became a realistic possibility. The decision made by the Government on 22 May contained a statement which said in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia will not sign the Minerals Convention, but instead will pursue the urgent negotiation of a comprehensive environmental protection convention.</PARA>
<PARA>Eighteen months later the Prime Minister acknowledged in a policy statement that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Minerals Convention was based on an illusion&mdash;the illusion of human infallibility in a region which hosts the most delicate and fragile ecosystems in the world.</PARA>
<PARA>Australia's step not to sign the Convention was decisive. Soon after, as the honourable member for Throsby detailed, to its credit the French Government expressed its full support for our position. Over the next 15 months nations across the globe joined with Australia and France. Belgium in June 1989, Italy in September 1989, the Soviet Union in January 1990, et cetera, followed soon afterwards, and eventually 39 nations joined Australia's initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The diplomatic work necessary to encourage these nations and those which followed should not be underestimated. The Prime Minister himself, the Australian Ambassador for the Environment, Sir Ninian Stephen, as well as numerous senior officers from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade all deserve the credit and support of this Parliament. The achievement of a 50-year mining ban, and the environmental protection which will follow, was a lengthy but certainly worthwhile process. What started as a vision, what seemed an impossible vision of an Antarctic world park and nature reserve, will now become a reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The success of those who turned their vision into a reality should encourage others who face similar obstacles to persist with their arguments because, as with so many environmental disputes, the arguments in favour of conservation as against exploitation are eventually proved to be the correct arguments for the long term. </PARA>

As already pointed out by my colleague the honourable member for Cowper (Mr Nehl), the coalition parties recognised the need to preserve this environmental wonder of the world, and had taken positive steps to achieve that objective, including prohibiting mining, long before Labor realised the Antarctic continent was anything more than ice, wind and penguins. </PARA>

It has never been settled, and its hostile climate and terrain make permanent settlement unlikely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Antarctic land mass, close to 14 million square kilometres, is almost twice the size of Australia. It covers almost one-tenth of the earth's surface and is almost entirely covered in ice. The coastline measures 31,900 kilometres. As much as 98 per cent of Antarctica is buried under an icecap, with an average depth of four to six kilometres. Although the Antarctic icecap holds 80 per cent of the world's fresh water, it is in fact the driest continent on Earth with a slightly lower rainfall than the Sahara Desert. Summertime temperatures rarely rise above minus 30 degrees centigrade, whilst winter temperatures average below minus 60 degrees centigrade. Coastal areas are warmer, with summer maximums rising to above zero, and winter minimums at minus 30 degrees.

Already several species of whales, seals, birds and fish are threatened or near extinction.

Australia is one of the nations involved in deciding the potential economic, scientific and environmental future of this ice-bound, but resource rich, continent. The Antarctic Treaty provides the primary legal framework for decision making in the region. It resulted from a collective research effort organised by the International Council of Scientific Unions which singled out Antarctica for special scientific study during the 1957-58 International Geophysical Year. The Treaty was signed in 1959&mdash;although it did not actually come into force until 1961&mdash;by 12 countries which had an active scientific interest and involvement in Antarctica. They have since been joined by 14 more countries with consultative party status, with a further 13 non-consultative parties. Any country may become a party to the Treaty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treaty was originally designed to prevent competition over the region. It stipulates that Antarctica should be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and not become the scene or object of international discord. No military bases may be established there, and nuclear explosions and disposal of radioactive wastes are prohibited. The Treaty also encourages international scientific research to be conducted by temporarily solving the problem of sovereignty. Freedom of access to the entire continent was guaranteed and there was provision for the exchange of scientific information and personnel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the Treaty provided a basic framework for protecting the environment, it did not expressly cover the possibility of exploitation of commercial quantities of natural resources, particularly oil and minerals. Over recent years there has been a growing awareness that any mining or oil drilling operations would pose one of the greatest threats to the future of Antarctica and the surrounding oceans. In the harsh and unrelenting Antarctic environment, mining would lead to certain pollution and devastation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Geologists have already identified a number of important mineral resources in the region, including gas, oil and coal. Although it may seem impossible to mine in a continent which is twice as cold as the Arctic, in darkness for six months of the year and accessible by sea for only a few short months, one only has to look at what is happening with mining in Alaska to understand that the seemingly impossible may be possible if there is sufficient motivation or promise of considerable economic gain or reward. In the 1970s, when the Convention of the Regulation of Antarctic Mineral Resource Activity was initiated, it may have been appropriate to predict and prepare for the exploration and exploitation of the potential mineral wealth hidden under the Antarctic ice, but in the late 1980s people started to question the wisdom of allowing mineral exploration or mining activities in the last great wilderness on earth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to conclude with the words of James Barnes, an American lawyer specialising in international environmental law, co-founder in 1977 of the Antarctic and Southern Ocean Coalition and a member of the US State Department Advisory Committee on Antarctica. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has never been a more urgent need for people to stand up and declare their intention to protect this extraordinary region. Antarctica can become a symbol of hope to all people, a living reminder of human ability to preserve its past, present and future, and to live in harmony with nature.</PARA>
<PARA>I am confident that this sentiment is shared by honourable members on both sides of this House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate on mining on Antarctica gives us an opportunity not only to reflect on the pristine wilderness of Antarctica, which my friend the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson), who travelled with me to Antarctica shared on our voyage, but also to make some reflections about morality and courage. One of the tragedies of political life is that success does not always go to those who show greatest morality and courage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two people who are not with us today were cast aside by their electors at the last election on issues that do not relate to Antarctica. Those electors would probably never have reflected on the consequence of setting aside Bob Chynoweth and Peter Milton from this Parliament. It is sad because the measure of those men, in terms of the lasting contribution they have made to Australia in any substantial way, is that they changed around an almost predetermined view on one of the most important issues that has ever faced the world. It is from the spark of courage from those two&mdash;against overwhelming odds&mdash;that most of us in this House took the view that probably the best measure in all the circumstances, given all the constraints, was to sign the minerals convention. It was a view that was shared by people who have very strong environmental credentials: the then Minister for the Environment, Graham Richardson, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans). Those men were not regarding the environment lightly; they formed the view that the best we could get out of this situation was to sign the convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the honourable member for Phillip (Ms McHugh) said, they kept their eyes firmly on a vision. With many ordinary Australians behind them, they were able to persuade, first, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and, through him, the Government, and then, strangely, the world community, that we would set aside Antarctica forever. That is extraordinary because those two men who are no longer with us are not able to be here today in any way to savour what I would have thought would have been one of the greatest victories this country can claim internationally. If we reflect on it, when all of us go very few will be able to say, as they can, that we contributed to this victory. Without their activities some decision of that monumental nature would not have been made. I think it is sad that they are not with us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us turn to another instance where courage can make a difference. In this case, the Prime Minister showed courage. It was by no means certain when Australia set upon its course of trying to persuade world opinion that it would be possible to draw together a coalition of nations to set aside Antarctica for wilderness, heritage and science. Many scoffed when the Prime Minister took that view; many were sceptical. Until France became involved in the effort, we were the lone international voice. Many other countries joined with France, but until only the most recent months the most powerful nation in the world, the United States, stood out against that international consensus. It was eventually drawn in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we have an opportunity to reflect on a moral question&mdash;a question of courage, which should spark a flame in all of us. Each of us can hope in a small way by determination, by belief in issues of principle, that one day we will be essential to some important decision which will benefit the long term, the world and the future of this planet, as Peter Milton and Bob Chynoweth did so well. I certainly wish them well in their retirement. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt that any opportunity for this House or this Parliament to debate issues pertaining to Antarctica is to be welcomed. This is Australian territory. As several honourable members have said, it is an important part of the ecological systems of the world. It is an area about which few Australians know very much. Because of its remoteness and pristine beauty it has attracted the imagination of all those who have visited it and all those who know a little of it. For that reason, we need to look at it and work out where we are going and where we are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, as you introduced the motion&mdash;although you are sitting in another role at this time&mdash;I say to you that as you found it necessary to introduce paragraph (2) it is indicative of the fact that even in a matter of some seriousness and importance the Australian Labor Party finds itself unable to resist pursuing parochial factional politics. The whole concept of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) having had anything good to do with Antarctica is rubbish. Let us start off on that precept. Frankly, he has been one of the players who has contributed only because of the position he has held. As the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr) has said, frankly, until France participated, the concept of a world park&mdash;which I still have very strong reservations about&mdash;did not even get off the ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several parts to the motion, however, and the other two certainly are matters which deserve the support of the House. I must admit that I still believe that the mining convention was a better way to go, although I believe the idea of imposing a ban for 50 years is excellent. But we need to realise that setting up a marine park does not guarantee the sanctity of the place. We have just seen those appalling incidents in Dubrovnik in the past few weeks. We need to understand that France was one of the countries that encouraged the establishment of a marine park. It has not shown exactly the same concern for some of the island states and areas of the South Pacific. As a number of us have said on other occasions, if France wishes to pursue underground nuclear testing&mdash;and I can understand the reason why and indeed support the force de frappe, as it is called&mdash;I would be far happier were it to pursue that within continental France. There is no reason why it cannot do so. If it is not going to do any harm to the environment, why do it in the South Pacific? But that is another issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of issues I want to mention but, as I have only two minutes remaining, frankly I cannot say a great deal. But I want to mention two. I feel very strongly about the move to take the huskies from Antarctica. The huskies have made a tremendous contribution in that part of the world. Those who are trying to advocate their withdrawal do not seem to understand that the huskies still have a capacity that no machine enjoys. They have saved the lives of so many of those who, when traversing that very fragile Antarctic area, have found that their huskies have suddenly stopped because they have known, they have sensed, that the ice over which they were travelling was too fragile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my point of view, the huskies should stay. There is justification for their remaining. There is no longer any reason to kill seals or animal life in Antarctica in order to feed them; Australia has not done that for a long time.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the House refer to the Committee of Privileges for inquiry and report the question of whether certain Government Members of the House were subjected to intimidation or improper interference on account of action or statements by Mr Bill Ludwig of the Australian Workers' Union in connection with the recent Government leadership challenge.</PARA>
<PARA>On Monday, 3 June I raised with the Speaker, pursuant to standing order 96, a matter of privilege based on news reports concerning comments made by a Mr Bill Ludwig, the Queensland Secretary of the Australian Workers Union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Ludwig was reported in many places to have said that if certain Queensland parliamentary members of the Australian Labor Party supported the unsuccessful leadership challenge by the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) then those members would lose their preselection. After considering the matter, on 5 June the Speaker advised the House that he was not prepared to grant precedence to a motion to have the matter referred to the Committee of Privileges. To underpin the seriousness of the matter, I point out that the conduct of Mr Ludwig prima facie contravenes section 73 of the Crimes Act, and that his threat, if complied with, would destroy the very essence of our representative system of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In giving his ruling the Speaker said, amongst other things, that a complaint of alleged intimidation or improper interference raised by a third party&mdash;such as myself&mdash;does not provide a good foundation for action in this area. I disagree, for reasons I will state in a moment. He also noted that if such allegations were raised by a member who had been the subject of the relevant intimidation or improper interference, he would be disposed to seek the advice of the Committee of Privileges as to the proper course that should be followed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regard his ruling as contrary to the law and practice of parliamentary privilege. It is entirely proper for a matter of this nature to be referred to the Committee on the instigation of a third party. In this respect, honourable members who have been subject to the intimidation may not be willing to raise the matter for fear of retribution. Indeed, I would have thought it my duty as a member of the House to respect and uphold the rights and privileges of the House. It would be a gross dereliction of duty on the part of the House if appropriate action were not taken. In this particular case it may well be that the honourable members concerned, as I say, are reluctant to raise the matter for fear of retribution. This is borne out by public comments made by Labor members, the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Gayler) and the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the event that I go further on another day, I will provide appropriate details of those statements but, for present purposes, I would simply highlight the following: firstly, on 1 June the honourable member for Leichhardt has said that he was `totally dissatisfied with the interference of the AWU, the union in Queensland'; and secondly, on 4 June the media reported that the honourable member for Hinkler has acknowledged that he may face retribution for his decision to support the honourable member for Blaxland in the leadership challenge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, notwithstanding the fact that a matter of privilege had been raised and put before the Speaker, Mr Ludwig continued to make public statements about this matter and, amongst other things, Mr Ludwig has been reported as saying that the honourable member for Hinkler may well have problems in retaining preselection. Those comments, if true, may even amount to a further contempt of Parliament on the part of Mr Ludwig. When he gave his ruling on 5 June, the Speaker indicated that he was `not aware of any exact precedents for the matters complained of'. We know the power of the House to punish for contempt is a general power, one not restricted to the punishment of breaches of acknowledged or established heads of privilege. The real question must be resolved by having regard to the provisions of section 4 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 which pose an objective test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is whether the relevant conduct was intended to have, or was likely to have, the effect of interfering with the free performance by a member of the member's duties as a member. Furthermore, there are numerous cases in which matters have been referred to the Committee of Privileges on the instigation of a third party. In March 1951 the House referred to the Committee a question involving party directions as to the conduct of members. The matter was raised by an honourable member who was not a member of the party involved. Two similar precedents can be drawn on in the British House of Commons&mdash;which we do draw on. The often cited case involving Mr W.J. Brown was originally raised by another member, Mr Byers, in March 1947. There was a similar case in 1944 when a matter was referred to the House of Commons Committee of Privileges involving a member, Mr Robinson. That matter was originally raised by another member, Sir Herbert Williams. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all the circumstances, it is my submission that the matter under present consideration should be referred to the Committee so that we may have the benefit of its advice and of its guidance. That is what it is there for. Having regard to the precedents which exist, to which I have referred, and their possible relationship to section 4 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act, we are faced with a serious and, indeed, unique claim of privilege, and one that ought to be tested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who control the business of the House gave me the opportunity to bring this on today&mdash;they did so a week or so ago&mdash;because I had put this motion before the House back in June. Some may think that it does not have a relevance to contemporary events. Oh, yes? Anyone listening to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> program this morning on the ABC would have heard about the donnybrook that is going on within the Australian Labor Party. On that program senior members were at one another's throats and doing all they could to humiliate each other&mdash;members of the Cabinet and members of the party organisation, particularly Mr Ludwig's own Queensland division. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While most Australians will be appalled that, at a time of economic crisis, all the Labor Party can do is wreak havoc on one another, the fact is that this is only a precursor to what is ahead&mdash;a drawn out, down in the gutter, base political brawl over who should lead the Labor Party. To hell with the national interest! Do not worry about the broad national good; do not be concerned with more than a million unemployed; to hell with those men and women who are finding it difficult enough just to make ends meet! No&mdash;we are going to be preoccupied with who the hell should lead the Labor Party to defeat at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is about personal ambition, nothing more and nothing less. Honourable members can forget the speeches. There is no philosophic difference. It is all very well the former Treasurer warning the Labor Party that it has got to pay attention to the millions unemployed. Who was responsible for the economic program that brought that about? The Treasurer himself, until he resigned. This is just an old fashioned power play. In the midst of a national crisis, where the well-being of most Australians is up against the wall, that sort of issue is being thrown aside. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Threats regarding endorsement that I referred to back in June are relevant again now. Who was here on Tuesday in this very Parliament? None other than the State Secretary of the Queensland Labor Party, Mr Wayne Swan, heavying the Queenslanders as Mr Ludwig did only a matter of months ago. The honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns), who is not in the House at the moment, has already been marked for extinction, to be replaced after redistribution because of his support for the honourable member for Blaxland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This show that is going on within the Labor Party is one of the grubbiest deals that we have witnessed&mdash;a power play in the midst of harsh economic times. As I say, to hell with the national good! That would be bad enough at any time but particularly when there is such a crisis in the Australian community. It underlines just how bad it is when important economic issues are being put to one side simply to argue about leadership within the Labor Party. That is why the relevance of this referral to the Committee was stark and correct in June and it is correct today. It compels a reference if in fact the threats are being regurgitated through Mr Swan, as well as Mr Ludwig. It is a tragedy, when there is so much besetting the Australian nation, that all we have emanating from the Labor Party at the present moment is this personal power play, accompanied by threats to members about their endorsement if they do not vote for one or another. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a 10-minute speech of superficial innocence, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) has failed to show an offence. He skipped over the essential elements of the Parliamentary Privileges Act, particularly section 4, and he has skipped over the Speaker's verdict even on the case he mentioned, the Brown case. For him to try to put up here that someone can successfully threaten the honourable member for Leichhardt (Mr Gayler), the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) and the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) is a bit like saying that the honourable member for Kooyong has never been involved in shady deals for leadership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Kooyong referred to the actions of Mr Ludwig. The honourable member failed to show that there was any offence. What section 4 says is that conduct must amount to an improper interference with the free performance by a member of the member's duty as a member. So it is more than interference&mdash;and it would need to be. It is interference with free performance. Of course, that interference can happen to varying degrees and has been a continuing facet of political life in the history of democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Kooyong was twice Leader of the Liberal Party. I recall that when he became Leader the second time there was a discussion on a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program which showed some amazing elements of interference leading up to his coup over the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). He won the leadership and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program made it pretty clear that there was interference, but was it improper? The interesting and frank discussion on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> showed how confusing it can be when determining whether interference is improper or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) saying he was involved in the pressuring of members and he told the honourable member for Kooyong. We had the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) saying that he was involved and when the tussle was on he told lies. To add to the confusion, the honourable member for Kooyong said that he was innocent. He said, `Nobody told me'. The honourable member for Ryan said, `I told Peacock'; the honourable member for O'Connor said, `I told lies'; the honourable member for Kooyong said, `Nobody told me'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a member of the Committee of Privileges of the House of Representatives, I know that we frequently apply the precedents of the House of Commons when considering matters. The Speaker rejected a request by the honourable member for Kooyong to have this matter referred to the Privileges Committee. Mr Speaker particularly noted on 5 June 1991 that `arrangements made within political parties were unlikely to give rise to matters of privilege or contempt'. Mr Speaker went on to describe the way in which members `are subject to representations, urgings and pressure as to their positions'. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . as a general rule, the House should not attempt to intervene in arrangements made within political parties.</PARA>
<PARA>If an honourable member came into this House and sought the protection of the House from Mr Ludwig or Mr Tuckey or anyone else, the Committee of Privileges ought to be able to consider the matter, but that has not happened this time. This time we have a third party, the honourable member for Kooyong, a member of the Opposition, alleging intimidation of members on the other side. It is interesting to see the reaction and recall the reaction of Mr Speaker on 5 June 1991 when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But I do not believe that a complaint of alleged intimidation or improper influence raised by a third party is a good foundation for action in this area.</PARA>
<PARA>We can go back to 9 November 1983 when Mr Speaker Jenkins cited the very case that the honourable member for Kooyong cited, the case of Mr Brown, MP, in 1947 when the House of Commons Committee of Privileges stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your Committee think that the true nature of the privilege involved in the present case can be stated as follows: It is a breach of privilege to take or threaten action which is not merely calculated to affect the Member's course of action in Parliament, but is of a kind against which it is absolutely necessary that Members should be protected if they are to discharge their duties as such independently and without fear of punishment or hope of reward.</PARA>

The honourable member for Petrie will, I am sure, tell us if and when he feels such a threat. Then the Committee of Privileges may well deal with the matter. Does anyone think for a moment that the big, burly honourable member for Leichhardt would feel pressured by someone who says something like that to him? Obviously not. If he does, then no doubt he will tell us. I have had a lot of association with the honourable member for Hinkler on some fairly tough issues, including resource security for the timber industry and on other issues. Not for a moment would I think that he would feel threatened to the extent that he was unable to discharge his duties independently and without fear of punishment or hope of reward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe we need again to emphasise section 4 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act. It clearly states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conduct (including the use of words) does not constitute an offence against a House unless it amounts, or is intended or likely to amount, to an improper interference with the free exercise by a House or committee of its authority or functions, or with the free performance by a member of the member's duties as a member.</PARA>
<PARA>The question we have got to ask is: is this improper interference with the free performance by a member of the member's duties as a member? There is no evidence of that. The honourable member for Petrie is performing his functions as a member of this House in the most impeccable manner. He is freely performing his duties as a member, as are the honourable members for Leichhardt and Hinkler. I reject the assertion of the honourable member for Kooyong and support the decision of the Speaker in rejecting the request. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that in 1983 Speaker Jenkins quoted former Speaker Morrison of the House of Commons, who expressed the view that the activities of Whips and the usual channels had never been regarded as a breach of the privileges of the whole House. Speaker Jenkins also quoted Speaker Selwyn Lloyd of the British House of Commons, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In general, I think that arrangements made within political parties in this House would be unlikely to raise questions of contempt or privilege.</PARA>
<PARA>Speaker Jenkins said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He declined to accord precedence to a motion on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA>Also on 9 November 1983 Speaker Jenkins said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I draw the attention of the House to the opinion of the House of Commons Select Committee on Parliamentary Privilege in its 1967 report and, in particular, its recommendation that the House should follow the general rule that its powers in respect of privilege and contempt should be exercised (a) in any event as sparingly as possible and (b) only when the House is satisfied that to exercise it is essential in order to provide reasonable protection for the House, its members and its officers, from such improper obstruction or attempt at or threat of obstruction as is causing, or is likely to cause, substantial interference with the performance of their respective functions. This is sound advice indeed, and in 1978 was adopted by the House of Commons and is now a principle guiding that House, its Speaker and its Committee of Privileges in these matters. It is a principle which should in my view be observed when we consider all matters of privilege and contempt, whether or not involving possible breaches by honourable members or other persons.</PARA>
<PARA>Madam Speaker Child made similar decisions. When a matter was raised with her on 16 September 1986 she said:</PARA>

<PARA>The honourable member for Kooyong has also failed to bring forward any matter which can be regarded as obstruction or intimidation. To sum up, Speaker McLeay has also said:</PARA>

<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>I draw to the attention of the House three excellent Federal Government initiatives relating to sustainable water management. I will then go to what I call a `tale of three cities', which is three different illustrations of initiatives that will enable better water management in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first is a Commonwealth report of the Australian Water Resources Council entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An AWRC Strategy for Water Quality Management.</EMPHASIS> It is a discussion paper of March 1991. The key element of this report is that future generations should be able to rely on the same water resources of the same quality as the current generation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sustainability of Australia's water resources is the key strategy which Australian governments must adopt. We must always avoid use by sectional interests to degrade our water quality; that is, if a local council competes for industry by offering an industry in one region the ability to further pollute its streams and water sources as opposed to those of another council, that sort of activity must be stopped. We have to use national powers and agreements to stop that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second report by the Industry Commission of July 1991 is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Water Resources and Waste Water Disposal</EMPHASIS>. Here the Industry Commission, as ever, is looking for means or devices by which those who manage our water resources can better do it, for efficiency, savings on infrastructure costs and the protection of the environment. That is the second initiative that the Government has taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, this report looks particularly at the cost of water used by households; access of water by farmers and industry; options to use water more efficiently in the home, in industry and on the farm; the provision of water-related infrastructures, such as dams, drainage and sewerage facilities; and water quality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third Federal Government initiative is that of the Ecologically Sustainable Development Working Groups, which in its draft report states that many of the environmental problems associated with water use can be addressed through the following sorts of policies. It recommends:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that Governments introduce pricing structures for water which <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">encourage efficient use and reflect the full cost of</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">administration and distribution;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that this be accompanied by full transferability of entitlements&mdash;between land holders. . . between and within States and between irrigation and other users, including recreational and urban users;</PARA>
<PARA>I will now give three illustrations of how, in three instances, we are achieving a much more intelligent use of water resources and better protection of our water resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The user pays concept has not always been well accepted by honourable members on this side of the House. In 1982 the Hunter Valley region was experiencing drought. The Hunter Water Board was considering building a fourth dam to service Newcastle and the Hunter region. Rather than go to the enormous cost of building that dam, a user pays system, a metered system, was introduced for water to households and industry rather than the old method of charging, which was just a flat and basic tariff. This can harm poor people if they happen to be left on a fairly large property where they are not using a lot of water but are being charged a large rate because they hold a large property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1982 the Hunter Water Board introduced a variable charge. It charged people for the amount of water they used. People's immediate reaction was very effective: they stopped using so much water. So powerful was it that Newcastle and the region literally `browned off'. People stopped doing the sorts of things that they normally did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, once people adjusted to the user pays principle, the pricing, there were amazing results. This has occurred since 1982, so we have a proper example of how better pricing of water resources brings decent results in terms of efficiency and equity. I will work this through. Consumption was predicted to drop by 20 per cent but, in fact, fell by 30 per cent. There was a significant reduction in peak day demand by as much as 50 per cent. The savings brought about in water consumption did not put the fourth water source&mdash;the Tillegra Dam&mdash;off for five or 10 years; it has now been put back to about 2024. The building of an entire dam has been put back 30 years because people are using water more sensibly by means of a pricing device. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an illustration of this, in the late 1970s within the Hunter district the residential consumption of water&mdash;averaged across all sorts of properties&mdash;was 270 kilolitres, moving up to 280 kilolitres and then to 290 kilolitres per property, when drought hit that region. The restrictions that the Hunter Water Board had to apply at that time of drought in order to save water reduced the consumption of water to about 250 kilolitres per household. That consumption moved back slowly as the Hunter region came out of drought. The introduction of rating based on the use of water has meant that consumption has now dropped to about 200 kilolitres to 210 kilolitres per household. What is more, it is continuing to decline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are suggesting, firstly, that in the early 1970s there was a runaway use of water by individuals&mdash;a wasteful use of water. This would have led to the building of a fourth dam which, in itself, would have been costly and environmentally destructive. Secondly, physical limits on the use of water were imposed to save water through time of drought. Those physical limits reduced the consumption of water. However, they have not had anywhere near the impact of the pricing system, which has now taken consumption right down to about 200 kilolitres to 210 kilolitres per household. I think this is a sensible use of a pricing policy to bring about an environmentally very sound outcome. That is illustration one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second illustration concerns water use in Melbourne and Victoria. A very recent study of the Department of Conservation and Environment in Victoria titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Water Victoria: The Next 100 Years</EMPHASIS> considers ways of better transferring water around Australia for different uses. It talks about a market or trading in water which would allow, once again, authorities to put off further huge and destructive capital works in Victoria by making better use of existing water supplies. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After only 150 years, Victoria is already over halfway towards the full utilisation of its water resource. If water development and water consumption continue to grow at traditional rates, Victoria will have developed all of its available water within 35 years and be up against a `brick wall'. Social conflict, generated by the exorbitant financial costs of dam construction and the resultant environmental damage, will erupt in coming decades if we follow this traditional path to water development.</PARA>
<PARA>We are not talking about a pricing device here. It is suggested that certainly in the Melbourne CBD, there is sufficient cost recovery to pay for any works associated with water reticulation. However, what is being suggested is a water trading scenario. This involves a management framework in which urban and irrigation water authorities trade water entitlements in a bulk water market extending across Victoria. Of course, I would hope that in time this might extend across State boundaries. Urban and irrigation authorities would be encouraged to buy and sell their entitlements, like any other commodity, in the marketplace. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under this water trading scenario, urban areas south of the Great Dividing Range purchase water entitlements currently held by northern irrigators. This is the cheapest option for supplying extra water to their growing populations. In this market, northern irrigators receive a sum of money for their entitlements which exceeds the dollar amount which could be earned if the water is used to grow pasture.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know how this will work out, but it is recommended, although not in such detail, by the Ecologically Sustainable Development Working Groups. They are recommending more flexible, intelligent means of using water resources: one, a pricing method, the second, a trading method. The third method is instanced by a discussion of a very advanced waste water treatment technology proposed for the Hastings district around Port Macquarie, which, as ever in these matters, has been developed and commercialised by the CSIRO. It is a suggestion for a small scale waste water treatment technology which could be applied outside cities to regions, smaller towns and so on. It is called the vertical flow wetland technology. As is noted in the discussion paper, that technology is tailor made for thousands of smaller communities and households throughout Australia which are struggling to treat sewage and other waste water in a way which avoids an explosion in their rates and also meets the increasingly stringent environmental standards for effluent disposal that are now being adopted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find great joy in the manner in which the Commonwealth is moving to pull together those who have responsibility for the management of water in the nation and is helping to direct them to ways in which we can maintain a very high quality of water without having to continue to destroy the environment through very large treatment schemes or extra dams and reservoirs and so on. We ought to be very flexible about how we achieve that end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In one example, that of the Hunter Water Board, we have a pricing mechanism which had environmentally sensible outcomes. They were very sensible in that they put off very large capital expenditures. The second example was that of the potential for a water trading system which will have a similar environmentally beneficial outcome. The third example was of the technological fix, if you like, that might allow a more benign treatment of waste water in the locality. By and large the problem in respect of the treatment of waste water in our cities is not a technological one but one of transportation&mdash; we simply ship the stuff out to sea and dump it. This is not a very intelligent way of cleaning up waste water. CSIRO is seeking more intelligent ways of doing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To finish up, in my home town of Brisbane we need to install water meters so that it becomes possible for me as a landowner to put in my own water tank. If I am going to outlay a couple of thousands dollars for a water tank, I must be able to save the money by not using water from the reticulated water system. It is possible to do that. I hope that the Brisbane City Council can achieve that. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to participate in this debate on water resources and to support much of what the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) has had to say about water conservation, water management and the maintenance of water quality around Australia. However, I want to put things into a rather more national perspective than the urban perspective of the honourable member for Petrie. It is something of a coincidence, Mr Deputy Speaker, that earlier this morning you and the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) participated in the debate on Antarctica. While there is a popular opinion that Australia is the driest continent in the world, as we discovered this morning in comments made by the honourable member for Casey, this is not true at all; the driest continent in the world is Antarctica, and Australia is the second driest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To illustrate just how dry our continent is&mdash;if we are to give a national perspective to this debate&mdash;if we were to build some sort of watertight wall around Australia and retain within the continent all the run-off resulting from natural precipitation, we would finish up with a continent covered by water five centimetres deep. If we were to do the same thing with the next driest continent in the world&mdash;the African continent&mdash;and contain all the water within that continent, we would finish up with a lake 17 centimetres deep. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Australia is an exceedingly dry continent and, as the honourable member for Petrie has pointed out, there is a desperate need for a responsible national perspective in the way we manage this scarce resource. In fact, as Australians we have been very casual about water use. I am told the average Australian consumes something like 530 litres of water a day. We can compare that with the usage of the Aboriginals who occupied this nation before us; they could live on 1.5 litres of water a day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I do not want to bore the House with a run through the Neil Andrew morning ablutions, I confess that this morning I trotted in from my Narrabundah residence and so I had occasion to shower in Parliament House. As the water was cascading over me I wondered how many water outlets there were in Parliament House, so I checked the Parliament House directory. After a quick calculation, allowing for my mathematical error, I found that in this building there are something like 2,500 taps in one form or another, 1,300 water valves&mdash;I am not sure of the differentiation between a tap and a water valve&mdash;18 water displays located in the gardens around the House and 36,000 sprinkler heads. That is amazing. This is the dependence that we have on water in this building, let alone the demands that we as a nation place on what are, as the honourable member for Petrie pointed out, very confined and limited resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am participating in this debate as a South Australian. Without being unkind to the honourable member for Petrie, whose remarks I largely support, I thought that much of what he said was, in national terms, motherhood. I happen to think it is fundamental that we need some form of user pays system if people are to be responsible with what is a scarce resource. Without dismissing what the honourable member said, I thought that in that sense it was elementary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am here as a South Australian who believes in user pays, because my State is entirely dependent on one source of water, the River Murray. I am here as a South Australian concerned about the quality of water that currently flows down the River Murray. I am here to endorse&mdash;in the words of the honourable member for Petrie&mdash;the need for a national strategy on the way we go about our water management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lest the Government imagine that, as a member of the Opposition, with the convenience of being in opposition, I am pleading for some grandiose scheme and enormous expenditure of money, I say it is not that at all. It does not take much to sort out the way we manage this valuable and scarce resource in the second driest continent in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reflect on the famous words of a predecessor of mine, Mr Bert Kelly, who, every time he saw an enormous national dam being constructed&mdash;he was particularly critical of the Ord River scheme&mdash;said that there must be an election around the corner because he could feel a dam coming on. There is always a temptation for governments to do something that is grandiose in order to capture the national imagination, but we can change our attitude to water conservation without grandiose schemes, and that was outlined by the honourable member for Petrie. Much can be quietly achieved in water conservation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me illustrate from a country point of view what can happen. The honourable member for Petrie has already said what can occur from an urban perspective. We do not have to be very imaginative, or outlay enormous sums of money, to have tree planting programs that can really sort out the salinity levels in our streams. Much of the problem&mdash;not all by any means; not even a majority&mdash;with the River Murray occurs because, with good intention but poor information, we have cleared surrounding land. The millions of trees that once lined the river and lined the Mallee and were all in their own right little water pumps picking up saline inflows and discharging them through the respiration process have gone. Instead, the water moves through the aquifer, unchecked by tree roots, picking up salinity that has accumulated in the aquifer and taking that saline water into the river basin. We do not have to be very clever to be involved in a tree planting program, nor do we need enormous sums of government money. In the process, we can minimise the saline inflow that is currently doing so much damage to the streams that all of our cities, but particularly Adelaide, are depending upon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Neither do we need do a great deal to rehabilitate the irrigation areas that are currently so dependent on our streams. Consider what happens if we simply provide each irrigator with a tax incentive to ensure that he or she is prepared to go from the extremely wasteful flood irrigation technique into the much more efficient distribution of water by dripper, microjet or overhead sprinkler, as the case may be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Liberal and National parties were in power there was nothing more than a 125 per cent tax deduction that dramatically changed the way in which irrigators went about sorting out their irrigation practices. This Government, for no good reason, rubbed the tax deduction out. As a result, it dramatically influenced the standard of water in South Australia and the capacity of irrigators, squeezed by the rural decline, to go about some form of rehabilitation themselves. It does not need much imagination to have the odd tax incentive which will not capture the voter imagination, but will do something about the standard of water currently flowing into our streams. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I am a South Australian. I am astonished that the water source on which I am totally dependent carries 1.4 million tonnes of salt to the sea each year. From where that water flows over the border between South Australia and Victoria to the sea, the water picks up an additional 600,000 tonnes of salt. That means that if we stand beside the River Murray for 15 minutes and watch what is happening 24 tonnes&mdash;or a semitrailer load&mdash;of salt will effectively flow past our eyes. It has been too easy for parliaments to say, `Well, that is what the irrigators are doing to the River Murray; they are the people who are mucking it up'. That is nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that the Murray has always had a salinity problem because the catchment area of the Murray was once a vast inland sea. Much of the saline load of the River Murray results from the fact that the water that flows into the River Murray picks up saline water from what was once the basin of a vast inland sea. Much of the salt load in the river is the result of that flow. In the 1860s, before irrigation was even considered in the River Murray basin, one of the inlets was called Salt Creek because the early settlers found it so saline. During the 1914 drought, when irrigation had still not expanded to what we know it as today, the salinity level at Morgan in South Australia was 10,000 EC units. In 1990 the average would be about 1,000 EC units, falling to about 500 EC units&mdash;in 1914 it was 10,000 EC units. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at a graph of river salinity at Morgan we discover that over the past decade river management has never been better, and salinity levels have rarely been lower, even though the popular line peddled by the environmentalists, who simply want to embarrass irrigators, would suggest that the worst water that has ever flowed down the Murray flows down it now. That is not true. Fundamentally, much of the salt load in the river comes not from irrigation but from what is collected as a result of the river having once been fed by a vast inland sea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I compliment the Government for picking up an initiative of the Fraser Government and installing the Woolpunda scheme, in which natural saline inflows that come in to the north and east of the River Murray basin are intercepted by 49 bores. Those bores pick up these natural saline inflows, which in many cases come up into the river basin from below, and pump them out to an evaporation basin. A person standing at the evaporation basin and watching the water flowing out of the pipe is seeing water that has never been seen before by a human eye, because thousands of years ago it fell to the north and the east of the river and it has taken thousands of years to percolate slowly through those saline basins and finally make its way into the river. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come from a State dependent on a water resource that needs to be cared for, and in this House in which I stand the Australian Labor Party is the Government, and it is currently the Government in Queensland and Victoria. It has a great opportunity, as the honourable member for Petrie has said, to maximise its chances to coordinate water management around Australia. It will not find this side of the House in any way frustrating what it is trying to do. If the Government is seriously prepared to do something about water quality, it does not have to outlay enormous sums of money; it merely has to have the political will to do what is responsible, even if it is not popular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appreciate what the honourable member for Petrie said about urban water quality, and I agree with him. But I can take him to River Murray towns of 4,000 people where sewage ponds are still located adjacent to the River Murray. I do not have much doubt that the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher) can do the same thing in his electorate. It is an indictment of the Labor Government that in 10 years nothing has been done to put those sewage ponds out of the flood zone. That is the sort of thing that it has had 10 years to do something about; but nothing has happened. The result is that every downstream community on the River Murray collects the sewage from an upstream community. That is Third World stuff, yet we still have it in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the honourable member for Petrie on water pricing. I have watched water pricing work for irrigators. The only real frustration irrigators have with a user pays principle is that in many cases what they are picking up is the cost of inefficient government schemes. They would happily install their own pump, lift water out of the river and put it on their own properties, and they would do it more efficiently and at cost. They are irritated only by the fact that they are saddled with the cost of a government scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with what the honourable member for Petrie said and with the interjection picked up by the honourable member for Mallee: the Government needs to encourage urban residents to install rainwater tanks so that they can go about their own form of water conservation. The honourable member's point about water meters is fundamental. I would have thought that everyone in Australia would expect to be charged for the water he or she uses, just as every South Australian does. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have this opportunity to second this motion. I share the concerns of my colleagues the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) and the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) about the urgent need to develop a national strategy for sustainable water quality management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is probably no other electorate in this country that can so dramatically demonstrate the need for the efficient and environmentally sound use of our water resources as my electorate of Kennedy in western Queensland. In the north of my electorate around the lip of the Gulf of Carpentaria, the summer monsoon rains regularly flood the savanna country, sometimes for hundreds of kilometres inland. The Gulf towns of Normanton, Burketown and Doomadgee were isolated by flood waters for nearly a month last Christmas. Meanwhile, Mount Isa, Longreach, Winton and Clermont can go for years without getting much more than a drop of rain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the tablelands the rain falls with monotonous regularity all year round, except for a dry spell this year that had a severe effect on local agriculture. But because there is such concentrated land use, there are problems associated with the sometimes competing needs of agriculture, development and the environment. The extremes of rainfall experienced in my electorate and the range of associated water management problems are repeated across Australia. We live in the second most arid continent on the planet and it is incumbent upon us to manage our water resources sufficiently so that the water available to the next generation will be at least as good as, if not better than, that currently available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not suggesting&mdash;and I am sure the honourable members for Petrie and Wakefield will agree with me&mdash;any grandiose Katteresque, that is, Bob Katter, Junior, Bradfield-type scheme to solve the problem. The damage that could be wreaked upon the environment by quixotic and chaotic schemes to divert the Tully and Herbert rivers inland is beyond reckoning. What I am suggesting, and what this motion calls for, is sensible management on a national level to set basic standards for the use, treatment and availability of water. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Climatic extremes have forced us to manage water sensibly in Mount Isa. The 40-degree summer days of Mount Isa, on which people can feel the moisture being sucked out of their skin every time they step into the sun, are the norm for millions of square kilometres across the continent. Because water is such a precious resource to the people of Mount Isa, it is treated with great respect. Water restrictions are in force for part of the year, there is an appropriate pricing structure in place for excess water usage, and water quality testing is carried out regularly by the Mount Isa City Council. What is needed, however, are national water quality standards and a national strategy for sustainable water quality management. We also need adequate funding for research and development into initiatives such as solar powered transportation of water over long distances in inland Australia. In this way we can harness the energy of the ever-present blazing sun of the inland to bring much-needed water to the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The efficient and environmentally sound use of water resources in Mount Isa is unfortunately not so obvious in the practices and attitudes of the majority of the Australian population, who live around the perimeter of Australia. A classic example of the problems that can result from our current mishmash of Federal, State and local authority regulations concerning water management is occurring now in relation to the Tinaroo Falls Dam on the Atherton Tableland. Because the local council concerned has permitted residential development well within one kilometre of the shoreline of the lake, there are suggestions that the water quality in Lake Tinaroo may already be almost beyond the point of no return because of the effects of past and present development around the lake. This presents a serious problem, as other councils in the area plan to draw water for human consumption from the dam to augment existing supplies next century. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Apart from people, water is without doubt our most valuable resource. I commend the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) for his motion, and I congratulate the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) on his expertise in this matter. The greatest disappointment of my political career was to see the present Labor Government, upon its election in 1981, scrap a proposal and a major financial commitment made by the former coalition Government to pipe the Wimmera-Mallee stock and domestic water supply system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make no apologies for raising this matter in the debate on this motion, as there could be few better examples in Australia today of how a commitment to a national project could provide medium and major employment opportunities, significantly achieve a more efficient and environmentally sound use of water, effect a reduction in soil salinity and improvement in water quality, effectively improve natural creek and river flows, and return an outstanding lake system to its original state. How appropriate in this time of severe economic and social hardship for a Federal government to show the initiatives to advance such a scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was during the desperate times of the 1930s that this unique open channel system in Victoria was built by hundreds of unemployed people. The system comprises 16,000 kilometres of open channels, services 51 towns&mdash;a population of 60,000 people&mdash;3,000 hectares of irrigation and 13,500 separate properties, and fills approximately 25,000 dams. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Wimmera-Mallee system releases on average 170,000 megalitres from the Grampians storage each year, of which 65 per cent is lost to evaporation and seepage and only 35 per cent is consumed. In the northern Mallee, the losses to seepage and evaporation are as high as 90 per cent. The real benefits from this scheme, however, lie in the fact that, by piping the northern Mallee as a priority and supplying that area from pumps in the River Murray, we would use only 3,500 megalitres to supply the area that today takes 65,000 megalitres of water from the Wimmera-Mallee storage. The quality of the water would also improve, with Murray water being between 250 and 300 EC units whereas the present delivery sees some 800 to 1,400 EC units delivered to the farms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Wimmera-Mallee system is overcommitted by between 15,000 and 20,000 megalitres each year&mdash;and that situation would be overcome by this program, as recommended in the Wimmera River integrated catchment management strategy report released this month. Some 85 per cent of the total cost of this project would be taken up in the manufacture and laying of pipes to service this area. The pipes, of course, could be manufactured in the western suburbs of Melbourne, giving a significant lift to employment, as it would in the northern Mallee area. The program would also have great flexibility in that it could be carried out in small sections, and I believe the work could commence within six to nine months of approval being given by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Wimmera-Mallee system has served the State well since it was built earlier this century, but today its extravagant loss of water places a responsibility on this and future generations to improve and modernise the system. While I look at this scheme as an employment creation program, it is a justifiable public works program which the State of Victoria today needs. Such an employment creation program would be a vital public works program which, as well as supplying work in these desperate times, will complete something that must be tackled sooner rather than later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I invite the Government and, in fact, I challenge the Government through this motion moved today by the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) to closely consider the piping of the northern sections of the Wimmera-Mallee stock and domestic water supply as being very suitable for a public works program to benefit employment in both country and city areas of Victoria. It is an intelligent measure to promote water quality and water savings. The Rural Water Commission in Victoria has done the preliminary design work on this program, and the basic conceptual outline of the total pipeline scheme has been made. </PARA>

Indeed, we need to make sure that any further development and use of water resources in Australia are sustainable and sensible. If we are to value this resource, we must do something that has not been done in previous years when, as previous speakers have mentioned, the allocation of water has been somewhat haphazard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even now, we still have local government authorities reluctant to impose a user pays system, reluctant to impose a metering system so that people are conscious of the volume of water they use and, hence, have an incentive to restrict usage and to use water more sensibly. Anybody coming to this country in the last 100 years would have seen the tremendous amount of water resources we possess and believed that there were no restrictions&mdash;a little bit like the pioneering or colonial mentality that we grew up with and that helped develop the country. But as we are now finding, this resource is not a bottomless pool. There is a limit to it and we have to make sure that we use it thoroughly. Some of the things we have done in the past need to be re-examined&mdash;even our attitude to the development of dams and the use of dam water. Whether it be for residential purposes, for industrial purposes or for agricultural purposes, the usage needs to be very closely examined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conflict in my electorate reflects exactly what is occurring throughout Australia. Do we dam the rivers for further development, especially residential development such as is occurring in my electorate, or do we leave the water resources and the water courses as they are?  Already, quite a number of farmers in my electorate have phoned me, disappointed that the dry season which we normally have in my electorate from July through to the end of the year&mdash;or a drier season, as people in some other parts of Australia might refer to it as&mdash;has affected the flow in the rivers. The flow has been very much restricted and in some cases has stopped for the first time in something like 100 years. The only other time one reliable water course stopped was during a devastating drought in the previous century. Stagnant pools are developing in that particular water course for the first time in living memory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The W7 site on Wilsons Creek west of Mullumbimby is certainly a contentious issue. The argument is all about population pressure and how much urbanisation we are prepared to allow within a certain area. Such development comes at the expense of agricultural areas, and it is for that reason I am very concerned about it. I sincerely hope that the issue is resolved so that further development is not ad hoc but is restricted so that it is commensurate with the sorts of resources we would like to see. Just this morning we have had news of the devastating effect of the burst dam in the Philippines. I certainly hope we never have that sort of thing here in Australia, but that is the extreme of the types of things that can happen with development along our water courses. </PARA>

In a nation of 17 million people, around 60 per cent live in a relatively thin coastal strip in the south-east. Yet around 50 per cent of many types of agricultural production&mdash;such as sheep, fruit and crops&mdash;comes from the Murray-Darling basin, which is home to only 1.8 million of the nation's inhabitants. The Murray-Darling basin is an important barometer of the nation's environmental well-being. With much of the land being irrigated, salinity has become a major problem. Some commentators have even observed that desertification of this area may occur, at least in part. That would indeed be a disaster, given that the area in question stretches from the southern quarter of Queensland through the majority of New South Wales and Victoria to the south-east of South Australia.

I do not suppose anyone enters this place in order to win a popularity contest. The best one can hope for is to have 50 per cent of the people think you are marginally acceptable.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern about tax collection is this: we have seen during the period of this Government a dramatic rise in the way in which conspicuous taxes, such as income taxes, are collected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is said that Commonwealth revenue has increased by something like 130 per cent, which is well above the inflationary increase. In the hidden tax area, in the taxation that the Opposition, for example, has focused on&mdash;the wholesale sales tax&mdash;it is known that, while the community at large does not know what it is paying in wholesale sales tax, the wholesale sales tax revenues to the Government have gone from something like $4.9 billion when the Opposition ceased to be in government to over $12 billion in 1991.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I rise to grieve about these things is simply that the Government and Government members opposite not only acknowledge that this increase has occurred but, worse than that, they are proud of it. They justify the increase in the name of equality and frequently parade in this place with self-righteous speeches about how much more effectively they are distributing what they see as the nation's wealth. They are entitled to do that. But I take umbrage at and grieve about the way in which they then paint us, the members of the Opposition, as&mdash;in their words&mdash;unfeeling and lacking in compassion because we do not applaud their capacity to rake in Commonwealth revenue in the way in which they have shown they are able to. They say that the milk of human kindness resides on that side of the House and that there is a monopoly on compassion on that side of the House, while we are seen as being devoid of any sense of feeling about what is happening to people who are unemployed or suffering in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rise this afternoon to express my umbrage at the monopoly on compassion that the ALP claims to have. Thinking about this word, I went back through the dictionary to discover just what compassion is. I found that `compassion' is derived from two Latin words, `com' and `pati', which translated mean `to suffer with'. Frankly, none of us can claim, as tax collectors, to have compassion because tax collection has nothing to do with our capacity to suffer with the people who are suffering in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the loads of self-righteous speeches that we have had peddled at us from the people opposite, we have not had one suggestion ever&mdash;from either side of the House for that matter&mdash;that we ought to cut our salaries or lower the quality of the scotch in the members' bar in order to be seen to be truly compassionate or in any sense identifying with the people around Australia who are not as privileged as we are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My contention in this debate is that one cannot claim as a government&mdash;Liberal or Labor&mdash;ever to be compassionate because the measure of a person's compassion is the measure of how deep they dig into their pockets, not how deep they dig into mine. I do not stand here this afternoon to be judgmental about the ALP. I do not suggest that it has failed any more than we did to meet that mark. What I take umbrage at is the judgment levelled at me in the name of compassion. I remind you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that compassion is measured by the depth to which we reach into our individual pockets, and no one of us has the capacity to pass judgment on the other on that point. It is not a matter of the depth to which honourable members opposite, as a tax collecting agency, are prepared to reach into my pocket or the pockets of other Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not rise to endorse the sentiments expressed by Mr Kerry Packer when he appeared before the Select Committee on the Print Media, but I was rather interested in one or two of his comments which I want to bring to the attention of the Parliament in the context of my remarks this afternoon. Mr Packer, so the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> tells us:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . refused to answer questions about how his companies managed to pay just 10 per cent tax. He said he wasn't prepared to go through his tax arrangements `with you or anybody else', but did say he paid only what he could not legally avoid.

<PARA>Then he is reported as having gone on to say this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You (politicians) are not spending it so well that we should donate extra.</PARA>
<PARA>Whether Mr Packer is right or wrong does not much matter. The measure of our capacity to be compassionate in the community is the measure of the preparedness that we have as individuals to recognise the needs of brothers or sisters, as the case may be, and not the way in which we simply go about generating tax income. We cannot claim to be compassionate in any party, in any government, because all we do as a tax collectors is take someone else's resources and spend them without their explicit authority. The danger is that in the process of generating additional tax revenue and sending it to people who we think desperately need it, even with the best intention in the world, we run the risk of simply remotely condemning those people to a cycle of dependency on government. We see that more credibly in 1991 than we have ever seen it, as we find people who are now moving into their third generation of being unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate in this chamber yesterday morning made much of industrial relations and what was seen as the failure of the Opposition to develop what was called a compassionate industrial relations policy. Let me remind honourable members opposite and the community at large that all the Opposition has been about in pleading for a different approach to industrial relations has been to allow people the right to choose to work or not to work, the right to choose to take a risk or not to take a risk, and the right to choose to belong to a union or not to belong to a union. Frankly, there has been no intention here to remove from any employee the right to work under an award and no intention to abolish a minimum wage, but in fact an endeavour to allow people to find work and so find a real sense of accountability, independence and self-esteem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I represent a rural electorate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the time available to me, I wish to touch on three separate topics. The first relates to the media. Unfortunately, the current national debate on media ownership and concentration has predominantly focused many people's minds on capital cities. The vast number of people in Australia who live in regional areas seem to be ignored. The areas of Newcastle and the Hunter Valley in general are about to see substantial expansion in diversity in media with the introduction of two new television channels. In Newcastle the entry of Prime and Northern Rivers Television, with a local news coverage, will ensure a diversity in that form of media. While, admittedly, that will add some difficulties to the advertising market and the marketplace, I do not doubt that over time they will be resolved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, those people who are focusing on the future of the Fairfax organisation all seem to be ignoring the fact that, regardless of who acquires Fairfax, the likelihood is that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newcastle Morning Herald </EMPHASIS>will be purchased by Rural Press Ltd, which currently owns the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Maitland</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newcastle </EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Star</EMPHASIS>. This would mean that the vast bulk of the print media in the lower Hunter would be run by one organisation. On the one hand, many people who are concerned about diversity and lack of concentration could well be forcing a much greater concentration within the print media upon the Hunter region. Whilst the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newcastle</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald</EMPHASIS> and I have at times had differences of view&mdash;it has its funny little ways; it tends to desource material, plagiarise and have its own perspective on what is news&mdash;the fact is that it is predominantly a local print media. Its profits may end up in Sydney, but its services, people, personnel and driving forces are normally intensely parochial, perhaps at times too intense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that the people who talk about floating Fairfax should start to consider as part of that argument&mdash;whether it is Mr Packer, AIN or Mr O'Reilly&mdash;the advisability of being prepared to hand over to an existing print media in the region the running and control of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newcastle </EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald</EMPHASIS>.

If it was Hobart, for example, which is much smaller, there would be a national interest because it is a capital city. It seems to me that the regional centres of substantial size are disadvantaged. Much of what I say may well apply to the Illawarra and other parts of the country.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I pay some recognition to those people in the Newcastle industrial complexes who have been so pioneering in the last five or six years. The changes within the industrial workplaces in Newcastle have been truly magnificent. It has not been easy. It has been a difficult process for management, trade unions and the work force. However, there has been an acceptance that the future of their industries and of the industrial base of the Hunter depends not so much on preserving a particular job in a particular company but on making sure that a company can preserve and expand its marketplace and, with that, the potential of developing new products and new companies that can also compete. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes have never been more noticeable than in recent weeks when 19 companies in the metals industry in Australia received substantial support in the form of the world's best practices awards. Three of the 19 were, in fact, Hunter based companies. I refer particularly to Goninans, Tubemakers and Anderson Rea. The fact that virtually one-sixth of the recipient companies were Hunter based confirms yet again that our companies have been working very well in the areas of staff management and union liaison. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The world's best practices scheme is aimed at helping those companies which pioneered the changes and developed a highly sophisticated and highly competitive capacity in their particular fields to spread those skills to other companies. Of course, the Government's support&mdash;which in this particular case totals $1.4m, shared by the three companies&mdash;is to help those companies pass on those skills. The community is unreasonable if it expects companies to help organisations other than themselves. This, to my mind, is a superb investment of taxpayers' funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While not referring to myself, Parliament and parliamentarians have been playing a role in this process. I want to give particular recognition to the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, which is inquiring into the shipbuilding industry and is having hearings in Newcastle on 4 December. It has been the preparedness of parliamentarians and government agencies to go into those areas to look at them first-hand that has been so encouraging. Firstly, it encourages companies. Secondly, it ensures that the nationally based organisations&mdash;whether they be politicians, Parliament or departments&mdash;have direct feedback from people at the coalface. I mean that almost in a literal sense. The fact is that it is very difficult for companies that operate in an individual context to relate at times to the national perspective, national goals and national objectives, which always seem so abstract and so remote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The preparedness of parliamentarians to hold committee meetings in Newcastle, whether in relation to the shipbuilding inquiry shortly to be held there or the ports authority inquiry of recent times, has been encouraging. Before this Government, only one parliamentary inquiry had ever held a meeting in Newcastle. From recollection, it was held in 1973-74 and it was on a highway environmental issue. The fact is that the Parliament itself tends to lose sight of the realities on the ground. We hear honourable members talking about their own electorates and their own areas, yet as parliamentarians they tend to ignore everybody else's. I think it has been the preparedness of some of the parliamentary committees to visit these centres and talk to the people involved in the industries that they are looking into which has been so encouraging and informative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My final comment is about the health scheme. I pay tribute to the emotionally involved and committed people who work in the health care system in the Hunter and who find it difficult to accept the dry economics of the State Government. I also pay particular tribute to the staff of the Mater Hospital, who are currently caring for a very dear friend by the name of Mrs Connnie Foley. The health care workers know that life is tough under State politicians and their government's dry economic rationalism. But deep down we do care. The hospital workers' caring more than justifies their actions in the hospitals at Wallsend and at Newcastle over the last six months, as it will in the months ahead.

With the economic growth of the region there is a need to develop the capacity of the representative parliaments of the region to participate in the closer identification of regional problems, of regional solutions and a better understanding of the cultural, historic, economic and social variables which are manifestly present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a trend towards greater cooperation in regionalisation, particularly in the establishment of ASEAN, APEC, the Pacific Economic Cooperation Conference, PECC, and the Pacific Basin Economic Council, PBEC. These organisations are devoted principally to encouraging economic and trade links between member countries and operate mainly at ministerial, official and private sector level. Apart from regional branches of international organisations such as the Inter-Parliamentary Union, there is no entity with a wide regional membership that provides a forum for the representatives of the peoples of the Asia-Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While ASEAN has established an interparliamentary organisation for its own members, which by nature is therefore limited, there is no overall Asia-Pacific parliamentary association as such. Consequently, Mr Deputy Speaker, it is worth noting for the record that progress is being made in this very important area. The first initiative was that of the Japanese. In April 1990, the Secretary-General of the Japanese Liberal Democratic Party and the delegation which he brought to Australia, including Mr Tatsuo Ozawa, gave the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) a proposal for a Pacific parliamentary league for educational, cultural and economic cooperation. Subsequently, discussions were held with other officers and members of this Parliament, including the honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley) and me. I met with Mr Ozawa in Japan in July 1991 and at that meeting he discussed in detail his proposal to have an inaugural steering committee meeting in Singapore to discuss the preparatory arrangements for the establishment of what was then called a league. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Ozawa accepted my offer to prepare a discussion paper for the Singapore meeting and on my return to Australia I prepared and circulated a paper, after full consultation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), his Department, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and the Presiding Officers. The paper, inter alia, recommended that an assembly for parliamentarians in the Asia-Pacific region be formed and that it be associated with APEC. I seek leave of the House to table the substance of that report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Cooperation in the broader context is a relatively new concept in the Asia-Pacific region. Historically, there are few examples of regional cohesion, largely due to the region's diversity. However, in the light of new global economic restructuring, the uncertain future of global economic markets and the changing economic profile of the Asia-Pacific region, there are economic and political imperatives that justify a shift to regional relations including closer cooperation. Therefore, an assembly of parliamentarians is clearly needed to further encourage greater cooperation, cohesion and understanding in the region and a trans-Pacific meeting of parliamentarians would provide opportunities for the representatives of member countries to maintain more effective dialogue face to face with regional partners whether on economic, cultural, political, social or other fields of endeavour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was in this context that I recommended that there be an association between the new organisation&mdash;which is to be called the Asia-Pacific Parliamentarians Forum&mdash;and APEC. I did this for a very fundamental reason. APEC is a recently established forum for economic cooperation with a broadening membership base and considerable potential for securing economic benefits for all its members through cooperation. The APEC forum is the first attempt to cooperate across the region. It includes members of ASEAN on the Asian side of the Asia-Pacific region, Japan, China, and Korea, the United States and Canada, and soon Mexico, and Australia and New Zealand to the south. The parliamentary forum could provide a most constructive and effective means for focusing consideration on the issues discussed by Ministers. I emphasise that APEC is a meeting of only Ministers and senior officials. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">APEC does play an increasingly important role in regional cooperation. As its membership is obviously going to increase in future years, an assembly would also be linked through APEC with a growing regional information base. Importantly, the assembly could act to widen the forum for discussion of issues raised in APEC meetings. Representatives of the APEC ministerial forum could report to the assembly annually on the activities of APEC and act as a sounding board for the representatives of the region. Putting it simply, while governments would meet in APEC, the people's representatives of the Asia-Pacific region would meet face to face in the assembly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The outcome of that discussion was that I recommended the establishment of an assembly for parliamentarians in the Asia-Pacific region that would be associated with APEC for the transfer of information, as well as, of course, association with other regional organisations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Approximately three years ago the Ethnic Affairs Commission of New South Wales produced a document entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ten Years After</EMPHASIS>. It dealt with the particular problems of the Turkish community in Sydney. It made reference to the Turkish community's limited access to government authorities; the lack of Turkish interpreters, which related to the cancellation of courses at a CAE; the limited number of Turkish courses in the high schools of New South Wales; and the overall unemployment pattern of that community. The report said that all of these problems could be partly traced to the correlation of Turkish migration in this country with the onset of Indo-Chinese refugees. In other words, to some degree the Turkish community had been neglected because of Australia's emphasis on helping to resettle refugees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That report, which was fairly objective in its analysis, has been followed by a variety of publications in regard to the Turkish community. The most recent to deal with the delivery of services to the Turkish community is the document produced by the Administrative Review Council entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Access to Administrative Review by Members of Australia's Ethnic Communities</EMPHASIS>. The report deals with the way in which that community perceives its rights to appeal to various government and semi-government authorities. This is of some importance to me. For instance, according to the 1986 census, there were approximately 2,900 Turkish born&mdash;and I stress that they are not the children of Turks, but Turkish born&mdash;citizens in the municipality of Auburn. These people constitute a very significant proportion of the 24,500 Turks in Australia. To put those figures in a different context, in the municipality of Auburn, which is central to my electorate, 35.4 per cent of the population were born in non-English speaking countries and of those 13.5 per cent came from Turkey. So my interest in these matters is longstanding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Administrative Review Council had the cooperation of a significant number of social workers in the community, such as Saliha Bektas from a Turkish child care group; Kaya Cakir, who is a youth worker for the Sydney United Soccer Club; and Besin Karasu and Oya Aytac from the Turkish Welfare Association. Indeed, some perhaps predictable but very worrying results came from that survey. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end, the Council came up with some very commendable recommendations. It is worth noting why it chose the Sydney Turkish community, along with Melbourne's Vietnamese community, to explore the level of knowledge about appeal rights within the community. On page 14, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Turkish community in Auburn is a relatively long-settled group. A large proportion of the population is old and many people are financially dependent on some form of pension or benefit. Many are neither skilled nor confident in written or spoken English.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the 1983 survey of languages in this country showed that the Turkish community, of all migrant groups, had the lowest level of English usage. Of course, the community is characterised by other social denominators: a very high level of intermarriage with Anglo-Saxons; very high unemployment patterns; and low educational achievement. The survey showed that the Turkish community had a very low level of recognition of their rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Council also went on to carry out a pattern of information to the community over the period of a year and then assessed the impact of that campaign. The program was found to have had a major effect. For instance, in 1990 only 23 per cent of the Turkish community knew of the existence of the Ombudsman; a year later, that figure had been raised to 52 per cent. In 1990, only 41 per cent of the Turkish community knew of their right to appeal in immigration matters; it had increased to 71 per cent a year later, a fairly significant increase. Only 41 per cent of the 200 Turks surveyed&mdash;it was a fairly worthwhile survey&mdash;said they knew anything about their rights to appeal to Telecom about telephone bills; a year later that figure reached 83 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These figures tend to indicate that there had been a successful effort by the people making the review to actually have an impact on the community and have some effect on their level of knowledge. It is interesting to note some of the novel approaches made by this survey because they are relevant to government authorities, to getting the message across, and to giving people access and equity to the government of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just go through some of the processes which represent a fairly novel approach from the standard departmental role of producing 50,000 copies of a document on social security or pensions, or whatever, in Turkish, and leaving it in the back room for the next six years. The efforts made by the Council included having the Turkish paper <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yeni Vatan</EMPHASIS> run what it called an agony column, over a period of months, setting out various questions on these issues from supposed readers, under the title <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Marco Pasha</EMPHASIS>, a significant force in Turkey. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Council's efforts also included having the Turkish radio program on 2EA broadcast a soapie covering the same issues. The show discussed delivery of services and how people go about appealing to different government departments. The Council carried out a variety of interviews with government authorities on talk back radio. It used the mosque at Auburn in my electorate as a central distribution point for information, as well as holding public meetings that were fairly well attended. It engineered the inclusion of a 90-second message in Turkish in all Turkish language videos obtained from the major shop in the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over a year, we saw a sustained campaign which, from the statistics produced, succeeded in accomplishing a greater level of knowledge in the Turkish community of people's rights. As a result of this survey, the Administrative Review Council, which, as I said, had very great cooperation from the Turkish community, came up with a number of fairly firm suggestions for the Government and for the various departments and authorities that have appeal rights and were subject to the review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amongst those suggestions was that there should be a greater market orientation by the various authorities in the way in which they pursue their roles, that the Ombudsman should be the central reference point in producing this knowledge to the communities, and that the various authorities should play a leading role in the dissemination of information to the community. The Ombudsman was seen as a very important centre to the whole thrust of improving access and equity to various communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also said, in regard to publicity material, that there should be not only a checking of translations for accuracy but also a greater emphasis on cultural appropriateness. Overall, the survey showed amongst Turkish social workers a worrying level of lack of knowledge of grants-in-aid. A number of workshops were held in the local department offices and people were also taken into State headquarters. However, as I said, there was a very disturbing pattern of a lack of knowledge by the workers themselves of what could be open to the Turkish community. It was stated that they should have a greater inter-relationship with the various agencies and should be brought in more often for various training courses. A network of grant-in-aid workers was formed to provide organisational advice and facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to translators, it was emphasised that financial provision for translators should be made by the review bodies and that they should critically examine the way in which information was currently provided by those agencies to the general public and, more particularly, communities that had a very low level of English. Other suggestions included very strong staff involvement in the planning of publicity activities. As well, as a result of this survey, it was suggested that there should be a greater willingness by authorities and agencies to look at a more diverse range of promotional and educational ways of conveying the message. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, there was concern that there was very strong duplication and gaps in delivery of knowledge from the communities, and there was an emphasis on their trying to work more closely together. I should say that the vast majority of the agencies interviewed came down with a fairly positive response in their actual endeavours. Those that were covered were Telecom, the Department of Immigration, the Australian Taxation Office and Customs. In general, there was a fairly positive indication that they were trying to do the job, but perhaps they need to ensure that they are more willing to try the different, perhaps the unusual, in presentation. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The most important functions of this Parliament are those of analysis, evaluation, re-evaluation and scrutiny of legislation. The Australian Constitution and the Westminster system for democratic government provide for the appointment of parliamentary committees. Those committees have a responsibility to investigate issues and collect data from the community in a manner that the House, as a body, is unable to accomplish. As explained in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">House of Representatives Practice</EMPHASIS>:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of their composition&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>being taken from all parties&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and method of procedure, which is structured but generally informal compared with the Houses, committees are well suited to the gathering of evidence from expert groups or individuals. In a sense they `take Parliament to the people' and allow direct contact between members of the public by a representative group of Members of the House when engaged on programs of hearings, visits or inspections. Not only do their programs enable their members to be better informed about community views but in simply undertaking an inquiry committees may promote public debate on the subject at issue. The all-party composition of most committees and their propensity to operate across party lines are important features. This bi-partisan approach generally manifests itself throughout the conduct of inquiries and the drawing up of conclusions. Committees oversight and scrutinise the Executive and can contribute towards a better informed administration and government policy-making process. In respect of their formal proceedings committees are microcosms and extensions of the Houses themselves . . .</PARA>
<PARA>There are some doubts as to the actual limits of the powers of investigation which may be exercised by or delegated to committees. Some would claim committees have unlimited power, but on the other hand the considered view is that their investigatory powers are limited to those matters over which the Parliament has power to legislate. Whatever is the real situation, and unless and until such time as the courts make a definitive ruling, the standing committees, as appointed today, still make use of those very wide ranging powers of investigation and inquiry. Many thousands of hours and probably millions of taxpayers' dollars are spent each year on and by the standing committees of the House of Representatives. Such expenditure of time and money is called into question when there would appear to be little cognisance paid to the committees' reports by the Ministers concerned. </PARA>

It is true that part of the role of our Committee has been fulfilled to this day. However, there is one extremely worrying factor and that is the apparent disregard with which the Ministers concerned have treated such reports.

That House of Representatives is made up of Democrats and Republicans, yet works as a House of independents where no-one is willing to take hard decisions for the good of the nation.

My grievance today is concern at the extreme levels of unemployment and the tragic exodus of young people from our region which, if not stopped, will culminate in a generation of our most skilled, capable and enterprising people being lost from our communities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, the Sunraysia Development Corporation produced a report of which I have sent copies today to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and key Government Ministers. It is a chilling document indicating the shocking and stark realities of the current economic and social crisis which is ripping apart the very fabric of our rural societies. I get no pleasure out of raising these issues, but it seems to be the only way to get the Government to take notice and to acknowledge the horrible legacy of the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating)&mdash;the recession engendered by him and cultivated and nurtured by Government policies. I will provide the House with some facts from that report. </PARA>

They have reports of families who feel forced to leave the area through embarrassment about their financial failure. Emmaus House, a social support group which supplies meals at night to needy people, reports a 25 per cent increase in its service in the past 12 months. Forty adults who otherwise would not have enough to eat are being fed there each night. There has been a shift in the services at Emmaus House from providing to derelicts to now catering for families. We really wonder where the Prime Minister's promise about child poverty has ended up. </PARA>

Their life is a daily charade of pretending to go to work. These men do not know how to explain the reality of unemployment. The total number of Sunraysia people who claimed social security benefits in March 1990 was 2,000. Today, that figure stands at in excess of 2,500&mdash;a 25 per cent increase in one year. The Department of Social Security reports increases in the number of wives and sons of farmers now claiming unemployment benefits. The Department estimates an increase of 20 per cent. </PARA>

The police report a significant increase in domestic violence from 1989 to 1990 and expect a further increase for this year. The Salvation Army in our region has spent more than $65,000 assisting people in need during the last 12 months. The value of food vouchers distributed in Mildura alone by the Salvation Army increased from $18,554 in 1989-90 to $28,550 in 1990-91&mdash;a 54 per cent increase in just one year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can also look at family law applications to see what is happening in the area of family separation.

Mildura City Council reports that there has been a 30 per cent increase in municipal rate receipts, many of which are now being paid quarterly instead of annually. One hundred and seventy-four summonses have been issued to defaulting ratepayers. A further 120 people have been forced to make arrangements outside of standard rate options to clear their debt. This is a tenfold increase. </PARA>

The survey of the Sunraysia Tourist Attraction Association shows a major downturn in business this year&mdash;between 40 and 50 per cent. The majority of tourist attraction operators in Sunraysia have been forced to dismiss staff. Between 60 and 80 per cent of permanent and casual staff have had their work hours drastically reduced. Due to the inability of the lessees to pay rent, three freehold motel mortgage auctions have taken place in the last 12 months and two motel leases have been taken over by the lessors.

But how can we get governments across Australia to take notice and to show a recognition that commitment to the wealth producing sector is not just needed, but is essential for the standard of living of all Australians? I have farmers in my electorate living on less than $100 per fortnight; some live on rabbits shot on their properties, with one Mallee farmer having lived on rabbits and galahs for the past nine months. We all know of children being forced to leave school to save on farm labour costs. While Australia is spending millions of dollars promoting a Buy Australian campaign, recent attempts by State health Ministers to enforce country of origin labelling products have, in my view, failed and there seems to be no urgency to ensure that anti-dumping procedures are adequate to counter the corruption and subsidisation of world trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the saddest situations is in the education, employment and training area. The number of people in the Sunraysia area registered as unemployed was 40 per cent higher at the end of March than for the previous quarter. The current recession has hit all industry sections in the Sunraysia, but particularly retail, building and hospitality. Students have had to withdraw from tertiary studies owing to parental inability to provide financial support. An increasing number of people from rural areas are attempting to find employment, relinquishing skills training programs. While an increasing number of people seeking assistance do not fit into long term unemployment categories, there is a need for change to ensure that our most skilled, best qualified people unemployed also have the opportunity to take advantage of training opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) called on business to show some initiative and issued an invitation to business to be positive. I issue an invitation to the Government today to do something about our industrial relations situation and our outmoded work practices that are denying our youth self-esteem and work experience; to show some initiative in the area of taxation reforms in order to restore personal incentive and remove the burden of sales tax, once again returning the balance to the productive sector and giving some incentive to savings.

I am sure that the further reductions yesterday were welcomed by everybody. The point that I really wish to grieve on relates to interest rate reductions. It is essential that the full reductions that were announced yesterday should be passed on to our business community in particular. Our housing sector would welcome that initiative as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to look at Reserve Bank statistics showing the reduction in 11 a.m. call interest rates over the past 12 months. Up to yesterday they had dropped by 4.5 per cent. The further one per cent reduction yesterday means a total decrease of 5.5 per cent. Unfortunately, the same reduction has not been seen in overdraft rates. Up to yesterday we had seen only a 3.5 per cent reduction; the best reduction made yesterday was 0.75 per cent, so the total overdraft rate decrease has been only 4.25 per cent, compared with the 5.5 per cent reduction in official rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, the base rates that banks charge compared to their margins&mdash;they have some flexibility in setting loan rates by being able to add a margin&mdash;have increased over that 12-month period. Twelve months ago we were looking at a margin of only 2.25 per cent, the difference between 17 per cent and 19.25 per cent. The recent September figures indicate that gap has now broadened to 3 per cent and there is certainly a lot of evidence to suggest that it is higher than that. But the figures for September of this year indicated a 3 per cent margin&mdash;from 13.5 to 16.5 per cent&mdash;showing a widening of that gap of 2.25 per cent. In my community, the business sector is taking many initiatives and I am sure that it will take advantage of the reductions made to date and would certainly welcome further reductions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short time available I would like to make some reference to the innovative things that are happening in industry in my electorate. A lot of credit must go to our local city council as well for the initiatives it has taken to encourage industry to the area. Organisations such as Pepsi have moved their operations to the city of Ipswich, which has eased dramatically the unemployment problems that we are all very concerned about at the moment. Many other industries, small and large, are thinking about moving their operations to Ipswich because there is little doubt that as time goes on that particular region of Australia is going to expand. </PARA>

The local chamber of commerce and its recently retired chairman, Mark Willis, also participated in this function. This small business is unique. It is called Design Plus and is, in fact, three separate businesses. Peter Rea runs Design Marketing; Leanne O'Donoghue runs Sunset Media Professional Typesetting Service; and Steve Rigby runs Rapid Service Press. It is good to see young people moving into business as these three young people have done. Their idea is innovative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By coupling operations, the group has reduced its costs and, at the same time, has increased the range of services that it can offer, thereby making the business more attractive to potential clients. This concept has great potential for many small businesses which may not be able to compete effectively on their own but which, through this type of group approach, could be better placed to meet client expectations. Of course, local business and industry needs to take action on such innovative ideas and take advantage of all the opportunities that are available to them. I offer my congratulations to Peter Rea, Leanne O'Donoghue and Steve Rigby in forming this new business. I wish them well in their future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I repeat what I said yesterday, that the honourable member for Kooyong seems to be obsessed about some sort of a deal. As I pointed out yesterday, the leave entitlements of the Solicitor-General are the same as those of a Federal Court judge, which the honourable member seems to understand, because he indicated that in the preamble to his question. The Solicitor-General was granted leave of absence for one year commencing on 1 January 1992. Under his terms of appointment, his entitlements to leave&mdash;as the honourable member correctly stated&mdash;are those of a Federal Court judge. In addition to that, his recreation leave, or leave combined with recreation leave, is the same as that for a Federal Court judge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was approached by the Solicitor-General and he requested leave. He then discussed it with me and requested my consent under the Law Officers Act to allow him to engage in private practice. Subject to laying down conditions which I thought were absolutely necessary to indicate that there would be no conflict between the role of a Solicitor-General on leave and somebody practising at the Bar and, in particular, in respect of what briefs would be taken and those sorts of matters, I granted him the right, as I was entitled to do under section 9 of the Law Officers Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not a matter of a deal but a matter of going through the processes and determining what would be done in the circumstances that I was faced with. During those discussions, the Solicitor-General told me why, rather than spending a year fishing or whatever else he may have wanted to do, he wanted to spend a period back at the Bar. Those reasons were personal reasons given to me by the Solicitor-General, and, quite bluntly, I do not think they are any of the honourable member's business.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Employment, Education and Training. Can he inform the House of the unemployment rate for October? Further, do the figures indicate that recovery is in train?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2588" SPEAKER="Dawkins The Hon J.S." NAMEID="9E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="FREMANTLE" MINISTERIAL="EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9E4">Mr DAWKINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a fact that the ABS released the labour market figures for the month of October today. Those figures reveal a fall in employment of just under 19,000 for the month of September. However, this disguises to some extent an increase in full time employment of 22,500, which I think must be taken as perhaps a glimmer of optimism in terms of the turnaround, perhaps, in the labour market itself. There was a further fall in the participation rate to 63 per cent and, as a consequence, the unemployment rate fell from 10.2 per cent to 10.1 per cent, with the numbers of unemployed falling by just over 12,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been careful on all these monthly occasions not to read too much into the figures. They have tended to dance around a bit from month to month. Whilst it is obviously better to observe a slight fall in the unemployment rate than a rise, I would nevertheless caution anyone about reading too much into these monthly figures. Nevertheless, I do note that the trend series has been very stable over the last few months, which does seem to indicate that at least there seems to have been a bottoming in the decline in the labour market itself. From what we can discern, from things such as my Department's leading indicators and other statistics, we should expect by the end of this year a return to a growth in employment itself. That will not, by the end of this year, necessarily lead to a dramatic fall in the unemployment rate, but at least we will see jobs growing again by the end of this year if those predictions, as indicated by the leading indicator, are to be borne out.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would make the observation that whilst the Opposition has been very enthusiastic about exaggerating the extent of unemployment in this country, and whilst it has always been trying to portray the number of people out of work as being a million, of course it is far less than a million, at just over 850,000. One does not take any comfort from the fact that there are 850,000 out of work, and we need to do all we can not only to get those people back to work but also to support them during this difficult period that they and their families are enduring whilst they remain out of work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does no-one any good, neither the unemployed nor the economy as a whole, for the Opposition to run around, as it has been doing repeatedly, pretending that there are a million people out of work, particularly when one bears in mind that the Opposition's policy is not only to further extend the number of people out of work but also to rip away the support which exists for those people who are out of work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I make is that I have concentrated very much on the circumstances of teenagers, particularly the 15- to 19-year-old age group. It is comforting to know that there are about 40,000 fewer young people out of work than there were in 1983. I think that means that the Government has been particularly successful in encouraging more of those people to remain in the education and training system and therefore improve their prospects of getting a job when they emerge from the education and training system.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, friend and colleague. Today's labour force survey figures show that the unemployment rate in October was above 10 per cent. May I say on behalf of the Government that the prospect of unemployment remaining at that level is unacceptable. The recession, I concede, has been deeper and longer than any of us would have wanted. Certainly the pain it has brought has naturally dominated people's perceptions of the current situation. That is perfectly understandable, Mr Speaker, as I think you would agree.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But today's figures also show, as the Minister said, that in trend terms employment has stabilised and that full time employment seems to be beginning to pick up. Certainly on that basis, these figures provide no support for the Opposition merchants of doom and gloom. Of course, these figures, important as they are, are only part of a wider picture and that wider picture is one of an economy in the early stages of a recovery. Yesterday, the Reserve Bank moved official interest rates down a further one percentage point and we are already seeing that flow into reductions in rates for home buyers and businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That reduction in rates to their lowest levels for over a decade, let me emphasise, was made possible, of course, by the reductions that we have achieved in inflation and the widespread perception which is reflected in inflation expectations that these reductions will be permanent. The partial indicators show clearly that these interest rate reductions are already leading to a recovery in the housing sector. We have also seen a sustained improvement in consumer confidence.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Following the meeting of the Reserve Bank board on Tuesday, the Government and the Reserve Bank, as honourable members know, agreed to a further one per cent reduction in cash rates to around 8 1/2 per cent. As honourable members know, this is the tenth reduction in interest rates since January 1990 and results in cash rates of less than half the level of that time. The Government expects that this reduction will be reflected quickly in lending rates. But neither the Government nor the Reserve Bank has made any approach, either formal or informal, to the banks to encourage them to pass more of the reduction to any one type of borrower.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initial reaction of at least one bank has been reduced rates for business borrowers by slightly more than for home lending. That is probably because the banks have been competing very hard in the home loan area and are unlikely to shave margins to win market share. Competition has not been as intense in the business loan sector and there probably exists greater scope for reduction in rates to these borrowers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me reiterate what I said yesterday: this reduction in interest rates reflects the further evidence of declines in inflation and inflation expectations. Monetary policy will continue to be assessed on the basis of prospective movements in economic activity, inflation expectations and the world economic outlook. The full effect of past easings has not yet worked through the economy. Yesterday's lowering of rates and the previous easings will continue to assist the recovery over the foreseeable future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is taking a responsible economic approach, maximising the likelihood that the economic recovery will be steady and sustainable in terms of both economic growth and jobs. It will also be avoiding the risk that inflation will re-emerge. This is not just the Government's view. For example, Professor Ian Harper, Professor of Economics at Melbourne University, expressed similar sentiments, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government was taking a responsible economic approach, and maximising the likelihood that the economic recovery would be slow and steady without risking the re-emergence of inflation. This cut in rates has not put us back on the roller coaster and even though it is politically convenient it is economically justified and responsible.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has decided that any Australian citizen, no matter where he or she lives, should be entitled to the same representation here in the national Parliament. That should extend to the territory of Norfolk Island. At the same time, the Government recognises that special circumstances surround the history of Norfolk Island. On that basis, not all citizens of Norfolk Island wish to be represented in this Parliament. Accordingly, in responding to the House of Representatives report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Islands in the Sun</EMPHASIS>, the Government decided to make available the facility of optional enrolment&mdash;I stress `optional' enrolment&mdash;for those Australian citizens in Norfolk Island who may wish to vote in Federal elections.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under section 122 of our Constitution, the Parliament may grant parliamentary representation to the territories to the extent and on such terms that it thinks fit. There would be constitutional difficulties associated with allowing people on Norfolk Island to vote in an electoral division within a State. A referendum would be clearly required to alter the boundaries of the particular State. No such constitutional difficulties exist in the case where it is suggested that Norfolk Island be attached to a mainland territory. Indeed, such a provision clearly exists in the case of the Cocos and Christmas Islands, which of course are very ably represented in this chamber by the honourable member for the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Based on advice from the Australian Electoral Commission it is proposed to attach Norfolk Island to the division of Canberra for electoral purposes only. Again, I have every confidence that those people who choose optional enrolment will be extraordinarily represented by my colleague the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. This electorate was suggested because the other ACT electorate, the division of Fraser, includes the Jervis Bay territory. It has been suggested by some people that Norfolk Islanders should be free to choose whichever electorate they wish to vote in.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government considers that the interests of Norfolk Island electors would be more effectively served if they were to vote as part of one division and be represented in this Parliament by a single member clearly answerable to the people of Norfolk Island, rather than having their representation spread across many Federal divisions. The Commonwealth Electoral Act also has a clear residential basis. An exception is made in the case of itinerant electors and eligible overseas electors because they do not necessarily have an identifiable place of residence within Australia in which they can enrol. In the case of Norfolk Island, potential enrollees ordinarily would be resident on Norfolk Island. Therefore, it would be consistent with the approach taken with voters elsewhere in the ACT for territory voters to be enrolled at their address on Norfolk Island.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DT4">Mr CREAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that in a minute. Secondly, it ignores the criticisms that were levelled at past drought policy&mdash;something which the Government has had to have regard to. On the question of the issues affecting rural Australia at the moment, it should be understood that whilst the rural recession is as bad if not worse today than it was in 1982-83, it was predominantly drought that was the cause in 1982-83. The problem is compounded today by low commodity prices and the high level of debt that certain sections of the farm community have had to meet. Therefore, it requires a comprehensive response, not just a response based on drought. This was the point that was well and truly argued in the debate on a matter of public importance in this House a couple of weeks ago. I think it is acknowledged by those on the other side of the Parliament. That point needs to be understood.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our strategy has been to develop sound policy that genuinely meets the needs of those people most affected, that targets that assistance and that is aimed at keeping good farmers on the land so that we have a secure base when we come out of the recession. The second point that needs to be understood is that a lot of rorting used to go on under the old drought policy. That was something that we had to address. The history of drought in Queensland&mdash;the State which is experiencing the most severe drought at the moment&mdash;is that between 1964 and 1989, under previous National Party administrations, some Queensland shires were drought declared 70 per cent of the time because those announcements were triggered by the State of Queensland. Many other areas were drought declared 50 per cent of the time. Honourable members should understand that more than three-quarters of the drought assistance went to only 16 per cent of the properties&mdash;the larger ones. That is the problem we are faced with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to recognise the problem on the one hand, but on the other hand we have to stop the rorts and make sure that the relief is targeted to those people most in need. Having said that, I am fully aware of the claims that those affected by severe droughts deserve special consideration. Where droughts are so bad that, for example, the breeding herd is being run down to the extent that it jeopardises the future development of the industry, I believe that requires further consideration on the part of the Government. I acknowledge that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rural assistance package that I announced last week will allow for that consideration through a review of the Commonwealth funding arrangements under the NDRA, and the formulation of a national drought policy which all States have said should be dealt with in February. So let us get that point clear to start with. As for the package itself, we should understand that the lion's share of the extra RAS assistance&mdash;$10m to New South Wales and $12m to Queensland out of the $30m for the rest of this financial year&mdash;is going to the States most affected by the drought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are the elements of this package?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would be delighted to. The most important, significant and comprehensive package of reforms ever introduced for road transport in Australia has been accompanied by what is probably one of the most appalling exercises in political misrepresentation ever.

As a result of these misrepresentations and the fear and apprehension which those persons are causing, many people in the road transport industry who have mortgaged their homes to buy a rig will possibly try to dispose of their rig, at a loss, before the final details are apparent. If members of the Opposition think that is smart, the credibility of people such as Ron Boswell and Bill O'Chee will be measured when those final results are known, and their credibility will be measured against mine.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have already indicated what those proposals will be. In July of this year, at the last Special Premiers Conference&mdash;and the Prime Minister has already referred to the reforms that came about in the area of road transport&mdash;the most significant package that has ever been put together was agreed to by the Premiers. All we had to do was ensure that the details would become known as they were developed. They will be considered later this month by the Prime Minister, together with the Premiers and the Chief Ministers. They have agreed to introduce uniformity of regulations for road transport operators across Australia. For the first time in the history of Australia, that will be done. It has been welcomed and applauded by all the people in the industry, who want that uniformity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, we are in the process of clarifying which parts of the road network will be the responsibility of each level of government. So there will be greater transparency, less ambiguity, less confusion, less uncertainty and greater efficiency, as the Prime Minister indicated. We are also in the process of finalising the establishment of a National Road Transport Commission so that we will have something which is a little more independent and is divorced from political interference in the uniformity that we want to establish and maintain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to that, for the purposes of equity, simplicity and efficiency, we are seeking to introduce national uniform charging arrangements. I know that many members of the Opposition have been repeating some of the claims that have been made. I will now put the matter clearly on the record so that, if any of them continue with any deliberate attempt to misrepresent it, they will be exposed for those misrepresentations, for the dishonesty which lies behind them and for any damage which is caused to road transport operators as a result of it. In connection with the six-axle articulated vehicles, the officers who were charged with the responsibility for developing a schedule of indicative or possible charges tabled that schedule at the last Special Premiers Conference. It was simply received by the Premiers; it was not endorsed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposition that was put forward was that by the middle of this decade there would be introduced in two stages a level of charges which would more closely and more sensibly approach the types of costs that the road transport operators impose on that road network. For six-axle articulated vehicles, by the start of 1993 the first instalment of those charges would be made, and by the middle of this decade, 1995, the total charge would be in place. The total charge proposed is $7,000 or $8,000. That accords with the charge that already exists in New South Wales, yet Boswell and O'Chee have been saying that the $7,000 will come in in 1993, and that in 1995 it will be $14,000. That is a lie.</PARA>

We understand what the Opposition's agenda is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to the honourable member for Capricornia's question, the initial ISC report proposed that the charge for the B-doubles be about $44,000. The schedule of charges that was tabled at the last Premiers Conference suggested that the charge should be $11,000 or $12,000 a year. That is what is already paid in New South Wales and Victoria. The ISC's proposal for the triple deck road trains, which was put forward initially in its report of May last year, was a charge of $70,200.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The indicative charges, contrary to that, suggest that there should be a 50 per cent discount for those operators, and the 50 per cent discount would represent something like $11,000 in 1995, and at the end of this decade&mdash;10 years down the track&mdash;there would be a more appropriate level of charges for those operators as well.

<PARA>We have this morning received another unemployment figure in excess of 10 per cent, which is now the second consecutive figure in double digits, yet all we have is a Government that is totally preoccupied with one job; that is, it is concerned with preserving the job of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), who is being challenged by the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating). He has just left this chamber; he is trying to unseat the present Prime Minister. Only one job is the focus of the Government's attention, when there are nearly one million Australians&mdash;and we stand by that figure&mdash;who are unemployed and some 500,000 to 600,000 other Australians who are working fewer hours than they want to work because they have been pushed to shorter shifts or onto part time work or because they simply cannot find enough employment to satisfy their desire to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet, in the midst of that situation, we have a Government which is in a total shambles&mdash;indeed, a Government which now has broken into open warfare whereby members of the parliamentary party are attacking members of the organisation and vice versa, and as well members of the parliamentary party are visibly and openly attacking each other. The halls of this place are alive with members of both sides of the leadership challenge running around trying to get the numbers to ensure a successful challenge by the honourable member for Blaxland. But the warfare has now become so open that they have actually pitched the firearms. They have fired all the bullets and they are into hand to hand combat as they come out of the trenches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had no better example of that than the events of the last couple of days with Senator Richardson attacking the Deputy Premier of Queensland because of his remarks that he thought the honourable member for Blaxland ought to be disciplined. Senator Richardson went on the attack last night at a branch meeting somewhere in New South Wales where he referred to the Queensland parliamentary organisation as boozers. He identified one of its members as a racial bigot and anti-Japanese. He was just getting warmed up, I gather, as far as the newspaper reports were concerned. In response, we have now had the Deputy Premier of Queensland coming back and referring to Messrs Keating and Richardson and other members of the New South Wales Right as having absolutely no concern about this nation at all. As long as they get their mate up, they are not interested in anything but themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, we have had other leading members of the ALP in recent days, like McLean, I think a vice-president of the ALP, making a very hardline statement that if Paul Keating were to become Prime Minister it would be a disaster nationally. This is the state of the warfare which has broken out in recent days, and some very detailed statements have been put on the record about the role of the relative parties in this fight. For example, this morning on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> Burns said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The thing about Mr Richardson of course is that he likes the personal attack because he can't defend what he is doing there. All these people that are rushing out to defend Keating now know that the New South Wales Right have made up their mind to destroy the Government if they can't get the leadership. They don't care about the Labor Party. They don't care about the rank and file. They don't care about the unemployed. They haven't done anything for the unemployed for years these fellows and it's about time someone told them straight, `We're sick of it'.</PARA>
<PARA>I could not agree more. The people of Australia are absolutely sick of the fact that the Prime Minister has not got the capacity to lead this country, has not got the capacity to pull his troops into line and has not got the capacity to deliver any significant reform in this country. It is now 18 months since the last election. The only thing he has done for the unemployed in that period is to increase their number. Under his own policies and by his own admission, those numbers are going to keep going up through to 11 or 11 1/4 per cent, as revealed in leaked documents, in the course of the next six to 12 months with no prospect of substantial improvement in the first half of the 1990s. Indeed, using the Government's own model and analysing its own forecasts, we see that the unemployment rate in Australia will still, under its policies, or its policy inactivity, be near 9 per cent in 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Australia are sick and tired, as Mr Burns accurately put it, of the fact that this Prime Minister is so weak and so indecisive and so incapable of carrying a divided Caucus that he is doing nothing to ease the pain of those who are unemployed. Indeed, some of the things he has done in order to keep his job&mdash;like the commitment to occupational superannuation&mdash;are simply going to add to the number of unemployed; another 100,000 jobs are going to be lost as a result of that initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look back over this Prime Minister's term in office, we see that he has been very conscious of his place in history, very conscious of the monuments that he might build and that historians might look back on and might judge him by in years to come. He has been the man of many monuments. Let us take a few minutes to look back over the period since the early 1980s when this man has been Prime Minister and look at some of the monuments he has attempted to create, all of which have been torn down either by his own inability to deliver or by the very deep-seated and poisonous factional wrangling that now characterises this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first great monument was, of course, the idea of consensus. Do honourable members remember that?  This man came in, in 1983, and he would do what nobody else could do&mdash;bring the country together. The only people he has really succeeded in bringing together in recent times are of course failed businessmen and bankrupts with their lawyers in court, or unemployed people meeting CES officers in order to get their dole cheque. That is his first monument&mdash;a failure as characterised by the size of the unemployed. There are nearly one million Australians presently unemployed and that number is likely to go higher. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second great monument of this man was that he would be remembered as the international statesman. We have just seen an example of this yesterday when he reported to this Parliament on his time at the Harare Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. He tried in a very distorting way to overstate his successes and, of course, his importance to that conference. So he is the international statesman. We will never forget some of the monuments he has left on the international stage. The MX missile crisis was a great start. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then of course there was the trouble with Fiji&mdash;two coups and he missed them both. Malaysia&mdash;sorry, he says that he has fixed Malaysia. We are yet to see what price he has paid to fix the breakdown in the relationship with Malaysia. Then, of course, there is the tussle with India and the sale of the Mirage jets to Pakistan&mdash;a very timely international initiative, one that will stand long as a monument to this man on the international stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have, of course, Papua New Guinea and the basic problems in Bougainville. We are so influential in PNG that we could not even be the honest broker when it came to the Bougainville negotiations; we could not even play a role. Then, of course, there is China&mdash;the love affair that became outright hatred when it was caught by the events of Tiananmen Square, and then the emotion and the rush of blood to the prime ministerial head when he allowed all those Chinese students to stay here, as if they were political refugees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was the Johnson Atoll debacle at the Pacific forum last year. One magazine article that I read referred to the Prime Minister trying to get back into that issue and back into a position of influence in PNG. It described him as something like a little sheepdog chasing around after Ratu Mara. There are all these outstanding monuments to the international statesman. It is always good to have an opportunity, when times get tough at home, to polish up the idea of being the international statesman, so he runs on that issue, does he not? It is always good for a run.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday we noticed that George Bush had the good sense to recognise that when one has problems at home one stays at home and fixes the problems. The Prime Minister's monuments as an international statesman will long stand him in poor stead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we go back to 1984, in the heat of the election campaign, what monument was there? Tax reform. Do honourable members remember that? All we got were the nasties. He did not deliver the reform and the people of Australia have suffered ever since with high marginal tax rates, massive disincentives to work and to save. An inability to carry the ACTU on that occasion destroyed yet another monument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was of course the monument of how the Prime Minister was going to create employment in this country. For a long time he boasted of the 1 1/2 million jobs that would stand through the tides of history as his monument to this country. He forgot to mention, of course, how he achieved the 1 1/2 million jobs&mdash;at the cost of about $70,000 in debt per job. Any fool can do that. Any fool can keep borrowing if there is no limit to the overdraft and can overheat the economy and create unsustainable jobs. But of course reality has come through. It is now quite clear that he cannot hang on to those jobs, and the one million unemployed are a constant reminder of the failure of the monument of employment under this man. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then of course the Prime Minister was going to be the world's greatest environmentalist. There was the world's greatest environmental statement. Remember that? Remember the one billion trees? How is he going? The only hole he has dug is for himself. So much for that monument. Now he has jettisoned the environmental movement. I see it has actually backed the contender, as recently as yesterday, in the leadership stakes. The environmentalists have given up on the Prime Minister because he could not deliver monuments of any substance to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next monument was to be micro reform. Was that not to be the monument to the third term of the Hawke-Keating Government? It was certainly micro. It is so micro that we have been searching the records for it and we have found absolutely no evidence to substantiate that. The Prime Minister knows we are right on that because Ministers are in here day after day getting dorothy dixers to try to demonstrate the fact they have made some progress with micro reform. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the House is a very good example of this. He was up here yesterday, or the day before, talking about how our waterfront was now matching best international practice. He was saying that we have the most efficient waterfront in the world. To give one example, the Minister for Transport and Communications cited the port of Melbourne. I was particularly struck by that example. Recently a ship, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">La Perouse</EMPHASIS>, left the port of Melbourne having been loaded at the rate of eight containers per hour. It went across the Tasman to New Zealand, to the port of Auckland&mdash;which, by New Zealand's own admission, is not anywhere near best international practice&mdash;where it was unloaded at the rate of 32 containers per hour. We are a long way short of New Zealand, and New Zealand in turn is a long way short of other international ports, ports of the capability of Singapore. It is absolute nonsense. It is living proof that micro reform has been all micro and no reform.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course there is the other monument&mdash;child poverty. Remember that? We were going to eliminate child poverty. This was another monument designated in an election campaign, in the 1987 policy speech. Of course, it was not long after that that the Government put interest rates up and, as the Archbishop pointed out to the Prime Minister, the increase in interest rates put more children into poverty in this country. This was another monument that came crashing down because of the inability of this man to actually deliver the policies required to achieve them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there was the wonderful monument that was built, probably the most outstanding and most memorable monument, the one to dishonesty and lack of integrity, associated with the Kirribilli conspiracy, the deal that was done to pass the prime ministership across to the honourable member for Blaxland&mdash;with their mates there. </PARA>

Big business, big unions even determine the prime ministership in this country. What a monument that has been because, for the last 18 months, the poor old honourable member for Blaxland has realised that the Prime Minister did not deliver that monument either. The Prime Minister hung on to that one. He was not going to let the honourable member for Blaxland in here. He cheated on him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, today we have before us the last of the great monuments. This one, in the Prime Minister's own words, was going to be it. This was the one that really mattered. This was the one that would be historic and monumental. This was new federalism. We have seen in the last few days the extent of the shambles that is new federalism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Premiers are desperately trying to get some sense back into this debate. They have been producing their own papers, dissatisfied with the work done by Commonwealth officials. They are putting genuine proposals. It has always been very difficult to deliver these in this country when there have been political overtones that have stopped economically rational and sensible decisions being taken. Yet this man has not got the courage to back a particular view. In fact, his view shifts depending on the circumstances. The Prime Minister goes into the Caucus and tells them, `You don't have to worry; there is no chance of income tax sharing with the States. Don't worry, I don't favour it; don't you worry about it'. And then out comes the document that shows that behind the scenes the process has been continuing. His officials, in fact, have been involved in the process and have been delaying meetings and creating circumstances where perhaps they might be able to salvage something. The last monument has again collapsed because of an incredible lack of leadership on the part of the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that it would be great, it would be entertaining, it would be genuine vaudeville if there were not nearly one million Australians unemployed left with absolutely no hope of getting back into the work force. In fact, their only hope is to be joined by others who will be unemployed in the course of the next 12 to 18 months as a result of the policies that this Government is pursuing. It might be great entertainment if it were not for the fact that we have the worst economic circumstances this country has seen in 60 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the Prime Minister that if he is interested in monuments then the real monument that he is going to leave is that of a lost generation of Australians. The current generation of Australians is about to leave a lower standard of living to their children than they in fact have enjoyed themselves. It is a very large price to pay for the vaudevillian approach to policy making that has been characteristic of this Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet the staggering thing is that right through the last 18 months he has had the support of the Opposition on a lot of these key policies. Do honourable members remember a year ago, 15 months ago, when he and the Treasurer and others attacked me for daring to float the idea of reform of Commonwealth-State financial relations? They used to come in here and talk about balloons going up&mdash;floating balloons, floating ideas&mdash;one of which the Prime Minister grabbed onto and tried to make one of his monuments? We were there; we were prepared to state a case. We were prepared to actually attend the Special Premiers Conference and to make a contribution. The Prime Minister knows that it is essential to get bipartisan support to make major change in Commonwealth-State relations generally and Commonwealth-State financial relationships in particular. We were genuine. We offered support. All the Government did was mock us. In fact, it ended up losing the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, other issues have come up&mdash;issues such as Medicare. Medicare is a shambles. The Medicare system is collapsing. We all know that some fundamental changes have to be made to the Medicare system in Australia. The Government made a tentative step in the last Budget; it went for a $3.50 co-payment. We did the right thing again; we offered bipartisan support. We stood there. In fact, I think we argued the case more strongly than the Government did. What happened? The Prime Minister could not deliver his Caucus again. He cannot deliver his Caucus now. He could not deliver his Caucus on that issue either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And so we could go on with all the major issues that have been on the agenda in the last 18 months. We have taken a responsible and, in many cases, a bipartisan position to try to get some genuine reform in place in this country, but this Prime Minister does not have the capacity to provide the leadership that is required in the worst and deepest recession in 60 years. Indeed, the entire focus is now on stopping the honourable member for Blaxland from getting his job. He does not care less about the nearly one million jobs of other Australians that have been sacrificed on behalf of all these monuments. He cares about keeping his own job, and he will do anything to ensure that he does. </PARA>

Let me contrast it with the abysmal record of those opposite when they were in government. It is not surprising that this Government has a large number of remarkable achievements to its credit because as far as we are concerned, as distinct from those opposite when they were in government, we have never regarded the conduct of international relations as a method of trying to advance political disputation within Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When members of the Opposition were in office, they had a prism in their eyes. When they looked at what was happening in this region, they asked themselves how they could engage themselves either directly in conflict or in other ways which would increase conflict within Australia. As distinct from that approach, we have seen the conduct of international relations as a responsibility on the part of the Government of this country to try to ensure that those less fortunate than ourselves should have their position advanced and, in so doing, increase the security of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that principle and according to that philosophy, let me refer to these facts, not opinions. First of all, it was this Government under my leadership which established the Cairns Group when the honourable member for Fremantle (Mr Dawkins) was the then Minister for Trade. This initiative, taken some five or six years ago, is still a significant and influential feature of the Uruguay Round at this stage. It has made a continuing positive contribution which has been recognised by the Europeans, by the United States and by the countries of this region and beyond. It is the voice of reason.

As a result of the position of Australia leading the Cairns Group, if there is, as increasingly likely it may be, a positive result out of the Uruguay Round to a very considerable extent, it will be due to the initiative in the first place by the honourable member for Fremantle in his former capacity as the Minister for Trade, followed by Minister Duffy and now followed through by Minister Blewett.

What was their approach? What was their philosophy? All they could talk about was the creeping spread of Chinese communism. They did not begin even to understand the historic and foundational differences between China and Vietnam. All they did&mdash;and in the process conscripted the young men of Australia to go to fight and die in Vietnam&mdash;was to preach conflict.

Let me say this: there is no greater monument of which I am proud as Prime Minister of the Hawke Government in the international sphere than that at this moment we have my Foreign Minister, Gareth Evans, being nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize. There can be no greater monument than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I read out in the House earlier this week the statement by the French Foreign Minister.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there we have it: the Cairns Group is a monument. In Cambodia there is peace under the Australian red book plan adopted by the Permanent Five; that is a monument of which I am proud. But I hope we do not stop there when we are talking about international monuments. We have created APEC. We did not, like those opposite did when they were in office, just talk in the vaguest terms about our interest being in this region. Through the hard slog and work of my Foreign Minister and Ministers assisting in the trade area, we have consistently, in a bilateral and in a multilateral fashion, sought to shape a reality for Australia where we are no longer seen, as we were for so long under conservative rule in this country, as a mere European outpost in the Antipodes. We have shown that we are really a country that will increasingly be enmeshed with Asia. In the result, we have seen that, through a series of bilateral relationships, we have increased very substantially our trading relationships with these countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we have gone the next step and created APEC. As honourable members will know, APEC was my personal initiative, which was followed through for me by my Foreign Minister.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does that mean? There has been talk about monuments, monuments that are just there for people to pay obeisance to mean nothing. The best sorts of monuments are those that, when one leaves office, one can look back at and say, `That institution there, which I created, is continuing year after year to improve the welfare of Australians in terms of their relationships with the whole Asia-Pacific Rim'. That is what APEC has done. The value of that continuing effective monument has been attested to by the leaders of ASEAN, the United States of America, Canada, Japan and South Korea. Just next week in Seoul at the ministerial APEC meeting, China, Taiwan and Hong Kong&mdash;the three Chinas that are referred to&mdash;will then be taken into APEC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite used the word `monument'; it is not my word. I have not gone around seeking to say, `That is the monument I have created'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, if I am able to say, firstly in regard to the Uruguay Round, that the outcome is better because of what we have done, then I regard that as a magnificent monument. If I am able to say that there is peace in Cambodia largely because of the Government which I have led, I regard that as a monument of which I am proud. If I can point to a continuing institution, APEC, which means that there is a greater stimulation of economic cooperation between the countries of the Asia-Pacific Rim, I say that that is a monument of which I am proud.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we got down to the statement of the Leader of the Opposition about our having failed to achieve in the micro-economic reform area. Was there argument attached to that? No. There was only one example taken of one ship on the Melbourne waterfront as though that, in itself, constitutes a measure of what is taking place on the waterfront; he did not look at the statistics that Conaust Pty Ltd has been putting out lately. I think that is a problem that this country has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is always the possibility&mdash;I do not think in the immediate future at all&mdash;that an opposition will become a government. Then there will need to be people capable of forming a front bench. The problem that we have with this Opposition is the utter immaturity of those who lead it. There are more mature people along the Opposition front bench, but leading the Opposition is a fifth-rate academic with a fourth-rate political presentation in this place. That is all. He has absolutely no conception of the breadth of the policy issues that he would have to confront if he were to become Prime Minister. We have an Opposition that ignores, of course, its own paltry record in all of the areas that it has chosen to discuss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hitler's armaments Minister, Speer, was finally released from a well-deserved, but not a sufficiently long, period of imprisonment in the late 1950s. He came out after about eight or nine years following his conviction at Nuremberg and was asked by a person from the press what he thought about the insidious, creeping developments of Soviet communism. The response of the former armaments minister, Speer, to this journalist was, `With a political record like mine, why would you want my views on anything?'. Indeed, why would we want the views of the adviser to the Government which immediately preceded ours?  It was a government of 7 1/2 years of complete failure in all the areas that it now suggests for us a test. The former government had one of the principal advisers to it, albeit a meritorious player, in the words of one of its erstwhile colleagues, Senator Stone, during the course of the development of the policy of that Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most appalling thing about the demonisation of the achievements of this Government by the Opposition and the propositions that it presents to the Australian electorate is that they are based on the deepest deceit. It is not a position which I would attribute to all members of the Opposition. For example, the other day the Opposition spokesman on industrial relations, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), when he made statements about unemployment, had the honesty to say that in the term of that Government&mdash;if the Opposition were successful at the next election&mdash;unemployment could not be expected to fall. It would remain well above 9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also had two brief moments of honesty a long time ago from the now Opposition Leader. In contemplating what he calls `reforms', there would necessarily be a substantial inducement of unemployment via that process. Given that he actually has no capacity to talk with the union movement or even to remotely understand what the Australian labour market is all about&mdash;the sorts of propositions that are encapsulated but by no means totally represented by his enjoyment of the prospect of placing troops on the waterfront&mdash;means the only way that the Opposition can get reform through, if it can be called reform in the policies of the Opposition, is by major destruction of the organisations that protect the living standards of the ordinary Australians in this community. That is its position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Well might the Leader of the Opposition begin his speech by ranting at the Prime Minister for his election slogan at the time he was first elected in 1983. Well might he criticise him for having a slogan of consensus, for basing a policy on a view that all Australians have to live in this country, are entitled to expect a decent standard of living, and are entitled to expect decent treatment in a democratic community. This is because its program is not capable of implementation without shattering the living standards and life expectations of very large numbers of Australians. It says, in sleight of hand in its policy, that it will have a set of propositions which will massively reduce the size of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of outlays, we now have probably the second or third lowest position of the OECD nations. One cannot reduce outlays further without seriously attacking some very damaged groups in this community. One has to go in after the pensioners; one has to go in after the unemployed. The Opposition should remember not to sell us this line in its moments of honesty. It knows, under its proposals, that unemployment will remain high for very long&mdash;not for nine months. Its proposal is to go in straight for the jugular of the most defenceless people in this community and, on their corpses, build the tax breaks for the wealthiest. That is the position that will be presented to us in a few weeks time by the Opposition when it comes to discussing how it will make way for its consumption tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition will incorporate a whole series of false assumptions on the product of privatisation and on the area of savings. But the horrifying thing is that the Opposition may&mdash;if it is ever elected&mdash;really attempt to do that. If it does, then the people of this country, as the people of New Zealand have, will rue the Government that has been placed upon them. I do not make that statement in a partisan way. The people of New Zealand rued the Labour Government that they elected and they have rued in spades the conservatives that they replaced them with. If there is one ideological homeland that the Opposition has sought and touted around this chamber, it is not in fact&mdash;as I thought it might be&mdash;Maggie Thatcher's Britain. At least she had a bit of brass, confidence and forthrightness about her. It has not chosen to model itself on Maggie Thatcher. God help us, it has chosen to model itself on New Zealand. That is an indication of the very smallness of the minds of Opposition members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Can one imagine Bob Menzies walking into this place as the Leader of the Opposition and making a speech like the one that was made here? Can one imagine Gough Whitlam walking into this place and making a speech like the one that we have heard from the Opposition Leader on a serious censure motion? Can one imagine Bill Hayden walking into this place and making a speech like the one that we have just heard from the Leader of the Opposition here? We have on our hands here a child&mdash;a political child&mdash; who is one of the newest members of this place with virtually no political background at all. He is going to move across this nation like an avenging angel, add to his CV and, when he finally retires to the south of France and is taking his gin slings with the rest of the teams in the merchant banking community whom he will have rejoined by then, be able to say, `Well, back there in the 1990s, last century, I did govern a rather paltry little place for a while, but one went on to bigger things as one moved on to the bourses in the Northern Hemisphere'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is his position. He is visiting; he is passing through. He will devastate this nation if he gets a chance. He cannot stand up here in this chamber against a Prime Minister who has managed to be elected more times as Prime Minister than anyone bar Bob Menzies. The Leader of the Opposition cannot simply dismiss the record of the Prime Minister with  reference to the foreign policy area by naming a series of countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then those opposite go on to talk about micro-economic reform and simply dismiss it by saying, `Yes, you haven't achieved it'. Honourable members require more intellectual bottom than that. If honourable members opposite are actually going to give this country any form of effective leadership, they require a capacity to argue it. To give some hope to the people of this country, they require a capacity to meet people at their points of need. Those opposite cannot. They will dress up their package and point out to the people, despite what they now say, that the GST will not produce unemployment, that it will employ people and that in the wholesale sales tax area there are some goods and services in every day use that are taxed; and they will reduce the taxes in those areas but place a tax on the necessities of life, the means by which people survive. However, what honourable members opposite will not say to the people is that they will reduce the taxes on luxury goods such as Mercedes, Ferraris and jewellery to the very level of taxes on food. They will attempt, as they always have, to fool the ordinary people of this country into carrying the burden of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not about imposing tax burdens on the rich in this country; we are about creating equitable tax systems. Opposition members came into this place and talked about whether there were any monuments around. I will name one or two, although I do not think it is sensible for any government or opposition to talk in terms of monuments; it is childish. The life of the nation goes on. The nation changes character. The past is a foreign country. Each generation comes through and does its best with it and passes it on to the next generation. None of us are here timelessly; we all move on. We do not talk about monuments. However, the Opposition introduced the topic of monuments, so let us go through that in regard to taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members opposite say that they wish to assist us to implement an unfair taxation system. We say to honourable members opposite, `No thanks. We do not wish to implement an unfair taxation system on your behalf'. When we introduced a fair taxation system&mdash;when we introduced capital gains taxes and fringe benefits taxes, and when we asset tested welfare&mdash;honourable members opposite were dragged kicking and screaming to finally vote for us on that a couple of weeks ago. Their leader had to come in and enforce unity on honourable members opposite. Every one of those particular taxation propositions was carried over the dead political bodies of the successive leaders of honourable members opposite, as they fought us tooth and nail on every one of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What it did enable us to do was to lower the top marginal tax rates. It also enabled us to lower those rates further down. It gave ordinary businessmen in this community a modicum of a feeling that they would be at least prepared to pay their taxes&mdash;none of them like to pay their taxes&mdash;and not go through massive evasion loops as was done in the 1970s. In contrast to that, I ask honourable members opposite to remember their own taxation record. Off the back of the introduction of fuel taxes in this country, honourable members opposite permitted to flourish a massive evasion of income and company taxes. That was their last achievement. That was actually not overt; they did not actually announce that as a policy objective. That was actually nearly what was achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now honourable members opposite have actually announced the policy objective. They will now permit massive changes to the upper levels of the taxation systems and bring in underneath an imposition on the ordinary people of this country. But there is one other thing. Honourable members opposite will say to ordinary people, to the pensioners, the unemployed and others, that they will adjust social benefits in this country to ensure that the very worst off do not get the impost of an increased tax burden as a result of that. They will ask those poor people to believe that, at a time when they are massively slashing social expenditures in order to be able to put this policy in place, they will be reliably compensated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one thing going for us&mdash;there has been a massive shift in the inflation rate and inflationary expectations in this country, which bodes well for the people. There are many achievements of this Government, but that is one which honourable members opposite always sought and never achieved. That is an achievement which has not come off the recession; it has come off wages policy. That is what has produced the change in the inflation level. Honourable members opposite will take that and blow it up against a wall. They will change the inflationary expectations in the wrong direction. If those opposite get into office they will place this country back on the old treadmill which we were on for years and which will ensure that we will never improve our international competitiveness. This is a shameful motion. It is being pursued shamelessly by the ridiculous people who proposed it. We need discuss it no more. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;For the information of honourable members, I present the exposure draft of the Broadcasting Services Bill and an accompanying explanatory document outlining the rationale behind the provisions contained in it. I am making a statement on the overall directions of key provisions in the Bill and its status.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The draft legislation is the culmination of the most significant effort in several decades to finally bring the Broadcasting Act 1942 up to date and, more importantly, to establish a regulatory framework for the broadcasting industry that will serve Australia into the next century. The Government's micro-economic reform agenda has already achieved landmark reforms in telecommunications, domestic aviation, the national rail system and the waterfront. Now it is time to turn to the antiquated, even nightmarish, legislation that regulates the broadcasting industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, broadcasting is different from some of the other service industries; it does not have the same impact on economic efficiency. Nevertheless, in the future it will be of very great significance in the development of information and entertainment services as technology drives communications industries together. This draft legislation is not only intended as a basis for dealing with the problems in broadcasting caused by an overconcentration on legalism. At the same time it aims to be more technology neutral, dealing with broadcasting services, whether delivered by radio transmitters, satellites or cable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill does not represent a finalised government position. The Bill has been developed following a long period of review and analysis&mdash;a review that was initiated in response to a perceived need for change from both within government and the industry. It forms the basis on which wide-ranging public consultation can be undertaken. Following that consultation process, which I will outline shortly, and in the light of views expressed, the Government will be in a position to settle the final form of the Bill for introduction into the Parliament during the autumn sittings in 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill before you provides a coherent regulatory framework based on a need to accommodate the future, not a desire for change for change's sake. It continues to recognise that broadcasting is an integral part of national identity and culture and of our democratic society. While this means that there must continue to be obligations placed on broadcasters, the Bill has nonetheless been developed in the context of the Government's broader micro-economic reform agenda, and seeks to promote sensible competition and structural adjustment in the industry, allowing it to take advantage of new technologies as they become available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1983 there have been some 20 substantial amendments to the Broadcasting Act 1942. Further ad hoc amendments will only add to its complexity and the potential for more loopholes to be created and exploited. We need a new Act capable of allowing the broadcasting industry to respond to both the complexities of the modern marketplace and innovations arising out of technological developments. Continuing to inhibit the natural development of this industry through unnecessarily cumbersome regulation will disadvantage consumers and be detrimental to the longer term prospects for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The limitations of the current Act have constrained development and structural adjustment of the broadcasting industry, and thus diversity for consumers. It has blinkered us to the technologies looming on the horizon, allowing us to only slowly accommodate technologies that have been available for years elsewhere. Despite the consensus on the need for change, it has to be said that there have been predictable pressures to protect those parts of the current regime that serve specific interests. I have been mindful of the need to balance the diverse, and often conflicting, aspirations of interested groups in developing a regulatory framework to serve the public interest in all its dimensions&mdash;social, cultural and economic&mdash;while also meeting the needs of a changing and growing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Worldwide, nations are having to come to terms with new demands on broadcasting, in particular in the commercial sector. The advent of satellite broadcasting, with its transborder possibilities, coupled with new technologies such as digital audio broadcasting that have the potential to remove scarcity of the spectrum for radio, will irretrievably influence the diversity and types of services available to consumers. We cannot and must not continue to ignore these changes. If we do, we run the risk of having them externally imposed, or of missing out altogether on development opportunities for our own industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This statement and the draft Bill represent a comprehensive response by this Government to three reports by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. The reports are entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Role and Functions of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Role and Functions of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal&mdash;Supplementary Report</EMPHASIS>, and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">To Pay or Not to Pay and other new broadcasting-related services</EMPHASIS>. These reports made a valuable contribution to the development of the draft Bill and I thank the members of the Committee for their efforts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides a consistent, yet flexible, regulatory framework within which the industry will be able to accommodate this change yet operate with confidence and a sense of predictability, while also providing for proper commercial and public accountability, consistent with our international obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the interests of regulatory certainty, and so as not to unnecessarily impede commercial operations, it is important that regulation of broadcasting services should, to the greatest extent possible, be consistent with wider commercial law. However, it is recognised that, where regulation seeks to achieve specific government objectives for broadcasting services, this cannot always be the case. For example, to meet our objective of keeping these services firmly in Australian hands, foreign ownership laws that are more stringent than for any other industry are applied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, given the limited competition in the television industry, it is important to ensure that any special provisions that recognise and allow the wider commercial market to operate should not do so in a way that would further limit that competition. Mechanisms would include requiring prior approval of any commercial transaction that would, incidental to the objectives of that transaction, temporarily breach limits in the Act, and the imposition of strict time limits to rectify it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not propose to detail the provisions of the Bill. The Bill itself and the explanatory essay accompanying it provide a far better basis on which people can make their judgments. There are, however, one or two features that I would draw to the attention of honourable members. For the first time broadcasting legislation will contain objects that set out clearly the outcomes the Parliament wishes to see from its role in the regulation of broadcasting. This will assist the formulation of decisions and guide the ongoing administration of the Act by the regulatory authority and enforcement through the courts. These objects are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">to provide a regulatory environment that will facilitate the development of a broadcasting industry in Australia that is efficient, competitive and responsive to consumer needs;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">to promote the availability to audiences throughout Australia of a diverse range of radio and television services offering entertainment, education and information;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">to encourage diversity in control of commercial television broadcasting licences and commercial radio broadcasting licences;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">to ensure that Australians have effective control of licences of that kind;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">to promote the role of broadcasting services in developing and reflecting a sense of national identity, character and culture;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">to promote the provision of high quality and innovative programming by providers of commercial broadcasting services;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">to encourage providers of commercial and community broadcasting services to be responsive to the need for a balanced coverage of matters of public interest and for an appropriate coverage of matters of local significance;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">to encourage providers of broadcasting services to respect prevailing community attitudes to matters of taste and decency; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">to encourage the provision of appropriate means for addressing complaints about broadcasting services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each aspect of the Bill reflects these various components to a greater or lesser degree. A further feature of the Bill is the emphasis on dealing with each type of service in a consistent, but not necessarily uniform, fashion. This approach recognises that various media and the information and entertainment services within them have a different power to influence the Australian public. For example, free-to-air broadcasting is more pervasive and persuasive than a restricted narrowcast service&mdash;thus the regulations that apply must reflect these varying abilities to influence. </PARA>
<PARA>Hence where new services are demonstrably different from mainstream broadcasting, they should not be subjected to the same degree of regulation. However, where a service is within the parameters of traditional broadcasting, the appropriate regulation should apply, regardless of how the service is delivered to consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The control provisions are a key reform of the Bill. The concept of control is now fairly well developed in corporate law. It rightly focuses on those in a position to exercise control over significant aspects of a company. It accepts that control can arise through a variety of mechanisms, including voting rights, contractual rights of direction or personal influence. Consistent with this approach, the provisions of the Bill focus on the important dimension of control of a licence where direct ownership limits are only one factor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They recognise the increasing complexity of corporate structures in the global marketplace. They therefore move from the rigidity of attempting to describe every possible ownership or control structure&mdash;the approach of the current Act that creates opportunities for avoidance&mdash;to laying down unambiguous conditions and limits that must be observed by licensees. The Bill then confers on the regulatory authority, the Australian Broadcasting Authority, the power to investigate and act on any suspected artifice or arrangement that may seek to contravene them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Specific limits on matters such as holdings of equity and voting interests must be set where ownership itself is an issue and to provide prima facie guidance as to levels that could lead to control. While the numbers are open to debate, I believe that the Bill provides a robust framework to enforce those limits once set by the Government. It will ensure that the spirit as well as the letter of the law is met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The print media inquiry is currently considering foreign and cross-media ownership. Any finding that could affect broadcasting services or cross-media limits will be considered in the context of this Bill. The innovative approach to control in the Bill may in fact provide some useful ideas for the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill makes specific provision for the regulation of pay TV and embodies the Government's decisions on ownership that I announced on 9 October. However, as a new industry with an as yet undetermined structure or market base, it could jeopardise the industry's viability before it began if we were to lock in specific limits before we had the opportunity to discover more details of that market. This will enable appropriate levels to be determined by the Government following the consultative phase for inclusion in either the Bill or the licensing arrangements and then enforced by the ABA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides for a more transparent and accountable planning regime for new services; for streamlined administrative processes in regard to licensing of services, particularly in relation to renewal of licences and inquiries procedures; and a more flexible and effective sanctions regime. Most importantly, the Bill maintains support for Australian content, quality children's programming and observance of community attitudes towards taste and decency. It also ensures that commercial and programming control remains firmly in Australian hands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned earlier, the Bill is not the Government's final position on the new legislation, but an exposure draft intended to facilitate community consideration of the issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no artifice in that; that is exactly what it is. It is not a Bill endorsed by Cabinet. We are here to hear the views of all those who wish to contribute to the debate on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A widespread process of consultation will be undertaken over the next three months on several fronts. I intend to make myself available to speak at a number of major conferences on issues arising out of the review of broadcasting and to receive the views of any interested parties who want to make a submission. Senior departmental officials will be available to explain the Bill at relevant major conferences and seminars held over the next few months, as well as conduct an intensive program of bilateral discussions with all parties on issues arising out of the Bill. My Department has established a streamlined process to receive requests for the relevant documents and to answer queries about the issues. The Caucus subcommittee on broadcasting, chaired by the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), will be initiating widespread community consultation on the Bill and related documentation, and will report to me in February next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill and supporting documentation are now available for comment and response by formal submission until the end of February 1992. Contact officers in my Department who will coordinate responses are identified in the material accompanying the Bill. My staff have of course put a lot of work into this. The relevant officers are in serried ranks above us, and I thank them for the work they have put into this, which has been an extraordinary labour not of love, I suspect, but of something else, over the last few months. I think they have done a fine job on it. I look forward to the vigorous debate that will ensue over the next few months and the outcome in the form of new, relevant and forward looking broadcasting legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I table the Second Annual Report to Parliament on the International Development Cooperation Program and the First Comprehensive Environmental Audit of the Australian International Development Cooperation Program, and I will make a brief statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1989 review of AIDAB by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade recommended that an annual statement be made on the aid program and the extent to which it has met its objectives over the year. This is the second such statement. The first was tabled last year by Senator Evans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reviewing the events of the past year, I should first note that ministerial responsibility for the aid program was transferred to me, under the new title of Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, from 1 February 1991. This addition to my portfolio responsibilities has given me considerable professional and personal pleasure. Overseas aid is an area in which I have held a very special interest throughout my adult life. Indeed, it is my firm conviction that the quality of any developed country's aid program provides an excellent measure of its wider characteristics. If it is a good international citizen, it is generally benign to its own. If it shows compassion abroad, it will show even more at home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I submit that by any measure, Australia has passed the test of good international citizenship in 1991, despite the unprecedented demands that have been placed upon us. Australia's aid program has been stretched to its limits during this period of enormous global upheaval. But its ability to respond to rapidly changing events efficiently and effectively has not faltered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The highlights of 1991 for Australia's aid program largely reflect the significant events which have taken place across the world during the past 12 months&mdash;and that, in itself, is evidence that we are both relevant and flexible in our overseas development activities. Most of these events are set out in greater detail in the document that I have tabled, but some deserve special mention here. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Aid Volume</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most significant highlight of the year has been the Government's decision to increase total official development assistance (ODA) by more than $50 million to $1,314 million&mdash;an increase in real terms of one per cent. Hopefully, this is the first step in pursuit of the goal set for us by the ALP National Conference in June to raise aid to 0.4 per cent of GNP by 1995. The Budget increase is of such significance because it allows us to expand our commitment in priority areas without decreasing activities in other areas of the program. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Increased Emergency Assistance</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, this increase in funding has enabled us to maintain emergency, relief and refugee assistance at the record amount of $64 million allocated last financial year. This week marked the fortieth anniversary of the founding of the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Australia's support for UNHCR and other organisations striving to relieve the plight of refugees is now more pressing than ever. There are currently more than 15 million refugees in the world, and this number is growing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last financial year, we provided over $2 million in emergency assistance for the victims of the cyclone in Bangladesh and over $14m to alleviate the dire situation in the Horn of Africa. During the year, we provided $11m to help those displaced by the conflict in Afghanistan. Almost $8m was given in response to victims of the Gulf war, and $7m for Mozambicans who have had to flee from the fighting in that country. Over $4m was provided to displaced Cambodians, both within Cambodia and on the Thai border. Another $1.3m was made available only two weeks ago to help repatriate displaced Khmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This financial year, the Government has also made over $1m available to help victims of the floods in Cambodia. In the last three months, the Government has made $200,000 available for urgently needed relief supplies for victims of the conflict in Yugoslavia. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">South Africa</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has been at the forefront in providing assistance as apartheid is dismantled in South Africa. Development cooperation with southern Africa provides a tangible demonstration of Australia's commitment to assist in this process. We are now well into a second triennial pledge of $110m for southern Africa and the front-line states. In June this year the Government announced that Australia would provide $2.3m to assist the anti-apartheid community in South Africa develop its capacity for economic planning. This is in recognition of the considerable economic challenges that will confront any government elected once apartheid is finally scrapped. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Cambodia-Vietnam</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Cambodia and Vietnam we have a reputation as a respected intermediary in negotiating a solution to the conflict in Cambodia. The Government is determined that our contribution to the peace process will be complemented by assistance to rehabilitate Indo-China. We have recently decided to resume direct bilateral aid to Vietnam, and the formation of the Supreme National Council in Cambodia has opened the way for direct bilateral assistance to that war torn country. To date, $6.4m has been allocated for each of Cambodia and Vietnam in 1991-92 for aid provided through non-government organisations and multilateral agencies. This will consolidate the goodwill generated by our important role in the process that led to the peace agreement signed in Paris last month by all parties to this conflict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The involvement of Australian businesses in the development cooperation program has been one of our real successes. Following a major restructuring of the development import finance facility, DIFF, during the year, funding for this program has been increased by $9m to $93m in 1991-92. This scheme combines development funds with export credits provided by the Export Finance and Insurance Commission, EFIC, for Australian companies bidding for development projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this way DIFF helps to ensure that the program is identifiably Australian, raising the profile of Australian products and skills in developing countries. By encouraging Australian companies to prove themselves, DIFF has opened up opportunities for considerable follow-on business for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Environment</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important measure of the quality of our development cooperation is its ecological sustainability. Environmental issues must be taken into account if development is to continue in the longer term. This does not mean that we should forsake development. Indeed, it will continue to be vital if millions of people are to escape the grip of poverty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we must also be concerned about the quality of development. As I emphasised in January when launching the interim policy statement, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ecologically Sustainable Development in International Development Cooperation</EMPHASIS>, environmental degradation, both in our region and globally, is an important concern for Australia. We can assist developing countries to adopt strategies which place fewer demands on the environment. The environment assistance program for developing countries announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in 1989 was effectively quadrupled in this year's Budget, and $80m will now be provided over the next four years. This will include funding for Australia's contribution to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer and the global environment facility of the World Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's commitment to ecologically sustainable development was also underlined during the year by the commissioning of a comprehensive environmental audit of the development cooperation program, which I am also tabling today. The report was conducted by Emeritus Professor Derek Ovington, and meets a commitment given by the Government in response to the Senate committee report on aid and the environment. It provides an overview of all activities undertaken by AIDAB, including over 760 bilateral projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The release of the audit is timely. It provides clear evidence that environmental concerns are being progressively incorporated into the program. Professor Ovington and his team have made a number of useful suggestions which I am happy to commend to AIDAB and others associated with the development cooperation program. The report also gives substance to a record of understanding between AIDAB and the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories. This was recently endorsed by both myself and the Minister, Mrs Kelly. It acknowledges that under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974, the international development cooperation program is subject to the same rigorous process of environmental assessment as projects in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reducing poverty in the Third World is the central humanitarian challenge that is today confronting us all. I emphasised this in launching the paper <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Poverty Alleviation Through Australian Development Cooperation</EMPHASIS> in May this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When launching the paper, I announced a broad poverty alleviation strategy to be followed by AIDAB.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The poverty alleviation strategy now being implemented by AIDAB will include increasing the proportion of aid directly targeted to raising the ability of the poor to take advantage of the economic opportunities provided by growth. The Government continues to recognise that non-government organisations are an effective mechanism for delivering aid directly to the poor. During 1990-91, almost $67m of our development cooperation was channelled through NGOs. This was an increase of over $11m on 1989-90. Of this, the women in development fund was doubled to almost $0.8m in 1990-91. The Government is now reviewing the extent to which women in development objectives have been incorporated into the wider program. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Agricultural research has improved the lives of the poor. The green revolution in South Asia was possible largely because of work by organisations such as the World Bank's Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research, CGIAR, and the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research, ACIAR. Research carried out by these institutions has also been important in re-establishing rice production in war torn areas of Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government this year increased funding for ACIAR by almost $2m to $18.9m and for international agricultural research organisations by over $1m to $7.4m. As well as the benefits that this brings to developing countries, Australia stands to benefit substantially from cooperation in international agricultural research. Australian farmers have had access to wheat genotypes derived by these organisations, and the value to Australia of consequent productivity increases has been conservatively estimated at $2 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, surprising though it may seem to some, growth in the agricultural sector in developing countries is also good for Australian farmers. Improved agricultural productivity in developing countries raises overall growth, boosting urban incomes and generating demand for Australian exports such as wheat and beef. Australian wheat exports to Indonesia, for instance, increased by over 50 per cent in real terms from 1980-81 to 1989-90. This is at the same time as agricultural output in Indonesia grew by over one-third. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Human rights are an important aspect of development. Political freedoms can improve the ability of the poor to engage in productive activities and can spur economic development. By broadening Australia's relationship with developing countries, aid can increase the opportunities for Australia to raise human rights issues. Australia understands that fundamental human aspirations may be recognised in different ways. But the rights defined in the International Bill of Rights are universal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe, however, that development cooperation should be automatically conditional on recipients becoming more democratic. This does not mean that the Government is not concerned about human rights. Australia has been more outspoken than many other countries on this issue. Last year we raised more than 460 human rights cases in over 82 different countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be nice to be able to believe that suspending aid would automatically force offending governments to recognise fundamental human rights. Such an idea has a strong visceral appeal. The Government is prepared to suspend aid if the situation warrants it. We have suspended the program to Burma and have stopped new activities in China following events in July 1989. But the reality is that, in many cases, suspending or reducing aid can harm most those who are already repressed, without placing any significant pressure on governments to reform. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most interesting aspects of the year for me has been to examine together the aid and trade issues arising from the development cooperation program, and in the portfolio as a whole. In helping countries to develop, the development cooperation program plays an essential role in furthering the Government's wider foreign policy objectives. Aid has real and very substantial benefits for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Simple slogans like `charity begins at home' fail to appreciate the nature of development cooperation. Aid is not charity. By cooperating with countries to promote development in the Third World, we promote direct Australian interests. In this sense, I believe that `development cooperation' is more applicable to the program than `aid'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should make it clear that I do not believe our development cooperation is in any way devalued by frankly acknowledging that the program serves tangible Australian interests. What is important is that there is a coincidence between moral and prudential interests. If the program did not effectively promote development, we would lose many benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is located within a region of developing countries. Our fundamental security interests&mdash;whether economic, environmental or political&mdash;are inextricably tied up with the political stability and economic development of countries in the Asia-Pacific region. Development cooperation with the countries in our region and beyond strengthens Australia's security. </PARA>
<PARA> <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Economic Security</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the economic front, development cooperation brings both broad and specific benefits. Although it is the specific benefits which are more tangible, it is perhaps the broader benefits which are more important. In the longer term, Australia's international economic security is heavily dependent on successful growth and development in our region. Some countries in Asia have done well in recent decades, but we should not assume too easily that the economic environment in our region will remain favourable. In a number of countries in our region&mdash;in the Philippines, Cambodia, Vietnam, Burma and Papua New Guinea&mdash;the obstacles to sustained economic development remain substantial. Recent economic successes have given rise to new challenges. There have been rapid increases in the demand for energy, growing environmental problems and rising employment expectations on the part of young people as education standards steadily improve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in Australia have a shared interest with the people of the Asian region in seeing strong, sustainable and equitable economic development proceed in the next few decades. Of course, Australia's development cooperation will not guarantee that this broad objective will be achieved, but it will certainly help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Assistance can be effectively targeted to overcome structural obstacles that constrain a country's ability to generate wealth. By contributing to the investment capital available in developing countries, our development cooperation can provide the physical and institutional infrastructure, such as the roads, bridges and energy supplies necessary for economic growth. By providing education and health care, we can assist people to make the most of opportunities for productive work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can also assist governments to implement the macro-economic, micro-economic and institutional strengthening measures necessary to achieve stronger growth. Through our involvement with multilateral development banks, such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, we help to finance loans to assist developing countries introduce structural adjustment measures. In addition, the creation of a Pacific Economic Policy Section in AIDAB has enhanced Australia's capacity to make a well-informed contribution to policy dialogue with the countries of this region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In working to increase growth, development cooperation does not stand alone. It is actively complemented by the Government's trade policy. During the year, Australia has energetically advocated a greater level of coherence between the aid and trade policies of donor countries. We have worked to ensure that the high levels of protection in developed countries, especially in agriculture, do not take away with one hand the benefits that development cooperation provides with the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By encouraging sustainable and broad-based growth in Asia, the development cooperation program provides new opportunities for an increasingly outward looking Australia. As developing countries in Asia especially grow, so too does their demand for our exports. Australia's trade with the six ASEAN countries, for instance, has increased dramatically as these countries have experienced economic success. Our trade with these countries jumped from $3.75 billion five years ago to $9.8 billion in 1990-91. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our involvement with multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and the specialised United Nations agencies provides further export opportunities for Australia. The $30 billion spent on goods and services by these institutions every year offer promising opportunities for efficient Australian companies. We need to work harder in this area to ensure that we reap the full gains. But these organisations already buy more from Australia than we contribute to them. </PARA>
<PARA> <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Transnational Problems</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cooperating with developing countries to solve transnational problems is a second area from which Australia and developing countries both have much to gain. As I emphasised earlier, the Government has been active to ensure that we promote ecologically sustainable development. Pollution in our region and the emission of ozone depleting gases are serious concerns for Australia. Similarly, cooperation on issues such as narcotics benefits all of the countries involved. Valuable assistance in law enforcement to stem the trade in narcotics has been provided to Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines. </PARA>
<PARA> <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Political Security </EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, development cooperation has important political benefits. For reasons of fundamental national security, Australia needs to build more diverse and substantive links with neighbouring countries. Development cooperation is an important element in this, as effectiveness reviews of the China, Cambodian and Indonesian programs have found. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The geographic focus of the program reflects a solid commitment by Australia to build ties with the countries of our region. Over one-quarter of Australian development cooperation is with Papua New Guinea. Including our assistance to Papua New Guinea, Australia is the largest donor to the Pacific countries. We are also the fourth largest donor to ASEAN. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now more than ever, our development cooperation with the Asia-Pacific region is likely to be important. The need for massive financial assistance to eastern Europe and the Soviet Union has raised the very real fear among developing countries that aid will be diverted. We have an important interest that this does not occur. But if we are to be taken seriously, our own cooperation with this region must not decline. This does not mean that we have ignored the pressing humanitarian needs in eastern Europe. We have continued the Australian program of training to eastern Europe, and have extended this program to include the Soviet Union. We will contribute $45m over five years to the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. But this has been additional to our development cooperation; it has not been at the expense of developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA> <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Conclusion </EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Initiatives by the Government during 1991 have significantly improved the high quality of our development cooperation. We can be confident that our development cooperation is a positive contribution towards improving the lives of many in the Third World. This is only half the story. The development cooperation program reflects the humanity of the Australian people. But the Government has firmly in view the vital national interests that are served by helping the countries in our region to develop. The development cooperation program is an essential element in Australia's broader foreign policy. Cooperating to encourage development has substantial benefits for Australians as well as for people in developing countries. In the long term, development cooperation is an investment in Australia's economic, environmental and political security. Development cooperation helps each one of us.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In responding on behalf of the Opposition to the speech of the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Dr Blewett), I first congratulate him on his appointment as the Minister responsible for Australia's overseas aid program. I am gratified by his ongoing commitment and personal interest. As a member of the then Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, which undertook the review of the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau and Australia's overseas aid program, I was one of those who enthusiastically encouraged the Government to appoint a Minister responsible for development cooperation, as we on that Committee called it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We set out the reasons why we believed it was so important that there be such a Minister. We saw it as being particularly important for Australia to maintain its relations with the South Pacific. We noted that Australia was a major aid contributor to these countries where this was the major part of their economy. We saw it as being important in sending a powerful signal of Australia's commitment to regional prosperity and peace at a time when relations in the South Pacific were more complex and volatile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could read at great length from the report of the parliamentary Committee enjoining the Government to make such an appointment. I am delighted that the Minister holds that appointment. I add, however, that when the Government responded to the Committee's report, it told us it had no intention of making such an appointment and argued rather fulsomely against it. That perhaps shows that governments are capable of learning the error of their ways. The Government suggested that it may cause some conflicts and difficulties with the principal Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans), and the joint Department for which this Minister is responsible. I think those arguments had less weight, but obviously when the Government responded to the Committee's report at the time, it thought they had some weight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not intend to delay the House because I have little time to respond to this <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Second Annual Report to Parliament on Australia's International Development Cooperation Program</EMPHASIS>. I thought I would look at the basis upon which we are receiving this report. The Minister is no doubt aware that this arose from the review by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. The Committee spent a great deal of time dealing with its concerns about the effectiveness of the aid program and about accountability. The Committee, which had been asked to undertake a review of Australia's overseas aid program following the Jackson Committee report, was seriously critical of the extent to which evaluation of aid programs occurs and is conducted. It was anxious that AIDAB should organise its staffing to undertake a significant volume of evaluation activities and it was certainly of the view that that should not cause reductions in program management or policy capacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee recommended in a rather full way that the Government should have a review which is presented to Parliament on a regular basis. The Committee's resolution was in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee strongly supports the proposition that, the Minister should make an annual Parliamentary statement on the Aid Program, and the extent of its success in achieving all its objectives.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government in this case said, `The Government agrees that such an annual parliamentary statement on the aid program would be appropriate'. It would be perhaps desirable&mdash;I do not mean this as a trite comment&mdash;for the Minister to look at what the Committee said about what it had in mind in terms of accountability. If one measures this statement against the Committee's requirement, I regret to say to the Minister that the statement does not fulfil that need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee noted that AIDAB reports to the Senate at Estimates committees, that it had been subject to periodic reviews and that it has an annual budget paper and a chapter in the Department's annual report which has some useful information on expenditure initiatives. It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But they are inadequate documents for full accountability to the public. Neither provides a comprehensive or analytical discussion of policy. A recurring proposal, originally contained in the 1982 report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts is that the Minister should make . . . a statement on the conduct and policy basis of the Aid Program. . . </PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Committee&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">supports this proposition. The utility of the Ministerial statement depends to some extent on AIDAB making more effort to identify program successes and failures. While administrative issues are still the easiest things for a bureaucracy to talk about, they are not the matters which most concern the community or its representatives.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It must `tell us how our aid money is allocated in terms which reveal the development impact of our aid spending'. . . </PARA>
<PARA>I have to say that, while I am delighted that the Minister is in the position that he is in and is going to devote the time and effort to this work, I certainly hope that he will take up that Committee report's recommendations and my reminder of the need for such accountability. In the report that he has presented&mdash;not in his speech&mdash;I find only two elements which meet what the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee had in mind, and they are in the discussion on pages 17 and 18 dealing with improving program delivery and review mechanisms. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of this, Vision 91&mdash;AIDAB's corporate objective for the year&mdash;has concentrated on aid quality.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major initiative during the year has been to improve planning and design of the program. The processes by which AIDAB's country and global programs are developed have been revised. All forms of assistance to individual countries will be integrated within an overall strategy.</PARA>
<PARA>It also states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The key feature of the new arrangements include the introduction of decision points at the end of each stage of an activity. This will avoid poor projects being continued and provide a better audit trail.</PARA>
<PARA>Over the page it states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Considerable efforts have been made to strengthen the review process. . . Program effectiveness reviews were initiated in 1990.</PARA>
<PARA>They were in relation to China, Indonesia and Cambodia. It also states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A summary of lessons . . . has also been published.</PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought that those documents, along with the document that the Minister has tabled today&mdash;a very substantial and useful document in relation to one aspect of accountability, that is, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Annual Audit of the Environment in the Australian International Development Cooperation Program</EMPHASIS>- would have been tabled. As part of my own preparation&mdash;as the Minister knows, one has only an hour or so to undertake preparation for such a debate&mdash;I thought that I should seek out these reviews and have a look at them because they were not presented to me as part of the documentation for today. I was told that nobody in the AIDAB library was able to assist me. They were not aware of the documents and could not make them available. I checked with the shadow Minister and he was not able to make them available to me. I hope that, in future when these matters are being looked at, consideration will be given to including not only a detailed statement of the sort that the parliamentary Committee envisaged but also all of the review documents so that the Parliament can be properly informed and prepared for a detailed debate on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accountability is a matter of very considerable moment. In the short time that is left, I want to take the opportunity today to deal with a couple of matters that have been raised in the Minister's statement to the Parliament&mdash;a statement which has been largely assertion and very much a disappointing statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first matter that I would like to take up is the comments in relation to aid volume. I do so against the context of what the Minister would remind me is my own Party's view that, in the present disastrous economic situation that this country faces, aid programs can no more be quarantined from government expenditure review than can other programs. The Minister has noted that this year the Government has increased by more than $50m the $1,314m that is allocated as part of Australia's overseas aid program. He did not point out, but it was discovered further in his statement, that $20m of that additional $50m is money that was to be allocated for global environmental programs with which the Government is involved. On page 6 of his statement it was made clear that $80m is to be provided over four years as Australia's contribution to the Montreal Protocol on ozone depleting substances and the global environment facility of the World Bank. It seems to me that, when one recognises that those fundings are being made out of the aid budget, it makes the increase less meaningful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the point that I want to make in relation to this, and what we find disappointing about the Government's presentation in this area from time to time, is that the Government has made many reductions in Australia's overseas aid over time&mdash;at a time when Australia was comparatively more prosperous than it is now&mdash;and they were cuts that were made in the context of a government which had given ongoing commitments to maintain aid at real levels. The difference between the Government's position and the Opposition's is that we are spelling out frankly the position that we take on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point that I want to make relates to the issue of additional new developments that the Government has outlined, particularly in relation to Cambodia and Vietnam. All of us anxiously watched what has occurred in relation to Cambodia and we certainly desire that the Government's intervention, such as it has been, will assist in ensuring that there is an enduring peaceful solution. We watch hopefully for that. We do have considerable doubts still about what might be the possible role of the Khmer Rouge in this, but obviously in the context of the changed environment the Government has moved to make certain changes in the way in which aid is provided to Vietnam, and presumably is foreshadowing that government to government aid on a bilateral basis may eventually be provided for Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I find disappointing the capacity of this Government to be able to assist in that area and the prospects of assistance that are held out. On the Government's own estimates, Australia will provide $6.4m to Cambodia and Vietnam in the year 1991-92. While the Government says that this is an increase on the $5.4m provided to Cambodia and $5.8m provided to Vietnam, the fact is that very substantial aid is already provided to each of those countries through the voluntary, non-government organisations that the Government has used to provide assistance in those regional countries to date.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that needs to be clearly understood is that, if the Government is to make substantial aid available to Vietnam and Cambodia, it is going to have to provide substantial and additional funds beyond those which have been allocated to date, or it is going to have to diminish the funds that are provided presently through voluntary organisations in order to provide the funds on a government to government basis. When we look at the nature of the programs and the success of the programs that have been undertaken, particularly in places such as Vietnam and Cambodia, one wonders whether that would be the most effective and most appropriate way to provide that support. Will simply shifting the funding provide better and more effective aid delivery to Vietnam and to Cambodia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the programs that I have seen where the Government has provided funds was detailed in the environment report that was tabled today. That was the irrigation project of Australian Freedom from Hunger where we have spent, up until May this year, $1.6m on trying to restore the agricultural capacity of fields that were devastated during the Khmer Rouge period and where people were unable to undertake farming in a reasonable capacity. If time had permitted I would have taken the opportunity to talk about the Government's priorities in the program, because the Opposition has considerable concerns about the way in which the Government funded aid to South Africa, in particular, through organisations such as the ANC. I am sorry that such limited capacity for debate occurs on a topic as important as this. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>On 23 July 1991 the Treasurer (Mr Kerin) and I announced a range of measures which the Government would be taking to restore confidence and stability in the unlisted property trust industry. As part of that approach, the Government decided to legislate, with effect from the time of the announcement, for the imposition of a standard 12-month notice period for the withdrawal of funds from existing `public' unlisted property trusts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you are aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, real estate is a long term investment. However, managers of unlisted property trusts are required by law to buy-back unitholders investments when requested to do so. This requirement has usually been accommodated by a provision in the relevant trust deeds enabling the management company to redeem from the assets of the trust units which it is required to buy back. The relevant legislation does not provide for maximum or minimum periods within which buy-back or redemption requests must be met. This period has been set in the relevant trust deeds. Most investors were, until mid-1990, able to withdraw their investments by giving between one week and two months notice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the downturn of the commercial property market, such redemption arrangements have become unworkable. Unlisted property trusts are unable to attract new investments or sell property at realistic values in the current depressed market. Both these avenues had previously provided management companies with the liquidity necessary to meet buy-back or redemption requests on short notice. The realisation that property values had slumped and adverse perceptions created by difficulties in relation to the Estate Mortgage trusts and  other corporate collapses resulted in increases in the levels of withdrawals. As a result, most of the unlisted property trusts which were not linked to financial institutions were, in the second half of last year, forced to call meetings of their unitholders to seek their agreement for temporary freezes on withdrawals and/or to adopt extended withdrawal notice periods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1990 the relevant regulatory agency at the time, the National Companies and Securities Commission, acted quickly to attempt to restore confidence and stability in the unlisted property trust industry. In July of that year, they established a task force which included representatives of the relevant industry peak bodies to attempt to find a solution to the illiquidity of unlisted property trusts. In August 1990 the NCSC issued a set of guidelines, arising out of the work of that task force, designed to enable such trusts to operate on a stable basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The work of the NCSC was continued by the Australian Securities Commission when it took over the responsibility for corporate regulation on 1 January 1991. In February this year, the ASC recommended to me a number of measures which were designed to ensure that unlisted property trusts could operate on a stable basis, despite the weak property market conditions. In brief, these involve requiring such trusts to maintain adequate liquidity levels at all times. A failure to do so would result in the convening of unitholder meetings to consider the future of the trust. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While my Department was examining these proposals, the major bank and life insurance company-owned fund managers placed before the Government advice relating to the deteriorating state of the unlisted property trust industry and, in particular, the situation with their trusts. It was apparent that some of these trusts were on the verge of experiencing liquidity difficulties. The Government was convinced, after considering the advice of the Treasury and the Reserve Bank, that the imposition of a standard 12-month notice period was essential if the fund managers were to cope with the difficulties they were facing in meeting withdrawals from their trusts at short notice and the interests of unitholders were to be protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a serious risk that a run on these trusts would have developed. Despite possible investor perceptions to the contrary, the parent institutions are not in a position to provide unlimited liquidity support for their fund management subsidiaries. The parent banks especially are not in this position. The Reserve Bank has a policy of restricting dealings of banks with their managed funds subsidiaries to an arm's length or commercial basis. In these circumstances, a run on the institution linked funds would have almost invariably led to the fire sale of commercial properties into an already weak market. Prices would have been driven down further. As a result, investors would have suffered significant losses. It might be noted that, in any run situation, the more sophisticated wholesale or institutional investors tend to be amongst the first to withdraw their investtments with ordinary retail investors being left to bear the bulk of the ensuing losses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Had we allowed a situation to develop whereby the managers of the institution-linked trusts were forced to place large amounts of property onto the market, this could also have led to broader systemic problems for the financial system in general. In particular, a significant proportion of the around $29 billion of non-performing loans currently being carried by the banking system are secured by commercial property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Faced with a further substantial fall in property values, the banks would have been forced to increase their loss provisioning against these loans and to reassess the asset quality of currently performing borrowers. The consequent reduction in the supply of credit flowing from that process could have led to more business failures and further job losses in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of the standard 12-month notice of withdrawal period does not of itself solve the liquidity problems of unlisted property trusts nor was it intended to. Clearly, it is necessary for many of those trusts to restructure their operations so as to provide a better match between the essentially long term nature of real property as an investment and investor demands for ready liquidity. The introduction of the 12-month notice of withdrawal period is providing management companies and trustees with breathing space in which to reach agreement with their unitholders on restructuring proposals. The Government expects all necessary restructuring to be completed by the end of next July. I note that this process has begun. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, the main features of the Bill are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Investors in those unlisted property trusts regulated under corporations law which existed at 23 July 1991 will be required to give 12 months notice in relation to buy-back and redemption requests in respect of units in those trusts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This rule will not apply to unitholders who are in financial hardship. Management companies will, where they are satisfied of such a unitholder's financial circumstances, be required to buy back units as soon as practicable at a discount not exceeding 7.5 per cent. Any disputed cases will be required to be referred to the trustee for determination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a mechanism in the Bill to enable unitholders to vary the standard 12 month notice period in circumstances where it is commercially viable to do so. Such variations will require the approval of 75 per cent of unitholders voting at a meeting provided that at least 25 per cent of unitholders eligible to vote do so. A meeting will be able to be convened on the initiative of the management company, trustee or upon a requisition from 50 or one-tenth of the unitholders in the trust, whichever is fewer. In order to avoid a situation where the notice period is shortened in circumstances which may adversely affect the viability of the trust, both the management company and the trustee will be able to apply to the Australian Securities Commission for disallowance of a variation to the notice period. The ASC will be able to disallow such variations where it is satisfied that it may result in a threat to the liquidity of the trust or the liquidity of the management company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the ASC will be empowered to permit the trustee to refuse redemptions from trust assets where it is satisfied that such redemptions are likely to adversely affect the value of remaining units or otherwise prejudice the interests of the remaining unitholders. This provision is designed to prevent a situation where a trust is forced to sell properties into a weak market in order to meet redemption requests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The granting of permission to refuse redemption requests will not, however, alleviate the management company from its obligations to buy back units in accordance with the trust deed. The Bill will also:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">require buy-backs and redemptions to be made at the price prevailing on the date of payment as opposed to the date of giving notice;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">enable unitholders to, with the approval of the management company, withdraw a buy-back or redemption request; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">ensure that unitholders do not lose any of their entitlements to income or other benefits between the date of giving notice of withdrawal and when they are actually paid out. </PARA>
<PARA>As I have mentioned, the standard 12 month notice period is part of a range of measures designed to restore confidence in the unlisted property trust industry. Other elements of the new regulatory structure which I announced on 23 July are to be given effect to by the making of regulations under the corporations law. These regulations, which will be largely based on recommendations made to me by the ASC, are presently being developed by my Department in close consultation with the ASC and relevant industry bodies. I expect to release a draft of these regulations for public comment later this month. The principal features of the new regulatory structure are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">management companies and trusts will be required to maintain an adequate level of liquidity at all times;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">a breach of the liquidity requirements will result in the calling of a meeting of investors to consider, among other things, the removal of the manager, the listing of the trust or the winding-up of the trust;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">borrowings by trusts will be limited to 20 per cent of the gross assets of the trust; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">there will be a capital adequacy requirement for management companies. </PARA>
<PARA>These requirements are designed to overcome the problem of the essentially illiquid nature of property investments in relation to those trusts which continue to operate as `traditional' unlisted property trusts. The proposed liquidity requirements will be framed in such a manner as to automatically require the convening of unitholders meeting to determine the future of the trust before it gets into a position of serious difficulty. Beyond this the ASC will, as I have already outlined, have the power to permit the trustee to refuse redemption requests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, the Bill also contains provisions which will be applicable to unit trusts in general. First, the Bill will enable amendments to be made to trust deeds for unit trusts where they are approved by 75 per cent, by value, of unitholders voting at a meeting provided that at least 25 per cent, by value, of unitholders eligible to vote do so. Under the existing law, such amendments cannot be made unless they are approved by an absolute majority of unitholders. While the existing rule certainly ensures that management companies take active steps to encourage investors in unit trusts to participate in meetings where amendments to the deed are proposed, there has been some concern that the existing requirement in many circumstances is too onerous. The proposed amendment was sought by the industry. The Government believes that it strikes a better balance between ensuring that trust deeds are not amended without an adequate degree of investor support and the imposition of costs on unit trusts which are ultimately borne by the investors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the Bill contains an amendment which will ensure that unitholders are able to requisition meetings for the purposes of giving directions to the trustee or management company in relation to the affairs of the trust. Such directions must not be inconsistent with the trust deed. This amendment corrects a difficulty resulting from a judicial decision which effectively meant that unitholders were only able to give directions to the trustee in relation to matters concerning the accounts of the trustee or the accounts of the management company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also contains an amendment to the corporations law to make it clear that the Corporations and Securities Panel has the power to make interim orders pending the final outcome of proceedings brought before it by the Australian Securities Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role of the Panel, on the reference from the ASC, is to determine whether or not unacceptable circumstances have occurred in relation to an acquisition of shares in a company, or as a result of conduct in relation to shares in or the affairs of, a company. Where the Panel declares an acquisition or conduct to be unacceptable, it may make orders to protect the rights or interests of shareholders or to ensure that the take-over proceeds as it should have done but for that acquisition or conduct. The Full Court of the Federal Court recently ruled that as a matter of statutory construction the Panel does not have the power to make interim orders to preserve the rights of persons pending its final determination of an application before it. The amendment in the Bill ensures that the Panel will have such powers. There is wide acceptance of the need for the Panel to have this power. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy Speaker, the commencement of the new national companies and securities scheme on 1 January 1991 was the single most important landmark in the history of corporate regulation in this country. It marked the bringing of corporate regulation for the first time under a single national regulator, the Australian Securities Commission, accountable to a single legislature, the Commonwealth Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The transition to the national scheme has been a remarkably smooth one with the Australian Securities Commission quickly taking up its key role of providing regulatory supervision of the activities of corporations and the securities markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment of the new regulatory framework on 1 January marked the completion of the first phase of the Government's program to reform the structure and substance of corporate regulation in Australia. The importance of this for Australia should be not underestimated. Without a credible regulatory environment, Australian companies will not be able to attract local or international investors. There can be no doubt that Australia's reputation as an attractive place for international investment was severely tarnished by the activities of some entrepreneurs. This Government is determined to redress that damage and restore Australia's standing as a place for secure investment. Already there are encouraging signs that the Government's resolute action to turn performance in corporate regulation around is beginning to be recognised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second phase of the Government's reform program involves a sustained and far reaching program of reform of key areas of the corporate law long recognised as in need of overhaul. Throughout the 1980s, the flawed structure of the cooperative scheme not only led to inadequate enforcement of the law but also largely impeded the law reform process itself. This Government is determined to remedy the last 10 years of neglect in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy Speaker, as honourable members are aware the corporations law which came into force on 1 January this year introduced some reforms in relation to prospectuses, takeovers and the strengthening of the investigating powers for the corporate regulator. At the time of introduction of the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill 1990 which established that law, I foreshadowed an ongoing program of corporate law reform. The Bill now before the House is the second major such reform initiative introduced by this Government since the commencement of the new scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members will recall that the first such initiative was the Corporations Legislation Amendment Act 1991 passed by this Parliament earlier this year. The first of the package of reforms contained in that Act brought about necessary and long overdue reform to require companies to consolidate their accounts and those of the entities they controlled so that investors and creditors would be able to determine the true financial position of a company. The second key area of reform included in that Act strengthened the law relating to insider trading so that the pernicious practice of insiders dealing on the basis of price sensitive information could be more effectively attacked. These new laws, which came into operation on 1 August this year, have sent a clear signal to local and international investors that integrity and credibility will be restored to our markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) deals with reform of other discrete areas of the corporations law, namely, fundraising, the Australian company number provisions and the settlement of securities transactions. In relation to fundraising, the Bill proposes a number of technical amendments which will remove current uncertainties in relation to the operation of the corporations law. Amendments to the Australian company number provisions will finetune those provisions to meet business concerns regarding the cost of complying with the ACN requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other amendments will facilitate new settlement procedures for stock exchange transactions and assist the Australian Stock Exchange to improve the efficiency of its settlement procedures. This will enable the Exchange to offer a service which is comparable with best international practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill was publicly exposed with the agreement of the Ministerial Council for Corporations in August. A number of submissions have been received from interested persons and organisations. Many of the suggestions for changes to the Bill have been incorporated into the Bill as it is now introduced. In accordance with the heads of agreement between the Commonwealth the States and the Northern Territory on corporate regulation, the Ministerial Council for Corporations has been consulted on the Bill and has approved its introduction into Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before dealing in more detail with the provisions of the Bill, I would like to briefly place this Bill in the context of the Government's overall program for the reform of companies and securities laws. In particular, I want to make it clear that this Bill is far from the end of the story for reform of the law in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am proposing that a further corporations law reform Bill, the third this year, be released for public comment later this year. That Bill will contain much needed and long overdue reforms to the law relating to loans to directors and intra-company transactions, corporate insolvency law and directors' duties. It will also facilitate introduction of a fully automated clearance and settlement regime for securities traded on the Australian Stock Exchange. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will also bring before the Parliament next year further reforms implementing the recent report of the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee on an enhanced disclosure regime for securities. It is my view that the key to fundraising laws which are fair to all participants and which will attract investment is the putting in place of a regime which ensures the timely disclosure of material information to the market. Such laws, together with a regulatory body which has the foresight and readiness to embrace the best information technology to provide an up to date database will, I believe, prove decisive in attracting investment to our markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For some time now there has been widespread concern as to whether the corporations law provides an appropriate regulatory structure for collective investment schemes. The Australian Law Reform Commission and the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee will be reporting on this matter next year. The huge level of funds invested in pooled investments by ordinary Australians makes it essential that there be exemplary regulation of this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the law enforcement area, I expect to introduce legislation soon to enable compulsory powers to be exercised by Australian business regulatory agencies on behalf of their foreign counterparts. The internationalisation of securities markets and the rapid transfer of funds across borders make it essential that the ASC be able to assist its overseas counterparts in the investigation and prosecution of offences against securities laws. In turn these agencies will assist the ASC to fulfil its statutory mandate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter which I regard as of the highest importance in the area of the enforcement of the corporations law concerns the self-incrimination provisions relating to ASC investigations. These provisions are currently under review by the parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities. The Committee's report and recommendations will be examined as a matter of the highest priority when available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be clear from the outline I have just given that considerable time and resources are being dedicated to the reform of our corporate laws. Given the regulatory failure and the excesses of a small but high-profile section of the business community during the 1980s, honourable members may rest assured that the Government will continue to maintain the momentum of reform and will continue to do so in close consultation with the business community and related professions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now deal briefly with the key features of the Bill before the House.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Fundraising <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"></EMPHASIS>As I stated earlier, significant reforms to the regulation of corporate fundraising came into effect under the corporations law on 1 January 1991. The Government is satisfied with the substance of the fundraising reforms. The new provisions have resulted in better information being provided to potential investors and a more informed market. Notwithstanding some criticisms of the provisions, all the signs are that business has quickly adapted to the new fundraising laws. Indeed the significant capital raisings this year indicate that the greater information being provided to the market is facilitating investment activity and confidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Government recognises that experience since 1 January has resulted in the identification of a number of matters which warrant clarification. This Bill includes a number of largely technical amendments for this purpose with a view to ensuring commercial certainty. These amendments are essentially those set out in the exposure draft with some minor modifications as a result of comments made during the exposure period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time of releasing the exposure draft in August, I announced that I had asked my Department to review the application of the provisions of the law which prohibit the issue of prospectuses containing materially false or misleading statements or from which there are material omissions. A range of conflicting views were expressed by various interested parties. Following further consideration of this matter, and in the light of public submissions, it is felt that it would not be desirable to amend section 996 in a manner which would involve any significant policy changes at this stage, without the benefit of public exposure of the amendments. Instead the Bill includes an amendment which clarifies the position of section 996 by providing that it does not apply to those offers in relation to which a prospectus is not required to be lodged with the ASC. The long term approach to civil and criminal liability in relation to the offers of securities will be reviewed in the context of consideration of the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee's recent report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report on an Enhanced Statutory Disclosure System</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other amendments to the fundraising provisions in the Bill:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">make it clear that the fundraising provisions do not apply to trading of securities on the stock exchange;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">clarify how the prospectus provisions apply to other secondary offers of securities; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">clarify the operation of various defences against civil liability for misstatements in, and omission from, prospectuses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regulation of prescribed interests and arrangements&mdash;such as unit trusts&mdash;under the corporations law has also been the subject of some controversy. Apart from the question of the regulation of unlisted property trusts, which is being dealt with in separate legislation, the issue of whether the trustee or the management company is responsible for the keeping of the books of accounts for prescribed interests has caused particular concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pending the Australian Law Reform Commission and the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee report on the appropriate regulatory framework for prescribed interests and other collective investment schemes, the Bill contains an amendment to make it clear that the trustee may continue to cause the books of accounts for prescribed interests to be kept by the management company. This will avoid unnecessary and costly disruption to the administration of unit trusts. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Registration Numbers of Companies and Registrable Bodies</EMPHASIS> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the Australian company number (ACN) and Australian registrable body number (ARBN) is to provide a simple way of assisting persons dealing with companies, foreign companies and registrable bodies to identify those bodies. The ACN and the ARBN provide a unique nine digit number for each Australian company, foreign company and other registrable body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A moratorium on the use of an ACN or ARBN currently applies to the requirement for companies, foreign companies and other registrable bodies to display their ACN or ARBN on public documents or eligible negotiable instruments under the corporations law. However, companies and bodies are still required to display their ACN or ARBN on their common seal and any document that is required by the law to be lodged with the ASC. This moratorium expires on 31 December 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of the amendments proposed to the ACN and ARBN provisions will be as follows:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">cash register receipts produced by an electronic machine and which set out information which is stored in the machine will not be required to contain the ACN or ARBN of the company or body issuing the receipt;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">alternative abbreviations for ACN and ARBN, without full stops, will be available for use by companies and bodies in all official documents;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">an advertising document issued by a company which is not also used as a document for undertaking some form of transaction with a person will not be required to contain the company's ACN or ARBN;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">the ASC will be empowered to exempt a company or bodies that operate in transportation of persons or goods from being required to place its ACN or ARBN on documents that are used in connection with transportation where it is necessary or desirable in the interests of promoting or maintaining consistency in international practice relating to transport documents. </PARA>
<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Introduction of fixed date settlement for market transactions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also contains important amendments which will facilitate the introduction of a fixed date settlement regime for transactions on the Australian Stock Exchange. The purpose of this regime is to ensure that settlement of a sale of securities takes place five days after the trade. It is anticipated that this requirement will reduce the risk in settlement of share transfers and the claims on the National Guarantee Fund, lead to more certainty for market participants and improve the international competitiveness of the Australian Stock Exchange. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regime being introduced by the Exchange follows internationally accepted standards for settlement of on-market transactions. Failure to implement such a regime in Australia could lead to offshore markets becoming more efficient and more competitive than the domestic market. This will in turn erode the liquidity of the Australian securities markets. This Bill extends the coverage of the National Guarantee Fund to facilities that have been developed by the Australian Stock Exchange to assist traders to comply with the new settlement requirements. The Exchange will also have access to the Fund for losses suffered by the Exchange as a result of brokers defaulting on their obligations under these new facilities. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA>In the context of the Budget, the Government announced measures which would allow for improvements to the arrangements for the recovery of costs to the Commonwealth health and welfare budget which flow from the migration program. The migration program operates to Australia's benefit but there is a level of cost attached to some of its components. The Government proposes to improve existing cost recovery measures, through changes to the assurance of support scheme and through the provisions of this Bill. This Bill provides for the payment, by certain classes of migrants and persons approved for permanent residence, of a migration (health services) charge of $822 to offset Commonwealth health expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before dealing with the specifics of the Bill, let me provide an overview of the assurance of support scheme. In general terms, an assurance of support is a legal commitment made by the assurer to repay to the Commonwealth, States, public or charitable institutions any money or the value of any goods or services paid out to support the person or persons covered by the assurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The assurance is an essential criterion under the migration regulations for applicants for permanent entry and stay in certain classes and a discretionary criterion in most other classes. The purpose of the assurance is to ensure that the burden of some costs which newcomers may generate during their initial years of residence in Australia are borne by their sponsoring families and not by the general community. It is important to note that the existence of an assurance does not mean that any person covered by it cannot receive social security benefits or other assistance. Rather, it means that the assurer is liable to repay any support that is received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A new assurance of support scheme will be introduced by amendment to the migration regulations. The new scheme will reduce the liabilities which the assurer undertakes. First, the validity of the assurance will be reduced from the current five years to only two years. This represents a marked decrease in the time taken to incur debts. Secondly, the debts that may be recovered have been restricted to special benefits and Job Search and Newstart allowances paid by the Commonwealth. Other support costs will no longer be recoverable. The provisions for the recovery of limited health costs were outdated and not operating effectively. As a result they will be removed from the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a separate but related measure, this Bill provides a more effective means for the recovery of health costs by the Commonwealth. In the Budget context it was announced that the assurance of support scheme would be augmented by a refundable bond and a non-refundable health charge. The charge, introduced by this Bill is to be paid in addition to the Medicare levy. It will offset part of the cost to the Commonwealth of providing access to medical, hospital and pharmaceutical benefits to certain migrants during their first two years as permanent residents in Australia. The charge affects only those migrants in respect of whom the assurance is an essential criterion&mdash;parents who meet the balance of family test, aged dependent, last remaining, special need and orphan minor relatives and the Lebanese concession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The payment of the charge will in no way affect the existing requirement that all migrants have to satisfy Commonwealth health standards. If all criteria are met for the grant of a visa or entry permit and if the charge is paid they will enter or will be approved to stay in Australia as permanent residents. As new permanent residents they have immediate access to our health and welfare systems, but are unlikely to have made the same lifetime contribution through taxes as other Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The health charge will enable the Government to recover an estimated 50 per cent of the average medical, hospital and pharmaceutical costs incurred by persons covered by the assurance and will result in an additional estimated revenue to the Commonwealth of $9.9m in a full financial year. The introduction of the bond and the health charge reinforces the understanding by applicants and persons who give assurances of the costs of migration. It is expected that this will result in more careful consideration by the parties involved of their financial commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill imposes the charge on applicants in the classes I have mentioned who have lodged their applications on or after 21 August 1991. It provides that the charge be paid after all other criteria are met and before a visa or entry permit may be granted. It also provides for exemptions from the charge for those persons who withdraw their applications. Persons who have paid the charge in respect of a class of visa are also exempt from paying any charge for the grant of the equivalent class of entry permit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To ensure that the charge retains its value in relation to health costs in future years, the Bill provides for the indexation of the charge on an annual basis in line with the all group consumer price index. These measures will provide a more effective approach to the protection of the Commonwealth's health budget than was available under the old assurance of support scheme. I commend the Bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum for the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This motion, of course, does not have our support because it flies in the face of the previous motion. The previous motion, which was to suspend the 11 o'clock rule, was designed, as I said a moment ago, to provide additional time for Government business to be dealt with. What is proposed now is the introduction of the guillotine, which will reduce the amount of time that will be available on some very vital Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The House will be aware that I have repeatedly protested against the practice of this Government of resorting to the guillotine to process its legislation. Sadly, I am having to do it again, though only a few weeks ago I had hoped&mdash;and I made this comment in the House&mdash;that for once we would have a session that would be guillotine free. When I expressed that hope during the debate on Parliamentary Secretaries, I acknowledged that this current sitting has been better managed than sittings in the past. I want to repeat that, despite the fact that the Government has decided tonight to introduce the guillotine, this current sitting has been better managed than those in the past. Notwithstanding that the Government will not be in office for much longer, I am sure that by the time it leaves office it will have a better understanding of how the House should be managed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this guillotine may not be as harsh, so far as time is concerned, as some that we have experienced, the Government nevertheless is again short-circuiting the legislative process. It is curtailing debating time and, as a consequence, the proper scrutiny and analysis of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the previous sitting we had the outrageous situation in which the Government put through no fewer than 37 Bills under the guillotine, and they had to be dealt with in four days. At most we got 40 minutes on each, apart from one on which a mere 15 minutes was allowed. On this occasion we are not being subjected to such a tight regime, but the ruthlessness with which this Government has been prepared to apply the guillotine does not offer much comfort for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The loser in all of this is Parliament. Ever since this Government came to office, the process of downgrading Parliament and its proceedings has been going on. The use of the guillotine is just one of the forms that are part of the downgrading process. The Hawke Government has been notorious for nibbling away at the edges and for bringing in major changes through the back door. It is the old Fabian device of gradualism, of which the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has been a faithful adherent since he enunciated it in a speech in 1984. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) will say that having to use the guillotine is all the fault of the Senate and the Macklin amendment, but this recurring bunching of legislation at the end of sitting periods suggests a breakdown in Government management processes. It is the responsibility of the Government to ensure that legislation is processed through the Cabinet procedures and brought into the House to allow proper debate. This, of course, must also mean that sufficient time be given for the Opposition to consider adequately such legislation before it comes up for debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of the measures being dealt with under the guillotine during the last few weeks of this sitting, as well as previous ones, are contentious and complex. It is therefore essential that a reasonable allotment of time be provided to allow serious scrutiny of this legislation. It is just not good enough for the Government to rush legislation through when this country is having to contend with the most serious economic situation that it has faced in the past 60 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this late stage, I appeal to the Government to take Parliament seriously, to reconsider its decision and to abandon the practice that it has adopted during the past few years of curtailing discussion. I appeal to it to allow the chamber more time to discharge its proper legislative functions in the interests of the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is proposing to curtail debate on no fewer than 11 pieces of legislation&mdash;the Health Insurance Amendment Bill 1991, the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991, the Migration Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991, the Fringe Benefits Tax Amendment Bill 1991, the Income Tax (International Agreements) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1991, the Income Tax (Deferred Interest Securities) (Tax File Number Withholding Tax) Bill 1991&mdash;a most important piece of legislation&mdash;the Medicare Levy Amendment Bill 1991, the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991, the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 and, last but not least, the Financial Legislation Amendment Bill 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of those Bills are important pieces of legislation and the Government, by weight of its numbers, in the next few minutes will curtail debate on that legislation and will force it through, a lot of it with only a minimal amount of time available for both scrutiny and debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the Bills that must pass through this House under guillotine have been introduced into the House of Representatives only today. Many of those pieces of legislation have not yet been scrutinised by the shadow Minister concerned, and they certainly have not been to the shadow Cabinet. The first opportunity that we will have to consider the legislation that I am referring to in the Opposition joint party room will be on Tuesday of next week. The Opposition deplores the action of the Government&mdash;repeated session after session&mdash;to steamroll legislation through the Parliament in this way. We oppose the motion. </PARA>

<PARA>I explained in my second reading speech on the Migration (Health Services) Charge Bill the Government's decisions in the Budget context in relation to the assurance of support scheme and the imposition of a health charge. That Bill imposed the liability; however, to give effect to the collection of the charge, changes to the Migration Act 1958 are required. </PARA>

The Bill also requires that applicants be notified of the requirement and that their visa or entry permit cannot be granted until the payment is made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also amends the regulation making power to allow for the remission, refund or waiver of the charge.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Bill be now read a second time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main purpose of this Bill is to allow for the registration of some people as citizens by descent who formerly were eligible to register but did not do so for a number of reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation which I seek to remedy arises from amendments in 1984 to the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 which limited the registration of Australian citizenship by descent to persons under 18 years of age as from 22 November 1986. My attention has been drawn to some people who, as children, were included on their parents' Australian passports and were subsequently issued Australian passports in their own right over a period of many years. These people have always assumed that they were Australian citizens and did not register because they were unaware of the fact that they had been required to do so to become Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Stewart Royal Commission Of Inquiry Into Drug Trafficking recommended tightening passport issuing procedures and the Passports Act 1938 was amended in 1984 to provide that Australian passports could be issued only to Australian citizens. To meet that provision all Australian passport applicants have to prove they are Australian citizens. When some former passport holders have applied for Australian passports they have discovered that they are not and never have been Australian citizens and are therefore not eligible for Australian passports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particular group of people consists of those who were born outside Australia to parents who were Australian citizens and, although eligible to be registered as Australian citizens until 21 November 1986, have not been so registered. Because the people concerned are now over 18 years of age, they are not eligible to be registered as Australian citizens by descent under the current provisions of the Act. Where they are permanent residents of Australia, they can obtain citizenship under the provisions of the Act relating to the grant of citizenship. Most who have come to notice cannot obtain citizenship under these provisions because they do not have permanent residence in Australia and this naturally causes them a great deal of distress and inconvenience. If they are outside Australia, they cannot return unless they meet the criteria of the migration legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not foreseen in 1984 that there were people in this category and legislative provision was not made then to protect them. This Bill proposes a new section 10C of the Act which will enable people who are in this situation and have a close association with Australia to apply for registration as Australian citizens by descent, even though they are now over 18 years of age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill requires that, for an applicant in these circumstances to be registered as an Australian citizen, he or she must have at least one natural parent who was an Australian citizen when the applicant was born and who is an Australian citizen when the application is submitted. If that parent is dead when the application is submitted, then the parent must have been an Australian citizen at the time of death. The applicant must now be 18 years of age or more and have been born outside Australia. The applicant must also have an acceptable reason for not being registered as an Australian citizen. I believe that in most cases the reasons given will be that the applicant had previously been issued with an Australian passport and has thus reasonably assumed that he or she was an Australian citizen, or the applicant has been enrolled under the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 for some years or the applicant was unaware of the registration provisions of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the `acceptable reasons' specified in this Bill, other `acceptable reasons' for failure to register as an Australian citizen may be specified in the regulations. An application will be subject to the normal fee for registration as an Australian citizen by descent and, because of the age of the applicant, subject to a good character requirement. The number of people able to obtain Australian citizenship under this proposed amendment is expected to be small. However the distress and inconvenience caused to those affected people is sufficient to justify this amendment to the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequential to the major amendment, this Bill proposes an additional amendment to section 10B of the Act. This amendment is necessary to ensure that children of people who obtain Australian citizenship under the major amendment to the Act, as I have outlined above, or under the existing section 11 of the Act, are considered no differently from children of people who obtained citizenship under the current provisions of section 10B or the former section 11 of the Act. The amendment will require that before a person under 18 years of age can acquire Australian citizenship by descent through a parent who also acquired Australian citizenship by descent, that parent must have a close association with Australia as already prescribed in section 10B of the Act. To emphasise that close association, section 10B requires the parent, in these circumstances, to have been lawfully in Australia for at least two years at any time prior to the registration of the person as a citizen by descent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill puts forward two further amendments. The first of these provides for review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of a decision to refuse an application for registration as an Australian citizen under the major amendment I have already outlined. The second is to ensure that the current section 11 is consistent in this respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, there are five other minor amendments which are listed in the schedule to this Bill. These amendments relate to references in the Australian Citizenship Act to the Migration Act 1958. When the Migration Act was amended in 1989 its sections were renumbered. I am taking the opportunity with this Bill to correct those section numbers of the Migration Act which are quoted in the Australian Citizenship Act. I commend the Bill to the House and I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA>The Bank Integration Bill 1991 will facilitate the integration of savings banks and trading banks. Following the liberalisation of banking regulation in the mid-1980s, the differential treatment of savings and trading banks became increasingly unnecessary, and the Government decided to remove the distinction for regulatory purposes between them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Banking Legislation Amendment Act, which received royal assent on 7 November 1989, included amendments to give effect to the Treasurer's announcement in the 1988 Budget of the removal of the distinction between savings banks and trading banks. The removal of this distinction was aimed at enabling banks within the same group to have better use and allocation of funds, simpler funding and accounting arrangements, and greater flexibility in servicing customers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the course of preparation of the draft legislation in 1989, it became apparent from discussions with the banking industry that, notwithstanding the fact that the legislation removed legislative barriers to the integration of trading banks and savings banks, there remained significant administrative costs and legal difficulties. Given the urgency associated with other provisions of the Amendment Bill, it was considered inappropriate to defer passage of the legislation to incorporate further amendments. Accordingly, the Government indicated in 1989 in the second reading speech to the Amendment Bill that consideration would be given to further legislation to facilitate integration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill serves that purpose by including provisions which facilitate the transfer of the assets and liabilities of each savings bank subsidiary to its trading bank parent. That transfer is, in the main, achieved through the principle of universal succession, but it is also assisted by exemptions from most Commonwealth, State and Territory taxes and fees and by providing for tax neutrality under income tax law. The legislation will thus give further encouragement to savings and trading banks to amalgamate, consistent with the legislation passed by the Parliament in 1989, and in doing so will also simplify the prudential supervisory role of the Reserve Bank. I present the explanatory memorandum to this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to address the Health Insurance Amendment Bill and the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2), which cover a range of issues, some of which are very important. They relate, for example, to the changes announced in the Budget for co-payments by patients for visits to their local GP. I do not need to remind the House about the fracas&mdash;I think that is a fair description&mdash;that occurred in the Labor Party Caucus when discussion was initiated. As the House will recall, the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Affairs (Mr Howe) suggested there might be a co-payment. He suggested a $3.50 co-payment was the appropriate level, and that this would be implemented by a series of measures, which I will come to in a second, on every visit to the GP. The only exclusion to that, I understand, would be pensioners and health care card holders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would think that $3.50 was not an enormous price to pay. I am not a smoker myself, but if I remember rightly it is about the price of a cheap packet of cigarettes. It was not enough, one would think, to actually break the bank of an individual&mdash;certainly not enough to deter somebody who was sick from going to the doctor but enough to make sure that there was some price signal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had some problems with the details of the implementation of the co-payment because the way in which it was done was to reduce the rebate to the doctor by a certain amount and for the doctor to be allowed to extract that amount from the patient; that is, the onus, the blame and the pressure was put upon the GP, not upon either the Government or the patient. The GP was cast in the role of being the evil, iniquitous one who would extract this money, when, of course, the truth was that the Government was about to extract the money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We thought that the method of extraction of the co-payment was entirely inappropriate but, nonetheless, we accepted the principle that the co-payment, a price signal, was an important way of reducing over-servicing and overusage of the system. I think there are very few people in this House now who would argue with the fact that over-servicing and overusage does occur. There might be some discussion about how much was over-servicing from a doctor point of view and how much was overusage from a patient point of view. Nonetheless, there was certainly a degree of overusage of the system and that meant wastage of Medicare funds. It meant that those funds were not available for things such as replacing hips that need replacing, fixing up cataracts&mdash;so people were left blind&mdash;or a whole range of other necessary health concerns that would not be addressed because money was wasted in inappropriate servicing of patients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We supported the principle of the $3.50, but what happened to the Caucus was very interesting. There was the most amazing schism and, in the end, the Cabinet and the Minister got rolled&mdash;there is no other way of putting it&mdash;and some compromise deal was looked at. The result in front of us now is, indeed, that compromised deal. But, of course, as with many compromises, the compromise is worse than the original. The compromise was a $2.50 payment, by virtue of handing back a dollar to the physician by way of a transaction fee, but only when that physician indulged in bulkbilling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that there are very few sensible people around this country who do not believe that offering a free service allows it to be overused. Indeed, it encourages not only overuse but also overservicing. One of the main problems with overuse and overservicing is the availability of free services under Medicare. It is very attractive politically, of course, and I think the Labor Caucus realised that. But in terms of what is offered to the patient, the reality is an encouragement to overuse the system. What is offered to the physician is an encouragement to overuse the system without any particular penalty or restrictions from the patient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would think that the Government's approach would be to say, `Okay, we will put a price signal in there and, by virtue of doing that, we will reduce the incentive to bulkbilling'. But the compromise that the Government finishes up with is a price signal, but it is one which is structured in such a crazy way that there is an incentive to carry on bulkbilling. It defies all sensible logic. I have lost track of the numbers of pieces of correspondence that I have had from people involved in the profession who cannot understand the convoluted logic of introducing a price signal on the one hand but, on the other hand, introducing a price signal which is structured in such a way that it actually encourages physicians to bulkbill. It is absolutely crazy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not to mention the craziness of the bottom line. The bottom line is that the Government has lost something like $70m worth of savings from its Budget estimates because of this naive political approach to the question of overusage and overservicing. We were very distressed by the method introduced. It did put the onus upon doctors and, in particular, upon GPs. It has done nothing to address the problems facing specialists or some of the other areas in medicine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly, in the bottom line, in the end summary, we ask what these Budget announcements did. It is not so much what they did, even though they were bad enough; it is actually what they did not do. They did not do anything about attacking waiting lists; they did not do anything at all about improving the efficiency of the system; they did not do a single thing about improving the quality of care; they did not do anything at all about improving the balance between the private system and the public system. In the end, they did nothing at all to address the crisis which is facing our health system now; the crisis which even the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Affairs, who has just entered the chamber, has agreed is there. In fact, he said to a number of authorities that the current system, as it stood, was unsustainable. Clearly, we would agree with that. It is unsustainable in its current form. A number of corrections need to be made. We do not believe that these are the right corrections. However, they are better than the current system. So for that reason, in spite of our reservations, we will support the changes to the Medicare rebates which will encourage a co-payment, even though we have major reservations about the end result of what has actually been done here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other question which arises, of course, relates to the fact that now individuals will face a co-payment every time they go to see their local GP while at present they face no charge at all for going to the local hospital outpatients. A number of them will, of course, trot along to the local casualty department or outpatient department and get what is, at present, a free service in preference to paying $2.50 or $3.50, depending on the billing system of their local GP. One may say that that is fine but the problem is the pressure that that will put upon the public hospital system. It will be even greater than the pressure which is there already. The pressure which is there already is enough to choke the system. So unless we actually do something about that, there is going to be a major exodus from GP surgeries into outpatients and casualty departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Victorian Labor Government has already announced that it will introduce a $5 fee. All the other States are considering their options in relation to what should be done to discourage people from using, what are at present, free services in hospitals. Unless something is done, there will be a major exodus. In the past, we have seen that changing the structure like this, without looking through the consequences, leads to changes which are detrimental to the public system. For goodness' sake, everybody must realise that the public system at present is so overcrowded and so choked that it cannot cope with any more patients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government should be encouraging patients to get off the public system and get into the private system. As honourable members know, the private system, at present, is considerably underused and is, therefore, finding it difficult to run at efficient levels. Around Australia, the average occupancy rate of private hospitals is between 55 and 60 per cent. At that level, it is difficult to run efficiently. At the same time, we have something like 70,000 patients sitting on public hospital elective surgery waiting lists. It is crazy not to shift some of that load from the public system onto the private system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposal does nothing to address that problem. It actually worsens the problem. Clearly, the problems facing the State hospitals in regard to the overusage which is going to occur as a result of this co-payment for GP visits will need to be addressed. At the same time, nothing is being done to address the problem of, what are at present, free visits to accidents and emergency units and to outpatients in major hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other items that I wish to raise. The Government, for reasons which I must say that I find difficult to understand, has put a guillotine on this Bill. I think there are something like 14 honourable members listed to speak for the Bill. I think it is unlikely that more than two or three will be able to take the opportunity to do so because of the guillotine which finishes at 9.30 p.m. and as I speak it is 35 minutes away. It is really a crazy system for something as important as this. I am sure the Government itself could not disagree that this is an important matter. I think its own deliberations within the Caucus would indicate that that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the Government had to set up a separate committee to evaluate what was going on with these co-payments is an indication of the difficulties involved, of the inequities which may be involved, and of how important this is to the health system of Australia. Regardless of that, it has put on a guillotine which effectively restricts the consideration of this Bill to something like a total of 45 minutes, that is less than two speakers. It is really somewhat disgraceful for the Government to try to put an important Bill like this through, particularly when the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley), a few months ago, indicated that he would no longer use the guillotine if it were at all possible. It is clearly not necessary. It is clearly a manoeuvre which is used by the Government as a simple attempt to try to restrain debate upon some of these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is impossible to avoid the conclusion that one of the constraints which the Government is trying to impose is not so much upon the question of the Government's proposals in terms of the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 1) or the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2), but in terms of the mooted amendments to the Bills from the honourable member for Macquarie (Mr Webster) in regard to the funding of abortions in Australia. Let me say very clearly that I believe that the amendments which the honourable member for Macquarie proposes, which will restrict the Medicare funding of abortions in Australia, relate to one of the most important issues facing this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I speak now entirely on a personal basis. I think it is very appropriate that there are no party positions on these matters. This is very much a matter for conscience voting but the situation is that the honourable member for Macquarie has indicated to all honourable members of this House that he will move amendments which will restrict the availability of Medicare funding for abortion in Australia. Whether it is agreed with or disagreed with, it surely is one of the most important issues facing this country at present and it should be given a hearing. It should be given a division. I am very sad that one of the effects of this guillotine&mdash;and those amongst us who are suspicious about the Government's motives would say that it is the main aim of this guillotine&mdash;will be to restrict debate upon this most vitally important motion. Let me indicate from a personal point of view that if this amendment from the honourable member for Macquarie is divided on, I will support him from the bottom of my heart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other issues in these health insurance amendment Bills which need to be addressed. Let me say, first of all, that amongst these are the question of medical service committees of inquiries. MSCIs are already in existence and, at present, its members have the power, in essence, to say to a physician, or indeed a surgeon, that his rebates were given inappropriately because the services which he billed for were not appropriate or were, in many cases, illegal or unjustifiable. There are a whole range of reasons. But they have the ability, at present, to require that the rebate be repaid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this legislation, the MSCIs will be able to actually find that an offence has been committed and that that offence is punishable with a significant penalty. Suddenly, we find that the members of MSCIs are no longer just saying, `Okay, that rebate was inappropriate. You should not have actually seen that patient'. They are actually finding physicians guilty of an offence. The view of the coalition is, in fact, that if there is a court of this degree with these amounts of powers, able to find its peers guilty of an offence, then its peers&mdash;the people who are being judged by these committees&mdash;should have access to the normal judicial rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people should have available the normal protection mechanisms of the court. They should be able to be assessed by the judicial process, not by a committee of their peers whose experience in these matters, by and large, is very limited. We believe very strongly indeed that the MSCIs are an inappropriate body in the first place but, in particular, they are inappropriate in terms of finding their peers guilty of an offence. This is something that we are opposed to and we believe that it should not be allowed to go through. However, because of the guillotine, these matters will be passed through the House tonight against our better judgment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other items which we support; for example, the changes relating to disqualified doctors. We believe that it should not be appropriate for a doctor who is disqualified from practising in one State to move to another State and start practising there. We believe that the restrictions which are imposed on doctors in that situation are indeed very appropriate. We believe in a number of other items which have been imposed, including the restriction of Medicare benefits to those who should appropriately receive them. This is related to a particular group of physicians whom I will not delineate because of time constraints. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other issues which relate to changes which may or may not have been unintended consequences, such as X-ray facilities available to the patients of physiotherapists and podiatrists. We have major concerns about this. The changes which were introduced by the Government a few months ago had the effect of restricting patients referred by physiotherapists from obtaining an appropriate rebate. Similar restraints apply to patients of podiatrists. However, chiropractors who, to most people, in this regard at least, would be in the same category as physiotherapists and podiatrists, had the ability to obtain appropriate rebates for their patients for radiology referrals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to us that in order for the patient to obtain a full rebate it would be necessary for him to go to a GP and to be referred by the GP to a radiologist for the appropriate X-ray of the spine, the foot or whatever the case may be. Of course, the problem with that was that, although it was designed to save money, every time the patient went to see the GP that meant at least another $20 down the drain. In many cases the GP would have to see the patient again to get the X-ray report and to discuss the results of that X-ray, which would mean another $20. In that situation that would be at least $40 down the drain, paid for by the taxpayer&mdash;not the Government&mdash;via Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any attempt to save money by this process seemed to us to be inappropriate. I think it is fair to say that there was no suggestion that chiropractors, physiotherapists or podiatrists were in fact in any way rorting the system or that they were referring patients for unnecessary X-rays. That has never been suggested and, indeed, it would not be the case. It meant that physiotherapy and podiatry patients had an extra trip to make to the radiology unit, but that would have occurred anyway. But, on top of that, they had to see their GP, either once or twice, depending on the GP's practice. That was, firstly, inefficient and, secondly, it was in breach of the normal philosophy of allowing patients access to those services in the simplest way possible. In addition, it actually costs the Government&mdash;the taxpayer&mdash;more money. For that reason, after discussions with representatives of the physiotherapy and podiatrist professions, we decided that we would move amendments to the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2) to allow the same access to radiology procedures as had been extended to chiropractors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our intention had been to move amendments and to divide on them, as had been discussed with the Government.

We will move an amendment in the same terms relating to podiatrists so that both of those groups and their patients will have appropriate access.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that these amendments in the physiotherapy and podiatry areas are very sensible indeed. I would like to mention a number of other items but, because of the constraints of time, if I speak for the time allotted I will restrict other honourable members from addressing the House on these matters. However, one item in particular relates to the restructuring of the schedule. This is in part the result of the recommendations of the Auditor-General. While we would not necessarily support the details of some of those restructurings they are, by and large, sensible. We would want to go further.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, when we take over from the Government after the next election, we will institute a major review of the Medicare schedule to include members of the medical profession, the Private Hospitals Association, health funds and other associated professionals so that the Medicare structure is reorganised in such a way that it discourages the sausage machine approach which is so prevalent at present and encourages preventative medicine, long term consultations and looks towards a longer rather than a short term approach in general practice. The quality of general practice has suffered enormously since the introduction of Medicare. There has been an enormous encouragement of the sausage machine approach&mdash;quickly turning over as many patients as possible rather than spending time with them inquiring into the problems which they face. I believe that is inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next Government will encourage long term, in depth consultations, preventative medicine and the practice of a range of issues in medicine which look to the longer term rather than the quick fix and the fast turnover. </PARA>

On that basis, I am happy to support the thrust of many of the things which the Government is doing, but decry the inadequacy of some of the ways it has tried to achieve them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have the dubious honour of having been a member of the Caucus review committee on Medicare. It is in that context that I address the House this evening. I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Health Insurance Amendment Bill and its sister Bill, the Health Insurance Amendment Bill (No. 2), implement the first stages of reform in the Medicare benefits for GP services contained in the recent Budget,  as amended by the Caucus and as recommended, in some instances, by the Caucus committee. I thank the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) for listening to members of the Caucus committee and for taking on board some of their recommendations, although obviously not all of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objectives of this Bill are to contain health expenditure so as to enable a more efficient use of health resources in this country, to encourage the more appropriate use of medical services through the introduction of a price signal&mdash;we may have a slight difference of opinion on that one&mdash;to provide improved protection for families and those heavy users of medical services through the family protection provisions, and to provide a clear signal that the Government supports the ongoing role of bulkbilling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The date of commencement of the reduction in the benefit has had to be changed, because of the reconsideration of some of those aspects, from 1 November 1991 to 1 December 1991. The maximum co-payment has been changed from $3.50 to $2.50, with the level of that co-payment now to be indexed, whereas previously it would have been static at $3.50. There will also be a $1 additional fee paid to doctors who bulkbill a patient who is not a cardholder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that these changes are important. The Caucus review committee was trying to make the point to the Government and to the Minister, as were members of the Caucus, that it had a concern that the original proposal did not appear to be showing the Government's preference for and wish to assist and maintain bulkbilling in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe&mdash;and I am sure the Minister does, too&mdash;that bulkbilling is a very efficient form of administration of medical payments. That is why I am very pleased to see some acknowledgment of bulkbilling in the Bill. Furthermore, the Bill assists in the restructuring of general practice in the longer term. That is also a most worthy pursuit by the Minister, and I congratulate him on attempting to do that in the context of the national health review. That is not something that has happened on its own; the Minister instigated the review, and the review has already come down with some excellent discussion papers which will benefit the Parliament and the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the common factors in relation to general practice is that we have acknowledged that there are too many general practitioners in Australia, with a cost system which has no cap on it in terms of fee for service and the Medicare rebate. It is a cost which can continue to expand with no end in sight if we are not sensible about the way that we ration or change the health care system through GPs. It is fair to say that general practitioners also recognise this and that they themselves have no objection to some restructuring in their industry. Of course, there will be differences of opinion as to what types of restructuring should occur, but one of the issues that the Caucus committee raised&mdash;and about which the industry and the Minister have concerns&mdash;is the number of migrant doctors, for instance, who are practising in Australia. That is not to say that they should not be practising but that there may be other ways of using their skills if not in general practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Neither is it to say, of course, that they are not good doctors or that doctors who are educated in Australia are better trained. It is nothing to do with that; it is to do with the mere fact that anybody who gets a doctor's qualification is able to hang up a shingle and begin to practise in a way that enables him or her to enter the health system and take advantage of the fee for service provisions which enable a rebate to be paid, irrespective of the need for additional doctors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important, although it was not one of the recommendations of the Caucus committee, that card holders continue to be protected by this Bill. There has been some concern in that area, because obviously in many instances card holders are people who are ill, sometimes chronically ill, and who would tend to be overserviced in the most common sense of the word&mdash;that is, not in a malicious sense, but simply because they happen to be the people who have the most ills and therefore the people who attend the doctor most often. Under this provision they will continue to be eligible for a rebate of 85 per cent, and that is quite a proper course to take. The last thing that we want to see would be those people being disadvantaged&mdash;although there is the risk of their still receiving a little more solicitous service than they may have received had they been subjected to the same reduction in rebate as other patients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The safety net for a family, now being $246 a year, is a significant improvement on what previously was a similar amount per individual. Everybody in the House would be aware of instances in which a member of a family may have got close to the safety net of $246, or $250, but not quite over the edge, and another member of the same family may have had some chronic illness or health problem and got very close to $200, perhaps, but neither would have qualified for the safety net as the provisions previously stood. As the Minister has pointed out, a situation now prevails in which instead of it being $948 for a family of, say, two parents and two children, it will only be $246 that they have to reach before the safety net applies. That is an important provision. It is one that many Australian families will now be able to benefit from&mdash;or, if not benefit from, at least they will have the security of knowing that, within a certain arena of criteria, they cannot be asked to expend more than $246 for their family. Of course, the only areas that qualify are those that fall within the scheduled fee, but that in itself is still a significant improvement on the previous situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The co-payment of $2.50 is designed to allow for the reduction in rebate to occur, because the reduction in rebate can then be offset by a small charge to the patient, which enables the doctor to stay roughly in the same position in terms of the relative viability or otherwise of his practice, and it cannot be seen to be jeopardising the doctor's position. As I have realised, many doctors in this country partially bulkbill&mdash;they do not totally bulkbill and they do not totally not bulkbill&mdash; so they already have within their surgeries and their office establishments some provision for staff to collect moneys. Whether the moneys are collected in coin or in cheques, or whether the patient pays by `pay doctor cheque' through the Health Insurance Commission, is irrelevant to the process. Effectively, if a doctor already has some provision for collection within his or her surgery and practice, that doctor should, without too much difficulty, be able to collect additional moneys from patients who will now be subject to that small co-payment&mdash;assuming, of course, that the doctor chooses to pass it on to the patient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter that the Minister has been raising for some time now is that there are a number of areas in Australia, and in the metropolitan areas in the main, where there is quite severe competition between GPs and some will choose not to pass on the co-payment for fear of actually losing patients. I think that is a fairly justifiable claim, at least in the short term, if not in the long term. I suspect that in the long term most doctors will utilise the opportunity of actually charging the patient, because it will become accepted practice to do so. I hope, given the Minister's assurances, that we will be able to monitor the way that this provision impacts on the community and that we will be alerted to any areas of significant concern, which of course we trust will not occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been indicated by a number of doctors who have a large bulkbilling patient workload that they have had a concern for some time that many members of their patient group would be prepared to pay something to attend and take advantage of their service but cannot possibly afford the scheduled fee, or above the scheduled fee, as charged by doctors who do not bulkbill frequently. Whilst not an ideal measure, this does provide a way for those doctors to recoup something from their patients, some of whom have actually indicated to doctors that they would not mind paying a small amount but that they are not able to pay, say, the $25 that they might have to pay if they attended a doctor who was not prepared to bulkbill for his or her services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Bill is defensible. It is a Bill which has a lot going for it and it is a very important step in the reform process, albeit, as I say, one that is not totally perfect. We do not always put perfect Bills through, and everything in this life is compromise. I am very pleased to see that the Minister has changed some aspects of the Bill to suit what I believe is the greater purpose of the Bill, and I am particularly pleased to see the co-payment being reduced slightly and also bulkbilling doctors being rewarded in what is effectively a recognition of the efficiencies that present themselves through the bulkbilling process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The health system in Australia does have problems, and the Minister has acknowledged that. They are not problems caused by Medicare, but they are problems which are caused, in the main, by the way we use the services and the way that we have structured many of the operations. It has grown like Topsy to a degree, rather than having been something that people would have planned had they had the opportunity to do so. This whole planning is now occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national health review being carried out by Jenny Macklin will make a significant contribution to what is a very important debate in the community, irrespective of where people stand on questions concerning the health system. I think this Bill will assist with some of the changes that need to occur within our health system, particularly in the area of general practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems also that the whole proposal for a co-payment has caused a lot of concern in the community, possibly because some people do not understand who it will impact upon. Although there will be people at the margin who are not in receipt of a health card or some other form of card, they will not be people who are absolutely destitute. But it will be a matter of some concern if people with a large family and a fairly low income are not in receipt of a card. Some illness may strike their family which means that they have to go to the doctor. I am sure that under those circumstances we can anticipate an element of compassion, in the first instance on the part of the doctor and, secondly, on the part of the system as a whole. Those are the areas that I would be interested in hearing about from people who strike that difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the House to accept the Bill in the spirit in which it has been offered&mdash;that is, a spirit of compromise on the part of the Minister. The legislation will have a lot to do with providing a better health system for Australia, and the restructuring of general practice, which is a necessity if we are to continue to have a healthy nation and a healthy health system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because of the guillotine, I have only eight minutes to speak to the Health Insurance Amendment Bill. This is a very important subject for me and for those whom I represent because the Bill demonstrates a significant change in the philosophy and direction of health funding. There are many things I would like to say on behalf of my constituents, because I have a constituency with very particular health care needs. For example, the census statistics show that my electorate has a greater than national average proportion of its population in both the aged and the young categories&mdash;and they are the two areas requiring very substantial health care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both State and Federal Labor governments have addressed the health needs of my part of the world in such a way that we have very serious shortfalls in health care. I become very angry when I see the impact of both State and Federal government health policies on the people I strive to represent. I have said before in this place, and I am driven to say it again, that the figures do not lie. I wish the Government would get its stereotypes out of its head. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sixty per cent of my electorate lies within the Gold Coast. I think the biggest disadvantage that people who live on the Gold Coast have is the name of the area. In one sense it conjures up fun and enjoyment&mdash;and the Gold Coast is all of those things&mdash;but it also conjures up an image of richness. I would be the first to admit that there is an amount of conspicuous consumption on the Gold Coast, particularly in riverbank housing. However, those who come and only take the river trip do not see the Gold Coast any more than those who go to Sydney and take the harbour trip see Sydney&mdash;they do not see the western suburbs, for example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the figures do not lie. They show that the electorate I represent is very low on the scale of household income. For example, the average household income in my electorate is lower than in the western suburbs of Sydney and some electorates represented by Labor members. Also, because this part of the world chooses, rather overwhelmingly, not to vote Labor, it is assumed that there is wealth&mdash;and there is not. </PARA>
<PARA>I mention all of those things to preface what I am about to say. Assumptions are made about affordability without going into the reality. I want to put this fact on the table:  all of us either have or have had elderly parents. Some of us have or have had quite aged parents. We would know from our own very personal experience that the older people get, the more concerned they become about their health care, and the more defensive they become about arrangements they make for their health care. For example, it is nothing short of traumatic for elderly persons with a fair dependence on their doctor to have to change their doctor. Having certainty in dealing with a doctor that they have dealt with for years is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amongst the elderly in my electorate a number of people of very modest means who do not necessarily qualify for any concessional benefit have taken out, to my great surprise, private hospital insurance. I know the Minister for Community Services and Health (Mr Howe) genuinely cares about the people he is meant to addresses himself to, and I want him to understand this the way I have understood it from what the members of my electorate have said to me, from the fears they reveal to me, as their member of parliament. They take out private health insurance because they are fearful of the need for hospital treatment&mdash;and there is a fairly high probability that they will need treatment in a hospital. They want to have their own doctor and they want to have good care. They make enormous sacrifices to insure themselves for private hospital care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After they put a roof over their head, pay for their food and maybe run a very modest motor vehicle to get to their local bowls club for their entertainment, an enormous amount of the disposable income that is left goes into the health care arena. They have a defensive attitude towards health care. They will not change their doctor because their doctor is forced to change the method of billing. According to the most recent information, from 1 November next year the gap will be $5. These things start to become very significant to people who are substantial users of health care, and who on top of that $5 are paying heavy health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to tell the House what the effect locally would be. Our shadow Minister, the honourable member for Lowe (Dr Bob Woods), pointed out that one of the implications of this change in health funding is that it is highly likely that there will be a shift of demand from the general practitioner to the local hospital. I want to give the House an inkling of what that means in my part of the world. The Gold Coast region has 13 per cent of Queensland's population. The last Goss State Budget gave it 4 per cent of total health funding&mdash;4 per cent for 13 per cent of the population. That might reveal the dependence that Gold Coast people are forced to have on the private sector. In an effort to keep elderly people out of institutions, a lot of emphasis has been put on domiciliary and home nursing care. The Gold Coast region has 12 per cent of the Australian population which is eligible for HACC assistance. From this Labor Government it receives 6 1/2 per cent of the available funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These problems go on and on. My plea is to the Minister: when he is looking for savings to fund his new cities program or anything else, please, no more burdens according to the stereotypes that have obtained for too long.

<PARA>The amendments to the Health Insurance Amendment Bill would enact a number of changes which would supplement and modify the package of reforms represented in the Health Insurance Amendment Bill 1991. These reforms are designed to ensure that Medicare remains a sustainable, equitable and efficient universal health insurance system and are the first stage of reforms in general practice funding to assist the medical profession to improve the quality of care it provides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The package of reforms presented in the Bill embodies the most significant changes since the introduction of Medicare, and consequently generated considerable debate within the community. In response to the concerns raised, the Government subjected the reforms to a process of review through a Caucus working party. Some refinements are now proposed to the Bill through these amendments to ensure the ongoing success of Medicare. I acknowledge the work of the committee. The changes came out of a process which, while not entirely to the agreement of every member of the committee, did achieve some significant reforms. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Migration Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991 introduces amendments aimed at strengthening the effectiveness of Australia's immigration border controls. According to the explanatory memorandum, the Bill's amendments include, first, a definition of the term `offences against the Migration Act' which includes offences against several sections of the Crimes Act 1914 as related to the Migration Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment will ensure that the entry and search powers contained in the Migration Act may be used in relation to offences of attempting to commit, aiding and abetting, urging or inciting or being an accessory or conspiring to commit an offence against the Migration Act. Prosecutions for these offences, the commencement of which may be limited by the Crimes Act, may be commenced within a five-year time limit specified in the Migration Act. In effect, the purpose of this is to enable the provisions relating to aiding and abetting, urging or inciting or being an accessory or conspiring to commit an offence against the Migration Act to be dealt with in the same way as they would be under the Crimes Act where they arise under the Migration Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter is a new division, part 1 to part 2 of the Act, which has been included to permit the obtaining of information and documents about the identity and location of illegal entrants. These provisions also provide for a person to be reimbursed expenses incurred in providing information, documents or copies of documents required. The person may also be provided with a certified copy of any documents which are retained. We are told these powers will enhance the compliance strategy by assisting in the increased location and the reduction in the number of people in Australia illegally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third part of the Bill includes amendments to sections 23 and 33 which will allow regulations to authorise the Minister to fix a numerical limit on the number of visas or permits of a particular class which may be granted in a particular financial year. The Minister's power will be exercised by a notice published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth of Australia Gazette</EMPHASIS>. The power to set limits on the numbers of visas or permits which may be granted will enable greater control on the delivery of the migration program to ensure the published limits are not exceeded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand this is to deal primarily with the new class that the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) announced some time ago and about which we have yet had no detailed information&mdash;the special assistance category. The special assistance category created places at the expense of refugees and those who formerly may have been able to come under the special humanitarian program, but we are told it is desirable that the number of places under that program in any one year be able to be limited. The purpose of this provision is to enable the Minister to make such decisions and to publish them in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth part deals with the introduction of offences in relation to the arranging of marriages or de facto relationships for the purpose of obtaining a visa or entry permit to remain in Australia. There are also offences relating to a person making an application for an entry permit on the basis of a marital relationship when the applicant does not intend to live with the other party in a permanent marital relationship. In line with this, penalties for arranging such relationships are to be $100,000 or 10 years imprisonment or both. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is to be a penalty of two years imprisonment for an Australian citizen or permanent resident to nominate another person on the basis of a contrived marital relationship. There are penalties of 12 months imprisonment and $12,000 for the provision to officers of false or misleading statements about marital relationships and the provision of such statements without the person making the statement taking the trouble to ascertain the truth or accuracy of that statement. Finally, the amendments will also ensure that the regulations may provide for certain matters to be specified by the Minister in a notice published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say, in relation to the generality of these provisions and notwithstanding the comments that I understand have been made by members of the Senate in their role as members of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee, that the Opposition has no principled objections to these amendments since they address concerns that we have frequently expressed in relation to the administration of the migration program. In fact, to highlight the concern I have expressed over time and continue to express about these matters, I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That all words after "That" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"whilst not declining to give the Bill a second reading, the House deplores the Government's failure, in a timely fashion to:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)maintain effective control over Australia's borders as evidenced by the existence of some 70,000 to 150,000 illegal entrants currently in Australia;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have to say that the issue of immigration control is fundamental to the integrity of the whole immigration program. One of the fundamental principles of migration policy accepted by the Opposition and accepted by this Government, as I understand it, is that it must be the role of the elected government acting on behalf of and with the support of the whole community to make the final and absolute decisions on who will or will not be granted entry to Australia on a temporary or permanent basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably, this principle has been clearly compromised over the past few years. That is still the case. A large number of people have entered Australia with the intention of obtaining permanent residence without going through proper channels. The lack of Government resolve to deal with this issue is the most significant factor in contributing to the growth of illegal entry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With a variety of mixed signals, poorly drafted legislation, the hope in some that there may be another amnesty&mdash;notwithstanding the clarity of statements by both the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs and the Opposition&mdash;and the lack of proper employer sanctions, it is little wonder that the flow of illegal entrants into the country still continues apace. All of this has had the effect of undermining public confidence in and acceptance of Australia's immigration program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention in passing, as an indication of what the possible outcomes might be, that only today the Government, in the papers published by the Bureau of Immigration Research, has indicated that the number of places granted in Australia&mdash;that is, to people who were in Australia as visitors or students or on some other temporary basis&mdash;has risen from over 14,000 to over 18,000.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been extraordinarily helpful as a member of the Joint Select Committee on Migration Regulations in prompting the Government as to areas in which it might move in relation to these matters. Some of the legislation arises directly from recommendations that have had that cooperative approach, one that I have always offered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of immigration control has been raised by me, as I have said, on a number of occasions. The Government has been less than diligent in addressing these concerns. The amendment brings out very clearly the Government's failure to address these questions in a timely fashion. Even now, when the program has been clearly shown to be out of control, the deterrent provisions introduced in this Bill do not go far enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several aspects to the problem. One is the number of illegal entrants currently in Australia who have not been given sufficiently accurate information about the number of illegal entrants. When the Government does adduce information, it gives various estimates and fails to take into account the numbers of people who are already within various processing streams and have validated, in part, their illegality by providing applications for other bases upon which they may be able to stay on in Australia. Such people ought to be clearly understood to have been those who ought to be included amongst those numbers. When we seek information from the Government as to the numbers of people that it is able to remove from Australia, it is very difficult to get an accurate picture as to the numbers of people who are added to that number and the numbers of people who have been deleted because either they have been forced to leave Australia or they have left voluntarily. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told that the Department has trebled the number of compliance officers nationally to implement a hardline policy in relation to illegal entrants. The result of all of this activity, according to the Department, is the deportation or voluntary departure of only some 3,500 illegal entrants during the last July to September quarter. Even though we are told that that involves a doubling of the figure for the same time last year, it has not been a trebling of the figure, as the number of additional officers might suggest would be appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does raise other important issues. When the Department put this information out, it did not make it clear that if we used last year's figures as to the numbers of people who became illegal&mdash;those who had been in Australia for 12 months or less; last year the number was over 40,000&mdash;on a quarterly basis it would have been an additional 10,000 who became illegal in the same three month period. Instead of seeing a benefit from that trebling of compliance officers, it would seem to me that we are still going backwards in terms of the numbers of people who are becoming illegal in Australia. That is a matter of very serious concern to me and the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Migration selection criteria have been carefully constructed over the years to best meet the social and economic needs of this country. Except for those who are admitted under family reunion or as refugees, the general principle has been that people are admitted for settlement on the basis that they will not represent an economic burden to Australia through inordinate claims on welfare, health or other resources or who would otherwise endanger the community by criminal activities. The tests that are normally carried out when people come from offshore cannot be carried out adequately if people come to Australia and seek to stay on either legally or otherwise. It constitutes an enormous problem for this country, one that needs to be dealt with rigorously. When the Government addresses these questions in that way, it has our support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The presence of such a large number of uninvited quasi-residents does enormous harm to the integrity of the immigration program because it circumvents the provisions of health criteria, criminal checking and the like. Australian people quite justifiably resent the diminution of their decision making power that does occur in such situations. These people have often been called queue jumpers. They are frequently people who would be unlikely to have been selected if they applied offshore. On that basis, one has to recognise that prima facie they are people who would be unacceptable as migrants in those circumstances. The Australian people justifiably resent the burden of cost that the illegal population places upon them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answer to a question in the Senate Estimates, the Department revealed that during 1991 compliance officers located 9,253 illegal entrants but it was only able to effect the departure from Australia of 4,862. The remainder exercised their entitlement to apply for grant of residence or refugee status. The Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), when he was Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, estimated that the cost of locating illegals was approximately $9,000 per person in 1988. I do not know whether that figure was accurate. Since the Minister gave it to us, I assume that it was. I can only surmise that in 1991 it would be much higher than $9,000 per person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thus, in the last financial year, it would appear to have cost the Australian taxpayers some $45m to find some illegals only to see them apply to remain in Australia on some other basis. These people are testimony to the way in which lack of control of this program has led to very considerable abuse. They represent a large contingent of uninvited queue jumpers who, under the current arrangements which allow them to claim refugee status in many cases, will soon be able to exercise their rights to sponsor other people here in certain circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can legitimately ask: has the Government really done as much as it can to reduce the number of illegal entrants to this country? For example, has it examined the possibility of employer sanctions? We know that most of these people ought to be ineligible for benefits under the welfare system. We know that most of them ought not to be eligible for tax file numbers, although we understand that many people who do not have an entitlement do obtain tax file numbers. No real effort seems to have been made to bring that abuse to an end. We know that in the main they have to obtain employment. There are provisions relating to the harbouring of illegals under section 80 of the Migration Act. A person to be found guilty of that has to conceal an illegal entrant or deportee to prevent discovery by an officer. It would appear to me that harbouring would constitute a much more difficult offence to prove if an employer was merely knowingly engaging an illegal entrant as an employee of a firm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government should be prepared to take up the same sorts of provisions that have been encouraged in the United States, which we are told go to the very heart of any effort to control illegal immigration. There have been numerous studies there and I can show the Minister some of that research. It shows that, if one is to slow down illegal immigration, one must remove the magnet&mdash;the incentive of jobs&mdash;that draws most illegal entrants to the United States. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. It does not have water borders, which is one of the reasons why we have been able to contain it much more so than others. It is not necessarily related to diligence of enforcement provisions. Employer sanctions would achieve this by penalising those who knowingly hire people who are illegal. I am surprised that, notwithstanding the Government's protestations, we have not seen any effort to provide sanctions of that sort. As I have said, provision could be made to strengthen the requirement for the Australian Taxation Office to sight proof of status before tax file numbers are issued to applicants. No effort has been made in relation to that. Certainly, some provision could be made for the issue of tax file numbers for banking purposes for visitors or temporary entrants, as I understand is the case in the United States, if it is argued that they are needed for some other purpose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This system would serve several purposes. Importantly, it would deter the flow of illegals. It would allow employers to have the confidence that their new employees are properly authorised to work. It would cut down on the number of illegal temporary entrants and visitors not authorised to work but who obtain employment. It would also ensure that employers do not discriminate against foreign looking or foreign sounding people only for fear of sanctions and penalties. These are some of the measures that the Government could usefully pursue and I offer them as positive, helpful and constructive suggestions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill also introduces offences relating to sham marriages and de facto relationships for the purposes of obtaining a visa or entry permit to Australia. The number of people making applications for change of status on marriage or de facto grounds has increased rapidly in the past few years and abuse in this area of the immigration program has been unacceptably high. People applying under this category from overseas are admitted through the family reunion program. This category accounted for 44 per cent of migrants in 1989-90 and the same level is planned for 1990-91. The number of people entering Australia as spouses or de factos has increased dramatically in recent years, from 9,200 in 1983-84 to 13,300 in 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Allegations and evidence of fraudulent activities on the part of individuals and migration agents are widespread. In view of this, the maximum penalties attached to offences in this area, which are severe, in my view are not excessive. Of course, it was the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations, when it presented its final report on spouse and de facto immigration, which drew attention to these matters. At that time I expressed my concern&mdash;</PARA>

This was done recently in regulations by the Minister and I commend him for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to touch on the refugee determination process. This is a matter of crisis for this country&mdash;a matter of very significant proportion. The fact that the Government now admits that there are some 24,000 claimants in the system, and that that number is still growing at 1,000 per month, ought to be of alarm to every Australian. When it is understood that in the past we handled fewer than 500 applicants, the enormity of this problem can be understood. Even with increased funding and extra staff, 13,000 primary decisions will be made, but only 3,632 applications will have been through the review process this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since it would be unreasonable to expect that people who have their applications refused in the first tier of review will not want to press their claims further and apply for a second tier review, I do not see how the backlog can be cleared for many years. Given that the figures from the Government disclose only 15 per cent of the program budget for funds for the final review stage, I cannot see how this will be adequate to deal with the anticipated case load. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, the developments in this area are  intolerable. Legislation to limit the access to change of status claims by illegals was passed in 1989. The impact of these provisions restricted access to the humanitarian and compassionate classes and thus left claims for refugee status as the only alternative route to residency. That was a decision of this Government and it is one of the reasons why the refugee program is now so seriously under threat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect of it relates to the decisions. I do not blame the Minister for this, but I do blame his Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in relation to the decision on the Chinese students in Australia at the time of Tiananmen Square. The pipeline processing&mdash;the Minister will be familiar with the jargon&mdash;whereby 25,000 other students from the People's Republic of China were admitted without any bona fides testing after the Tiananmen Square massacre is testimony to the abject failure of his colleague the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), who ought to be held personally accountable for the enormous problem that this country faces in relation to this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a well-known fact that the majority&mdash;about 17,000&mdash;of the 24,000 people claiming refugee status are people from the People's Republic of China who came after Tiananmen Square through this pipeline processing arrangement. The fact is that this has compromised seriously our ability to provide for protection for the people who have genuine claims and need for protection. I find that an intolerable situation. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen the problems that the Department has faced through the impact of judicial law making in allowing quasi-permanent entry to so many people where claims are already suspect. It has served to limit further the potential that this nation has to assist the genuine refugees in some of the most hideous camps offshore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past 18 months over 300 undocumented arrivals in Australia, claiming to be Vietnamese or Khmer, have made claims for protection. Yet in all the time since then we still have no formal outcome in relation to their status. Their detention occurs at considerable expense to the Australian taxpayers. This is also a matter of very considerable concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is worrying, of course, is that with this situation in which there is no clear outcome it is hard to believe that others would not contemplate journeys to Australia to try to obtain the same sort of opportunity for themselves. Failure to act with courage and resolve to remove illegal entrants after proper and prompt consideration of claims for protection only serves to generate a further insurmountable backlog of claims and sends a clear signal to the international community that we cannot control our borders. </PARA>

I do not blame the Minister personally for it but I do blame his colleagues who have forced decisions which have allowed this to occur. It is clearly a matter for which the Government is accountable.

I do not know why the Minister has to make a number of decisions of a very unpalatable kind, I imagine, to him in relation to those who are seeking to come here as migrants, through cost recovery, through bond arrangements, and other charges that have to be made.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to support the Migration Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1991. I completely disagree with what the Opposition is proposing to do in its amendments because this Bill, through its amendments, is aimed at strengthening the effectiveness of Australia's immigration controls and&mdash;if the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) would like to read it and understand it&mdash;is a part of the continuing examination of our migration legislation under the present Minister, the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, this Bill deals with illegal entrants to Australia. The amendments contained in the Bill will provide a power to identify and to locate illegal entrants and create offences relating to arrangement and use of contrived marriages or de facto relationships to gain residential status in Australia. These offences will also extend to the interdependency category to safeguard against the potential of abuse of the system by those under that category. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The term `illegal entrant' is defined by the Migration Act as a non-citizen who has entered Australia illegally or who entered legally but no longer has authority to remain. It also includes those whose stay is irregular, those who have overstayed their immigration leave or those who have secured an extension of stay or residence by deception. This Government, I am very proud to say, is not prepared to allow illegal entrants to undermine the integrity of the migration program or to allow them to have access to benefits and services to which they have no entitlement. The vigorous strategy of the Department of Immigration in locating, arresting and sending home those people who do not depart Australia when their permits expire has continued unabated as a result of legislation introduced by this Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the honourable member for Dundas would have to admit that the Government's hardline policy on illegal immigrants is obviously having a significant impact on the numbers of people overstaying their visas, as overall numbers of illegal entrants in Australia are now decreasing. However, other measures, such as those contained in this Bill, are necessary as the Government will not tolerate the persistent presence of the many thousands of illegals still in Australia. The message must continue to be hammered home that Australia is not a happy-go-lucky haven for people who thumb their noses at our immigration laws, but is a country where those laws are rigorously applied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The estimated number of `overstayers' at 30 April this year was 78,000, a reduction, I am pleased to say, of some 13 per cent from the figure of 90,000 some 12 months earlier. This result has been achieved in the face of a 10 per cent increase in the number of people arriving for temporary stay. In the three years to 1990, four million visitors and 167,000 students arrived in Australia. In 1990, 58,000 visitors to Australia overstayed, and 52,000 overstayed in 1991. There was a decrease in the number of students who overstayed illegally from 16,000 in 1990 to 12,000 in 1991, a figure which is particularly significant as, unfortunately, the nationals of some countries still view student visas as a back door to immigration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, illegal entrants are starting to take notice of this Minister and this Government's continued message to them to pack their bags and to go home. However, further legislation, such as that contained in the Bill before the House, is needed to address those illegals who are more determined to stay in Australia. This Bill, by allowing the Minister to obtain information and other relevant records regarding a suspected illegal who has evaded border immigration controls, such as ship crew deserters or stowaways, will help the Department of Immigration locate those illegals and provide a more accurate count of their numbers. Legislation which confronts the issue of illegal entrants is long overdue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The immigration debate is not helped in any way by the continued presence of illegals within the community. This is obvious from an article in the March 1991 issue of the journal <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Urban Policy and Research</EMPHASIS>. According to that article, the population of Australia is growing at a faster rate than that of any other country in the developed world. Some of this growth is due to natural increase, but immigration already accounts for more than half. Immigration will make an even larger relative contribution as natural increase slowly declines towards the year 2031. If we continue to add migrants at the present rate we will add an extra 10 million people over the next 40 years, two million from natural increase and eight million from immigration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although I may not agree entirely with the figures presented in that article, the point is still there that immigration does contribute to our population growth, which is another reason why it is so important that we control the level of illegal immigrants coming to Australia as best we can.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That particular journal article went on to say that Sydney was now the destination of some 35 per cent of immigrants into Australia and, combined with geographical constraints on Sydney's expansion, meant that the effects of immigration on the urban infrastructure were being felt acutely in that area. This is an issue which I feel this Government will very soon have to address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill before the House, however, is a finetuning of the migration legislation and is partly in response to the first report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations on illegal entrants in Australia, which was brought down in September 1990. I have read that report. I have also read the alternative report brought down by the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock). I believe that even he will have to admit that the amendments in this Bill certainly not only cover a lot of that report but also have been led by the investigation of that Committee.<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report itself made many recommendations in regard to illegal entrants and clearly stated the Committee's desire for the problem of illegals to be addressed. The report stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a long waiting list of applicants seeking migrant entry to Australia. For each immigrant who secures a visa by fraud or each illegal entrant permitted to remain, other qualified applicants may be left behind or left to wait longer for a visa. Illegal immigration severely taxes the resources of immigration staff and may undermine the political resolve needed to maintain the integrity of and public support for the immigration program.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The control of illegals has taken on a new urgency in recent years because the problem is coupled with, or compounded by, fears of an increased movement of asylum seekers. . . The presence of illegal entrants has come, whether correctly or not, to symbolise the inability of governments to control their borders and, in Australia's case, to protect the integrity of its immigration program.</PARA>
<PARA>According to that report, the Department's illegal entrant figures are largely based on information derived from their movement records and details from passenger cards which are filled in by people arriving in and departing from Australia. According to the Committee's report, the estimates of overstaying illegals based on such data must be inaccurate. The report also stated that the estimated number of overstayers must be less than the actual number, because up till 1988, the Department did not count those who overstayed less than six months. It also excluded those people who have lodged applications to extend their stay or changed status whilst still lawfully here but whose permits have expired during processing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Department told that Committee in evidence that the accuracy with which it can calculate the number of overstayers has improved from about 70 per cent accuracy in the mid-1970s to some 90 per cent accuracy now. Nevertheless, the number of illegal immigrants currently in Australia is unacceptable. This Bill carries on from other measures which this Government and this Minister have already introduced in the last few years to help deter illegal entrants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In August 1990, in a bid to reduce the number of illegal entrants in Australia, the number of compliance staff in the Immigration Department's regional offices was more than trebled to 150. Since then the staff has worked to a detailed compliance strategy and has been supported by enhanced computer systems. The cost of these additional resources and systems has been offset by a new fee structure for processing certain categories of visa applications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Enhancements to computer systems have provided more timely data to compliance staff. But, more importantly, they have enabled other government agencies, such as the Department of Social Security and Medicare, within the limits of the Privacy Act, to check the residence status of applicants before approving a benefit or service. Such action results in considerable savings to taxpayers through the exclusion of ineligible applicants from receiving benefits and services. It also makes it harder for illegal entrants to support themselves and removes some of the incentives to them to stay in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The additional compliance staff has resulted in giving the Department much more strength to follow up temporary entrants who overstay their temporary entry permits, allows it to follow up people whose applications to remain are rejected and to ensure that they actually leave. It also enables it to apprehend illegal entrants who are working, to deport criminal illegal entrants and to investigate organised immigration rackets, such as contrived marriages and the importation of foreign prostitutes, with a view to prosecuting the organisers and enforcing migration law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has prided itself on its efforts to become a fully multicultural society. Over the past two years, the Hawke Government has introduced the most fundamental changes to immigration policy in 30 years through its commitment to the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of ethnic background or race. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Political commentator Paul Kelly wrote a special feature on immigration in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, and while it was on 28 May 1990 it is still applicable today. He stated in that article:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The two great ideas which have dominated Australia's approach to immigration have been the drive to expand the population and the determination to maintain the quality of the immigration intake.</PARA>
<PARA>Paddy McGuinness, also in that special feature, wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Few, if any other, countries in the world have such a good record in the creation of an integrated multicultural society. This is something which should never be forgotten in the course of the debate on immigration policy.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, the Government has been heading in the right direction with its immigration policies, and this Bill is no exception. Our immigration laws are, by necessity, increasingly stringent, and this Bill ensures that tougher procedures are adhered to in order to benefit the Australian community at large. The offences which are created in this Bill largely deal with those entrants who have lied and entered into sham marriages or de facto relationships to obtain permanent residence in Australia, without being true to those relationships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many examples of contrived marriages currently occurring in Australia with a view to obtaining permanent residence in this country. I am aware of four such examples which have now been dealt with by our Department, and particularly under our now legal system. The first example I want to mention is that of an Australian female who married an overseas national who was in Australia on a tourist visa. On obtaining permanent residence following the marriage, the male divorced the Australian female and sponsored his original wife for entry into Australia. The Australian female then sponsored another male from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example that I have been made aware of is that of an Australian female who sponsored a male from overseas as a de facto spouse so that he could obtain permanent residence. At the same time, however, the female sponsored another male for migrant entrance as her spouse. This woman was prosecuted and fined $1,000 with three years good behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also been informed of an agent who recruits females to undergo bogus marriages. The agent backdates marriage documents and conspires with the marriage celebrant to complete documents with false information. The last example I am aware of is that of an Australian male who married a female from the People's Republic of China for payment. This male also recruits others to do likewise and has gone witness to 15 other marriages, seven of which to date have been confirmed bogus marriages. I am certain that there are many thousands more examples, some of which would be much more serious than those that I have just outlined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In evidence to the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations, the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs indicated that deception after entry into Australia was rife, at least by those who, for immigration purposes, contracted sham marriages or marriages of convenience. According to the report, the Committee received a number of submissions which were concerned with the issue of bogus marriages, some from women who had been taken advantage of by unscrupulous men and whose primary objective was to gain entry to Australia. That report also commented on the fact when it stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is adamant that in clear cases where such bogus or sham marriages are detected, the non-Australian partner, who has used the marriage to gain entry to or stay in Australia, should be removed from Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>I quote again from that report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee heard evidence that some migration agents operate marriage bureaux, which appear to encourage the practice of contracting a marriage for immigration purposes. Certain agents apparently confiscate and hold clients' passports until the fees owing are paid in full. It appears to the Committee that such unscrupulous migration agents almost certainly encourage applicants to lodge unmeritous applications for change of status and at times may themselves contrive or connive at fraud practised on the Immigration Department.</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill addresses such problems and tackles them head on. It allows the Department to clamp down on and charge people who are conducting false marriages or de facto relationships to gain residency. All players in the arrangement of a non-genuine marriage or non-genuine de facto relationship for migration purposes will be punishable by 10 years imprisonment, a $100,000 fine or both. Offences have also been created within this Bill for purposely making a false statement in regard to a marriage to gain permanent residence in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">International law recognises the sovereign rights of nations to determine who may enter into and remain within their territory. This legislation is important in order to ensure that the effectiveness of Australia's immigration controls is maintained and enhanced so that only those people with a right to enter and remain in this country may do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other important facets in this Bill before the House. I know that time will not permit me to go into those.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I want to refer the Minister to some of the remarks that he made in his second reading speech. I remind him of what he said. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia must have effective immigration controls to ensure that only those persons who are entitled to enter and remain in Australia do so.</PARA>
<PARA>We agree with that. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will not tolerate the continued presence of illegal entrants in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that contrasts rather markedly with the fact that there is, in fact, a very significant continued presence of illegal entrants to Australia. The Government has tolerated them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one listens to what the honourable member for Prospect (Mrs Crosio) said, one could almost be convinced because of the way in which she stands up here and makes her points. I think she could probably try to sell ice to Eskimos with a straight face. She has not convinced me by any means. I do not think that she has convinced anyone on this side of the House that the Government has, in fact, done very much at all to address this particular problem of the number of illegal entrants that there have been into Australia hence, of course, the amendment which has been moved by the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) and which I have had great pleasure in seconding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister has pointed out in his speech that there are people who will go to extreme lengths to enter or remain in Australia. He has also said that the use of contrived marriages or de facto relationships for obtaining residence in Australia is unacceptable. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion, these amendments&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is the amendments that he has moved to the Act and which we are debating tonight&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">demonstrate the Government's continued vigilance to ensure that the effectiveness of Australia's immigration controls is maintained and, where necessary, enhanced so that only those persons with a right to enter and remain in Australia may do so.</PARA>
<PARA>I must say that the rhetoric, some of which we agree with, is not matched by the actions of the Minister or his government. If it were so, we would not even be having this debate. These sorts of statements are really motherhood. He is absolutely right in making those statements but, unfortunately, he has failed to deliver. We regret that. The issue of immigration control is certainly fundamental to the integrity of the entire immigration system. Unfortunately, as I said, despite the rhetoric that we hear, the action has been to the contrary. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Mr Hand" NAMEID="5H4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5H4">Mr Hand</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You have just actually been a party to encouraging people to break the immigration law with the South Africans. You encourage people to by-pass the law. You did,  outside this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FT4">Mr BRADFORD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to tell the Minister about that. I am glad that he has given me the opportunity to raise that matter. That is one issue that I intend to raise with him during the course of this debate. So if he can settle down and relax for a moment, I will come to that shortly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I need to put in context what I have to say about that issue. Firstly, we need to recognise that there are as many as 150,000 illegal immigrants here&mdash;overstayers, illegal entrants or however one would like to describe them. The honourable member for Prospect is shaking her head. I do not know. She should tell me how many there are. She would like to pretend that there is a smaller number. She would like to say that there are 70,000 or something less. There could be 250,000 for all she knows or, in fact, I know. But the point is that there is a very significant number. We are wasting time talking about tens of thousands one way or the other and the fact that they are here. That is the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us talk about that particular problem. As I have said in debates on this issue on many occasions, these people are here taking jobs from Australians at a time when there is very significant unemployment, particularly unemployment amongst young people. Many of these people who are here illegally and staying illegally are taking jobs from young Australians. That should motivate us to catch these people and throw them out. The other thing, of course, is that these people are not paying taxes. That also is of great concern to me as I am sure it is to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> So we are dealing with legislation here which strengthens some of the regulations in respect of immigration border controls. As the honourable member for Dundas said, we have no problem with giving departmental officials greater powers to identify and locate illegal entrants. We support that particular action. I ought to say that I think employers have something of a moral obligation, if not a legal one, and a responsibility to ensure that they do not employ people who are not entitled to work. I have made that point here before. In effect, they may inadvertently be aiding and abetting illegal entrants by not doing so. Whilst they are not specifically required to check that people working for them are bona fide citizens or residents, I think that they have an obligation in the present cirumumstance, where we have this unemployment, to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand, employers do have a responsibility within the broad context of section 80 of the Act because they would fall into the general category of those who may knowingly harbour an illegal entrant. In fact, there are significant penalties for that. Of course, the difficulty lies in proving that the employer actually knows that the person is an illegal entrant. Whether merely employing and paying an illegal entrant amounts to aiding and abetting under section 80 is probably a matter for conjecture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer specifically to the amendment moved by the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), which, as I mentioned, I had the pleasure of seconding. We do not propose to deny the Bill a second reading, but we do deplore the Government's failure in a timely fashion to maintain effective control over Australia's borders, to locate and remove illegal entrants from Australia expeditiously, to administer effectively areas of the immigration program to eliminate areas in which fraud and abuse are evident and, finally, to establish a fair and expeditious refugee determination process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, because of the extent of this problem, the Government has failed. We deplore its failure; hence the amendment we are moving tonight. I do not think that these amendments are moved lightly. We on this side of the House are condemning the Government and the Minister for their failure to act in a timely fashion to locate and remove illegal entrants from Australia, and to do so expeditiously. The number of illegal entrants who remain in Australia is glaring testimony to the Government's failure in this particular area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to the point the Minister asked me about a moment ago, and I thank him for doing so. There is an irony here that I must take the opportunity of referring to. I assume that the Minister was talking about the world wave ski titles which were held on the Gold Coast a couple of weeks ago. Let me put it in context. We have a serious problem in the country with illegal immigrants&mdash;number unknown, but certainly tens and tens of thousands&mdash;taking jobs from Australians and not paying taxes. We ought to be getting out there and catching them and throwing them out. However, what do we have?  We have officials of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, in numbers, down at the beach at the Gold Coast disrupting a surfing contest. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move on and refer the Minister to another little problem referred to in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gold Coast Bulletin</EMPHASIS>.

The infiltration of organised crime into this country has occurred and is occurring. <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>I do not know the extent of it. But there are people coming out here, and these people were caught after they got here. What I want to ask the Minister is how they got here in the first place. The point I am making to the Minister and the point that was made by the ABC's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program&mdash;about which I have asked the Minister questions&mdash;is: what is the Government doing to protect the credibility of the many Japanese companies which are operating here legally and in a bona fide manner?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have significant numbers of Japanese people working here and corporations who have invested here and who have no taint of corruption. They deserve to be protected. They have questioned me as to why we are allowing some of their compatriots who are known to have organised crime links to come to this country. I have asked the Minister whether the Australian Federal Police has sufficient resources to properly check these people out before they come here. This is a serious problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people are pragmatic about it and say, `Look, they have got money to spend.

It is incumbent on the Government, in its policing of the issue of visas and, indeed, in other ways, to make sure that Australian business is not infiltrated by organised crime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Minister is being so attentive, I will draw his attention to another relevant case of an illegal immigrant in Australia who is making a meal of it while we sit by and watch. Mrs Bustamante de Brady, a Colombian national, arrived in Australia on a tourist visa in June 1990, almost 18 months ago. She extended her visa a number of times and when the visa finally expired&mdash;she did not have a tourist visa any more&mdash;it turned out that she applied for permanent residency. I wonder whether that application should ever have been accepted in the first place, but it was. This woman is here with a tourist visa that has been extended a number of times. When that runs out she applies for permanent residency and the application is accepted. However, she was asked to leave the country by 27 July 1991, after her application had been turned down. What does she do now? She applies for Australian citizenship. This is terrific. She is still here. I do not know how she managed to apply for Australian citizenship because, as I understand it, she had to be here as a permanent resident for two years, but she was here as a tourist. However, she has applied for Australian citizenship. </PARA>

For example, in the case of marriage and de facto relationships, as the honourable member for Dundas well knows, it is not just a question of getting tough; it is also a question of balancing that toughness with respect for people's fundamental human rights. In this country we respect the right of marriage for genuine marriages.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If anyone in this chamber thinks that it is a simple question to make that determination, he has not studied the issue. As the report makes clear, it is a very complex question; it involves a complex set of determinations which the immigration officer has to make and there is a procedure for appeal in certain instances. We have tried to balance&mdash;as we have throughout&mdash;these complex issues concerning illegal immigrants and their rights on the one hand and the rights of the Australian community on the other; people making claims on the basis of change of status for marriage; and the current and very difficult problem concerning the huge blow-out in applications for in-country refugee and humanitarian determination. This is the problem we have to address as a Parliament. </PARA>

I have appealed to people from all sides of the Parliament to come forward if they have any good ideas or if they know of ways and means of dealing with this very difficult issue, including the honourable member for Dundas, who is the Deputy Chairman. If he has good ideas he should come forward with them, rather than coming into the chamber and saying, amongst other things, that the Government has failed to establish a fair and expeditious refugee determination process. What nonsense. When the problems were identified the Committee moved quickly and made an interim recommendation to the Minister.

<PARA>In the two minutes remaining to me I will try to respond to a number of the claims made earlier in this debate and I will speak to the amendments. The amendments seek to further strengthen the legislation. It is interesting to note when one is confronted by the Opposition spokesman, the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock), and his henchmen, in terms of their contributions to this policy area, that they steer a very wide course on the issues before the House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable member's amendment was a clever sleight of hand trick to widen the parameters of the debate. He moved it knowing full well that under the Standing Orders there is a very limited time for me to respond to those claims. But his contribution to the debate was in his normal style of a gentle pat of support and a belt around the ears in the next breath. But most of his attempts at belts around the ears missed the mark, because he is wrong. He makes out that this is a simple area of policy delivery for the Government and the Department. He makes claims in his amendment of 150,000 illegal entrants&mdash;based on what, no-one knows&mdash;when clearly the Government has said, from the official records, that 78,000 people are in Australia illegally and we are pursuing them with great vigour, in line with the recommendations of the committee which he is Deputy Chairman of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat what the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) said: I am determined, in a way in which no other Minister has applied himself or herself, to eradicate illegal entrants from this country, and I will continue to be, but I am sometimes confronted with situations such as the one on the Gold Coast, where people, with the support of members of this House, flagrantly breach the regulations and have the gall to come here and say to me, `You are not doing enough'. They encourage people to breach the regulations, so that is the grossest form of hypocrisy I have ever encountered. It is hypocrisy in the extreme to come in here and whinge, whine and grovel about illegals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My departmental officers pursued the law, and the law will be obeyed in terms of illegals.

For honourable members to come into this place and name individuals and expect me to respond in individual cases is another example of an amazing performance.

The pathology initiatives which I announced in the Budget were in response to two things&mdash;first, the National Health Strategy Background Paper No 6 `Directions in Pathology' and second, longer term statistical evidence which has indicated that pathology services have been increasing at a disproportionate rate when compared with other medical services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The package of initiatives has been developed in consultation with representative bodies from the pathology profession. The package includes industry structural reforms, savings measures and schedule fee reforms, which will be the basis for further negotiated restructuring. I have also established the Pathology Advisory Committee to advise me about implementation of ongoing reforms. The Committee membership comprises my Department, the Health Insurance Commission and the pathology profession represented by the Australian Association of Pathology Practices and the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key components of the initiative are the introduction of a licensing scheme for pathology specimen collection centres and proposed regulatory amendments to the Pathology Services Table. A single level schedule fee will be introduced, as opposed to the current SP and OP levels. The schedule fee will be set at 70 per cent of the current SP rate for all services except for certain items of cytology and histopathology, and four high-volume tests. New transaction fees, which represent costs other than those directly involved in the test procedure, including the costs associated with transporting of specimens to the laboratory and collecting samples, will be introduced to offset the reduction in the schedule fee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an attempt to increase their share of pathology service delivery, there are indications that some pathology practices compete with each other by providing significant inducements for treating practitioners to request pathology services from their practice. Some pathologists may place their trained staff within a doctor's surgery, and this action may not only reduce the doctor's ability to choose between pathologists on a service-by-service basis, but may have the undesirable effect of significantly increasing the amount of pathology ordered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1 February, in order to be licensed, a collection centre must be an independent facility, owned or leased by an approved pathology authority, which is set up with appropriate equipment and supplies for the collection of pathology specimens. The centre must be staffed by employees of that approved pathology authority and include staff trained in specimen collection procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is generally recognised within the pathology profession that there are too many collection centres in this country, many of which are operating in very close proximity. Often this has the effect of being inefficient and adding unnecessary expense to the provision of pathology services. The number and location of collection centres will be reviewed in cooperation with representatives from the pathology profession, with a view to reducing the number significantly over a two-year period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The formula for the allocation of licences for permanent collection centres is based on the volume of pathology services, the number of full time equivalent specialist pathologists associated with the practice and the number of treating practitioners who request pathology from that practice. The number of centres operated by some pathology practices will exceed the number which may be granted a licence under the new arrangements. Excess centres may receive temporary licensing and will be phased out over two years. From 1 February 1992, private approved pathology authorities will be required to hold a licence for each of their collection centres, to enable the payment of Medicare benefits in respect of pathology services rendered at those centres. The licence fee has been set at $1,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently established pathology practices will be eligible to apply for up to three licences, and so new market entrants will be assisted during their first year of operation. In addition, on a proven needs basis, special consideration may be given to granting licences to centres which service rural areas currently. The new transaction fees are intended to cover costs other than the test procedure itself and include indirect operational costs, professional quality assurance, courier and collection costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new transaction fees will be applicable on an episodic basis&mdash;that is, a claim may be made for the provision of pathology services requested by a practitioner in respect of one individual on the same day. For example, if a practitioner orders four pathology tests for a person on one day, Medicare benefits will be payable for each of those tests but only one transaction fee may be applicable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taken together with the reduction of the schedule fees for individual services, the introduction of an episodic transaction fee will remove a distortion in the present arrangements which reimburses pathology providers more than once, where multiple tests are ordered on the same specimen, for costs incurred only once in collecting the specimen. The transaction fees are two tiered. A higher transaction fee of $15.50 will be set for specimens collected in licensed permanent collection centres, private or recognised hospitals, the patient's residence or in licensed day hospital facilities. The specimen must be collected by an employee of the proprietor of the laboratory in which the pathology service will be rendered or an approved pathology practitioner associated with that laboratory. A lower transaction fee of $9.50 will be set for specimens collected in licensed temporary collection centres or the surgery of a treating doctor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certain histology and cytology items will be subject to a different transaction fee structure. This will give recognition to the greater degree of complexity of specimens taken from hospital in-patients. Hospital in-patients generally require more specialised attention than outpatients, and this is reflected in the rendering of some pathology services as compared with those services performed in non-hospital settings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill provides for specific circumstances under which a Medicare benefit for a pathology service will not be payable. A Medicare benefit for a pathology service will not be payable where the pathology specimen is collected in an unlicensed collection centre. Any person who operates an unlicensed centre will be required to take all reasonable steps to inform both the person from whom the specimen is to be taken and the pathologist who may perform the pathology service that Medicare benefits will not be payable for the service. A Medicare benefit for a pathology service will not be payable where inappropriate agreement, arrangement or incentive for ordering the service exists between the approved pathology practitioner rendering the service, the treating practitioner requesting the service or a medical entrepreneur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reform of collection centre arrangements is being undertaken to negate the potential for this nexus. There must be no functional, direct or indirect, pecuniary or other beneficial contractual arrangement or understanding in relation to the ordering of pathology between the approved pathology authority, a pathologist, the treating practitioner, employer or employee of the practitioner, or any other party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reforms I have outlined are supported by strengthening sections 129AA and 129AAA of the Health Insurance Act 1973. These sections relate to bribery and prohibited practices in relation to the rendering of pathology services. The categories of persons which can commit an offence against these sections has been broadened, and in particular it will include bodies corporate which in some instances have been used to avoid the restrictions placed on individuals. Penalties for breach of the conditions of these sections have also been increased significantly. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to assure honourable members that the importance of appropriate use of pathology in disease prevention and diagnosis is well recognised and supported by the Government. However, inefficiencies in the current arrangements, plus inappropriate use of pathology services, create an unacceptable burden on our health system and the Government's reforms are designed to reduce these inefficiencies and produce a more cost-effective industry.

<PARA>The Australian Institute of Health Amendment Bill seeks to amend the Australian Institute of Health Act 1987 to enable the Institute to undertake the collection, analysis and publication of statistics in the fields of welfare services and housing assistance. This is the first step in a process to develop and strengthen national welfare statistics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need for national welfare statistics has been recognised for many years. Major reports calling for the development of national welfare statistics have included: in 1975, the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration and the Henderson Commission of Inquiry into Poverty; in 1976, the Bailey Task Force on Co-ordination in Welfare and Health; and the 1979 Baume report on evaluation in Australian health and welfare services from the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been previous attempts to address the concerns. In 1976 the Commonwealth and State governments attempted to improve the situation by establishing WELSTAT with a secretariat maintained by the Commonwealth. The aim was to establish national statistical standards for social welfare data. Intermittent national data was published on adoptions, children in care and emergency relief but data quality problems prevented regular publication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1987-88 the Commonwealth contribution to the WELSTAT secretariat ceased. Since then there have been Commonwealth-State discussions on data collections for individual programs and States have continued some development work in the general child welfare area. Considerable work remains to be done. This Government has decided to put in place definite steps to address the problem. The development of a national welfare data role by the Institute is regarded as an essential part of fulfilling the framework for determining roles and responsibilities agreed by the Special Premiers Conference in October 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Plans to enhance the Institute's role had their roots in the October 1990 Special Premiers Conference. At that time, heads of government agreed that the collation of nationally consistent data was essential for the framework for rationalising Commonwealth, State and local government roles in policy planning, service delivery and evaluation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Attachment 3 of the Special Premiers Conference communique set out a framework for determining roles and responsibilities in service delivery. It stated that, in determining the allocation of functions to the spheres of government, considerations should include the need for clear and direct accountability to the electorate and client group, and the achievement of effective evaluation and monitoring mechanisms at the least possible administrative cost to government and service providers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the October Special Premiers Conference, I established a working group chaired by Professor Bettina Cass to advise me on a proposed role for the Australian Institute of Health to encompass the collation of welfare statistics. The working group recommended that the Institute's role should be expanded to encompass data on programs which provide welfare, community services and housing. Health and welfare Ministers, at their meeting on 6 September 1991, agreed to the expanded role and that existing State based data collections of child maltreatment and substitute care be included as a priority area. Housing Ministers have indicated their support of this initiative. Ministers also agreed that a memorandum of understanding would be developed jointly between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories outlining the rights and responsibilities of all parties in relation to the Institute's expanded role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Institute of Health was set up by an Act of this Parliament in 1987. As a statutory body with its own charter, and with the States represented on its board, the Institute has been recognised as a genuinely national body, rather than an agent of the Commonwealth. It has been active in improving national health statistics, and successful in working constructively and cooperatively with Commonwealth, State and Territory authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Achievements of the Institute include the development of a national minimum data set for institutional health care; progress towards a national health labour force data collection covering a number of health professionals; progress towards a national cancer statistics clearing house; inventory of Australian health data collections, and initiating the development of a national health information agreement. With this track record it is a suitable body to undertake the development of national welfare and housing assistance statistics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An enhanced Institute will improve the availability and quality of statistics on welfare services. This information on welfare services and their impact on the Australian population will be available to governments, researchers and the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Statistics will be gathered from programs whether they are administered solely by my Department, are jointly administered by the Commonwealth and the State and Territory governments, or are solely the responsibility of State and Territory governments. This will cover a wide range of services which are used by the vast majority of Australians at some time in their lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Child care services, including services related to parental participation in education, training and the labour force, will be included. Services specific to the welfare of children, including child protection and substitute care from the State based welfare data collections, that is, the WELSTAT collections to which I referred earlier, will, subject to State funding, become the Institute's responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other major areas in which the Institute will produce data are aged care services, services for people with disabilities, and housing assistance. With the increasing ageing of the Australian population over the next three decades, it will be increasingly important for both governments and the community to have access to comprehensive data on aged care services. This will make it possible to monitor the quality and effectiveness of existing services and to plan for the future, to meet the needs of disadvantaged groups and to reduce variations in access to, and quality of, services across the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth-State disability agreement has set the scene for a fundamental restructuring of the administration of disability services whereby the Commonwealth takes responsibility for employment services and the States take responsibility for accommodation services. The data on disability services which the Institute will collate will enable governments and non-government service providers to monitor the progress and effectiveness of that agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Improvements in data on housing assistance will be another important feature of this initiative. The term `housing assistance' includes the Commonwealth-State housing agreement, the supported accommodation assistance program and the crisis accommodation program. In order to be able to respond to the needs of people in situations of housing stress, comprehensive information is required on what services are available and what they provide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As it did in the health field, the Institute will develop its welfare role through a process of active consultation to take place at all levels. Representatives of State and Territory welfare and housing departments will be added to the board of the Institute. States will therefore be integrated into the process of setting objectives and priorities for the collation of welfare data. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To provide a framework for this consultative process I have agreed to the establishment of a National Health and Welfare Information Council. The Council's major tasks will be to advise the Institute's board on the development of national health, welfare and housing assistance data and priorities; and the development of the Institute's work program and priorities. This Council will have members from the Commonwealth, representatives of all State and Territory health, welfare and housing authorities, together with input from key organisations in the health, welfare and housing information fields. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I expect to see the National Health and Welfare Information Council being pro-active in raising the level of community awareness and understanding of the need for and benefits of national information in the health and welfare areas. The Council will stimulate the development of a national approach to our health and welfare information systems, provide a valuable forum for exchanges of ideas and have a vital input to the Institute's decision making process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the Institute's expanded role in relation to that of the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The Bureau is responsible for the coordination of all national statistics in Australia. Subject to this overall coordination, the Institute will be responsible for the development, coordination and production of national statistics relating to welfare services and housing assistance. The ABS will retain responsibility for the coordination and production of statistics relating to the general well-being of the Australian population. The Institute will develop, in consultation with the Bureau, statistical standards and classifications relevant to welfare services and housing assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the collection of welfare services and housing assistance data, privacy and confidentiality requirements will be met. The Institute's existing legislation has provisions which provide for the confidentiality of all such records. The amendments in this Bill make no change to these provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation provides for the Institute to produce a report every two years providing statistics and related information concerning the provision of welfare services to the Australian people, and an outline of the development of welfare related information by the Institute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The task facing the Institute is challenging. This legislation provides the basis for the Institute's move into the welfare area. The short term aim of establishing national welfare data needs to be carried out in a practical and flexible manner, with an awareness of variations between States. A longer term objective is to develop uniform national data collections. This task will need to be undertaken in a number of stages to make it manageable, but is of major importance if the Institute is to produce data to meet those purposes I have outlined.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major purpose of this Bill is to implement decisions in the area of aged care announced by the Government in the 1991-92 Budget. Accordingly, the Bill proposes a significant amendment to the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954 to enable community care packages to be provided to frail older people continuing to reside in their own homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable members will appreciate that the fundamental objective of the Government's aged care policy is to extend the independence of older people in the community through the provision of care services. All surveys of older people have shown that they prefer to stay at home and receive care, rather than move to a residential facility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of community aged care services packages is an important step in this process. As was announced in the Budget, rather than having a long term target to provide 60 hostel places per 1,000 people over 70, we will now aim to provide 55 hostel places. As a substitution for the reduction in hostel places, we will introduce community aged care services packages. This means that the packages will replace some of the hostel places which would otherwise have been built. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aim of the community aged care services packages is to allow aged people to receive hostel personal care services in their homes. They will be targeted at people with higher dependency levels or complex care needs who are assessed as being at risk of admission to, or in need of, residential care. The program will provide complete packages of services which are designed to meet each individual's assessed needs and which build upon the recipient's potential for independent living in their own homes and the support they presently receive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of packages which will be approved is based on the number of hostel places forgone. The packages will be developed at the rate at which the hostel places would have come on stream. This means that in the initial years the numbers are relatively small but will grow to around a thousand places by year three of the phase-in period. Initial approvals for community aged care services packages will particularly concentrate on those areas of Australia in which it is difficult to build viable hostels due to factors such as the cost of building, the concentration of people in an area who require care or the lack of suitable land. This is true of many rural or remote areas but is also true for some inner city areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The packages will be funded at a level similar to the care subsidy provided for hostel residents requiring support for personal care. Both community and residential care providers will be eligible to receive funding for providing community aged care services packages. The approved provider will be able to use the existing resources of each area by using its own service base, volunteer services, and through use of other service providers in the area. In this way full use will be made of existing service infrastructure while gaps that exist now will be filled. This should help develop links between residential and community providers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence of this change in emphasis, the name of the Act will be changed to `Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act'. Further provisions of this Bill seek to amend this newly titled Act in order to restructure the existing hostel personal care subsidy. As foreshadowed in the Budget, following a review of hostel recurrent funding, the Government has decided to restructure hostel personal care funding. This was seen as necessary to target funding to those residents with high levels of physical frailty and to those suffering from dementia. The restructured personal care subsidy will provide clear incentives for hostels to provide care for more highly dependent and confused people, consistent with the objectives of the aged care strategy. An additional $14.6m will be available in a full year in support of the restructured subsidy arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existing arrangements provide for only one level of personal care subsidy for a wide range of care needs. This is a disincentive for hostels to admit more frail residents. It is essential that hostels be encouraged to expand their role in caring for more highly dependent residents because of the rapid growth of the aged population and because of the more specialised role of nursing homes in caring for those residents who require continuous nursing care and supervision. The new arrangements will provide for three levels of funding for residents requiring personal care:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">additional support will be available for the top 10 per cent of residents who are very physically frail, including people with dementia;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">additional funding will be directed to residents with a moderate degree of confusion or dementia; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16">residents with moderate personal care needs will continue to be supported; the threshold at which a resident can attract the subsidy will be effectively lowered in recognition of the requirement for personal care support services by a greater number of residents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existing dementia grants program will be phased out over a two-year period and incorporated into recurrent funding. The two higher subsidy levels will be provided to all hostels which provide care to dementia sufferers, as compared with only about 37 per cent of hostels under the dementia grants program. All hostel residents assessed as needing support for dementia will now receive support, compared with the 50 per cent of such residents under current arrangements. Existing recipients of dementia grants will receive transitional assistance during the phase-out of the current funding. The situation facing any hostel at the end of the phase-out period will depend on the care need profile of their residents and the subsidy level they attract for those residents in July 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also contains provisions to amend the existing Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act to enable some control to be exerted over the quality of persons operating hostels approved under that Act. Until now, there has not been an effective measure available to address the problem of unsuitable persons becoming the operators of approved hostels. In 1989, in recognition of the need to create such a control in the nursing home sector, the National Health Act was amended to ensure the suitability of proprietors of nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments now before the House will create the same control over the quality of persons operating approved hostels. These amendments will make it a condition of a hostel's approval that the person operating, or proposing to operate, a hostel be approved as an approved operator. Where a hostel is in breach of this condition, the Commonwealth will be under no obligation to sustain financial assistance by way of recurrent subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision to approve or refuse an applicant, or to revoke the approval of an existing approved operator, will be based on consideration of a person's ability to satisfy certain criteria. Broadly, these criteria will include relevant experience, honesty, efficiency, and history in the aged care industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further purpose of this Bill is to make amendments to the National Health Act 1953, the Nursing Homes Assistance Act 1974 and the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954 to revoke approvals to the 17 remaining nursing homes for disabled people and three remaining hostels for disabled people at the time the existing Commonwealth-State disability agreements come into full operation in each State. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments are necessary to allow these remaining nursing homes and hostels for disabled people to be included in the transfer of administrative responsibility for all Commonwealth funded disability accommodation services to the States as the Commonwealth-State disability agreements entered into between the Commonwealth and all States and Territories on 30 July 1991 come into full operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments proposed in the Bill relating to the payment of Medicare benefits for R-type or referred diagnostic imaging services are designed to enable the payment of benefits of certain imaging requested by physiotherapists. The services for which physiotherapists are to be formally recognised as requesters are X-rays of spine and pelvic area. This amendment gives physiotherapists the same recognition in the ordering of imaging services as chiropractors. The amendment acknowledges that spinal X-rays are important in determining whether spinal manipulation can be performed safely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also contains minor consequential amendments to the Act to allow a Medical Services Committee of Inquiry to examine cases relating to the rendering of excessive pathology services. The National Food Authority Act 1991 was passed by the Parliament in June 1991 and was proclaimed to come into effect on 19 August 1991. The Act created the National Food Authority, with responsibility for the development and amendment of food standards. These standards will be adopted by the States and Territories under an agreement signed by heads of government in July 1991 at the Special Premiers Conference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 71 of the Act contains provisions aimed at ensuring as smooth a transition as possible from the system which operated under the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) before 19 August to the system now operated by the Authority. The purpose of the proposed amendment to section 71 of the Act is twofold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, it deals with a problem which has become apparent in the handling of a large group of recommendations made by the NHMRC to the National Food Standards Council on 14 August 1991, but not dealt with by the Council before the Act came into effect on 19 August 1991. The Authority has become aware since the Act commenced that this group of recommendations, representing over 50 separate matters, is now disqualified from being included within the Food Standards Code as defined in the Act. Had the Council dealt with the recommendations before 19 August, they would have been eligible for inclusion in the Code. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the absence of this amendment, it would be necessary for the Authority now to consider each of those matters under the procedures laid down in the Act. This would represent a large increase in the Authority's workload, with consequent lengthy delays in finalising many matters which had been virtually completed by the NHMRC. Many of these matters involve changes to food standards requested by the food industry or by consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment provides that, where the NHMRC had made a recommendation to the Council but the Council had not made a decision before the commencement of the Act, such recommendations are deemed to have been recommendations made under the Act. This will allow outstanding matters on which the NHMRC had made recommendations to be dealt with as quickly as possible, and will avoid the necessity for the National Food Authority to have to consider each of these matters again under the procedures laid down in the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second purpose achieved by the amendment is to ensure that outstanding proposals can be dealt with in the same way as currently provided for outstanding applications. Applications are requests by outside parties for changes to the Food Standards Code, and are most often made by the food industry. The Act provides that applications which were in existence before the Act commenced are deemed to continue in existence, and imposes a time limit of two years within which the Authority must make a recommendation to the Council on these applications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposals, on the other hand, are matters which arise from within the food regulatory system. The intention behind proposals is frequently to rationalise or simplify or clarify provisions in food standards, to remove anomalies apparent to food authorities, or to provide increased protection of food consumers. The Act makes no provision for the continued existence of proposals which were in existence before the Act commenced, and this means that matters which had been almost finalised under the NHMRC system would have to be reintroduced from the beginning of the process laid down in the Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment not only provides for proposals which were in existence before the commencement of the Act to continue in existence but, more importantly, allows the Authority to deal with them in the same way as it can deal with applications. This means the Authority will be empowered to omit steps in the public process of dealing with a proposal, having regard to the stage which the proposal had reached under the NHMRC system. Thus proposals which had been almost finalised by the NHMRC can be considered by the Authority at an advanced stage rather than having to start from the beginning of the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment also introduces a time limit of two years within which the Authority must either make a recommendation to the Council on an outstanding proposal or must decide to abandon the proposal. This is the same time limit as currently applies to outstanding applications. The effect of this amendment will be to streamline the handling of matters which were outstanding when the Authority came into existence and to reduce delays in the Authority's consideration of such matters, to the advantage of both the food industry and food consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is actively promoting the concept of day surgery. In December 1989 a four level differential benefit was introduced into the health insurance basic table to encourage the growth of day-only procedures. In an effort to ensure that the growth of day surgery did not emanate from treatment that was performed in doctors' rooms, or treatment that was traditionally provided in hospitals as outpatients, my Department produced a type C&mdash;exclusion list&mdash;professional attention list. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This exclusion list&mdash;a list of Medicare benefits schedule procedures not normally done in hospital on a day-only basis&mdash;prevents hospitals and day hospital facilities from receiving an accommodation benefit if a procedure on the list is undertaken on a day-only basis. However, I acknowledge that there will be occasions when an item on the exclusion list could be performed in hospital on a day-only basis. In these circumstances provision exists for certification by the treating medical practitioner stating that his or her patient required day admission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This certification procedure currently only applies to public and private hospitals. The amendments I am proposing will enable day hospital facilities access to the same certification mechanism. The Bill proposes amendments to the National Health Act 1953 which will give effect to two of the changes to the nursing and personal care funding arrangements for non-government nursing homes announced in the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One set of amendments will enable a nursing home to delay applying for a new classification for a patient whose previous classification expired during or shortly after return from hospital leave.  A new application now will not need to be made until the resident's care needs have been carefully assessed following their return to the nursing home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new classification will take effect from the date of return to the nursing home, or the date the previous classification expired, whichever is the later. These amendments will remove the present incentive for a nursing home to apply prematurely and inaccurately for a new classification, in order to avoid funding being reduced to the lowest classification level between the date on which the previous classification expired and the date the new application is determined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other amendments address nursing homes' concerns about delays in receiving funding for the nursing and personal care of new residents. The amendments provide for a nursing home to receive interim funding for a new patient at the lowest classification level from the date of admission, pending assessment of the resident's ongoing care needs and submission of an application for annual funding based on that assessment. When the application is approved, funding will be adjusted to the appropriate classification level from the date of admission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also contains a number of additional amendments to the National Health Act in relation to nursing home matters. Following upon the recently completed review of nursing home infrastructure funding, the Government has introduced provisions to enable additional funding for isolated homes and for homes caring for residents who receive nasogastric feeding or continuous oxygen. It has also introduced provisions to enable supplementary recurrent funding for proprietors who build new homes without receiving capital grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of these provisions is for isolated nursing homes whose infrastructure costs are substantially higher than those of most other homes because of their isolated location, such as in Alice Springs or Cobar. The proposed principles will enable the Minister to compensate homes according to their remoteness. Subsequent provisions enable provision of additional funding for homes caring for residents who receive nasogastric feeding or continuous oxygen. This will ensure that residents do not have to pay these costs. People needing these services sometimes stay in a hospital because it provides the services to them at no cost, when in fact hospital care is inappropriate to their needs. The new funding will help prevent this. The provisions will also enable the Minister to approve funding at different levels in accordance with the needs of different residents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last of this series of provisions will enable supplementary recurrent funding to be provided for some proprietors who build new homes or new premises for existing homes but do not get capital funding. Charitable and benevolent organisations have for many years been eligible for capital grants to assist them to build new nursing homes or rebuild existing homes. These new provisions will assist some of those who have not received such grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the great majority of nursing home proprietors are ethical operators who provide good care to their clients, a small number have a record of unsatisfactory practices in the industry. I do not consider that it would be appropriate to encourage these people to remain in the industry by providing them with the additional recurrent funding for new nursing home buildings. The proposed legislation therefore allows me to take into account a proprietor's record in the industry when considering an application for this additional funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill introduces an offence in the National Health Act for providing false or misleading information in applications to become approved operators of nursing homes. Nursing home approval is conditional on the proprietor being an approved operator. Approval as an approved operator is only granted where a person is considered suitable to be the proprietor of an approved nursing home. It is important, therefore, to ensure that the information supplied in support of an application for approved operator status is accurate and truthful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further amendment increases the various penalties contained in the National Health Act relating to the administration of the Commonwealth's nursing home recurrent funding program. The reason for increasing the penalties is to ensure that they provide both effective deterrents and appropriate sanctions in respect of the matters to which they relate. In view of the time elapsed since they were introduced, they no longer do this. The proposed amendments will reinstate their effectiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill also contains provision to correct an unintended effect on the rights of aggrieved applicants to seek review of Pharmacy Restructuring Authority (PRA) recommendations. The amendment will allow aggrieved applicants to seek an Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) review of PRA recommendations relating to the approval of pharmacies, the payment of essential pharmacy allowance and the provision of financial assistance with the amalgamation or closure of pharmacies. The amendment will have retrospective effect and allow all those applicants aggrieved by past recommendations of the PRA to seek review of those recommendations by the AAT. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The earnings credit allows, on an annual basis, maximum rate pensioners to accrue the value of their weekly income test free area up to $1,000.

This limitation will also apply to the rate of pharmaceutical allowance payable to a member of a couple with a non-pensioner or beneficiary partner. These measures will not apply to existing pensioners or beneficiaries as at 11 March 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The payment of pharmaceutical allowance was introduced in November 1990 to offset the introduction of a charge for pharmaceutical benefits for persons who had previously received prescriptions free under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme.

What is more appalling about today is that it once again reflects the contempt with which this Government treats the Parliament. In the last two weeks of the autumn sittings, no fewer than 33 Bills were guillotined through the House of Representatives. The guillotine was originally meant to prevent the obstruction of legislation by fixing times at which parts of a Bill must be voted on, but wholesale abuse of the guillotine by the present Government has turned it into a surgical instrument for cutting off democratic debate at the neck.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answers to the honourable member's questions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The term ``Commonwealth Expenditure on building works'' has a wide connotation and may have a broad definition which may range from current annual expenditure on Commonwealth Departmental Works projects ranging from thousands through to millions of dollars and to annual outgoings for all Commonwealth Entities including Corporations, eg Telecommunications Corporation, Commissions, eg Overseas Telecommunications Commission, Organisations, eg CSIRO or Agencies, eg Radio Film &amp; Television School.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As such, particularly if the wider range of organisations is envisaged, there is no comprehensive financial or statistical record maintained&mdash; except perhaps through National Accounts maintained by Department of Finance, which would enable the value of such expenditure to be appropriately or quickly gathered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the financial years 1987 to 1989 the Department of Housing and Construction largely had control of Appropriated Funds for, and therefore had responsibility for, reporting to Parliament the expenditure on Capital Building Works for Commonwealth Departments. This organisation has now been amalgamated with other Agencies and reconstituted within the framework of Department of Administrative Services. These expenditures for the years 1987-89 are on record in the Annual Budget Paper No 2.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1.7.89 control of Capital Works expenditure under Appropriated Capital Building Works was devolved directly to individual Commonwealth Departments. The Department of Administrative Services operating through the Project Services Division of Australian Construction Services serviced those Commonwealth Departments under agency arrangements but in arranging contracts for such approved works did not have any direct responsibility for the recording of expenditure incurred. It is therefore unable to report on the expenditure involved in the particular periods mentioned. Such expenditures by Commonwealth Departments would be recorded in Parliamentary Papers under individual Departmental Appropriations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1.7.91 Commonwealth Departments are no longer required to engage Project Services and consequently not all such Works would necessarily be actioned through that agency. Again the recording of overall expenditure under the Appropriation for such works for Commonwealth Departments would be under the control of individual Departments and collated by Department of Finance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Project Services Division of Australian Construction Services can report on the tendering methods used for works for which it has acted as agent. This gives a measure of the total value of such projects.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) In January 1990, ANOP Research Services Pty Ltd was  commissioned by Kinhill Engineers Pty Ltd on behalf of the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) to complete a survey of attitudes to the proposed third runway at Sydney Airport. ANOP was again commissioned by Kinhill on behalf of the FAC to undertake a further survey during March 1991 to assess whether any change had occurred in community attitudes since the first survey in January 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Yes</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The 1990 survey involved 1,000 Sydney residents while the 1991 survey involved 1,200.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The numbers of persons surveyed from the local government areas included in the 1991 survey are as follows:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) The survey was conducted over a representative sample of the population of the greater Sydney metropolitan area.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) No. All essential information concerning the 1991  survey was made public by the FAC in the Supplement to the Draft EIS for the Proposed Third Runway.

The methodology and results of the 1991 survey are contained in a document titled "The  Attitudes of Sydney Residents to the Proposed Third  Runway". The FAC will make the full details of the survey, including the questions asked, available to members of the public upon request.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) All respondents were asked: "What do you think are the advantages or benefits of a third runway at Sydney Airport?"

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) A summary included in the March 1991 survey indicates that 40 per cent of respondents nominated "fewer delays" (aircraft delays, delays generally, passenger delays) as an advantage.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(i) No. Aircraft operations on a crossed runway layout are more interdependent than operations with a parallel runway configuration. Consequently, the addition of the proposed parallel north-south runway will increase the airport capacity by at least 30 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(ii) No. Based on ten years of observations (1978-1987) of meteorological conditions at Sydney Airport, the EIS has estimated that use of the east-west runway would be required on average for 1.2 per cent of the time. Aircraft movement data for 1987-89 show that 1.6 per cent of movements required the use of the east-west runway when the north-south runway was unavailable due to a crosswind limit of 20 knots used by Air Traffic Control for runway selection. This limit was increased to 25 knots in 1990. Use of the east-west runway due to crosswinds exceeding 25 knots on the north-south runway was required in 1990 for 0.2 per cent of the time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision to operate on any particular runway at KSA is ultimately the responsibility of the pilot-in-command based on his or her assessment of operational and safety requirements. Pilots are certified competent to safely operate their aircraft and would be free to elect to operate from the east-west runway where this was a safety or operational requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, the air traffic management procedures which would be used with the parallel runways as opposed to the present crossing runways would promote more efficient and safer airborne and runway traffic flows, with fewer areas of possible conflict than can occur with traffic flows using intersecting runways.</PARA>
