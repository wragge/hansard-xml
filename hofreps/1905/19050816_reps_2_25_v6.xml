                        <para>- I wish to commence my remarks by saying that, in my opinion, legislation is occasionally passed by this House in regard to which it would be better if we had the advantage of the information of commercial men, which would enable us to determine its probable results. Last session a Bill called the Sea Carriage of Goods Bill was before this House and another place, and, , as a layman, I candidly confess that it seemed to me that its provisions were framed in the best interests of the producers of Australia. Men who were sending produce from this country oversea, had on numerous occasions discovered that it was seriously damaged when it arrived at its destination ; but in consequence of a clause inserted in the bills of lading by the shipping companies, no redress could be obtained from them. The shippers of perishable produce, such as apples and other fruit, have in this manner, at various times, sustained serious loss. It therefore seemed to me that a measure preventing ship-owners from contracting themselves out of their liability for the results of their carelessness would be beneficial to producers, and I did not object to the Bill. I have since discovered, however, that the Act is operating most injuriously upon the interests of Australian producers who desire to export to the East. I have been told that, so far as the carriage of perishable produce to England is concerned the effect of the Act has been to lower freights, though, in my opinion, the lowering of freights has been due really to an increase of competition. But the climatic conditions under which produce is conveyed from Australia to England are totally different from those under which produce is conveyed from Australia to the East. Perishable produce exported to England is invariably carried in cool chambers, and kept at a certain temperature throughout the voyage. But when produce is sent to the East by the vessels of the two principal English companies engaging in over-sea trade with the Commonwealth, it has to be transhipped at Colombo, where the heat is very great, and the effect of the transhipment on perishable produce is extremely detrimental. Therefore, since the coming into force of the Sea Carriage of Goods Act, the Peninsular and Oriental and Orient Companies have refused to carry perishable produce from Australia to the East, though they continue, as before, to carry such produce to England. </para>

                            <para>- I am not arguing that point. Australia produces perishable goods in quantities far larger than those which she consumes, and it is, therefore, necessary that she should have markets abroad to which to send the surplus. I need hardly point out how disastrous it will be to our producers if they are compelled, owing to the refusal of the shipping companies to carry their goods elsewhere, to confine their exports to the markets of the old world. We have repeatedly, year after year, seen that the effect of sending to those markets more than is required there is that prices go down immediately. We know, however, that there are teeming populations in the East, and I have the best authority for saying that if our produce can be delivered to them in fair condition, our people can do a very large trade with them. But apples and potatoes deteriorate very rapidly, and even flour and preserved or canned fruits - even though put up in hermetically sealed tins - will be totally destroyed in less than two months when the weather is very hot; so that it is a severe handicap on the shipping companies to ask them to guarantee the delivery of such goods in sound condition. One of the largest firms trading with the East, Messrs. Thomson, Thomson, and Co., who have offices in Melbourne, Colombo, Singapore, and elsewhere, were, before the Act came into operation, in the habit of exporting something, like 6,000 cases of apples to India and the Far East every year; but during the eight months in which the Act has been in operation, they have shipped away only 600 cases. </para>

                            <para>- I am not prepared to say, but I should think that such produce has in the past been carried in cool chambers, at any rate so far as Colombo. As I have said, the Peninsular and Oriental and Orient Companies now refuse to carry it at all, and it is only lately that the French and German vessels have accepted it, and then only in limited quantities, when they can get nothing else, and at higher rates. That is shown by the fact that in eight months they have carried only 600 cases, and the season is now practically over. These facts should convince honorable members that the Act is operating injuriously in regard to the interests of our producers. Further, I desire to point out that flour comes within the same category as apples and other perishables of that description. The result has been that instead of a steamer running direct to the East every two months, as was the case before the Act came into operation, only one steamer in every four months proceeds there. This should afford convincing proof that the operation of the Act has been disastrous. </para>

                            <para>- All I can say is that flour, like almost everything, else of an edible character, is a perishable, and the fact that it is liable to contamination if stowed with other cargo, causes the steamship companies to object to carry it. Moreover, in two months flour will become full of weevil, and similar deterioration will, within three months, overtake oatmeal in hermetically sealed tins. </para>

                            <para>- Whatever the law common or otherwise - may be, the fact remains that the shipping companies will not carry products of a perishable character if they can obtain other cargo. They will carry flour only when they can obtain a sufficient quantity to fill one compartment of the hold. My statements upon this point can be easily verified. With regard to potatoes, my attention was called to the effect of the provisions of the Sea Carriage of Goods Act by one of the largest exporters of potatoes, who informed me that a firm in Colombo had written to them, asking them to ship a small quantity of potatoes, with a view to ascertaining if trade could be opened up. In consequence, however, of the refusal of the steamship companies to carry such cargo, they were unable to comply with the request. </para>

                            <para>- Messrs. Thompson and Thompson have communicated with all the companies, and only the two mentioned have been ready to do business. I might also mention the fact that at the commencement of the fruit season Messrs. Thompson and Thompson made arrangements with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey,</inline> their agent at Hobart, to ship 600 cases of apples monthly to Colombo. They had agreed to sell the apples to an importer in Colombo, but in consequence of the refusal of the Orient and Peninsular and Oriental companies to carry fruit to the East they were unable to fulfil their contract. All I ask is that the Government shall amend the provisions of the Act so far as they operate with regard to the export of produce to the East. I understand that if the penalty of &#163;100 were abandoned, the shipping companies would still be prepared to carry perishables to the East. If the exporters like Messrs. Thompson, Thompson, and Co. and others, including the Tasmanian firms, are willing that the provisions of the Act should be modified so far as the Eastern trade is concerned, we may reasonably ask Ministers to bring down an amending measure. The shippers are quite prepared to take the risk. As Ministers know, with the exception of perhaps two honorable members, there ate no commercial men in this House from whom we can obtain advice in matters of this kind. We are really groping in the dark. I did so when I supported the Act. I thought that it would be a good thing for our producers, but I now see that I made a mistake, and I trust that Ministers will come to the same conclusion. It may possibly be said that in consequence of the operation of the Act the rate of freight on apples exported to the old country has been reduced. I have the best authority, however, for saying that that result has been brought about merely by increased competition. </para>

                        <para>- I quite recognise the right of any honorable member, and especially of one who thinks that the producers he represents have been prejudicially affected by any Act, to call the attention of Ministers and Parliament to such an important matter. But as the remarks of the honorable member, and the conclusions he has drawn from the statements placed in his hands, would, if correct, reflect on the Ministry which introduced the Act, and on myself, as one of the commercial men in the House, to whom the honorable gentleman has alluded, I should like to say just a few words with a view to showing that the honorable member,&#39; or those who have given him information, are entirely under a misapprehension. I favoured the introduction of the Act, because I recognised as a business man that the way in which the shipping rings and shipping companies in combines were taking advantage of their opportunities to contract themselves out of every common law liability was utterly shameful. </para>

                            <para>- I do not say that the Government railways are any better in that respect - they go too far in that direction. I found that the bills of lading were year after year becoming less valuable to shippers and consignees, and that it was high time that somebody stepped in and declared that the opportunities afforded by the practical monopoly of sea-carriage should&#39; not be taken advantage of to the public detriment. The practices of the shipping companies were operating to the disadvantage of the general community. When the Bill was before the House, it was argued by ship-owners that if they were called upon to incur any additional liability they must raise the freights, and that the consignees would practically have to pav for the immunity from unfair risk sought to be secured to them by the Act. The shipping companies rearesented that if, at the end of a voyage, they were called upon to pay claims to the amount of ;&#163; 1,000 on the voyage of a vessel in addition to the liabilities which they were formerly required to meet, the freights must be increased to a corresponding amount to cover the additional claims. That, however, was an altogether false argument. The fact was that the very evasion of liability by the shipping companies was becoming a national evil. Great and unnecessary losses were occurring every year, because those under whose control the goods were placed were not responsible for their safety. That was. a most improper state of affairs. The ^1,000 loss referred to did not need to occur if proper supervision was exercised. At any rate, only a small proportion of the losses which shippers had to endure occurred when the ship-owners were made to bear their proper share of responsibility for the safety of the cargo. The Act operates in the direction of not only doing justice between the two parties, but of reducing a great and increasing national loss. I think the honorable member for Wilmot&#39; can assure those who have given him the information which he has placed before the House that they have entirely misread the Act if they have arrived at the conclusion he has indicated. The Act merely are- . vents ship-owners from contracting themselves out of their liability for neglect or negligence. </para>

                            <para>- Not at all. This is not a new provision. The honorable member is considerably younger than I am - a fact to which I refer only for the reason that I remember when there was an honest bill of lading as between shipowners and shippers. At that time all these liabilities for neglect or negligence fell upon the ship-owner, and there is no more difficulty now in deciding responsibility for neglect than there was then. It had to be shown in such cases that the goods were shipped in good order and condition, and any alleged defect in, or neglect by, the ship had to be proved before a claim could be enforced. The provisions to which I have referred make it perfectly clear that owners of ships carrying perishable goods to the East, whether in refrigerating chambers or not, can be protected by the insertion of a clause in the bill of lading exempting them from anything from which ship-owners are exempted under this Act, and that even if no such clause were inserted, its existence would be implied. The best proof that the complaint made to the honorable member for Wilmot is not justified is furnished by his statement that the firm in question had sold 600 cases of apples per month to Ceylon, but could not mow obtain shipment owing to this Act. As a matter of fact, perishable goods of this description are being carried under this Act <inline font-style="italic">vi&#226;</inline> Ceylon, and to ports beyond, by the very steam-ship companies that refused the shipments to which the honorable member referred. They have carried like cargoes which have to pass through the tropics on the way to Ceylon- </para>

Does it not show that they do not open up the cool chambers on their vessels reaching Ceylon, because they fear; that by so doing they might destroy fruit or other perishable products for ports beyond? </para>

                            <para>- Is it not perfectly clear that, as these vessels carry fruit from Hobart to London - and have to pass through the same conditions of climate as are encountered by a vessel carrying fruit to Ceylon - without any objection by their owners to the provisions of this measure, the refusal to receive shipments of fruit for Ceylon arises from causes&#39; outside of the Act itself ? I do not wish to detain the House, but&#39; have been led to make these observations, because of statements similar to that made by the honorable member for Wilmot, which&#39; have been scattered broadcast. This is the .first opportunity I have had to contradict .them.. , I repeat that the Sea Carriage of Goods Act simply brings back ship-owners to their liability under the common law, and that it is right that they should be brought back to that liability. They never had any right to be free from it. It is in the interests not only of the consignees, but of the ship-owners themselves, as well as of the general public - on whom must fall any unnecessary loss - that they should not be allowed to contract themselves out of this liability. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the taunt of the honorable member for Wilmot&#34;, that the business men in the House had been asleep, has been thoroughly dissipated by the honorable member for North Sydney, who has answered, the whole&#39; case put&#34; forward by the mover of this motion. It seems to me that the honorable member for Wilmot has been making use of this House just as one might avail himself of the &#34; Notes and Queries &#34; column in a newspaper, and that he could have obtained all the information he desired in a far simpler way. As a commercial man., I say that this Bill was required by business men more than by any other class, and that in a matter of this kind no commercial man could have an interest at all inimical to that of the producing classes. </para>

                            <para>- I am; and I may say that I find&#39; no difficulty in securing freight to the East for perishable commodities. The honorable member for Wilmot referred, among other things, to canned peaches, which, he said, were sent to the East, and could not be kept in sound - condition for more than a month Or two. That statement shows that he has not a grasp of the question. I undertake to say that if I went to the East to-morrow i&#39; should find some of my own canned peaches - that had probably been there for twelve months in a thoroughly sound condition. Goods that are placed in hermetically sealed cans cannot go bad when passing through the tropics or anywhere&#39; else. This shows that the honorable member &#39; has been somewhat misinformed in regard to the case in question. I think it is well known that the space in the vessels of the Orient Company and the Peninsular and Oriental Company set apart, for shipments of apples is&#34; wholly taken up long before that produce is ready for export. . My own firm has a large contract running with a shipping company for a term of three years in respect of a large share of the space so set apart, and I know that the available space in many of these steamers is fully taken up under contract. Under these contracts,, the space has to be paid for whether used or not, and the result is that an outside shipper probably finds on applying for space in the refrigerating chambers that there is none available. As the honorable member for North Sydney has said, there is no reason why these steamers which carry perishable produce beyond Colombo, through the Red Sea, and on to the English market, should refuse the same, class of freight for transhipment at Colombo, <inline font-style="italic">en route</inline> to the East, when there is any space available. It is almost incomprehensible that they should do anything of the kind, for the freight on apples for the East would be relatively very much higher than that on apples for London or Liverpool. Shippers of perishable products are not confined to the mail steamers. They can get their goods sent to Colombo, Singapore, or other ports in the East, by the China Company and by other steamers which leave Melbourne and Sydney almost every week. </para>

                            <para>- It hardly comes within the operation of this Act. The Sea Carriage of Goods Act very &#39;properly brings back the combination of ship-owners to the common law liabilities which they have been evading for many years. During that time they have not only been robbing and fleecing the public, but have placed the shippers in Australia in a bad position commercially. If freights were to be increased it was far better that they should be raised under a system by which shippers would be able to obtain a guarantee from the only person who is able to give one, that the perishable produce would be cared for on the voyage. The only persons who can see to the proper care of perishable produce on board ship are the ship-owners or their agents. It is easy to understand that whilst they had no responsibility in the matter they took very little care to see that the .goods were properly treated; but having made them responsible in the terms of the Act, we know that they will do their utmost to see that perishable produce from Australia arrives at its destination in the best possible order. There is nothing in the Act which enforces ship-owners to accept bad fruit here, and deliver it as good fruit at its destination. Speaking as a commercial man very largely interested in the fruit trade, I say that all that was desired was that the ship-owners should be brought back to their common law rights. There was no way in which we could do this- other than that provided by this Act. This provision was adopted elsewhere in the Harter Act, as honorable members are aware, and had been found to operate very successfully. I can see no reason why we should seek to upset this Act, which has been pronounced by many people who have had experience of its working to be quite satisfactory. So far from the Act having the effect predicted when it was being discussed by the honorable and learned member for Parkes, and other honorable members, of putting up freights on butter, apples, and other such perishable products, as a matter of fact, freights have absolutely come down. The honorable member for Wilmot has said that that is not the effect of the Act, and I am quite willing to admit it; but surely the converse also holds good, and it is proved that the Act has not had the effect of raising freights. The competition amongst the great carrying companies is such that we can depend upon freights being brought down to a proper level. Without some such legislation as is contained in the Sea Carriage of Goods Act, while that competition amongst carrying companies would still exist, there would not be the competition which there is at the present moment amongst those companies, in the carriage of fruit, butter, and other perishable products successfully and safely. If we wish to stimulate the production of our natural wealth, and secure good returns to our producers, that is the kind of competition we should encourage. I can assure honorable members that that competition now exists under the- Sea Carriage of Goods Act, and that the leading companies engaged in this traffic are vieing with each other as to who shall most successfully carry these products. It was only natural to expect that when this legislation was proposed, the great shipping companies that for a number of years enjoyed immunity from ordinary common law obligations should exercise considerable influence to prevent this Parliament passing such a law. I am thankful that honorable members saw fit to take a broader view. The measure was passed in the interests of our producers, and was based on justice; and, so far as I am aware, it has been successful in its operation. I can give honorable members personal experience in connexion with the matter. The year before the Act was passed, the firm to which I belong lost a very large sum of money on the shipment of fruit, not altogether because of the way in which it was carried, but largely because of the slovenly way in which it was handled, and the lack of attention in its carriage. Last year, under the operation of the Sea Carriage of Goods Act, we had a successful year, and that advantage has been accompanied by the additional advantage of new contracts securing a reduction of freight on this particular kind of produce. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member who moved this motion had one object in particular in asking honorable members to consider the question. He desired honorable members to be aware of the difficulties which shippers are experiencing in connexion with the carriage of these perishable products for transhipment at Colombo for the East. In substance, what the honorable member has asked is that in order that the markets for this produce in the East might be extended, these particular ship-owners should be allowed to contract themselves out of the provisions of the Sea Carriage of Goods Act. I dissent entirely from what the honorable member has said. In my opinion the Act is an admirable instrument for the protection of the interests of shippers. I am sure that the mercantile community generally have no wish that the Government should do anything which would interfere with the principle underlying the measure. Of course, it must be admitted that any assistance which can be given to insure the further development of what ought to be a very large trade with the East in fruit and other perishable products would be desirable and profitable. I presume that honorable members are aware that the bulk of the produce shipped to the East is shipped direct by steamers passing along the eastern side of this Continent. The mail steamers, in declining to accept these perishable products, which have to be transhipped at Colombo, are really recognising that they cannot hope to successfully compete in the carriage of this class of produce with steamers going direct from Australia to the East. Though I have no actual knowledge of the circumstances which the honorable member for Wilmot has related to the House, I take it that the two large mail companies to which the honorable member has referred do not adopt the attitude of which he complains because of any objection to the provisions of the Sea Carriage of Goods Act. </para>

I entirely dissent from the view put forward by the honorable member for Wilmot, that there is any desire on the part of these two great mail companies to put any obstacles in the way of the carriage of this class of produce. What I have stated I think sufficiently accounts for the fact that they have no wish to cater for it.

                        <para>- I am one of those who took a very considerable interest in the passing of the Sea Carriage of Goods Act. The bulk of the fruit shipped from Tasmania comes from my own electorate, and although I am in constant touch with the fruit-growers, very many of whom are my personal friends, I have not, up to the present heard a single word of complaint from any of them. The great objection raised to the passing of the Act was that inasmuch as it would compel the shipping companies to provide their own insurance, it would lead to an increase in freights to such an extent as to prevent shipments of this class of produce. I am glad to say that the very opposite has been the result, and that this year shippers have been enabled to enter into contracts for the carriage of fruit from Hobart to London under the provisions of the Act at a reduction of nearly 33 per cent. on the freights previously existing. I admit that the passing of the Act may not have effected that reduction, but we are able to say that it has not prevented it - in other words, it has not caused the increase in freights which some of those who opposed the measure thought would follow its enactment. There is, however, a more important point to be considered. Quite recently an important case was decided in London. A large shipment of fruit was totally destroyed; as the shippers contended, through the negligence of the shipping company. The fruit, when it arrived in London, was absolutely worthless, and the shippers not only lost the whole of their fruit, but the freight which they had paid on it. They brought an action against the company, and the company put in as a defence their bill of lading, under which the shippers had contracted themselves out of all redress. The case, of course, went against the shippers, but I contend that that is a monstrous state of things. I hope that Ministers will be exceedingly cautious about interfering with the operation of an Act which has already done a very great deal of good. I readily admit the importance of our trade with the East, and in the interests of the State from which I come I should like to see it largely increased. But we are satisfied that the Sea Carriage of Goods Act has been such a boon to us, although in operation for so short a time, that it would be a calamity to the growers and shippers of fruit in Tasmania if we had to return to the state of things existing before the passing of the Act. The shippers of fruit were very largely taken into consideration when the Act was passed, and the very fact that it was proposed to pass such an Act had the effect of inducing steam-ship companies to prepare for its operation, with the result that fruit was carried Home in the past season in an infinitely better condition than ever before. There has not been one failure, to my knowledge, this year in the carriage of fruit because the shipping companies, in anticipation of the passing of the Act, made preparations to accept their proper responsibility for the carriage of goods entrusted to their care. </para>

                            <para>- The shipment of fruit for some years was absolutely disastrous to the shippers. Whole shipments were sometimes destroyed, and the fruit was worthless when dumped on the London market. During the present year, largely, I claim, as the result of the action taken by the shipping companies to make proper provision to carry out their obligations under the Sea Carriage of Goods Act, fruit has been carried to London from Australia in excellent condition. It has been proved, as we contended all along, that it only required a little common sense and some care to enable that to be done. Desirous as we may be of opening up trade with the East, we should be exceedingly cautious about tampering, with the Act in such a way as to throw us back to the old condition of things. I readily accept the information supplied by the honorable member for Wilmot, but the gentleman whom the honorable member named in connexion with the shipment of fruit in Tasmania is a personal friend and elector of my own, and, though I conversed with him not many weeks ago, and he was aware of my interest in this matter, he did not bring it under my notice. I again urge the Ministry to be exceedingly cautious before tampering with an Act which I claim to be one of the very best that has yet been passed in the interests of the producers of Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I am rather pleased that the honorable member for Wilmot should have taken the action which he has taken this afternoon, because it gives an opportunity for the correction of the erroneous impression most industriously circulated in some quarters as to the effect of the Sea Carriage of Goods Act. I congratulate the honorable member also on the desire which he has evinced to support a rational measure of State Socialism. If we have had one instance of the splendid advantages to be derived from State Socialism which is better than another, this Act affords such an instance. </para>

                            <para>- We were told that it was necessary, in the interests of producers, to place some restriction on the right of ship-owners to contract themselves out of their liability for damage done to cargo carried by them, and, after some little experience of the operation of the Act, we have no proof that it has operated detrimentally to the interests of consignees, while we have evidence that it has been of advantage to the shippers of perishable produce. The ship-owners now have to pay attention to the seaworthiness of their vessels, and to the proper condition of the holds and other places in which they store the produce which is carried. In short, they have to perform their part of their contracts. They cannot contract themselves out of their obligations. Not only have the producers of Australia been benefited in this way, but, owing to their concerted efforts, they have been able, by dealing as a body, instead of individually, with the ship-owners, to obtain considerable reductions in freight. The late Government, however, when contracting to pay a large subsidy to a shipping company for a certain purpose, should have seen that the interests of producers were preserved. </para>

                            <para>- I am sorry that the interjections have thrown me out of my course. I wish to show that the Act, instead of being injurious to the interests of those engaged in the shipment of perishable produce from Australia, has benefited them. As the honorable member for South Sydney pointed out, the percentage of losses has decreased since the Act was passed, and there has been a considerable reduction in freights, though that, of course, is not due to the operation of the Act, but to other causes. The facts related by the honorable member for Wilmot as to the refusal of ship-owners to take produce for Eastern ports by vessels trading from Australia to London has no bearing upon the operation of the Act. The only inference to be drawn from those statements is that the vessels in question had their cargo space filled with more profitable freightage. </para>

We know, as a matter of fact, from the evidence of one who is largely concerned in the shipping trade with the East, that there has been no difficulty in getting freightage for a considerable quantity of produce consigned to Eastern ports. The honorable member for Wilmot only proved that a little more State Socialism is desirable. In my opinion, it is the duty of the Government, when an opportunity occurs, to seek out markets for our producers, and to assist them in getting freight to those markets. </para>

My definition of Socialism may not be correct, or it may differ from that of the honorable and learned member for Corinella. I hope that the Government will obtain further evidence than has been put forward by the honorable member for Wilmot before they take into consideration the advisability of repealing the Act. </para>

                        <para>- I, too, think that the honorable member for Wilmot is to be congratulated in having initiated the keenest and closest discussion which I have heard this session. He said at the opening of his remarks that the commercial members of this Chamber were asleep, that they were not looking after their own interests, when the Sea-Carriage of Goods Bill was before Parliament; but I think that he has found by this that they were perfectly awake, and that as soon as commercial men and producers feel that it will benefit their pockets they raise no cry against interference with freedom of contract. There is an interference by the Act with freedom of contract. A ship-owner is not now allowed to make a contract with a shipper absolutely relieving himself of liability for the bad condition of the refrigerating chambers of his vessel, or the bad handling and stowing of goods. A few years ago the first objection that would have been raised in this arena on. the discussion of such a measure would have been, &#34; This is an interference with freedom of contract. Why should we interfere with two adult persons who are making a contract?&#34; Such is the change which may be wrought in a few years that, while the measure has been discussed this afternoon, not a word of that kind has been heard from the able commercial and producing members who have taken part in this debate. </para>

                            <para>- The old objection was, &#34;Why should not two adult persons be allowed to contract between themselves as they think fit? Whatever they say is honest must be regarded as honest.&#34; The honorable member begs the question. I do not care whether you call the Act State Socialism or anything else, it is a splendid measure, and it has operated to the advantage of the producers. There is a great trade opening out with the East, and we hope to increase our dealings with the huge population of that part of the world. We are now only beginning to feel the effects of this expansion of trade. No doubt there are difficulties in the way of communication. At the present time the vessels of the various lines proceeding to the East, along the eastern coast of Australia, sail perhaps once a month. There are other vessels calling at Colombo on the way to Europe, which also take cargo to the East, but at the present time our shipping arrangements are not equal to the great trade which we hope to presently do. But if the Sea Carriage of Goods Act is left alone for a while, there will be plenty of shipping companies only too eager to compete for this traffic. If I may be allowed to say so, respectfully, because I know that the honorable member for Wilmot has given us what is absolutely his honest view of the state of affairs, the statement which he put forward on behalf of the producers is really a statement put forward on behalf of the shipping companies. </para>

                            <para>- The goods will be carried. We have only to give enough time to the shipping companies. The true and natural line of communication between Australia and the East is by way of Singapore, Manilla, Hong Kong, Shanghai, and the Japanese ports. If the steamers which now take that route - the vessels of the China Navigation Company, of the Eastern and Australian Navigation Company, of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha, which have been stopped by the war, and of the Norddeutscher Lloyd, which leave Sydney every three weeks - do not provide sufficient accommodation for the trade, other companies will come in. There is a tremendous rush to secure business for ships,&#34; shipowners being only too anxious to find trade for their vessels. What the Act has done is, as the honorable member for North Sydney has so well said, not to guarantee that goods shall be delivered sound at the . port to which&#39; they are consigned, but that ship-owners shall take due precaution against damage? or loss. First it is provided that they shall not contract themselves out of liability for the harmful condition of the ship&#39;s hold or for having inefficient provision for maintaining an even temperature in the cool chambers, or out of the liability foc handling and stowing goods. The honorable member for Wilmot may, therefore, reasonably conclude that he is under a misapprehension in thinking that ship-owners are required to give a guarantee that they will deliver their goods iri sound condition. </para>

I think, however, that they are beginning to appreciate its advantages, and that those honorable members who like the honorable member for Moira so effectively represent the producing interests, recognise that it has conferred great benefits. Under these circumstances r do not think, that honorable members are likely to change their views. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think the honorable member for Wilmot has made out a case such as would warrant any alteration of the provisions of the Sea Carriage of Goods Act. As the measure has had beneficial results so far as our shippers are concerned, and has prevented steam-ship companies from contracting themselves out of their proper liabilities, the Government should be very careful about interfering with it. One can easily understand why shippers will not carry fruit under the conditions to which the honorable member for Wilmot has referred. It is because they would not use their cool chambers for more than half the voyage. After the fruit had reached Colombo it would not be placed in cool chambers, and any; one acquainted with perishables knows that nothing is more injurious to them than sudden rises or falls in temperature. That is the reason why. shipping companies refuse to carry fruit to the East. In any case a few thousand cases of apples that might be sent t&#169; Colombo are not to be considered as against the hundreds of thousands of cases which are shipped to Great Britain and elsewhere under far more favorable conditions than prevailed previously. I do not think that fruit intended for the East should be sent <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Colombo. As the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has indicated, the East coast is the natural route for shipments to the East. The Eastern and Australian Steam-ship Company have cool chambers in their steamers, and would be only too pleased to carry perishables to Eastern ports. The same remarks apply to the China Steam Navigation Company. As goods intended for Eastern ports have to be transhipped at Colombo if they are sent <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> that port, the transhipment might just as well be made at Sydney, and the goods sent by the shorter route. I am glad that this discussion has taken place, because every honorable member, except the honorable member for Wilmot, has expressed himself in favour of retaining the Act in its present form. I trust that the Government will take the same view. </para>

                        <para>- &#34; This discussion has caused some stir in certain quarters of the House, as does any mention of the regulation and control of industrial or commercial affairs by the State. Honorable members opposite seem to be quite unhappy because for once honorable members on this side of the House agree with them with regard to a piece of legislation which they term socialistic, but for which we have quite a different name. Owing to the loose and flabby thinking that is indulged in with regard to the socialistic propaganda from time to time, anything may be called socialistic nowadays. Honorable members of the Labour Party, if they please, may say that this Act operates in the direction of State Socialism; but if this be State Socialism, if every interference with private contract is State Socialism, I take it that the whole world has been engaged for hundreds of years in carrying out that principle. </para>

                            <para>- The distinction between what honorable members call State Socialism and the kind of Socialism that is the objective of the Labour Party, is that the first aims at regulating on the basis of justice all the individual operations of the community. In considering whether a proposal is socialistic or otherwise, we must pay some attention to its objective. What is the objective in this case? To look to the interests of individuals, to see that private contract is not crushed out by monopoly. The object of honorable members opposite is not to take care of private contract, but to abolish it altogether. </para>

                            <para>- That is precisely what I am saying. It interferes with freedom of contract, with the object of preserving and regulating it, and not with the view of abolishing it, as honorable members opposite propose. They do not want to encourage private contract. If they interfere at all it is with the ultimate object of legislating private contract out of existence, and setting up something else in its place. All this is by the way, but one may be pardoned for making some reference to these matters, because the moment one has anything to say with regard to a measure of this kind one hears remarks from the Ministerial corner with regard to its socialistic character. By the same process of reasoning, one might denominate any statute in the civil code as being in its essence socialistic. </para>

                            <para>- I suppose that settles the matter, so far as the honorable member is concerned, because it is well known that he pays particular attention to anything that the press of Australia may say. I believe that it is one of the features of the Labour Party that they accept as gospel everything that the capitalistic press may say. It is amusing to hear the honorable member declare, in the most confident way, that the press have characterized the Sea Carriage of Goods Act as a socialistic measure. The same press says that the honorable member and those associated with him are on the track that leads to the subversion of our civilization. Does the honorable member believe that ? </para>

                            <para>- Honorable members of the Labour Party say that this is a socialistic measure, and my point is that it is nothing of the kind. It merely provides for interference on the part of the Government to prevent shipping combines from fleecing private enterprise. If we were Socialists we should be glad to see private enterprise entirely done away with, because that is the supreme objective of honorable members opposite. But we, who believe in private enterprise, desire to take every precaution to see that its operations are carried on upon the plane of justice. That is all this Act does. I do not think that it has acted in any way adversely to the shippers of Australia. None of the evil results that were predicted have followed from the Act. </para>

Otherwise, I should be delighted to carry on the dialogue with him. As I was saying, none of the dire consequences predicted have come to pass. On the other hand, it is well known that ship-owners are taking more precautions for the safe carriage of perishables, and I believe that on the whole the result of our legislation has been beneficial. It may be that cases of hardship will arise, but I believe that matters will settle themselves in time, that the Act will prove of great advantage to the producers of Australia, and will afford some guarantee that, whilst they are engaged in their own enterprises, and following their own methods of life, their interests will as far as possible be preserved. </para>

                        <para>- I am satisfied to know that the Sea Carriage of Goods Act has the heart-whole support of so brilliant a member of the legal profession as the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne. He has told us how simple this Act is - how simple it is to interpret it. In doing so he has followed the example of nearly every lawyer who has been asked to interpret it. And yet almost every legal opinion consulted in the Commonwealth has placed upon it a different interpretation ! The honorable member for North Sydney tells us that the Act has operated wholly in the interests of the commercial classes, and I certainly think that the principle underlying it is just. While, however, the honorable member says that the persons most directly interested - namely, the shipping fraternity - cannot see any virtue in the Act, because it is intended to regulate their operations, it is only fair for us to consider whether the honorable member who, as a Minister, introduced the Bill into this House, would not merely be exhibiting one of the common weaknesses of human nature if he refused to see anything ill in his own ewe lamb. Judging from the remarks which have fallen from some honorable members, one would suppose that the honorable member for Wilmot had displayed anxiety to secure the repeal of the measure. I listened very carefully to him, but failed to detect any such intention on his part. His object was to direct the attention of the Government to what might prove to be certain faults in the Act, with a view to having them removed. I suppose honorable members are agreed as to the necessity for some such legislation ; but I think the honorable member for Wilmot has done well in initiating this discussion, because he has shown that the export trade affected by the measure is now divided into two classes. Our export trade falls into two classes. The first is a class of trade - such, for instance, as that in fruit and other perishable commodities between Australia and Great Britain - so well established and so constant as to secure a regular traffic of steamers with special facilities for catering for its wants. There is such competition in that trade that, despite legislation of this character - and I think such legislation is good, if well considered - it will still be carried on, and competition will govern the freights. There is another type of export trade, however, which does not from its importance guarantee a regular service of steamers properly fitted and equipped for its purposes; and such avenues of trade must be retarded by a measure of this kind to the detriment of the expansion of .the commerce of Australia. Throughout the Sea Carriage of Goods Act an obligation is inferentially cast on the owner to properly man, equip, and supply his ships. I do not know how it presents itself to my legal friends, who hope for so much from this measure, but to the lay mind the obligation &#34; to properly equip &#34; is such as to make any sane man refuse to carry perishable merchandise, unless his vessels are fitted with refrigerating chambers. Vessels running between Australia and countries, the trade of which we may desire to develop, may not have such refrigerating chambers; and may consequently be debarred by this Act from offering themselves as the only means of transport available, at a risk which the consignor and consignee would be willing to take, in view of all the circumstances. Certainly the attention of the Government may well be directed to that fact, with a view to see whether this measure, whilst rightly applying to the important lines of our export trade, may not act rather harshly upon other branches. I make this suggestion not in the interests of the ship-owners, for whom I do not stand here, but in the interests of the producers. </para>

                            <para>- The object of the honorable member for Wilmot is not to stifle our export trade, but to improve and .expand new markets which I hope in time will be of immense importance to the Commonwealth. The adjacency to Australia of 400,000,000 people of Eastern races should surely make the House and the country feel that all efforts should be directed to opening up and expanding those markets before other countries have established their trade therein. I hope that the Government will give most serious attention to the subject . introduced this afternoon by the honorable member for Wilmot. </para>

Even if it were only to&#39; afford public information on the question, an investigation by the Minister would be useful. All share the ambition of the honorable member for Wilmot that this trade, instead of being &#39;in any way impeded, should be fostered and enlarged to the utmost. </para>

                            <para>- Wherever there are trade prospects, it is admittedly our business to look into them, and in that connexion the honorable member has the House with him. It was only when he endeavoured to offer a reason why that trade  is thought to be impeded that he entered upon debatable ground, and gave rise to a discussion which was certainly interesting in itself, but to which, after the masterly statement made by the honorable member for North Sydney,- it is unnecessary for me to add a word. &#39; Whatever may be the cause, I think the House is fully satisfied that our trade with the East cannot have been impeded by the passage of the Sea Carriage of Goods Act, unless the passing of that measure has so fostered the through trade to London as to make it more profitable to the shipping companies to devote the whole of their space to the through trade, instead of giving part of it, as before, to half-way shipments to the East. </para>

We are concerned with the facts, and&#39; with their proper interpretation; but are not called upon at this time, except by way of defence, to contend that the honorable member has not proved his case. He cannot associate the want of accommodation for perishable produce to the East with the passing of the Sea Carriage of Goods Act. I do not desire to touch upon the other question, except to say that my own impression is, that while the House was considering this Bill - of which I was an innocent supporter - it was being assailed by that section of the press which usually supports honorable members opposite. That section of the press described the Bill as a State socialistic measure, and the late Government was censured for introducing it. If, therefore, an error has been committed in labelling it, the fault rests, not with those who now adopt that phraseology, but with those who, at the time the measure was before us, so described it. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. CAMERON</inline>(Wilmot).- I am quite satisfied with the proposal made by the Prime Minister. In bringing this matter before the House, I have been animated only by a desire to do the best for Australia. My wish is to ascertain whether trade has been diverted or checked on its way to the East by legislation that we have passed. If it has, then we should retrace our steps so far as is necessary. It is well known that America is competing in the countries of the East for trade that we are losing. It should be our desire to do our best to retain that trade. The motion of which I have given notice, will enable us to be supplied with information that will either prove or disprove what I have said to-day. If we find that the volume of our trade in perishable products with the East has decreased since the Sea Carriage of Goods Act has been in operation, that will be fairly conclusive evidence that such legislation is in the wrong direction. If, on the contrary, we learn that the trade is increasing - and according to my information it is not - we shall know that the statement I have made to-day regarding this question is erroneous. </para>

                        <para>- The remarks made by the Minister when introducing this Bill were particularly brief, and one would think from that fact that the measure was not of considerable importance. I hold that it is, on an analysis of its provisions, one that may have very far reaching effects upon our trade and commerce with other countries. According to clause 1, it may be cited as <inline font-style="italic">The Commerce Act</inline> 1905, but I think it might be described as &#34; a Bill to give the Minister power to obstruct commerce with other countries,&#34; to delegate to the Minister - who is not always proof against the importunity of persons interested in limiting competition - power to prohibit imports, to affix the Government hall-mark as to quality, class, and grade to all goods intended for export, and to make any Customs official, agent, or private person, importer, or exporter, an expert, in the words of clause 3- as to the nature, number, quantity, quality, purity, class, grade, measure, gauge, size, or weight of the goods. and - leaving out some other parts of the clause - as to the mode of manufacturing, producing, selecting, packing, or otherwise preparing the goods. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>For all these purposes the Minister is to assume a jurisdiction, whether it exists or not. We might also give this measure a sub-title, and describe it as &#34; a Bill to enable the Government to exercise its powers of initiating legislation - which are gradually becoming less as we are exhausting our rights under section 51 of the Constitution - to give them the power to pad their programmes with measures whose meretricious attractions may prove alluring . to those who subject measures to a merely perfunctory examination.&#34; As those intrusted with the working of the Constitution, it is our duty to see that its spirit is respected in our legislation. I feel confident that the leading motive of the Constitution as regards trade and commerce is that, subject to the necessities of imposing Customs and excise duties, trade and commerce, whether internal or external, shall be as free as possible. That direction is really given by section 92 of the Constitution, which declares that, after the imposition of Customs and excise duties, trade, commerce, and intercourse between the States is to be absolutely free. It is not merely to be free from fiscal restrictions, but unfettered by any obstruction on the part of a State or an individual that is likely to interfere with the free interchange of commodities or the free intercourse of people between one State and another. That is the leading principle of the Constitution, and although it does not apply in its entirety to foreign commerce, still in spirit, subject to the power to impose Customs duties, it does. The only limitation imposed as regards external commerce is that we have power to make certain fiscal arrangements. Subject to that, I believe that the spirit of the Constitution is that trade, whether external or internal, shall be as unhampered as possible. The principle of the Bill seems to be the very reverse. Those responsible for its form appear to think that it is the duty of the Federal Parliament, on the mere possibility of an evil accruing, to place as many obstructions in the way of intercourse with foreign countries as is possible. The question of the constitutionality of some of these provisions also arises. As I have already said, the Bill may be described as one, amongst other things, to assume power whether it exists or not. We find, according to <inline font-style="italic">Prentice and Egan,</inline> that the mere fact that commodities when manufactured are intended for export to other States, does not bring them within Federal direction and control. We find it stated at page 519 of <inline font-style="italic">Quick and Garran&#39;s Annotations</inline> to the Commercial Clauses of the Constitution that- </para>
                    <para>Commerce does not come within Federal jurisdiction and control until its transportation from one State to another, or from a State to a foreign country has begun. Even preparation for export is not sufficient. </para>
                    <para class="block">I have given a summary of the various decisions on which <inline font-style="italic">Quick and Garran</inline> base their statement, and a quotation from a leading American authority on the commerce clause of the American Constitution. It is clearly laid down that Federal jurisdiction does not commence until the commodity has really entered into the stream of commerce, whether internal or external. There are many matters which are more properly dealt with by the States. Even questions of importation are sometimes subject to State jurisdiction. I mention the importation of diseased cattle as an instance of questions which are left to the concurrent jurisdiction of the States. The draughtsman of this Bill, on the contrary, seems to think that Federal jurisdiction commences the moment that goods may possibly be exported or enter into Inter-State or external commerce, because clause 6 provides that- </para>
                    <para>Every person who intends to export any goods of a kind or class required under this Act to be inspected or examined by an officer shall, before the goods are shipped, give notice in accordance with the regulations to the Customs of his intention to export the goods, and of the place where the goods may be inspected. </para>
                    <para>Penalty&#163;20. </para>
                    <para class="block">So if he does not give a certain notice to the Customs Department, he is to be liable to a penalty of&#163;20. As I indicated in the beginning, there seems to me to be in the Bill a very liberal assumption of a jurisdiction the existence of which is at all events open to challenge. I consider that a great mistake. </para>

                            <para>- I say that it is open to challenge, and if I were to offer an opinion on it I should think that it could be challenged successfully, because the authorities I have quoted seem to me to indicate that the mere intention to export does not come under Federal jurisdiction. If the mere intention to export does not come under Federal jurisdiction, we have no power to declare that any person who intends to export any goods shall give a certain notice to the Customs Department under a penalty of &#163;20. Clause 6 might be one of those clauses which can have no effect, because they cannot be enforced. As a general principle of law, you cannot decide a man&#39;s intention unless it is evidenced by some outward act. </para>

In view of the authorities T have examined, I think we have no power to penalize a man simply because he fails to give a certain notice that he intends to do a certain act which he has not yet begun. </para>

                            <para>- A person may intend to do a certain thing, and before he does any act to carry out his intention he must under this clause give a certain notice. I merely say that that provision is open to challenge with a certain probability of success. So far then as to the scope of the Bill. The powers under the Bill, nearly all of which are given to the Minister or the Government, are most extensive and arbitrary. Under clause 5 there is a power given of inspection of prescribed goods, irrespective of whether they are subject to&#39;&#39; duty or not. These powers of inspection exist under the Customs Act, and they exist as ancillary to the Customs Act, even though they were not declared. But clause 5 of this Bill goes very much beyond that, in giving powers pf inspection in respect of certain goods which are not the subject of any impost at all on importation to the Commonwealth. If this Bill is incorporated with the Customs Act. and it deals with&#39; goods that are not subject to any Customs impost, the words used here may have a very wide significance. A power&#39; is given to search any place for goods, and these extensive powers of inspection may prove very harassing. Power is given to search&#39; for goods, probably in a private house, after importation, and although, as I have said, no claim can be made on the goods by the Treasury for the purpose of securing, duty. The powers given are not only very, extensive, but they are exceedingly arbitrary. I may mention that there is a; great difference between this Bill and the Customs Act as regards the prohibition of the importation of certain classes of goods. It is due to the public, and due to the importers and exporters that they should, know in express terms what goods cannot be imported without liability to forfeiture, or without the importer or exporter being&#93; liable to a penalty. We should not have our legislation in such a state that people in other countries intending to export goods&#39; to us would be constantly risking prosecution. Hence the Customs Act, so far as that could be done, supplies a list of imports which are prohibited There is undoubtedly in a paragraph of section 52 of the Customs Act a drag-net provision dealing with prohibited imports, but so far as Parliament could declare in express terms what commodities were not to be imported it did so. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g</inline> of the section to which I have referred provides that all goods, the importation of which may be prohibited by proclamation, shall be prohibited imports, but that provision is to. a great extent limited by the actual specification of prohibited goods in an earlier portion of the section. The im&#39;portations prevented under such a provi-sion are always very limited. I believe that up to the present time only certain articles which are likely&#39; to be deleterious if used in the manufacture of beer and other articles of consumption have been placed upon the list of imports prohibited by proclamation.. This shows that the Government regarded it as very dangerous to invest the Minister with the power to say that any particular articles are liable to seizure if imported. Under this Bill it is&#39; proposed to give to the Minister the whole power of determining what goods are not to be imported. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; but the description is to be prescribed by the Minister. If that description is false so as. to mislead in any particular, although innocently, the goods may be forfeited; but, if with the knowledge of the person importing or with the knowledge of the consignee, a fine of &#163;100 may be imposed, in addition to the forfeiture of the goods. The point I desire to . emphasize is that the Minister is given power . to declare what description is to be attached to any kind of goods, and if that is not complied with the goods may be prohibited, their innocent importation renders them liable to forfeiture, and their importation with a knowledge that they are prohibited by regulation or proclamation renders the person importing them, and any person aiding or abetting in their importation, liable to a fine of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100.</inline> I am aware of no legislation of this kind, although the Minister of Trade and Customs stated that this Bill is based on the Merchandise Marks Acf of 1887, of England. That is not so- As I shall endeavour to show later on, the principle of the Merchandise Marks Act is quite different. Without going into details at this stage the primary object of the Imperial Merchandise Marks Act of 1887 is to prevent the imposition by an importer* or by a vendor internally of false marks. The object of this Bill is to enable the Minister , to prescribe what description he thinks should be put upon goods, which is quite a different matter. Again, there is nothing in the Imperial Merchandise Marks Act of 1887 as to the quality of goods in relation to trade descriptions or false trade descriptions. The Imperial authorities knew the great difficulty there is in giving indications of quality or purity, and these words, which are of very far-reaching importance, are expressly omitted from the English Act to which reference has been made. Although we were told bv the Minister of Trade and Customs in introducing this Bil&#93; that with the exception of four or five clauses the Government have practically adopted the provisions of the Merchandise Marks Act of England, it is clear that they have not done -so. </para>

                            <para>- I refer, mainly to the principle of the Bill. For instance, there is clause 7 which, as I have endeavoured to point out, gives the Minister the power to prescribe that goods must have a certain trade description on them. He fixes what is -&#39;to be indicated by the description, and the goods are liable to forfeiture unless they have it on them. The Merchandise Marks Act of England, which is supposed to be the basis of this Bill, contains no such, provision. It deals simply with goods which have certain trade descriptions attached to them by importers - that have attached to them trade marks, to which the importer is. not entitled, or false trade descriptions. But there is nothing to prevent importation without any description of quality, quantity, or of the other requirements of clause 3. I have examined the provisions of the two measures, and find that that is the difference between them.

                            <para>- There is no such provision in the Merchandise Marks Act, but, I think the Commission which recommended the introduction of that measure dealt with the suggestion that goods manufactured in Germany should be marked &#34; Made in Germany, &#34; and the importation provisions of the Act were largely due to the fact that goods were imported into England from </para>

                    <para class="block">Germany bearing on them a mark of origin indicating that they had been manufactured in England, whereas they had really been manufactured elsewhere. There is nothing in the English Act to force an importer to give a description of the quality or purity of the goods imported, or to comply with any of the other requirements of clause 3 of the Bill. In that respect the Bill is the very opposite of the English Act. To show how harassing the Bill may prove to importers, and, to a certain extent, to exporters, one has only to read the list of articles given by the Minister at page 631 of the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> report of his speech as likely to be proclaimed. We should avoid as much as possible legislating by proclamation or regulation. How can an exporter from England know what our laws are when they are made in that way ? Because a proclamation may be issued at any time, even when goods are on the sea, declaring that their importation will be stopped unless they comply with certain conditions, with which, under the circumstances, it is impossible for them to comply. Then, again, the regulations issued by the Minister may be buried away in the <inline font-style="italic">Government Gazette,</inline> so that persons residing in other parts of the world will not know, what is prescribed. Notwithstanding these facts, the provisions of the measure are highly penal, and infringements of them may subject importers to the forfeiture of goods. Regulations made under the Act will become operative immediately on proclamation. We should, as far as possible, instead of providing in Acts of this kind for the making of regulations which will not be easily ascertained by those whom they concern, and especially not by exporters from other countries, endeavour to make our legislation explicit in itself. The Minister has informed us that he wishes to get power under the Bill to prescribe in regard to such articles, among others, as beer, butter, candles, cheese, . fish, fruits, furniture, jams, jellies, leather, salt, soap, spirits, and starch, what description shall be given to them to designate their purity, quality, place of manufacture, ingredients, &#38;c. He will have to be an expert in regard to almost everything imported into the country to lay down some method of describing with accuracy, or so as to prevent the making of mistakes, the nature of the contents of imports, their place of origin, degree of purity, quality, and so forth. Not only 1 so, but he will require to have at every ; port of importation officers who will be capable of properly administering the law. There is a great safeguard in the English </para>
                    <para class="block"> Act in the fact that that Act deals principally with trade marks, since it is easy to identify a false trade mark, or the misapplication of a trade mark. Then the definition of trade description is much more limited in the English Act than it is in the Bill. The Bill adds several words which are not to be found in the Merchandise Marks Act. In clause 3, paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a,</inline> the words &#34; quality and purity &#39; &#39; have been added. In paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b,</inline> the words, &#34; selecting, packing, or otherwise preparing the goods,&#34; have been added.&#39; The  only  words in the English Act are &#34;as to the  mode of manufacturing and producing.&#34; Then in paragraph e the word &#34;ingredients &#34; has&#39; been added, the English Act reading &#34;as to the material of which any goods are composed,&#34; the Bill adding &#34; or from which they are derived.&#34; But even without the addition of the words to which I have referred, -each one of the English provisions has led to litigation. There has been great  difficulty  in defining the place or origin of goods, several cases having turned on that point. Good&#39;s made almost en-  tirely  in France have been found to have been manufactured in some part elsewhere, and watches have been confiscated because, although made in England, they contained one or two wheels which had been made abroad, and put together in England. </para>
                    <para class="block">
            <inline font-style="italic">Kerly</inline>points out that in many cases it is almost impossible to comply with the pro- visions of the law, though, as regards false trade descriptions, there is the saving provision that the false description must mislead in some particular. That, of course, gets over the question as to where the goods originated, because, if they have been made principally in one country, it may be held that it is not a misleading description in a material point to designate that country as their place of origin. The Bill, however, will require a far greater degree of efficiency on the part of the officers stationed at our ports of importation than is required by the English Act. Not &#39; only must the Minister fix upon proper standards of description, but the clerks administering the Act, together with the exporter, importer, and consignee of the goods must all to&#39; a large extent be experts. The exporter is liable if he does not &#39;comply with the description laid down by the Minister, in regard to the various matters mentioned in clause 3. Therefore I say that the Bill will lead to very great oppression of exporters and importers, and, instead of encouraging trade, may seriously hamper it. It is significant that in England they are unable to work a Merchandise Marks Act without the help of informers. We have had instances recently of local competitors giving information to a Minister. Under the Bill, every one who may be affected by the importation of a particular class of goods in the way of trade competition will importune the Minister to issue proclamations varying the descriptions. There is noe the same danger in England that there would be here, for the reason which I have pointed out, because very little harm can come of the registered owner of a trade mark stating to the Minister that it is being violated by an importer. The definitions of trade descriptions in the English Act are so clear, and are so much less comprehensive than are those in the Bill, that there is not the same likelihood of a Minister there being importuned and misled by interested persons as to the description of certain classes of imports as there will be here. The fact is that the Department cannot get on very well, even in England, without the help of those affected by the competition of imports. To quote <inline font-style="italic">Kerly</inline><inline font-style="italic">-</inline></para>
                    <para>The regulations provide, in accordance with the Act, that where goods are detected by the officers to be such as are prohibited to be imported, they are to be detained. They do not, however, contemplate that the officers will be competent of their own knowledge to detect the attempted in- infringement of the Act in all cases, or in all classes of cases; and accordingly they make provision for the officers to act upon information given by private persons, for instance, by the owners of trade marks or names which are likely to be wrongly used on imported goods, and in certain cases they require the informants to give security, or to make a deposit of money, as a condition of the detention of the goods. </para>
                    <para>Where there is merely a false trade description, or the use of a trade mark by a person who is not the registered owner of it, the supplying of information by interested parties may be a comparatively innocent thing. But if the Minister is to be set in motion in regard to the quality, purity, place of origin, or method of manufacture of goods, it may lead to an immense amount of harassing of industry, and an interference with the administration of the Customs Department which we certainly should not encourage. For these reasons I think that the Bill is too drastic. It is altogether too comprehensive, and is not necessitated by anything I have heard urged in its favour. I do not know whether it would not be well to vote against the second reading, and thus throw on the Minister the responsibility attaching to its introduction; but, at any rate, if an amendment is moved to refer it to a Select Committee, I shall vote for that. </para>

                            <para>- The criticism directed against this Bill has come from the Opposition side of the House, and the honorable and learned member for Angas handled his subject with such great ability that I should have thought he would claim the attention of the Prime Minister, who, I understand, is to-day in charge of the measure. The honorable and learned member for Angas rightly described the Bill as one to prevent commerce. He might have gone a little further and described it as a Bill not merely to prevent commerce, but also to destroy industry and retard the business operations of the community. It will be impossible to carry on business under the Bill, except by a process of evasion. The measure, on its face, aims at preventing deception in trade operations ; but it will in reality encourage deception. If it be passed in its present form, persons interested in the commerce of the country will be able to operate their businesses to advantage only by a process of evasion and deception. Above all things, any legislation we pass in this House ought as far as possible to aim at making it easy to do right and difficult to do wrong; but if, as this Bill proposes, we practically tie a man up, and give him no means of escape, except he resort to deception, we shall proceed in a contrary direction. That is one of my complaints against this measure. Instead of making it easy for a trader to do what is fair and right, it is proposed to bind him down by such restrictions, and to impose upon him such hardships, as will lead him to do what he otherwise would not be impelled to do. This is another of those regulative measures which seem to be teeming forth from the various Governments of Australia just now, and particularly from the Federal Government. I take leave to say that there has been so much of this kind of legislation recently as to show a great want of the sense of perspective on the part of those who are responsible for it. It seems to be supposed that if a Bill is introduced to impose certain restrictions upon trade, we shall necessarily promote the welfare of the community at large, and help to build up the industrial prosperity of Australia. We might, however, with advantage form a larger conception of the functions of government. One may very well ask how much further this restrictive legislation will go before we are afforded an opportunity to deal with those large subjects of public concern which have to do with the peopling of the Continent, and the setting up of a prosperous and happy people here. I am not now questioning the right of the Government to impose any restrictions they please. I suppose that the right of the Government to interfere with the occupations of the people nowadays, and with commerce and trade, extends . to the utmost detail of the individual life of the community. Admitting, however, that the Government may have this technical right, I challenge the wisdom of a measure of this kind as applied to a young and struggling community like ours. The Prime Minister hardly ever mounts a platform but he treats us to a most beautiful and sage discourse upon what should occupy the minds of the legislators of Australia ; but I should like to know how much further we are going to push restrictive legislation of this kind before we deal with the larger matters which have been awaiting our attention for the past five years. For instance, what is to become of our electoral machinery, or the great problem of the transfer of. the States debts? Why are not proposals brought forward relating to that matter which has been vaguely described by the Prime Minister as &#34; population,&#34; involving, of course, the appointment of a High Commissioner, and the advertising of Australia? Then, again, what about the Capital question, and our defences? </para>

                            <para>- There is no need for Standing Orders now that certain honorable members have removed from the Opposition benches to the Ministerial corner. Looking at the business-paper, it seems to me that the Government are exhibiting a strange lack of the sense of perspective in regard to the legislation which demands our attention. Instead of dealing first with what should come first, they seem to thrust upon our attention the subjects of least moment. I have looked through the Bill, and have asked myself whether there is any need for it. Our commerce is not very large yet. In Great Britain they get along without a Bill of this kind, although the value of their trade aggregates&#163;850,000,000. whereas ours represents only&#163;86,000,000. Why should we tie up our trade by means of stringent regulations and restrictions? I submit that we might very well take a leaf out of the commercial book of the old country, and put aside all restrictions until our trade has acquired a volume something like that of Great Britain. </para>

                            <para>- Of course it is; but having regard to our isolated position, and to our great empty continent, we have every reason to aim at encouraging our commerce, instead of restricting it in every shape and form. I desire to say a word or two with regard to some of the reasons given by the Minister for the introduction of the Bill. Of all the second-reading speeches that ever preceded the discussion of a Bill of this kind, commend me to the deliverance of the Minister of Trade and Customs. He occupied about a quarter of an hour, but gave us no description of the Bill or its principles. He uttered only one or two vague sentences in giving us his reasons for its introduction at the present time. He said that the Bill was the result of some understanding arrived at at the Hobart Conference. In making that statement, however, he conveyed a totally erroneous impression. There was never any understanding at all. The matter was introduced, under the head of &#34; The development of the resources of Australia,&#34; by the honorable member for Gippsland, who urged the need of uniformity in the standardization of goods for export through the medium of an agricultural bureau. That was the utmost that was stated at Hobart, and that is the extent of the justification for the Minister&#39;s reference to what was done at that gathering. Will it be believed that every Premier present at that Conference disagreed with the honorable member for Gippsland, declared that there was no need for such legislation, and that under no circumstances would he consent to it. Yet the Minister of Trade and Customs has the audacity to tell us that this measure was practically agreed to at the Hobart Conference ! A more misleading statement was never made to this House: The Minister went on to tell us his reasons for introducing the Bill. He said, &#34; This is a Bill to confer greater and more discretionary powers on the officials of the Customs Department.&#34; In Heaven&#39;s name, if the powers they now possess are not sufficiently large, and if the discretion they are able to exercise is not sufficiently extensive, I should like to know what more is required. At any rate, the harvester scandal took place under our present laws, and if we are going to have any repetition of that incident we shall have to seriously consider the question of curtailing, instead of increasing, the power of the Minister. If we confer greater discretion on the Customs officials, we shall really clothe the Minister with greater powers. His present powers are sufficient to enable him to ruthlessly break in upon the trade relations of reputable firms, and practically hold up their business, by increasing the import duties upon their goods by from 50 to 100 per cent. If we are going to give this power to the Minister of Trade and Customs, or to any other Minister, it will be a sorry look out for the country unless we have a much wiser Government in office than we now appear to have. The honorable member went on to say that another of the objects of the Bill - </para>

As to many of the goods to which this Bill will apply, the Minister can interfere only to the great detriment of our commerce. If he could interfere,, and set up a better standard to facilitate our commercial operations in so far as these goods are concerned, I should say, &#34; Give him the power by all means&#34;; but it is because, I am sure that it is not within the ken of one man to do so that I say this power should not be given to any Minister. </para>

There are abuses in relation to every industry in the world, but may I remind the honorable member that even Governments do not always carry out their functions perfectly. Has the honorable member closed his eyes to what is going on at the present moment in New South Wales in connexion with the lands of that State? Has he never heard of some of the strange things which the Government in his own State have allowed to take place? Does he not know that we have to &#34;police&#34; our Governments in all these functions, just as keenly as ordinary individuals have to be policed. After all, Governments are composed of ordinary human beings. </para>

                            <para>- One kind of human nature is to be pitted against another? My difficulty in regard to the honorable member is that he wishes an ignorant sort of human nature to be allowed to determine the direction which the operations of men who have spent their lives in the acquirement of particular kinds . of knowledge shall take. That is my whole criticism against this Bill. The Government cannot possibly know as much about these matters as the persons concerned. They cannot of themselves prescribe standards or descriptions as accurately as can those who are engaged in a trade to which this measure will apply. The markets of the world are in the last resort the great standardizing agents. I wish to know why this Bill relates only to commerce beyond the Commonwealth. Let me give the Minister an illustration of that which I have in mind. We are told that wine is to be standardized before it can be sent abroad. </para>

                            <para>- That seems to be really the case. We may have to put up with any kind of rubbish in the shape of wine. It may be adulterated with sugar, and water, as is now alleged to be the case with&#39; wine sold in some of the States, and possibly those who are making better wine will have to contend against that disability. These practices may still continue, so far as wine intended for local consumption is concerned, but the moment any wine is to be exported the Government step in, and say that it must be up to a prescribed standard. In other words, the Government is setting up a standard in the case of goods to be consumed by people outside to the great detriment in many cases Of those within the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- I think that we are acting wrongly in prescribing a standard in relation to goods for export, and failing to fix one for goods to be locally consumed. Let us look at the question as it affects boots and shoes. Under this Bill a standard is to be set up for boots and shoes intended for export. The trade will not be able to export boots beyond the Commonwealth, except such as are prescribed by the Customs officer. Is not the proposal absurd? How could an officer say whether such articles were up to the prescribed standard unless he saw them being &#39; made and was an expert in every branch&#39; of the boot and shoe trade? Who could prescribe a standard for a good boot or shoe, having regard to the way in which the trade is specialized? </para>

                            <para>- To the whole boot. According to this Bill, we are to have a Government official who is to say whether a boot is thoroughly and roundly made - whether the leather is good, whether the sole has been properly put on, and, in short, whether all the work appertaining to its manufacture has been carried out properly. It is absurd to expect this work to be carried out by any Government official, and particularly by any Customs officer. And so with apparel. We are to have a Government officer to say what kind of apparel shall be exported,, but no provision is made in the Bill in regard to the apparel, or -the boots and shoes, which the people of the Commonwealth shall wear. They may buy the veriest rubbish in the&#39; way of boots and shoes that they please, but no one must seek to induce persons outside the Commonwealth to buy such rubbish from Australia. I was told the other day by a woollen expert, that no man - not even those who are engaged in the trade - can tell whether sixpence a yard has been taken out of the quality of a cloth. If that be the case with regard to our woollen manufactures, how will a Government expert be able to set up a standard for the whole world? How will he be able to say what shall be a proper standard for cloth, and whether any cloth proposed to be exported is up to that standard, when the best experts assert that it is impossible to tell within a margin, which means a profitable enterprise or an unprofitable one- </para>

I am afraid this is .a Bill to bring about prohibition in many of the commercial and trading relations of the Commonwealth. I do not wish to touch the fiscal aspect of the question, but, apart from any consideration of the kind, protectionists and free-traders are alike interested in seeing that the Parliament itself prescribes the conditions under which that commerce shall be carried on, and that it is not left to a Minister to prohibit the importation, or exportation, of goods at his own sweet will, whim or caprice. If the Bill is to be passed as it stands, the Minister will require, as the honorable and learned member for Angas has very properly pointed1 out, a staff of inspectors and experts, which it is appalling to contemplate. It will be one of the most costly measures that has ever been passed. When we seek to do impossible things, we give people a motive for evading our legislation, and betaking themselves to that very deception which it is the very aim of this legislation to prevent. </para>

                            <para>- What I said was that this Bill would have a tendency to drive people to seek to evade its provisions as long as it remained in its present form. That&#39; is one of my main points. It proposes to set up a standard, as to which the Minister must be absolutely ignorant, and it must inevitably fail. The Bill aims at providing what the quality of articles of export and import shall be. How can a Government know whether an article is worthless or valuable? As was pointed out during the debate last week, an article which may be absolutely useless for one purpose might be valuable for another. The honorable and learned member for Werriwa showed that potatoes, which might have no value for the purposes of food, might yet be very valuable for spirit distillation. </para>

                            <para>- No. There is a prescribed trade description to be set up by a Government official, and unless the person concerned conforms to that particular description, his goods may be forfeited. No Government should attempt to set up a standard for goods, or to brand them, unless they can guarantee them as to their ultimate use. Unless a Government can go through the whole of the ramifications - of an industry, and say what this or that particular thing is to be applied to finally, they should nor. undertake the responsibility of forfeiting goods, because they do not happen to be in accordance with a Government trade description. Then again, things which might be good here, might, after they leave our ports, develop latent defects on the voyage. I believe that is a common experience in connexion with many of our staple industries. That might happen in connexion with fruit, preserved fish, preserved meats, or preserved milk. Is a Government official to say that preserved milk shall be made in a certain way? This Bill says so. Under this Bill, the Government are to say what ingredients shall be used in the manufacture of condensed milk. The Government take the power to mate up these prescriptions in relation to all the products of the country. For instance, it is provided that a trade description may mean in relation to any goods - </para>

If a man says, &#34; These goods are all right,&#34; the Minister, under this Bill, takes the power to say that they are wrong, and there is into appeal from his decision. The Minister may do certain things of grace, if he pleases, but he is made the final arbiter under the Bill. This is a monstrous power to put into the hands of any Minister for a purpose of this kind. </para>

This Bill provides for a precise description, and the standardization of goods, and it will inevitably drive people to evade its provisions. They cannot live as they do if the Bill is permitted to remain as it is at present. Let us look at one of the methods by which all this is to be done by the Government. Under clause 5, for instance, it is provided that - </para>

                            <para>- If they are doing good work now, where is the need for this measure? Is the intention really to multiply the number of inspectors? I believe that inspectors in the service of the States are doing good work, on the whole, and that is all the more reason why we should not meddle with them. Here it is proposed to provide that, notwithstanding the inspection of fruit by State inspectors, when it is brought to the wharf to be sent away, it is to be turned out for inspection and examination by an officer under this Bill. Nothing more absurd was ever put on paper. </para>

                            <para>- I do not say that they are doing good work in any such ridiculous way as is here proposed. The inspectors are working in the various States under far more reasonable enactments than are proposed in this Bill. I am endeavouring to point out that this Bill is unworkable. I admit that it appears to be impossible to make any criticism of any Bill submitted to the House by the present Government without being immediately challenged by the opposition of honorable members in the Labour corner. I do not know why it is, but one has only to make the slightest criticism of any Government measure, to provoke the opposition of honorable members in that corner. Ever since I rose to address myself to the provisions of this Bill, I have been subjected to a running fire of interjections from the honorable member for Hindmarsh. </para>

                            <para>- I venture to say that it is not done in South Australia. It is a mere pretence of doing it, if anything of the kind does take place. It is a physical impossibility to do any such thing. I take the case of the fruit growers of my own State, and I know that it is a common thing with them to get a wire from New Zealand for a shipment of oranges. The price is quoted in the telegram sent in the morning, and the request is made that the oranges should be shipped by a boat leaving the same afternoon. The fruit-growers have to pull the fruit from the trees, pack it, cart it ten or a dozen miles to a railway station, send it in to Sydney, and then to the boat to go out that night. How is it possible for these men to give this notice to an inspector, and have that fruit thoroughly examined before it is placed on board ship? I remind honorable members also that it is to the interests, of fruit-growers that their fruit, and especially soft fruits,, should be kept on the trees till the very last moment. They do not desire to take their fruit from the trees until it is necessary to send it direct to the boat, otherwise they have all they can do to ship it in a state of good preservation. If there is to be an inspector to whom the fruit grower must give notice, and if he has to assemble his fruit wherever he may be directed to do so for the purpose of examination, running a risk that the officer may be employed with some other duty when he requires him to inspect his fruit, the result will be disastrous and ruinous to his industry. </para>

I should like to know how people living at the uttermost ends of the earth are to know what the Minister means, or how he is to interpret his own trade descriptions. I suppose there are hardly any two men who would interpret a trade description in the same way. People are to run the risk of having a whole shipment of goods prohibited, simply because the Customs official here may interpret a trade description in a way contrary 10 the interpretation put upon it by some men at the other end of the earth. And, so far as I know, there is to be no appeal. How is an importer to inform a man at the other end of the world exactly what is meant by a given trade description? </para>

                            <para>- It might be done with tea as readily as with anything; but it would be a difficult thing to do with fruit and perishable produce generally. I do not object to all the supervision that may be possible ; but the Bill goes to extremes such as are not contemplated by the English Act, although in that country they have a trade and commerce ten times as large as ours. For every&#163;1 worth of commerce that we have, the old country has &#163;10 worth; but it has no such restrictive regulations as it is proposed to bring into force here. Then, again, the. Bill says that any goods which do not come up to a prescribed standard may be forfeited <inline font-style="italic">instanter,</inline> and the owner would have no redress unless the Minister liked to give him redress. The Minister of the day may act in regard to all the minute ramifications of the commerce of the country as the Minister of Trade and Customs acted the other day in regard to certain harvesters. In that case he interposed to prevent the importation of an article without giving notice of his intention to those most keenly interested. Acting on his own sweet will and discretion, he blocked the importation of those goods, and the importers had no redress. This is not a matter of fiscalism ; it is a question of getting fair-play for the industries of Australia. I understand that the Minister aims in this Bill at setting up standards for certain foods and medicines imported into this country. Against that function of the measure, I have not a word to say, because I think it absolutely necessary in the interests of the public health of Australia to take all the precautions we can to prevent patent foods and medicines which are likely to be injurious from getting into general use. I should like to see the Governments of the States doing what is done on the Continent of Europe, where quack medicines are analyzed, and their formulae proclaimed to the world. I often read <inline font-style="italic">Science Siftings,</inline> a very useful paper, nearly every issue of which contains the formula of some new patent medicine which has been put on the market ; and I believe that in Germany Government officials analyze all these remedies, and make public their ingredients. That is a work which might very well be done by our Governments; and if the functions of the Bill were limited to the safeguarding of the public from injurious food and medicines, I would readily and cordially support the measure. But we have the means of doing what is necessary in that direction in the Health Departments of the various States. In addition to the extensive laboratories of the Customs Department, each of the Health Departments of the States has a laboratory, so that there is all the machinery and paraphernalia necessary to analyze foods and medicines likely to prove injurious to health. But, as the Bill goes further, and interferes with the commerce of the country down to the minutest detail, there is only one description which can be applied to it, namely, that of the honorable and learned member for Angas, that it is a Bill to prevent commerce, and not a measure to facilitate trade and to standardize our products. The plenary powers given to the Minister will tend to subvert the purpose at which the Bill is aimed, and the measure will have a result quite the opposite of what is intended. It makes it so impossible for persons to carry on. business and trading operations without fraud that it will in many cases drive the traders of the community, and others, to evasions which will defeat the very purposes which we have in view. It is impossible to do all that the Bill aims to do in the matter of prescribing proper designations for all the goods imported into this country, and therefore the measure must ultimately fail. It has been severely criticised by those who are most interested in commerce in Australia. Every Chamber of Commerce has protested against its passing, and I presume that the members of those bodies may be allowed to know a little about the subject. We may denounce them as honorable members sometimes do as members of a capitalistic class, who have sectional ends- to serve ; but, taking a broad view, they may be presumed to know what is best for the trading relations of the country in the largest sense. The Chambers of Commerce all over Australia unanimously &#39; condemn the Bill. </para>

Men who are as honest as we are, and who are assisting to build up the commerce of Australia, protest against the Bill, on the. ground that it will ruin their business. Many persons in my own electorate, particularly fruit-growers and farmers, say that the provisions of the Bill are unworkable.

If ever there was a Bill&#34; that needed to be sent to a Select Committee, by which, the. statements made by such persons as I have referred to could-, be tested, this is such a Bill. I strongly suggest to the Government that they should allow it to be inquired into by a Select. Committee, and that the honorable member for Hindmarsh, should be made a member of that committee. I should like to see him confronting some of these men in regard to their statements about their own business. I am sure that he would be able to teach them all about it. </para>

                            <para>- There is not much suggestion of fair play in the interjection of the honorable member for Southern Melbourne. A Select Committee could gather information from one end of the continent to the other, from persons who are in business, and would tell us what the effect of the Bill would be, .and the House, having the recommendation of the Committee, before it, would be in a better position to form an accurate judgment in regard to the measure than it is in now. We do not know enough about the commerce of the country to be able to say that the provisions of the Bill will not injuriously affect it. The Minister of Home Affairs has said that it will not hurt anybody&#39;s business; but he has&#39; spent all his&#39; life in a lawyer&#39;s office. </para>

                            <para>- No ; I would abolish them as readily as would the honorable member. But I would not include honest with dishonest traders, and pass rule of thumb provisions, which will make it almost impossible for any traders to conduct their business honestly. The aim of our legislation should be to make it easy to do right, and difficult to do wrong, but. the Bill provides a motive for all kinds of evasion, for the simple reason that it will be almost impossible for traders to comply with its provisions. Then the trade designations prescribed may ; be ignorantly framed, and, in this way, the purpose contemplated by the measure may be defeated. We. require further light from those who can tell how their businesses will be affected by such legislation; and the Government should, therefore, refer the Bill to a Select Committee. I make this suggestion in the most friendly way, because I believe that if the Bill were passed in its present form the result would be most disastrous to the commerce of Australia. I suggest, also, as I did at the beginning of my speech, that it is about time that this Parliament devoted its attention to some of those larger proposals about which we have heard so much, and for the time relegated to the background restrictive proposals such as that now before us. We shall get along very well without this Bill. We have done so for many years. The old country manages very well without any such measure, and yet its commerce is ten times more valuable than our own. </para>

                            <para>- Have they all been converted then - have they been inoculated with socialistic virus? Perhaps this measure is to be regarded as the sign and seal of their conversion. The Bill now before us would be mischievous, and I suggest that a further inquiry should be made by a Select Committee, representative of the commercial knowledge of the House, which could ascertain the opinions of those who are most keenly interested in the measure, who have the most to lose if it prove mischievous, and the most to gain if it be made a thoroughly workable and honest enactment. I admit the necessity of legislating upon some of the matters dealt with by the Bill, but we should frame a measure that will not have the far-reaching and dire effects that would follow the passing of the Bill now before us. In the meantime we could give our attention to some of those matters upon which so much stress has been laid by the Prime Minister, and seek to increase the volume of our trade rather than hinder it and fetter it. We should aim at increasing our trade, because that would lead to an increase of our population, and the establishment of a happy and prosperous race of industrials, who would form the most secure barrier that could stand between us and any danger that might threaten us from outside. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Parramatta commenced his speech by deprecating the absence of honorable members from the Government benches, and later on, when several honorable members were present, and were taking an interest in his criticisms, he objected to any remarks being made by them. It is really difficult to please the honorable member. It apparently escaped the attention of the honorable member that at the time he made his first complaint there were present only four members of the Opposition - the party upon whom the special duty of criticising the proposals of the Government falls. The honorable member said that this Bill would destroy commerce and industry, but that seems to me to be rather violent language to direct against a measure of this kind. What terms would the honorable member use in regard to a Bill that would really have such an effect as he describes? The language used by the honorable member with regard to some of the proposals with which he does not agree is extraordinarily vehement. I admit that he speaks in a most interesting manner, and that very often his criticisms are sound and worthy of attention, but surely it is unnecessary to stigmatize a Bill of this character in the violent language the honorable member has used. As a matter of fact, I do not know that I am in agreement with the whole of the provisions of the Bill, although I am thoroughly in accord with its general object. I am not sure that I shall be in favour of giving to the Minister of Customs the very large powers proposed, unless clear proof of their necessity is afforded. I admit that it is desirable to grant large powers to the Minister, because otherwise it may be impossible to prevent fraud, but we must guard against going any further than is absolutely necessary in that direction. If it can be shown that the powers proposed to be granted are excessive, I shall be prepared to join other honorable members in limiting them. </para>

I admit that he made out a good case as to the harassing effects of such provisions if they were stupidly applied, but we are entitled to assume that a little common sense will be exercised even by Customs inspectors. Occasionally abuses will creep in, but we must run the risk of that. The honorable member also said that a considerable outcry had been raised by the commercial class against this measure, and that the Chambers of Commerce of all the States have protested against it. If I recollect rightly, there was also a strong protest from the commercial section of the community when the Sea Carriage of Goods Bill was before this Chamber. </para>

                            <para>- It was represented by a very large section of the commercial community that that measure would probably have the effect of increasing freights and doing great injury to our export trade, and the late Attorney-General had to make a very vigorous reply to the criticisms to which he was subjected for entering a socialistic trap and endeavouring to hamper trade and commerce in everyway. In spite of all the criticism that was directed against that measure, we nave heard to-day scarcely anything but praise of its results. That measure, which was expected to bring our commerce to ruin and disaster, has proved highly beneficial, and probably a similar thing will happen with regard to the present Bill. The members of the Chambers of Commerce are naturally inclined to think that any legislation of a restrictive character will hamper trade. Commercial men are very conservative in regard to any proposal to interfere with the conditions governing trade and industry, and are disposed to feel alarmed when any alterations are suggested. I do not think this House will, because of the fears of commercial men that industry will be hampered, stay its hand in its efforts to protect the public against false descriptions of goods, or to protect the producers of Australia against the disaster which may be visited upon them if the reputation of Australian produce is injured by persons who are careless or unscrupulous. The chief accusation levelled against the Bill is that its provisions in regard to the inspection of exports are impracticable. I should like to say, however, that the experience of one or other of the States has shown conclusively that none of these proposals is incapable of being successfully carried out. I believe it is a fact that in most of the States the system of Government inspection of exports now obtains. It is certainly in operation in South Australia in relation to most of the products to which it is said the provisions of this Bill cannot be applied. All fruit exported from South Australia - and especially that intended for the other States - is most carefully inspected by Government experts. The fear expressed by the honorable member for Franklin that in some way or other this Bill would prevent a shipment of apples being hurriedly; completed under special circumstances is due to a mistaken view of what is intended. It is surely not necessary to the carrying out of the provisions of the Bill that all the cases of fruit intended for shipment shall be lumped together on one wharf for examination. We do not attempt any such ridiculous practice in South Australia. A man who has a shipment of fruit to send away telephones to the Department, or in some other way most convenient to him, informs it that he will have a consignment ready at a certain hour, and an inspector is at once sent to examine it. These inspections are made, not only on the wharfs, but at the packing-houses. In the case of a grower directly exporting a large quantity of fruit, the inspections take place al the orchard. There are many growers who directly export their good&#39;s, and in their case the examination is always made at the orchard. </para>

                            <para>- They certainly are, and I am showing that I am equally anxious that their reputation shall remain untarnished. The honorable .member will recognise that it is to the interest of every producer of milk throughout the Commonwealth that the reputation of Australian butter should be kept as high as possible. He must be aware however, that, in the absence of some form of Government supervision, there would be nothing to prevent the industry from being ruined by a consignment sent to the markets of the old country by a man who had no permanent interest in the trade, but had simply managed to secure a quantity of inferior butter for export purposes. Firms which are regularly engaged in the trade have a reputation to preserve, and would not think of exporting inferior produce; but it is absolutely essential to the protection of Australian producers that some provision of this kind- should obtain. Even admitting that one or two growers might find once or twice, during a season, that, owing to the system of Government inspection, they could not complete their shipments by a few cases - and I. do not admit that anything of the kind is likely to occur - is it not a great deal better that they should suffer that temporary disadvantage than that the whole reputation of Australian produce should be seriously damaged, as it has been on many occasions, by men who have simply gone into the export trade for a time, and, failing to make a success of it, have dropped out of it. </para>

                            <para>- Speaking from memory, it is carried out under regulation by the responsible Minister. The whole system has arisen from the development of the State Government Export Department, which has grown from a very small branch to one of considerable proportions. I have not been very many years in political life, but was a member of the South Australian Parliament when it was first proposed to establish a wine depot in London. It is out of that proposal that the very large State Export Department of South Australia has been evolved. That Department carries out the whole of the business relating to the export trade, for local shippers, and deals with a considerable variety of produce. I am reminded by the honorable member for Grey that it owes its origin really to a former leader of the Labour Party in the State House of Assembly. The proposal, as first made, was that a depot for wine should be established, but the then leader of the Labour Party moved to insert the words &#34; and other produce.&#34; The amendment was carried, but, as may be surmised, the words so inserted were struck out by the Legislative Council. The Government, of which, you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> were a member, and of which the right honorable member for Adelaide was leader, determined, however, to act on the decision of the House of Assembly, and set to work to develop the export trade, not only in relation .to wines, but other South Australian products. Curiously enough, it is only in connexion with the wine trade that any suspicion as to the success of the export business conducted by the South Australian Government has arisen. With the exception of the selling of wine in small lines in London, the undertaking has been an undoubted success, and even the placing of small lines of wine with hotelkeepers and other retailers in London might have been successfully carried on by the wine depot if the Government had entered upon an extensive system of advertising. Honorable members will recognise, however, that the general body of taxpayers did not relish the proposal to spend a large sum of money on advertising the products of only a small section of the producers, and, consequently, in the absence of sufficient funds for this purpose, so as to enable the depot to compete successfully with Burgoyne&#39;s and others, who advertise very largely and hold a considerable number of the tied houses, the Government, during the last ta&#39;.v years, have ceased to carry on the sale of wine in small quantities. The establishment of the export depot was advocated as calculated to tend to the benefit of producers, and no question was raised as <inline font-style="italic">10</inline> whether or not it was a move in the direction of Socialism. Latterly, of course, those who are opposed to Government intervention in any way, have referred to the undertaking as a piece of State Socialism. Although the Export Department has been referred to as a socialistic enterprise, it has been just as pronounced a success as has the State Socialism of the Postal Department. </para>

                            <para>- We had one expert, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomson,</inline> who practically inspected all butter sent through the Export Department. He knew his business, and he is now doing the same work for Queensland. Then in connexion with the export of wine, we had a viticulturist, Professor Perkins, than whom no better man can be found in Australia as an expert in wine, and he performed the same duties in connexion with that industry. Though, of course, rejected meat has not been shipped, it has sometimes happened that butter and wine which have been rejected have been subsequently exported, and in one case within my knowledge goods rejected have on export brought a better price than those which have been passed. Honorable members will know that that may be the experience of any expert. The taste for wine is capricious, and time has often a great effect upon its value. On the whole, there has never been a suggestion that Professor Perkins, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thomson,</inline> or any of the other experts have not carried out their duties of grading and inspecting to the satisfaction of the producers generally. The men to whom I have referred are .experts, and I do not overlook the fact that under this Bill it would appear that these duties are to be performed bv Customs officers. To give these powers of inspection to men who are not experts would be a mistake. Without examination by experts, we cannot look for anything like careful grading, but can only in a general way prevent the export of goods that are manifestly inferior. Goods must be very distinctly inferior before a man who is not an expert will take the responsibility of prohibiting their export. </para>

                            <para>- We can discuss that matter in Committee, but I think the Minister will find that for this duty he must have men who are expert. This should not involve additional expense in South Australia, at all events, because in all probability the men who are doing this work for the State would continue it under this Bill. In connexion with the export of fruit, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Quinn,</inline> the expert employed in South Australia, examines all the fruit that is exported, the object being to keep up its reputation. To show the advantage of this inspection, I may refer to the reasons which led to the inspection of fruit. In Western Australia the growers of fruit are naturally very jealous of the fruit which is imported from the Eastern States, and they kept the local inspectors up to the mark, with the result that very large quantities of fruit were condemned, and the South Australian fruit-growers believed that they were condemned without sufficient reason, that the local prejudice on the part of the West Australian inspectors, and not the inferior quality of the fruit, was the cause of the condemnation. The South Australian Government determined that so far as it could be prevented no fruit that was not wholesome and free from the codlin moth and other pests should be exported from the State. The system of inspection before export was then inaugurated, and the reputation of South Australian fruit has consequently been kept up ; and the action taken has been the means of very much improving our trade relations. The Export Department of South Australia also took up the meat industry. We hear a great deal about socialistic interference with private enterprise ; but in this case there was no such interference, because, singularly enough, clever and alive to new opportunities of trade as commercial, men are, no one in South Australia ventured to take up the meat industry. If was left to the Government to establish that industry. They have established their own freezing works, and they do the whole of the killing, freezing, and transport to the markets of the old country. </para>

                            <para>- I had forgotten to mention the fact to which the honorable member refers. No advantage was taken of the offer, and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Cockburn,</inline> who was then Minister for Agriculture, began the killing, freezing, and transport of meat to London. From that has grown up a business in the export of lambs to London which is worth some scores of thousands of pounds to South Australia every year. I think that in the last year, the State exported 250,000 frozen lambs. In this connexion the Export Department carries on the whole of the business of export for the producer. The producer, whether he be a pastoralist or a small sheep farmer, sends word to the Agricultural Department that he proposes to send a certain number of lambs on a certain date. The Government officers receive them at the railway station, they are put into yards, killed at a convenient time, frozen, and shipped away, and the producer later on gets his account sales. </para>

                            <para>- As the honorable member for Grey reminds me, we have in South Australia, in connexion with the export department, a system of advances on consignments by producers. The advance, of course, bears a certain proportion to the market value of the consignment. The system adopted enables a man, even if he has only half a dozen lambs, to readily secure for them the full value which can be obtained in the London market, which is the best market in the world. He does not require to go to any shipping firm, or to be under the thumb of any combine, as the Government do all the business of export for him. He has only to send in a notice of the number of lambs he is sending down to the Department, and he subsequently gets his account sales. Some small commission is charged, and there is a charge for freezing, but the charges in connexion with the exportation of frozen meat in South Australia are less than are those in any other part of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- Rabbits and poultry are treated in the same way. Occasionally a new industry may be established in this way. I remember that an application was received from leaf -cutters on Kangaroo Island, who produced crude eucalyptus oil. They were under the impression -that the local firms of oil- distillers did not give, them a fair price for their crude oil, and they applied to the Export Department to put their production on the London market. They asked&#39; for an advance, and got a smaller advance than they asked for. Their oil was sent by the Export Department to London, and its value ascertained. The returns to the leaf. -cutters on Kangaroo Island were such that, they concluded, that they were receiving a fair price from the local distillers, and that it was not worth their while to endeavour to send the crude oil direct to the old country. Honey is exported from South Australia almost entirely through the Export Department. All manner of articles for which, in ordinary circumstances, it would be difficult to establish a market, can be. tested through the Export Department, which has proved to be a very great boon indeed to South Australia. Of course wheat, wool, and such staple products are not .exported through the Department, as the conditions in connexion with their export are privately organized. In the case of wool, the wool buyers of the world buy in Adelaide, and there would be no particular advantage in making use of the Department. In the case of wheat there has, until recently, been sufficient competition to insure to the growers a good return for their wheat. Of course honorable members will see that if the wheat industry got into the hands of a combine, it would be of the very greatest advantage to South Australian wheatgrowers to have the Government Export Department to fall back upon. It has been suggested, during the debate, that meat is an export which cannot be satisfactorily inspected and graded by Government officials ; but, as a matter- of fact, such work is done in South&#39; Australia to the satisfaction of the whole industry. </para>

                            <para>- The inspection of frozen meat can take place only where there are freezing chambers at the ports of shipment, but the distances which the beasts have to travel before being killed need not be taken into consideration. In South Australia, lambs are graded by Government, officials, and carcasses which do not come, up to a certain, standard of weight and quality, although, rejected, are kept in the depot for some days, to allow the owner to say what shall be done with them. If he does not make any intimation on the subject, these carcasses are sold at auction at Port Adelaide as &#34; rejects.&#34; The effect of this Government inspection has been that South Australian lambs have obtained the highest price given for Australian lambs in the London market. South Australian butter, too, has obtained the highest price given, there for Australian butter, owing to the fact that it is graded before exportation, the Government brand not being placed on butter of inferior quality, which is classed as pastry butter. Then, although our apple export is not so large as that of Tasmania, the prices obtained for South Australian apples, owing to the care and supervision exercised by the Government inspectors in regard to all that are sent away, have been the highest obtained for any Australian apples. During the South African war, some South Australian merchants obtained contracts from the Imperial Government for the supply of preserved meat, and in those contracts were stipulations similar to those which, the Government propose to provide for under the Bill. It was required that the meat should be put up Sn tins of a certain size, and should be of first-class quality, to be certified to by the Government inspector. It was found that the 2 -lb. and 4-lb. tins of meat supplied did not contain full weight, and the deficiency was made up by sending away extra tins. I do not say, for a moment, that had there been no inspection the contractor would have sent short weight, but I say, without fear of contradiction, that the inspection rendered absolutely impossible_ in regard to this contract, what occurred in connexion with other contracts. The same thing took place in connexion with a supply of jam. Contracts were allotted to. a number of jam-makers in the State, and the Government inspector visited the different factories to inspect the jam when made. This inspection was absolutely satisfactory, and helped to keep up the reputation of our goods. Then, in regard to hay, the British authorities having had no experience of wheaten hay, were at first pre&#39;judiced against it, and preferred oaten hay ; but they were satisfied that under our sys-tern of inspection only hay of good quality would be sent to them, and only good hay was sent, so that the orders our producers received were very satisfactory. To my mind, nothing will be gained by referring the Bill to a Select Committee. The proper carrying out of its provisions, and the effective supervision of our exports and imports, will depend entirely on the administration of the Department, and that cannot be improved by ascertaining the opinions of commercial men, producers, and others in regard to this, that, or the other provision of the Bill&#39;. The success of .the measure will depend upon the selection of the right men to act as experts and supervisors, .and its application to the right class of goods. It is only by experience that we shall know to what goods to apply the provisions of the Bill. There may be goods which to-day it would be unnecessary to inspect, but which a few months or a year or&#39; so hence it might be advisable to bring under the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. Everything will depend upon the selection of the right men. To curtail the powers of the Minister may do harm; because it may prevent him from bringing under the Bill goods which ought to be subject to inspection. The matter, however, is one with which the House is perfectly competent to deal without an inquiry by a Select Committee. The honorable and learned member for Angas stated, I think, that the Bill is unconstitutional. That argument does not appeal to me perhaps as much as it should,- because the opinions of eminent lawyers differ so much on constitutional points. Of course, I do not think that we should attempt to pass legislation which it is clearly not within our powers to pass, but the States Parliaments and Governments will take all sorts of care that we do not infringe their rights, so that we need not be greatly concerned about a matter which can be decided only by the High Court. -The argument that the Bill is another instance of the socialistic fad for bringing all industries under Government officialdom is of all arguments the most absurd.- </para>

I do not think any attempt should be made to classify the legislation brought before this House into socialistic or anti- socialistic measures. </para>

I hope that &#39; no honorable member will be influenced by any such reason as that. If the proposal be a good one, surely we can adopt it without reference to the question whether or &#39;not it emanates from those who belong to a particular school of economic thought. I &#39; hope this Bill will be fully considered in Committee, and that it will not be relegated to a Select Committee. No possible advantage could attend1 the adoption of the latter course, but, on the other hand, the consideration of the matter would be delayed until next session. </para>

                            <para>- That point may be argued in Committee. I believe that this Bill will confer substantial benefits upon our producers, and that any legislation which will have that effect should be brought into operation as early as possible. If the reputation of our produce were to suffer, our exportations would be seriously reduced, and our population would not expand at the rate at which we desire to see it increase. Therefore, as population is our greatest need, we ought to do everything we can to promote the growth of our industries and the expansion of our export trade. </para>

                            <para>- Then practically New South Wales is the only State which has not passed legislation dealing with the classification of exports. I am not aware that any great demand has been made for this measure. I believe that, as a matter of fact, it has emanated from the departmental officers, who are always anxious to increase their powers. In New South Wales the Government officials have been endeavouring for years past to secure an enactment for the regulation of the dairying industry, but they have always failed, because the producers are strongly opposed to any such legislation. </para>

                            <para>- The producers object, and rightly so, to being placed at the mercy of any Government official. Every State has its own methods of promoting the producing industries. Victoria has given a great impetus to the butter industry by granting bonuses, but unfortunately the Government grant has not gone into the pockets of those whom it was intended to benefit, but into the hands of unscrupulous traders.&#39;The evidence given before the Butter Commission showed that the greatest corruption existed in connexion with the export trade. I have read the report of that Commission, which should be perused by every producer in Australia. The Commission have done splendid work in exposing the nefarious practices which have been resorted to by traders, but I do not see any reason why the disclosures that have been made in Victoria should serve as a pretext for saddling the producers of all the States with legislation such as that now before us. I believe that the evils which have arisen in Victoria in the past will be to a large extent corrected by the establishment of cooperative dairying companies, such as exist in New South Wales. </para>

The producers of New South Wales have been self-reliant to the utmost degree, and have established the butter industry upon a sound footing, without any Government interference or support. They have always been prepared to meet the producers of other countries in the open markets of the world, and they deserve every credit for the success which they have achieved. There is no reason whatever why they should now have their produce subjected to Government inspection. </para>

The proprietors of the <inline font-style="italic">Leader</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Australasian</inline> sent representatives to inspect the New South Wales butter factories before any institution of the kind was in existence in Victoria. The use of a Government brand in connexion with butter intended for export will not add one far thing to the value of the article: Those who are advocating the adoption of . a Government brand do not understand the subject. The butter will not be improved in quality, or enhanced in value. It is the brand of the factory which has its value in the market. In Victoria I have purchased large quantities of butter, and have been principally concerned with the brand on the article. </para>

                            <para>- I was not aware of that, but I know that some of the buyers for the London market who gave evidence before the Butter Commission in New South Wales stated that they did1 not require any Government brand. The producers of New South Wales are as anxious as any one to obtain high prices, and if they considered that any advantage would be conferred upon them by the adoption of a Government brand they would be only too glad to agree, to it. They have for the last twenty years been engaged in conducting large co-operative enterprises, and have handled and marketed their own produced instead of sending it to proprietary firms, such as those who have been operating in &#39;Victoria, and whose main object has been to make as much profit as they could out of the producer. At a conference of producers recently held in Sydney, at which fully three-fourths of those engaged in the butter industry were represented, a resolution was passed by a large majority in opposition to any Government grading, or other interference with the industry. </para>

                            <para>- No, the price is fixed by a board, independently of the brand. Even supposing that the Government brand in Denmark has the effect of adding to the value of the butter, it does not follow that the adoption of a similar practice in the Commonwealth would have equally beneficial results. I would remind honorable members that at the Earl&#39;s Court Exhibition a few years ago a New South Wales factory carried off the blue ribbon for the best exhibit of butter against competitors from all parts of the British Empire, including Victoria and New Zealand. That was a signal victory for private enterprise over Government graders and inspectors. </para>

                            <para>- No doubt, but my contention is that the Government brand does not give the butter any higher value. I do not consider that the proposed system of grading is practicable. The proposed methods could not. very well be applied to fruit, and so far as butter is concerned, it is proposed to start at the wrong end. It is intended that the produce shall be inspected, and graded when it arrives at the port for export, but I hold that the proper place to begin is the factory. The New South Wales producers believe in the cream being graded in the first instance, and I think that all that is &#39;required&#39; is a strict Dairy Supervision Act. The provisions for insuring cleanliness in the dairy cannot be too stringent, but no attempt should be made to interfere with the exportation of produce. It would be quite possible, as has been recommended by the Butter Commission, to insist upon &#39;the factories registering their brands,, and to require them to ship only under such brands. </para>

                            <para>- No doubt their registration would largely put down cattle stealing, and the registration of butter brands would be of great benefit to the producers, as it would deter persons from using the butter boxes of others. I am certainly an advocate of the grading system, but object to the work being carried out by Government officials as it would involve the appointment of a whole army of experts. Had this Bill been demanded by the producers I should have supported it ; but as a matter of fact we do not find even one of our producers speaking in favour of it. I am satisfied that when the people become more familiar with the provisions of the Bill, petition after petition against its passing will be presented. </para>

                            <para>- I would not. The cooperative factories are combining to carry out the work of grading for themselves. When the producers recognise that they themselves are the proper persons to deal with this work, and send their produce to one central floor, they will be able to control the whole industry without Government interference of any kind. The co-operative companies propose to appoint their own graders. </para>

                            <para>- I think not. We are told that New Zealand butter secures the best price in the markets of the world. I may say that I have purchased large quantities of butter produced in that colony, and that my experience is that while one can get New Zealand butter graded as &#34; No. 1,&#34; which is in every way suited . to the palates of one&#39;s Sydney customers, it is possible to get butter branded &#34; first grade &#34; which is not at all suited to their taste. I have known butter that would not sell on the Sydney market, and would be regarded as of second-rate quality, to be in great demand for export to South Africa. </para>

                            <para>- I may tell the honorable member that in the early history of the butter industry in Australia - when Victoria was making rapid strides, and opening up trade with various countries in respect of this article of food - I happened to be interested in a large co-operative butter factory in Newcastle, and had the pleasure of sending the first shipment of tinned butter to the East. We spent a great deal of money, not only in developing this trade with the East, but in sending shipments to&#62; Malta and Gibraltar, and this branch of our business went on swimmingly until a Victorian firm suddenly undercut us. We were greatly surprised at this, and failed&#39; to understand how they could undersell us, until we learned that they were selling 14 ozs. as 16 ozs. In that case we were the heavy weights, and the Victorians were the light weights. </para>

                            <para>- In my opinion all reasonable care should be exercised in connexion with the butter industry. The several States have gone to great expense to secure the placing of their produce on the markets of the world in as good a condition as possible. No stone has been left unturned to achieve success. Our produce has withstood all criticism, and we have been able to compete with the products of the world in the open market of London. In these circumstances I do not think that Government interference at the port of export wi&#39;.T be attended with the good results that are anticipated. I fail to understand why the Government should have any special reason for supervising the export of butter or other produce whilst they pay no attention whatever to produce intended for local consumption. </para>

If we are to take action in this direction, let us start at the very basis of the industry, and&#39; see that our producers are working on right lines. But there has been no great demand&#39; for this Bill, and as the several States have their own graders, and the people of New South Wales are very much opposed to the measure, I must certainly vote against it. Let us educate our producers on the lines; I have indicated. The Postmaster General and the Vice-President of the Executive Council represent large farming constituencies, and I should like to knowhow their constituents view this proposal. I trust that the Bill will be referred to a Select Committee, so that we may have an opportunity of&#34; hearing the other side of the question. So far all the criticism that has been levelled&#34; against the Bill has come from the representatives of New South Wales. The reason for this is that the producers of that </para>

                            <para>- Quite so; but in the State I represent private enterprise will come to the front every time, and will teach the other States what is necessary in this direction. I do not know that the products of South Australia are selling at higher prices in the London market than are those of New South Wales. I certainly think that the producers should be consulted in regard to this proposal, and it is for this reason, that I trust that the suggestion made by the honorable member for Parramatta that the Bill be referred to a Select Committee, will be accepted. I do not know that there is any pressing need for the Bill. Legislation on somewhat similar lines has been passed by all the States, with the exception of New South Wales, and I think she can manage to scrape along for the next few months without any interference in this direction on the part of the Commonwealth Government. </para>

A civilized community living in large masses must have social laws, and must allow the central authority - whatever it may be - to exercise a lesser or greater control over the management of those affairs which, in the interests of the community itself, can be best controlled by that authority. </para>

                            <para>- I come now to the point at which we commence to differ. The question, &#34; What is Socialism?&#34; has frequently been put in this House and elsewhere, but fortunately the party to which the honorable member for Boothby belongs, has rendered it quite unnecessary for those who are opposed to their policy to give a definition of the word. The Labour Party have defined the Socialism for which they are striving, as the possession by the State of all the means of production, distribution, and exchange. </para>

We can all regard a measure such as this from the stand-point merely of its effect and its expediency. Whether we approve of this measure or not, it must be admitted that it is very far reaching and important. It goes beyond anything of the kind attempted in any of the States of Australia or in New Zealand. It proposes to deal not merely with certain articles ; we are, under this Bill, asked to give full power to the Minister to put his grip upon every article of trade and production, import and export, throughout every State of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I shall very soon show, to the satisfaction of the House, that it does go further. I am sure every honorable member will be delighted if we can remove dishonesty from trade, and compel honesty in commercial transactions. We desire to remove every possibility of false descriptions, and the deception and injury which may be the result of false descriptions. But this Bill does something more; It not only provides that there shall be true descriptions of imports and exports - which is quite right - but it attempts to raise the standard of production. That is a very good thing also, if it can be successfully done by the State. I shall show afterwards that this is really three measures rolled into one. The objects of the Bill, to which I have just referred, are good objects, but we shall have to take great care that in giving the enormous power which is here asked for into the hands of a Government, or of a single Minister, we shall not be injuring the trade of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- No, there is not, or the Government would not want this Bill. Further, I remind honorable members that we have seen how powers given under the Customs Act may be used in some cases. We have seen that the powers given for one purpose may be applied to quite another; we have seen that an action intended to prevent disturbance of the labour market in Australia by the introduction of labourers, say, during a strike, may be used to exclude six harmless hatters. </para>

I refer to that matter only as an instance of powers given to a Minister, and used in a way which was never intended by Parliament. If it had been stated at the time Parliament agreed to give those powers to the- Minister administering the Act that they would be used in the way I have described, the majority of the members of this House would not have agreed to intrust the Minister with such power. </para>

                            <para>- I take <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for the statement I make. On several occasions, when the strength of the provisions of this measure were questioned, the honorable gentleman referred honorable members to the other Bill. I say that course was unusual. I also deny that there was any Bill dealing with this matter accepted by the late Government. The late Government did have a measure prepared, but the Bill drafted was never dealt with by them before they left office. I had seen a copy of it, and prepared some criticisms upon it, which I will give honorable members the benefit of to-night. As a matter of fact, the drastic provisions dealing, at any rate, with imports, came from a Bill which was drafted by a Ministry, of which the present Prime Minister was a member, if npt the head. That Government drafted a Merchandise Marks Bill, containing,, as regards imports, the, most drastic provisions to be found in the present Bill. The Watson Government rechristened that production. I do not know whether they did not desire to carry it on under the name conferred upon it by the previous Government, but after making certain amendments in the Bill, they called it the Fraudulent Trade Marks Bill. When the late Government took office, they found two measures before Parliament, the Trade Marks Bill and the Fraudulent Trade Marks Bill, and they found that certain provisions of the latter Bill dealt with matters which should properly be dealt with in a Trade Marks Bill. They found that the draftsman of the Fraudulent Trade Marks Bill had borrowed from the English Merchandise Marks Act a number of provisions al together inapplicable to our circumstances, and other provisions included in the English  Act, apparently in order to dovetail into existing British legislation, which could not be dovetailed into our different legislation. </para>

                            <para>- I am not going to debate them now. I say that the British Merchandise Marks Act dealt with matters which the present Government have not found it necessary to include in this Commerce Bill. Then it was determined that there should be a separation entirely of the overlapping provisions of the two Bills, and the resulting Bill never came before the Reid-McLean Cabinet for consideration. The draft that remains in the Department is not a Government Bill, but a draft of a Bill prepared for the Government, and not dealt with in Cabinet at the time the Reid-McLean Government left office. </para>

                            <para>- I do not object to it. If the Minister of Trade and Customs does his duty, every person in the community will be able to judge by the descriptions attached to goods what their nature is. The Bill is also a Merchandise Marks Bill. It provides that the Minister may cause to be imposed on articles of export a certain mark or brand, showing source of origin and other particulars, and may exclude from the Commonwealth goods branded or marked in what he considers an objectionable manner. Lastly, the Bill is a Grading Bill, since it gives the Minister power to compel exporters to have graded such goods as he thinks should be graded. </para>

                            <para>- Of course it gives power for Government grading in connexion with exports. These provisions seem very simple until they are looked into. If honorable members pay attention to the provision in regard to country of origin they will see that it is possible to embody in regulation the strong provisions of the Fraudulent Trade Marks Bill that goods imported here from England, and bearing on them the name of London or Liverpool as the place of origin, may be refused admission if there is not in addition the name of the country in which those cities are situated, supposing that there should happen to be a town of the same name within the Commonwealth. Of course I know that this provision has been borrowed from the English Act, but the circumstances of England are quite different from those of the Commonwealth. England is one of the great countries of the world, and when London, Sheffield, Birmingham, and Liverpool are mentioned anywhere throughout the world it is understood that the English towns of those names are referred to, unless the contrary is indicated. There was a special reason for the provision in the English Act, inasmuch as foreign manufacturers, in the endeavour to pass off on the English public as goods manufactured in England goods which had really been made abroad, marked them with the names of large English cities. Sometimes the goods had been made in or near small villages abroad, bearing the names of large English cities, or there were towns of the same name in the countries from which the goods were exported, and the description as. to origin was therefore not altogether false, unless the goods had not been made in such towns, though it was absolutely misleading. But it would be absurd to require under our legislation, because there is a Liverpool in New South Wales, and perhaps a London in one of the other States, that goods of a house like that of Crosse and Blackwell, London, which have been known for a century, should be branded &#34;England&#34; in addition to the name of the city of manufacture. The Bill does not say that goods shall be so branded, but it gives the Minister power to say so, and that was the intention of the Fraudulent Trade Marks Bill. In this measure far too much is left to regulations. We ought to know a great deal more of the intentions of the Ministry in regard to the measure, and of the real scope of the provisions of the Bill ; and before we allow it to become law, we should provide that these extreme and dangerous powers shall not be exercised by regulation. Then the trade description may&#39; be required to furnish particulars - </para>

The trade descriptions which I have quoted are those which, according to clause <inline font-style="italic">i}</inline> the Minister may require importers to supply. Particulars may be required not only as to the manufacturer or producer, but as to any or all of the matters to which I have referred before the goods are admitted to Australia. &#39; Now, as regards exports, the trade description has to be supplied, if the Minister so wills it, and as far as he so wills it. The goods cannot be exported unless that condition is complied with. Secondly, under this provision he may enforce grading. I think that the Vice-President of the Executive Council will now see that it is possible to&#62; make this a grading Bill, and to&#39; enforce the grading of any article the Minister may select. </para>

                            <para>- According to the statement of the Minister of Trade and Customs, I take it that the powers of grading proposed to be conferred by the Bill could be applied to .wool or grain - to anything and everything. That is a very extraordinary power to give, and I do not know whether those honorable members who represent m&#39;ore fully than I do the leading industries of Australia are prepared to clothe the Minister with such powers without some limitation. In New Zealand they have an Act that applies to butter and cheese only. Here power is being asked to grade all classes of produce, and to insist upon certain descriptions as to quality being attached to every export of goods. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, that is one of the articles included in the list, and I am not sure that there is not good reason for it. But it is proposed to go far beyond that. We are to grant this power in the faint hope that every man who occupies the position of Minister of Trade and Customs will be reasonable and wise, whereas our previous experience shows us that we should be very careful to restrict the powers of Ministers. I never knew Acts of this kind of universal application to be passed, giving indiscriminate power to a Minister over the whole trade and industry of the community. </para>

All I can say is that the late Cabinet never approved of any Bill, and that no Ministry can be held responsible for a measure until it is introduced by it into Parliament. I presume that it is intended to grade exports under this Bill. Perhaps the Attorney-General would inform us whether that is the intention, because I think that it is due to us that we should be told. </para>

                            <para>-That is not the question. The grading does not prevent people from exporting. Under a system of grading, it will be competent for persons to export what they please. In Victoria, for instance, butter may be exported with the word &#34; pastry &#34; placed upon the box by way of description. That does not stop the exportation of the article. Surely the Ministry have some intentions. Some of the States have been grading, and some have not ; and I ask whether it is intended that all our exports, or certain of them, such as the Minister may decide, shall be graded by the Commonwealth? That is a matter upon which we should have information before we proceed to discuss the Bill. Why should I be kept here discussing that aspect of the question if it is not the intention of the Government to adopt this system of grading? It is only right that I should know the intentions of the Government in this regard, and I ask the Attorney-General to say now whether it is intended to grade throughout Australia butter, cheese, and other articles which are now graded in some of the States. There is no answer from the Minister. That is the way that Parliament is treated when the Government have a majority sufficient to carry a measure. I contend that Parliament has a right to know the intentions of the Ministry in connexion with this measure. </para>

Now I hope that I have made my meaning clear. Will the Minister explain? </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Boothby spoke in support of the Bill, on the ground that it provided for the grading of produce intended for export. We should know at the outset the intention of the Government. From my reading of the speech of the Minister of Trade and Customs, I thought that it was intended to grade produce for export. That impression of mine was questioned by another Minister who said that the Bill did not bear the meaning which I applied to it. , Now we have another Minister who will not say what it means. This is the most extraordinary position of affairs. This seems to be the Bill, not of the Cabinet, but of one Minister, who is absent. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot obtain an answer, even from an honorable member who says that he knows. I never saw such a condition of affairs in any Parliament. I never knew of a House being asked to indorse a measure of this kind without an explanation as to the intention of the Ministry in regard to such an important matter. If we are to be treated in this way, the Commonwealth Parliament will be the most subservient that ever sat. As I cannot get an answer now, I hope that the Attorney-General, who is at present in charge of the Bill, will avail himself of an opportunity to consult the Cabinet before he replies to my inquiries, and that he will inform us whether it is intended that Commonwealth officers shall grade the exports to which the measure is to apply. We have a right to this information - it should have been given to us before - and I hope that it will be supplied before the motion for the second reading of the Bill is carried. I notice that one very important department of trade is not covered by this Bill. It is not to apply in any way to Inter-State trade. Truthful descriptions are to be given, and purity is to be insured in the case of goods imported or exported, but goods bearing all sorts of false description and containing all sorts of injurious ingredients may. seemingly pass to and fro as between the States without check or hindrance. </para>

                            <para>- I am not saying whether it is or not, but I feel satisfied that the Adulteration Acts of the several States would not be in operation if such laws were unnecessary. I should like to know whether the omission to extend the provisions of this Bill to Inter-State trade is intentional or accidental, and, if it is intentional, . the. reasons for it. If such a measure as this is to be passed, there is very important work in connexion with the InterState trade which may be carried out through its agency. . At present, in some of the States, advantage is being taken of certain local laws relating to health and agriculture to practically exclude the products of other States. That is a matter that would be within our control in passing such a measure as this. It is highly desirable that whatever is properly admitted into one State and prohibited in another should be admitted or prohibited, as the case may be, throughout the Commonwealth. In other words, there should be uniformity in this regard. This system of admitting in certain States and excluding in others may be due really to a desire on the part of the State authorities who exclude to free their producers from the competition of others beyond their borders ; but this is a case in which the Commonwealth should step in and endeavour to establish just relations between the States. The Bill ostentatiously omits all reference to Inter-State trade. I do not know why the people should be permitted to do what they like, so far as trade between State and State is concerned, while at the same time we impose severe restrictions upon their trade as between Australia and any other country. There may be some reason for the position taken up by the Government, but it has not been mentioned by the Minister in charge of the Bill. I would ask him also to furnish an answer to this&#39; question, when replying at the close of the debate. .As the Government propose to exercise the strong powers to be conferred upon them by the Bill over one class of trade, why do they not seek to avail themselves of our constitutional powers over another class ? To my mind, if grading is to be adopted by the Commonwealth, it should, at the outset, at all events, be made optional. If, as has been stated during the debate,&#39; the result of Government grading has been to secure enhanced prices for goods treated in that way, how foolish any one producing a good article for export would be in refusing to have his produce graded. First of all, we desire to know, however, whether there is to be any grading. The Minister will not tell us. The exports to which this Bill is to be applied should be stated in a schedule to the measure itself. I see some difficulty in the way of dealing with imports in like manner ; but if there is to be grading - and here again I may be beating the wind, because it may not be the intention of the Government to provide for anything of the kind - the Parliament . should keep in its own hands the power to determine what goods shall be dealt with in that way. If the Ministry wished at any time to add to the list, the &#39;addition should be made only by resolution of both Houses of the Parliament. That would be only a very reasonable and proper safeguard. If an illustration of the necessity for this proposal be required, I can supply it, by referring to the two lists of imports and exports which the Minister placed before the House in moving that the Bill be read a second time. In the course, of his speech he said - </para>

                    <para class="block">I ask honorable members to note the difference between this statement and that which, the Attorney-General has made. The importance of this measure does not seem to have been grasped by the Ministry. They have brought it before Parliament, evidently, without being at one as to its meaning, and without- giving that full explanation, which, in a second-reading speech, covering such an important measure as this, could not be compressed into the two or three pages of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> that are occupied by the report of the speech of the Minister. The Minister of Trade and Customs spoke, as quoted, of provisions in the Bill that were intended to prevent the exportation of certain articles, and yet we have been told by the Attorney-General that it is not intended to prevent the export of anything. I think the House will bear me out when I say that that was the statement he made. According to the Minister of Trade&#34; and Customs, biscuits and confectionery are among the articles likely to be affected by the Bill. Why they should have been selected out of the thousand and one articles of manufacture which we export, I do not know. </para>

                            <para>- But the Bill is to apply to biscuits sent out of the country. The reason suggested by the honorable member may be right, but we have had no explanation on the subject from the Minister. Another item mentioned in the list is fruits. The words used in the Tariff, &#34;Fruits, raisins, bottled,&#34; are- employed. Those are the only kinds of fruit with which the Bill is intended to deal according to this list, but a doubt as to the accuracy of that list is raised by the further statement made by the Minister that - </para>

                    <para class="block">In this, as to preventing exportation, we have another contradiction of the statement made by the Attorney-General, and it would appear that it is the intention of the Government that the Bill shall deal with fresh fruit, although in the llist of goods which the Minister read, only &#34;fruit, raisins/, bottled,&#34; is mentioned. We find apparel, boots,&#34; and shoes, and furniture, in the list of exports to which the Bill is to apply. I fail to understand why these goods should be specially selected. Some furniture, for instance, is largely constructed of iron. We have all sorts of other iron manufactures, and it may reasonably be asked, Why is the Bill to apply to one class and not to others? Then, again, certain other furniture is constructed almost entirely of wood. There are various Australian industries in which wood is largely employed, and why should those industries be omitted? Meats, preserved an&#39;d concentrated, are also to be dealt with under this measure, but I see no provision for rabbits, or for meat in carcase. No reference is made to meat of this description in the 1 ist read by the Minister. In the list of imports, to which this measure is to apply, both preserved and concentrated milk appear. We produce preserved milk in Australia, and I should like to know why only concentrated milk is mentioned in the export list quoted by the Minister? It seems to me that all these facts show that the Bill has received no consideration, and that it would be dangerous to allow it to pass from, our brands in the absence of any clear indication on the part of the Government as to what is intended. Coming to the list of imports quoted by the Minister of Trade and Customs, we find that it comprises woollen goods, but that those articles are not included in the list of exports. Salt is also included in the list of imports, but is excluded from the&#39; exports. </para>

                            <para>- But why is that article selected in this way from a whole host of others ? There are many other articles mentioned in the list to whose inclusion I might take equal objection. I am sure, however, that I have satisfied honorable members, whether they be for or against the measure, that Ministers have not considered it properly. The very statements prepared for the information of the House, such as these lists of exports and imports, to which it is proposed the Bill shall apply, shows that there has been no fixed principle behind the Government proposition. They have submitted it without having made up their minds as to the basis on which they are going to deal with these goods. Yet we are asked to put these stupendous powers into their hands without any reservation or safeguard. I think we ought to protect the exports of the Commonwealth, and the large industries which depend on them, from serious danger, and that, so far as grading is concerned, if that is intended the goods to be &#39;dealt with should be stated in the measure, and no addition to them should be made, except by resolution pf both Houses of Parliament. I go further, and support the proposal made by the deputy leader of the Opposition, to refer this Bill to a Committee. Honorable members may think that this is for the purpose of obstruction, but it is no such thing. </para>

                            <para>- It would not be <inline font-style="italic">exparte</inline> at all. This is a measure which does not affect trade alone. It must affect, for good or for ill, the whole of the industries of Australia. Surely those conducting those industries, in the first place for their own benefit, and, secondly, for the benefit of Australia, and who are in a position to say whether this industry should be dealt with and that should not, whether this produce should be graded, and the other should not, are entitled to a hearing before action is taken, and not afterwards, when it will be too late? I do not know of any other Parliament that would refuse to give them that opportunity. In the New South Wales Parliament, Bills dealing with matters of this sort must, under the Standing Orders, be referred to a Committee. In the British Parliament there are Law Committees. Trade Committees, and other standing Committees to which Bills dealing with certain Questions must go before they are dealt with by Parliament. </para>

Honorable members must admit that this measure proposes to put the grip of the Minister of Trade and Customs on every export and. import, and that means that all the industries of the country which depend on imports, or which are benefited by the development of exports, will be affected by the passing of the Bill. It is not too much to ask, in the circumstances, that those engaged in our industries should have an opportunity to put before Parliament, through a Committee, what they think would be the effect of such a measure, what they have to suggest to improve its provisions, and, if there is to be a grading provision, in what way its application would result in advantage or injury to the industries affected. For instance, suppose the Minister proposed to grade wool or wheat, do honorable members think that any advantage would follow from that? Might it not involve serious drawbacks ? </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Moira must remember that the Commonwealth Government could not deal with exports of wheat in the same way, as they would only begin to touch the goods when they came to be exported, and grading them for standard purposes then would be absolutely useless. The practice in standardizing has been to have specimens of the crop collected all over the State at an early stage, and on these to fix the export weight per bushel, so that there may be a fair deal between the exporter and the buyer abroad. The Commonwealth Government could not do anything of, that -kind, because they can only begin to deal with the matter when the goods reach the wharf for shipment, and a quantity of wheat at any one time on the wharfs would not represent an average of the crop of the whole of the State. I quite recognise the importance of this subject to the honorable member for Moira, and his constituents, and I trust the honorable member will be able to get from the Minister more information concerning what is intended by the Bill than I have been able to get. From lack of that information, I am. at a great disadvantage in dealing with the question. I have concluded, from the remarks of the Minister of Trade and Customs, that grading is intended, although I do not know that the honorable gentleman has absolutely said so in so many words. I have concluded that, also, from the powers asked for in the Bill, but I do not know now whether -it is intended or not. It is highly desirable when we propose to legislate on such matters that we should get the fullest light on the subject to be dealt with. I am unable to see how a committee, inquiring into this measure, and its possible effects upon exports and the industries of Australia, which they represent, could do any harm. I am certain that the investigations of such a committee must do good. They might alter the opinion of honorable members on some points at any rate, and would tend to the benefit of Australia. </para>

I regret that we have not heard something more practical from the honorable member for North Sydney than we have heard. In the first place/ 1 should like to say that I do not pretend to the knowledge of these matters, possessed by that honorable gentleman and by my honorable colleague, the Minister of Trade and Customs. I should much have preferred that the Minister of Trade and Customs should have been here to-night, in order, however informally, to give information to the honorable member for North Sydney in answer to his inquiries. I should like to say that it is of importance to know the source of this Bill and its history. It is of importance to know that, although honorable members opposite call it a drastic Bill, it is very much less drastic than any measure of the kind that has been before this Parliament. It interferes, or purports to interfere, with trade in a much less degree than did the measure which came from another place, or the measure which we found on the stocks prepared by some member of the preceding Government. </para>

I refer to their Bill, not by way of example, but by way of warning. We have departed from it in the direction of protecting, without unduly harassing merchants, the very people whom he and his friends are always holding up as needing protection - the consumers of Australia. Now, the honorable member has not a word to say about the consumers of the goods imported here. It is we who are going to defend them. </para>

Does he not know that still more enormous powers have been conferred upon Ministers by Acts already on the statute-book? By the Customs Act of 1901, section 52, paragraph <inline font-style="italic">g,</inline> it is provided, after the mention of a great many things as prohibited imports, that - all goods the importation of which may be prohibited by proclamation - shall be prohibited imports. There is absolutely no restraint there on the power of the Minister. </para>

                            <para>- We do not require power to prohibit the importation of goods, or to prohibit their exportation, whatever the goods may be. The Customs Act, as I have shown, allows us to prohibit the importation of goods, not only absolutely, but also in some cases subject to conditions and restrictions ; but while we can prohibit the exportation of goods absolutely, we have no power to prohibit exportation subject to conditions and restrictions. Therefore we require power to control exportation without absolutely prohibiting it, and in asking for that power we have made the Bill regular and systematic by dealing also with imports, to prevent any objection being urged against the measure on the ground that it did not deal with both imports and exports. So, in the first part of the Bill, the provisions in regard to false trade descriptions relate to the application to goods of descriptions which are misleading. Of course, no honorable member, no matter where he sits, would tolerate the application of false descriptions to goods. With regard to imports, we do not say for a moment that we are taking power in the Bill to prevent importation. </para>

Neither are we asking Parliament to re-confer the power of absolutely prohibiting importation, or of dictating to any person what goods shall or shall not be imported. Further, we are not taking the power to create qualities, grades, sizes, weights, or ingredients. </para>

We constantly read cablegrams containing comments made at home as to the quality of our products. We read that they are getting into disrepute because of adulteration, or because they are of improper quality. We want to prevent that.

                            <para>- I think so. At the same time it is not to be supposed that the trade of Australia would be killed even within a few months by any regulation. I think it is rather far-fetched to imagine for a moment that any measure would be introduced by a Minister that would have the effect of injuring our trade. It is to be supposed that every Minister of Trade and Customs would be actuated by a desire to benefit the country. This proposal is not being put forward by the members in the Labour corner, but is being submitted in the interests of the producers and of the general body of consumers. </para>

                            <para>- That proposal is not made for the purpose of relieving this Parliament of its proper function. It is not proposed to refer all Bills from this Parliament to that committee. If we had such a. committee it would be able to furnish us with information from time to time upon matters relating to the general welfare of the Commonwealth. The Bill before us has in some shape or form been under discussion for many months. It has been under the consideration of every Government that has sat on these benches, and has been thoroughly well thrashed out in the other Chamber, where there was, so far as I am aware, no talk of referring it to a Select Committee. It has been sent down to this House, and has been remodelled by two Governments, and I do not think there is any excuse for referring it to a Select Committee. We are not at all averse to receiving - in fact we invitee suggestions from any Chamber of Commerce or any member of such a chamber, or any individual, and we promise to consider any representations that may be made to us. We are not rushing this measure. We are giving it proper consideration, and we are averse to referring it to a Select Committee because we think that if that course were adopted we should never get any work done. If anything was to be done in that direction why did not the previous Government appoint a Commission and have the measure inquired into during the recess? </para>

I think there is ample justification for this Bill, because it will protect the public, and will also have the effect of increasing the reputation of our Australian products. It is necessary that some measure of this kind should be passed in order to protect the interests of our producers in the wine and in other trades. </para>

                            <para>- I notice that honorable members on either side of the House seem to regard themselves as obliged by some sense of duty to make constant interjections when an honorable member is expressing opinions opposite to their own. I would ask not only that interjections should be refrained from now, but that when honorable members of the Opposition reply, interjections should equally be abstained &#39;from- They are irregular at all times, and are specially objectionable when they are of such a character as to disturb the course of an honorable member&#39;s speech. </para>

                            <para>- With all respect to my honorable friend, I think I have done so. With regard to Inter-State trade, I would say that every State has- it in its own power to protect its own people. When it gets products within its own borders it has the power to deal with them as it thinks fit. We want, above all, to guard against goods being exported as Australian produce unless such goods are honestly marked. Therefore, we feel that 5t is our duty to see that Australian goods go into the markets of the world with no false reputation. With regard to both exports from Australia and importations into Australia, I think the Bill will confer desirable powers which should be placed on the statute-book without very much delay. </para>

                        <para>- I fully realize that this Bill is of very considerable importance to the whole of the people of the Commonwealth, be they consumers or producers, and it came upon me somewhat as a surprise when the honorable member for Cowper stated that there was no demand whatever for a measure of this kind, but that it had emanated from the departmental officers. If his statement be true, it is strange indeed that this is the third Government that has taken the matter in hand in one form or another. We have only to look at the records of our courts in order to find that proceedings have been instituted against traders for selling goods which were not what they purported to be. Viewing this matter, in the first instance, from the stand-point of the consumer, what reasonable man can object to the Customs authorities demanding that where necessary .a trade description shall be applied to imported goods, defining what they are. The records of the police courts of Victoria show that some imported condensed milk, which is used largely for feeding infants, has been little better than poison, and I think that it is absolutely necessary that the Government should have the power to take samples of such goods at the time of importation and have them analyzed. We know, furthermore, that those who buy so called linen goods from our warehouses often find that the articles are made up largely of cotton. Then again, in regard to woollen piece goods, similar frauds are perpetrated. . When the Tariff was under discussion we . were told that alleged tea, which was practically Ceylon mud, was being imported into the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- I know that that has been done, but we want to have the matter placed beyond any doubt. The Government should be empowered, in the interests of the consumers, to demand that trade descriptions shall be affixed of such a character that the public may know what they are really buying. I know from experience that coffee, which is supposed to be a highly desirable beverage, is sometimes made of dried Bullock&#39;s liver. I know that not only imported goods, but also some articles of local production, are a. fraud, and not what they purport to be. But one thing at a time. Considerable stress has been laid on the contention that it is proposed to unduly interfere with the rights of exporters. Judging from the experience of the States, however, we cannot be too careful in dealing with our products for export if we are to preserve the reputation of our goods, ft has been said that a Commonwealth&#39; system of grading- butter! might result in injury to the producer. Victoria alone has an export trade in butter the value of which&#39; approximates to 7 50,000 per annum, and those who declaim against the right of a Government to intervene in matters of this kind must, surely forget that Government supervision has been exercised for some years over the export of butter from Victoria. As far back as 1898 the Victorian Legislature passed the Export of Products Bill, providing for - </para>

                            <para>- Our export of frozen meat has been restricted by conditions over which we have had very little control, but it is to be hoped that those conditions will soon disappear. T remember a time when shippers of frozen meat - not the sheep growers, but those engaged in the export business, comprising, for the most part, commercial men - used to think nothing of shipping home as &#34; Australian mutton &#34; carcasses that should have gone to the boiling down works. These men were indifferent to the reputation of Australian meat. In confirmation of this statement, let me quote some remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. R.</inline> &#39;Farrell, and published in- the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Mail</inline> on 1st of June, 1904, which, were quoted by the honorable and learned member for Darling Downs in this House on 20th October last. These remarks, which were made by a gentleman who is said to have travelled very considerably, will be found at page 5865, Vol. 22, of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> 1904 - </para>

                        <para>That is no exaggeration, and I greatly regret to state that Australia was not represented, except by the writer, and when asked the reason - &#34; Why we cannot depend on your meat (New South Wales). We like your Queensland beef in handy sizes, no waste; but if some of the people knew it was Australian they would not have it. We do not want anything or anybody Australian.&#34; The whole cause of this hatred is summed up in a very few words. These people have been swindled in business through the great quantity of fraudulent and not up-to-sample or quality of goods imposed upon them under glowing and flaring brands that had no right ever to be allowed out of the Colonies, but&#39; should have been condemned straight away. Tinned meats are to be seen in auction rooms for anything you dare to offer. In the wholesale and retail grocers&#39; windows you only see well-known American and English brands. Why ? Because they are sold under the United States of America Bureau certificate, and are always sought after, and it is found that Australia has no such -hall-mark to guarantee her products. </para>

                            <para>- I was. So far as my judgment goes, there can be no attempt on the part of the Commonwealth Government to grade goods for export except where a mark or classification is adopted by those engaged in any particular trade. In such cases the Commonwealth Government, through the Department of Trade and Customs, could compel some trade description designating a particular class of product to be applied to goods for export. </para>

The first grade is described as &#34;first quality,&#34; while the second is called &#34;pastry butter,&#34; and butter leaving Australia without bearing either of those trade descriptions could, in my opinion, be stopped by the Government tinder this Bill. I do not think, however, that it would be competent for the Commonwealth to go further, or that butter classed as &#34;approved for export&#34; could, by any stretch of imagination, be graded by its officers into another class. </para>

                            <para>- I can hardly conceive of any of our staple products being exported without bearing some descriptive brand or trade mark. The abuses that have crept into our butter trade, as well as into other branches of industry, have not been due to the producers themselves. Little, if any, of the corruption that exists in these States can be traced to the producer, although it is quite true, as the honorable member for Cowper has said, that inferior butter is sometimes produced owing to ignorance or inattention on the part of the manufacturer. In these days, however, it is recognised that it is essential to the very existence of the producers that absolutely good butter should be made. The same remark will apply to all our producers. They must turn out a good article in order to secure success. It is those who wish to secure an illegitimate profit who damage our export trade and injure the reputation of our. products. As soon as any particular product has made a reputation for itself in the markets of the world these men will come in with the intention, if the opportunity offers, to ship off an inferior admixture in order to gain a temporary pecuniary advantage. They soon go out of the business, leaving those who remain to bear the odium of their bad practices. </para>

                            <para>- Where our producers have formed themselves into co-operative companies they ship for themselves, but practically none of those who raise sheep or lambs export frozen carcasses on their own account. The same may be said of Victorian producers of butter, with the exception of one or two co-operative companies. Surely, honest traders can have no objection to a particular description where necessary being applied to a particular class of goods. A great deal will depend upon the administration of this measure. When the honorable member for North Sydney was speaking, I interjected that it would be very difficult to place within the four corners of the Bill a provision stipulating to what particular class of goods it should apply. </para>

                            <para>- In Victoria there is supervision of the fruit exported, under a State Act. Broadly, what is intended by this Bill is that where there is any attempt to defraud the public, the Government shall have power to say to an exporter, &#34;You shall define what your goods consist of. If you are shipping apples of first quality, you must take the responsibility of applying a trade description of that character to them.&#34; As the consequences of this Bill may be very far-reaching, I frankly admit that we are entitled to give it the closest possible scrutiny. No matter how honest our intentions may be, we shall not be able to justify our acceptance of the measure on the statement of the Minister, if it is subsequently found that by passing such a Bill we shall have done something which will injuriously affect the producing interests of Australia. The objects of the measure are in my opinion most worthy. It is intended to protect the interests of the consumer, by enabling him to know what he is purchasing. It is an effort to protect those engaged in the export of produce of various kinds ; and it is an effort to maintain a fair standard of quality in a general way for our staple products. . The measure will have little or no application to a considerable number of our products. We know that those engaged in producing wool, for instance, have the best experts the world can produce for the classification Of their product. It is not reasonable to assume that the Government would intervene between those experts and their employers to impose any further classification of wool. Wheat is another large staple product of export, and, were it possible, there is no doubt that those engaged in the wheat-growing industry would find it to their, advantage if some standard were fixed in connexion with wheat. Unfortunately, up to the present time they have not been able to obtain anything of the kind. Those engaged in the business to-day know from bitter experience that when they go to the trouble of cleaning and making their samples as perfect as possible, it is on very rare occasions indeed that they can get a better price than the more careless farmer secures for his comparatively inferior article. I do not know that the Government could intervene for the classification of this product. </para>

                            <para>- If some attempt were made to ship as wheat something that was not wheat, the Minister could intervene, but not otherwise. So far as I know, there is in the Commonwealth practically no classification or grading of wheat as an article of export. In Victoria the corn section of the Chamber of Commerce yearly fix the weight of the bushel of wheat, and that is all that is done. The admission was made by the honorable member for Cowper, when dealing with a particular class of export, that, speaking particularly for the State of New South Wales, no intervention by the State was necessary for the supervision of the export other than the enactment of a strict Dairy Supervision Act, under which information and education could be given to the producers in the first instance. That would be a step in the right direction, and such action is being taken in Victoria. I believe it is contemplated also in New South Wales. The supervision, however, is exercised at the port of export, and that is where the experts of the Agricultural Department are brought into contact with the producer in the first instance. Every consignment of butter sent from Victoria is examined by the experts of the Department as soon as it is admitted into the cool stores. If it is not up to the required standard, the attention of the factory manager concerned is immediately directed to the fact, and if there is no improvement in the next consignment from the same factory, an expert is at once sent into the factory. </para>

I have no word of condemnation for the agent or middleman, as he is termed, because he is a necessity in our system of conducting business. But it is such dishonesty as has been revealed by the evidence submitted to the Victorian Butter Commission that this class of legislation is designed to prevent. If honorable members will look at the report of the Butter Commission, they will see that they recommend just such&#39; action as is now being taken by the Commonwealth Government.

                    <para>A measure of success that has attended Victorian butter in the London and foreign markets is due to the fact that the product is made from the milk of cows fed upon natural pastures. The attractive flavour of the butter is due to the natural pasturage, which also adds to its keeping qualities. These favorable qualities, and the supervision of Government experts, have been specially noted by buyers, and have been the means of obtaining a high price, as compared with some other Colonial and foreign butters. </para>
                    <para>It is, to an extent, due to the advantageous geographical position of Victoria, where the spring and summer seasons fit in with the European winter months, and the supervision organized by the Government, that have, in a degree, protected the producers against the practices adopted to secure for the middlemen the bulk of the profits from this important national industry. . . . </para>
                    <para>The export trade for Victorian butter is now established, and to advance and guard its reputation on London and foreign markets requires such restrictive legislation, and, as a means of suppressing certain trade practices to which the industry has been subjected, this legislation is as urgent as it is necessary. </para>
                    <para class="block">That is the recommendation of a Commission appointed specially to inquire into the conduct of a particular industry. Those engaged in any industry are well aware that restrictive legislation is not directed against the honest man. This legislation is in every instance designed to protect the honest trader, employer, or producer, and to restrict and restrain the operations of the dishonest trader or employer. </para>

                            <para>- We have no legislation to deal with some of the objectionable practices which have been found to exist. We have no legislation with regard to the manipulation of brands, secret commissions, and that sort of thing. But here is a report from a tribunal specially constituted to inquire into the conditions of an industry, and they recommend Government action with regard to restricting, not honest traders, but those who are dishonest. And it is that class against whom this legislation is directed. It is not to be supposed that the honest trader will be interfered with in the slightest degree under this Bill. It is the man who comes into illegitimate competition with the honest exporter who will be affected. It is the man who exports goods which resemble woollens, but which are three parts cotton, and brings them into competition with those of the man who exports pure woollens, against whom this legislation is directed. The same applies to the man who exports lamb, trades on the name which our exporters have built up in London, perhaps sells a consignment on the water, and leaves it for the purchaser to find that he is &#34;landed.&#34; Naturally the purchaser so treated damns the whole Australian meat trade. I see no course open to us but to give some discretionary power to the Minister. I would, if it were possible, insert a schedule to the Bill containing the articles to which the measure is to apply. But I cannot conceive that that is possible. I think that the better course to pursue will be to follow the suggestion of the Attorney-General, and deal with the articles affected by regulation. Everything will depend upon the wise discretion exercised by the Minister ; and I have yet to learn that power is proposed to be taken to compel any exporter of produce to classify it according to the decision of the Minister for the time being. It will be obligatory for the exporter to attach to goods for export such a trade description as will define them and give information to the purchaser or consumer auto what they really are. To give such a description is, in my opinion, all in the way of fair and honest business. The States Governments have had to consider legislation for n similar purpose. We have an illustration in the State of Victoria, where the Government, pressed bv public opinion, have introduced an Adulteration of Foods </para>

                    <para>Act. Such a measure will deal with locally manufactured goods. The Commonwealth Government can best take action with regard to imports. The Customs Department is the proper authority to exercise control over such goods, in the first instance; the proof that there is a necessity for such legislation is the fact that, during the last few years, three Governments, in succession have made attempts to deal with the subject in one form or another; either by means of a Merchandise Marks Bill, a Fraudulent Trade Marks Bill,, or a Commerce Bill, such as we have before us. The suggestion of the Attorney-General gives Parliament absolute control over a tyrannical or despotic Minister or Government. Any action of the Minister can be brought under review by this House, and if he transgresses his authority or injures either consumers or producers, Parliament will bring him to book. But, as far as my experience goes, I do not think that any Minister will, in the slightest degree, attempt to affect injuriously either the producers or the consumers of Australia. </para>
