                <para class="block">The amendments made by the Senate in this Bill do not touch any question of substance. The first provides that the Act shall commence on a date to be fixed by proclamation, to allow of notice of the alteration of the law being given at distant places, such as Port Darwin and Broome. Then, instead of making the language test a passage of not more than fifty words, it is -proposed to make it a passage of not less than fifty words in any prescribed language or languages. The provision in clause 3 that any additional language prescribed shall not be taken to be sanctioned unless &#39;within a certain time the proposal has not been dissented from by Parliament has been altered so that no additional language may be used for the test, until its use has been assented to by Parliament, thus making the assent of Parliament positive instead of negative. The fifth amendment is a proposal to insert a new clause, which reads as follows : - </para>
                <list type="decimal-dotted">
                    <item label="3.">
                        <para>Until a regulation prescribing any language or languages under section 3 of the Principal Act as amended by this Act, shall come into force, any language authorized by section 3 of the Principal Act before the commencement of this Act shall be deemed to be a prescribed language within the meaning of that section as so amended. </para>
                    </item>
                </list>
                <para>That makes no alteration, except in the form of the expression. The next amendment proposes to leave out the word &#34; agent &#34; in a clause in which the word was not required. The last amendment, in clause 12, is intended to meet, in a better way than we were able at the table, the suggestion of the honorable member for North Sydney for the protection of shipowners against being called upon to deport prohibited immigrants after they had been here for some time. I inserted an amendment which would accomplish the object so far as section 8 of the Act was concerned, but it was discovered that the ship-owners might be liable under other sections. Now it is proposed to limit their responsibility to the deportation of immigrants prohibited under sections 3 and 5 of the Act. With the one exception to which I have referred, these are merely drafting amendments. </para>

                    <para>- It seems to me that one of these amendments is most important. It means that no language can be prescribed in addition to those already prescribed - and none are prescribed except European languages - unless a resolution is passed by Parliament. Therefore, if it were desired to prescribe any other language in order to meet the susceptibilities pf any nation with which we were friendly, that course could be adopted only after a long and tolerably angry debate in this House. That would involve the adoption of more offensive methods than those at present provided for. </para>

                        <para>- There is practically no difference between the two provisions ; the amendment effects no improvement. The object of the Bill is to tone down the terms of the present Act by making them less offensive to friendly nations. But, as the result of the amendments made in this House, and further amendments proposed by the Senate, we are providing that no other language shall be prescribed except after a possibly angry debate in Parliament. That does not seem to me to be the way <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> conciliate a friendly nation. However, the responsibility lies with the&#39; Government, and I can only enter my protest against what is now being done. </para>

Therefore, the provision is designed, not only to shut out immigrants who cannot comply with certain conditions, but to really prevent any one from coming here. One officer may prescribe fifty words, and another may call upon an immigrant to transcribe the whole of the Bible. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. JOSEPH</inline>COOK (Parramatta).A few minutes ago, the Minister told me across the table that he would be glad to present me with a copy of the speech he delivered here yesterday. After having listened to his speech, I have no special desire to be furnished with a copy of it; but I would suggest that when the Minister prepares a lucid explanation of a measure the least he should do is to pay this House the same compliment that he pays the <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> The honorable and learned member for Wannon very properly asked why honorable members cannot be treated with the same consideration and courtesy as the newspaper which is behind the Government. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> declares very properly that this measure is the most important of <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> session. It far transcends any other that has been before us. As to its far-reaching character, no two opinions can be entertained. Its operation will extend to the uttermost ramifications of trade in the community. If the measure is the most important that has been introduced this session, I venture to suggest that a constitutional outrage has been perpetrated by bringing it before this Chamber after the Appropriation Bill has been assented to by the Governor-General. Whoever heard of the one important legislative enactment of a session being thrown before a Chamber like this, after the Appropriation Bill had been passed by both Houses. I venture to suggest that on the next occasion we are considerate enough to afford the Senate an early opportunity to consider the Appropriation Bill, you, sir, should not allow the Bill to pass out of your hands until the business of this House is concluded. That is the constitutional procedure invariably adopted in other Legislatures of the Empire. We have departed from it in the belief that we should speedily wind up the session by passing such measures as were necessary to complete the ordinary sessional programme. Immediately we surrendered our hold upon the finances, the Government began to introduce measures of infinitely more importance than any that have preceded them. This is an outrage which the House would be quick to punish if it had a proper sense of constitutional dignity. The Government have been guilty of political trickery, and have resorted to a practice which has been adopted for the first time in the history of this Parliament. In these closing hours of the session of a demoralized House, we are whittling away some of our most precious prerogatives and privileges - but no one seems to care. I, at least, shall record my protest against what I conceive to be a violation of the fundamental principles of constitutional Government. I have had to protest on previous occasions against similar action on the part of Ministers, and I shall probably have to raise my voice again and again with increasing fervour, in protest against important&#39; Bills being introduced at this stage. The Minister yesterday, by way of extenuation, stated that the delay in the introduction of the measure, was due to the stonewalling of the Opposition. The answer to the Minister is to be found in the statement of one of his colleagues that the measure had not received its final preparation until two days ago. Therefore, the Minister has been guilty of a piece of effrontery in telling us that the late introduction of the measure was due to the action of the Opposition. There is another reply to the Minister, and that is that the greater part of the time of the session has been taken up in the consideration of two measures. The Commerce Bill occupied five weeks, and the honorable member for Bland told us that the Trade Marks Bill had engaged the attention of the House for four weeks. Therefore, nine weeks have been devoted to the consideration of measures which are not nearly so important as that now submitted to us. May I suggest to the Prime Minister, in all seriousness, that the consideration of this Bill should be deferred till the next session? A Bill affecting profoundly - as this does - all the trade and commerce of the Continent, ought not to be rushed through before the people who are most interested in it, who will suffer for whatever faults it may contain, have been afforded an opportunity of looking through if, with a view to making some representations fo the Government as to how their industrial activities will be influenced by it. May I point out that in the case of measures of infinitely less importance, the Government have paid the trading community the compliment of consultation. When the Customs Act was under consideration in this House, the then Minister of Trade and Customs, the right honorable member for Adelaide&#39;, confidentially submitted his proposals to the various Chambers of Commerce throughout Australia. Since then, the Trade Marks Bill was held in abeyance for weeks, in order that the trading community might be consulted concerning it, and might have an opportunity of making any representations that they thought fit, as to its possible effects. The same course was pursued in connexion with the Commerce Bill. Yet the measure under consideration - a measure which transcends them all in its importance - is, forsooth, to be pushed through this Chamber in the closing hours of an already too long drawn out session. I say that the Prime Minister will be doing a great injustice to the people of the Commonwealth if he pushes this Bill through in this way, and the least that he can do is to defer its consideration until next session. Another reason why it should not be persisted in at the present time is that it purports to be a Bill to deal with trusts. It is directed against two trusts in particular, which it is alleged are operating outside of Australia to the detriment of the public, by reason of the harvesters which they are sending here to compete with our own manufacturers. Need 1 recall the fact that a Royal Commission is already -in existence whose special duty it is to investigate all matters relating to trade and commerce, and to ascertain how harvesters, and other agricultural implements of local manufacture are being affected by competition from oversea. We are now invited to break in upon the deliberations of that body with this Bill, which, so far as that aspect of the matter is concerned, takes the question entirely and ruthlessly out of its -hands. Why ? Because some enterprising, gentleman outside has declared that he is being injured by the competition referred to. We have been told that the two firms whose methods are impugned, and against whom this legislation is specially directed, have already asked to be allowed to give evidence before the Tariff Commission. Surely the House is not prepared to cut off the heads even of trusts without hearing anything which may be advanced on their sidle? These firms have petitioned this House through a Royal Commission, to be heard in reply to the charges which have been made against them. They declare that they are not indulging in unfair competition. </para>

                            <para>- Under this Bill a trust is required to prove that it is not engaging in unfair competition. That, I venture to say, is entirely anti-British, and absolutely foreign to every instinct of fair play. I maintain tha* a trust should be treated fairly by the supreme Legislature of Australia, just as should the humblest individual. These firms say - &#34; Before you pronounce us guilty of unfairness in our -trade relations, hear us before the Royal Commission which you yourselves have appointed to take evidence upon this point. We are willing to be judged after we have been heard.&#34; As the Tariff Commission meets in Melbourne in the middle of January to still further pursue its inquiries, the least we can do is to defer the consideration of this Bill until a thorough investigation of the facts has been made, and until we ascertain, upon authenticated and sworn evidence, whether the peril really exists which the measure is intended to meet. </para>

                            <para>- There is no doubt about that. Under it, the Minister will have an opportunity to practise his fine art of squelching the trade of Australia. There is nothing that he likes better, so long as it means political preferment to him. The Government, I repeat, is one of the champion meddling Governments of Australia. Not content to do our own work, to devote ourselves to the consideration of those great measures affecting our population, our standing in relation to the States - indeed, all those things which it was the primary object of the Constitution to achieve - we have begun to meddle in matters which do not concern us, and we have even gone outside of Australia to do it. </para>

                            <para>- I am speaking of the honorable member&#39;s bold attempt to take a hand in Imperial legislation, which consumed a great deal of the time of the session that might very well have been devoted to the consideration of this Bill if it was intended to pass it before Parliament prorogued. Having taken a hand in Imperial legislation, and declared to the Imperial Parliament what it ought to do in relation to the government of a great portion of the British Isles, we are now invited to transport ourselves to America, to ascertain how people over there manage their businesses, how they assess their values, and how they make their profits. Had we not better stay at home and look after our own business? We may go tinkering all over the world when we have nothing better to do. Meantime, I suggest this is a measure which adversely affects many innocent, <inline font-style="italic">bond fide,</inline> honest traders in Australia, simply because. they are traders. Indeed, as I have said elsewhere, it ought to be called not an Anti-Trust Bill, because it is,&#39; in its essence an anti-trade Bill - an anti-commerce Bill, an anti-importation Bill. </para>

                            <para>- The wonder is that any Government would assume that they have the capacity to deal with all these matters in this light and airy fashion. The best testimony we can obtain of their inefficiency is supplied by the fact that they arrogate to themselves the capacity to do all that this Bill would require them to do. We are told that this Bill is one to deal with trusts. It sets out broadly to do that by the establishment of a huge Government trust to take the place of private ones that are to be scotched. The Government are going to set up another which, in the tyranny of its action, the scope of its endeavours, and the results it will achieve, will be a more gigantic trust than any of which we have cognisance. It will affect the consumers and the traders of Australia in a more adverse way than any private trust that it seeks to replace. Briefly put. this is a Bill to force up prices. </para>

                            <para>- The first part of the Bill relates not merely to trusts, but to ordinary trading. The Bill is to enact Socialism in Australia. It is to give legislative effect to many features of Socialism, without the assumption of socialistic responsibility bv the Government. The responsibility is still to be left with the private individual. The Government are going to regulate his business for him, and, if need be, to prevent him from carrying it on except under conditions prescribed by this measure. If we are going in for Socialism. Jet the Government take over the whole concern, and accept the responsibility for its management. We shall then know where we are, and what we are doing; but it is not fair to socialize the form, method, and conduct of enterprise, whilst we at the same time leave all the responsibility to those whom we so victimize. </para>

                            <para>- My own impression is that the Government are meddling far too much in the industrial enterprises of the country, and that the more they meddle the worse they make the position. The people who suffer most from trade disorganization or anything that interferes with the ordinary regular flow of industrial life are the very men at the bottom of the scale, who are working for wages. They are hit every time. The capitalist can look after himself ; the man at the bottom of the scale cannot. </para>

                            <para>- We shall see about that. By the time the honorable member has done with the workers of Australia they will be in a very prosperous condition, no doubt. This measure is entitled the &#34; Australian Industries Preservation Bill.&#34; In my judgment, it would be better termed &#34; The Australian Industries Destruction Bill.&#34; That would unquestionably describe its object and effect. I appeal to the Ministry to give consideration to the fact that Australia is to-day a great exporting country, and must remain so for generations to come. However much we may try, within our borders, to stimulate our home industries, when we &#39;have done our best in that connexion, Australia will still remain for many generations a great exporting country. With our virgin continent and few people that must be so. Roughly speaking, our export trade is 30 per cent. of our total production. We may prohibit imports by this rough, rude, and ready method, but by the same proportion that we prohibit imports we prohibit exports; we prohibit the export of that upon which we depend for our very life blood. I have no desire to discuss the fiscal aspect of the question, but am speaking of broad principles of trade to which every one subscribes. Whatever we do, as protectionists or free-traders, in the way of regulating our commerce, the position is altogether different when we take power, as is proposed by this Bill, to prohibit trade, and to make it a misdemeanour to import goods. The result must be bad to Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I am describing an extreme measure. I know, that the honorable member is a protectionist, but I have yet to learn that he is a prohibitionist. I am denouncing the prohibition to be effected by this measure, and which has nothing to do with the fiscal question, as such&#39;. It is one thing to regulate our commerce, but if honorable members desire to secure protection, this Bill will be a dis honest means of obtaining it. The only way to secure protection for the industries of Australia is by the imposition of a protective Tariff. That would be honest, frank, and straightforward; but this is a dishonest way of sneaking in prohibition. It is not a proposal to impose a moderate protective Tariff, such as most of the protectionist members of this House profess to believe in. </para>

                            <para>- I was about to come to that point. One would think that in introducing a measure of such far-reaching importance, the Minister would have made some effort to furnish data showing its necessity. But what are the facts? In moving the second reading of this Bill, the honorable gentleman did not mention anything to show the necessity for it. I believe that the Prime Minister made reference to letters that had been addressed to him, but, if they be important and material as showing the necessity for legislative action, why were those letters not produced, or mention made at least of their effect? </para>

                            <para>- I should be very sorry to see any American trust hurt our own industrial enterprises. I should be very sorry to see either of these trusts knock out <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay,</inline> or any other manufacturer of harvesters in Australia; but I decline to have -my political leg pulled by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay,</inline> or any other man. If he has a real 1 grievance, let him establish &#62; the fact by evidence. Would not any one think that the Minister, in submitting this Bill to the House, would have shown, by such figures as he had at hand, how this unfair competition was ruling and ruining Australia, since it is said that our industrial, existence is in peril, and that we are being overborne by octopi, in the shape of American trusts? Not a word of evidence has been given to justify this important proposal, and, in the absence of such evidence, may we not justly infer that it does not exist? The Comptroller-General of Customs is specially selected to carry out the provisions of the Bill, because of his intimate knowledge of the ramifications of trade. Why has not a report been obtained from him to show the effect which the trusts are having upon Australian industries? Has no evidence been produced because the Minister has none in his possession,? If the Minister has no evidence to justify the introduction of the Bill, the measure should not have been brought forward; while, if he has such evidence, and is suppressing it, he is not dealing fairly and honestly with us. </para>

                            <para>- Is that all the evidence which the Minister has to buttress his case? He did not show that there is any relative increase in the importations of harvesters. If no further evidence of the injury dope by foreign trusts can be adduced, the Bill should be instantly withdrawn. All that I have learned goes to show that the Australian manufacture of agricultural implements is steadily increasing, not that it is being done to death by the octopus trusts to which the Minister referred yesterday. I cordially congratulate Australian makers that this is so, and I sincerely hope that their business will steadily advance. There is no evidence that our manufacturing enterprises are being, crushed out of existence by American trusts. I find that in 1 896 - to take the case of the agricultural implement makers - there were 852 men engaged in that industry, while eight years later there were 1,496 men engaged in it, and that, whereas in 1896 the value of their production was ,&#163;244,000, last year it was ,&#163;431,000. Those figures show a healthy development of business. </para>

                            <para>- No doubt I should see it as soon as the honorable member, if it actually existed, though probably I should not be so readily scared. Yesterday, when reference was made to the rumour that there are 2,000 harvesters on the water, on their way to Australia, the Minister of Trade and Customs told us that Re know nothing about it. </para>

I am as ready as is any honorable member to deal with a real peril, and to preserve our manufacturers from unfair attacks, but I see no reason for scare legislation. The introduction of the Bill has been instigated bv one manufacturer. </para>

                            <para>- I am not doing so. When I .say something which the honorable member is saying all the year round, he accuses me of attacking workmen. He, however, does not scruple to stigmatize honest working people as wage slaves, and to* assert that they are not their own masters. The workmen to whom I refer have acted under duress. I am speaking generally when I say that we must not take too seriously the statements made by workmen employed by those who want this legislation.&#39; I know nothing about the relations between McKay and his hands. They may be of the best, and I hope that they are. So far as I can ascertain, however, McKay is the originator of this legislation, and I congratulate him upon his cleverness, and his ability to influence the Government as he is doing. I congratulate the Prime Minister, too; on having so enterprising and active a man in his constituency. </para>

                            <para>- It could not conduct its investigations without learning all about the business ramifications of our shipping. To compare our tobacco trust or* our shipping combination with some of the trusts which have been legislated for in America is to slander Australia. We have no parallel to the American trusts, which&#39; fleece the public, and corrupt the Legislatures of the United States. It is, indeed, suggested by some of the best writers on the subject that in that great country over the seas - &#34;the land of the free and the home of the brave&#34; as it has been called - the anti-trust legislation is being manipulated for their own interests by some trusts against other trusts. Trusts, which are a menace to the liberty, health, and morality, and to even the life, of the people, ought not to be made the basis for legislation such as we are now asked to consider. We have no parallels to the trusts of America, and, therefore, we should leave them alone. We should not drag them in as precedents for our conduct in this case. </para>

                            <para>- I have heard nothing about that. I contend that we have had no scandals such as have made anti-trust legislation in America necessary. It is very strange that we should have to go to America for all our ideals and models of legislation. I absolutely decline to take the United States legislation as a model, and for the reason. that much of it is the result of manipulation and public corruption. The sooner we drop this specious Yankee legislation, for which there is no need in Australia, the better it will be for us, and for our reputation abroad. While we are taking steps to deal with outside trusts, we are not proposing to take any measures in regard to the trusts in our midst. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> has admitted that he belongs to a combination, the purpose of which is to keep up prices, and if this legislation would not apply to a case of that kind, we should be playing a very one-sided game. Unless the Bill applies to inside, as well as to outside, trusts, an undue preference will be given to the former. I presume that the evil attaching to trusts is inherent in the combinations, and has no reference to the <inline font-style="italic">country in</inline> which they operate. That which is evil in America would also be an evil in Australia. The Minister said that the idea underlying this Bill was the protection of Australian industries. If that be so, he is endeavouring to sneak in protection. A proposal for further protection to Australian industries ought not to come from a Government which has pledged it self deeply to the electors of Australia to maintain fiscal peace during the life of this Parliament. If this measure is intended to further protect the industries of Australia, the Minister is utterly condemning his own conduct,, and proving his treachery to the people. He told us that, in endeavouring to impose further protection, many ideas had suggested themselves to him. He thought, first of all, that he could impose higher duties, but he feared&#39; that too much opposition would be raised in this House. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister is quibbling again. He declared that this was a protective measure, and stated that if he could have afforded protection to our industries by increasing the duties he would have done so;_but he knew that any such proposal would provoke strong opposition. That is a fine thing for a Minister to say. In the absence of opposition, he is firm in asserting his principles. If, however, the slightest hostility is displayed, his principles vanish. That has been the outstanding feature of the Minister&#39;s career. He is a magnificent protectionist when there i&#187; no risk of his losing office; but if the slightest opposition is raised, his principles are found to be without solid foundation. . I do not pretend to understand many of the technicalities of the measure. A prominent honorable and learned member on the Government side of the House told me that he could not make out some of the definitions and other provisions in the Bill, and he concluded by saying that if he were a trader trying to understand the Bill, he would be completely puzzled. Therefore, there is some excuse for my not being able to understand the measure. I should like to know from the Attorney-General- </para>

                            <para>- I am asking for information. If the honorable member had asked a question, Ministers would have rushed over each other in their anxiety to answer him, but because I seek information I am treated with contumely&#34;. The Minister shows his utter want of appreciation of the amenities of his position when he objects to a legal question being addressed to the Attorney-General. I wish to direct attention to the definition of what constitutes &#34;lower remuneration for labour.&#34; It seems to me that it is very faulty indeed. It merely includes &#34; less pay or longer hours.&#34; It should include both. Under the Bill, if a man employed by one industrial combination is working for longer hours than are the employes of other combinations, that fact is deemed to constitute one of the elements of unfair competition. I, should think it would be fairer to apply the test of the rate of remuneration per hour. We are told that in many industries in America the employes work for ten hours per day, but that they receive a higher rate of pay per hour than do those who are engaged in other industries. Therefore, it seems to me that if we are to apply a. proper test, &#34; lower &#39; remuneration for labour &#34; should be judged both from the stand-point of the hours and the pay, and particularly of the pay per hour. That, after all, is the real test of the efficiency of competition. Then, in this Bill, we get a definition of what is &#34; unfair competition.&#34; First of all, the Comptroller-General of Customs is required to look after the whole of the industrial enterprises of Australia - a task which he cannot perform. We make the Minister a kind of socialistic boss, so far as the industrial life of the Commonwealth is concerned. He is supposed to interest himself in all matters relating to the welfare of the producers, the workers, and consumers. What does he know, about them? What special fitness has he to undertake this important inquiry into ramifications of the whole trading and producing interests of Australia? He cannot do it, and he will&#34; not do it. No man can do it. </para>

                            <para>- That is my trouble. Very likely he will act on ignorant and -interested representations. That is one of the dangers of&#34; the Bill. If we could be sure that he would act with knowledge and judgment, there would be nothing, to be said against it. No one man can possess the requisite knowledge to undertake this stupendous task, and therefore I say that effect will not be given to the Bill. But the fact remains that the Minister is required to make the effort - ignorant, rude, and ruthless as it will be. That is the one danger that we have to fear. There is no doubt that the Comptroller-General of Customs knows as much about the ramifications of trade as any one man can do. But he does not know as much as the whole trading community, and therefore he can never be a proper judge as to what affects the interests of the workers, producers, and consumers all over Australia. Neither can any Board which the Minister may set up. The Comptroller-General has to frame an opinion as to what constitutes &#34; unfair competition,&#34; as it relates to Australian industries, the preservation of which, in his opinion, is advantageous to the Commonwealth. Under this Bill, we actually allot to him the task of declaring what industries should be preserved in the interests of the Commonwealth. How can he know that? How can he tell whether an industry is likely to prove advantageous to Australia? He cannot possibly know anything about the new industries which may be established. Yet he is the &#34; Pooh-Bah &#34; to whom this matter will be referred. If he comes to the conclusion that an industry is not engaging iri competition in such a way as to lead to the preservation of Australian industries, he is obliged to report accordingly. Then we are told in the Bill that competition is to be regarded as unfair, and is to be legislated out of existence, if it will probably lead either to Australian goods being withdrawn from the market, or being sold at a loss, unless they were produced at a lower rate of remuneration to labour. One would think that the Comptroller-General would have plenty to do in. inquiring into the existing order of things. But he -is to do more than that. He is required to forecast the1 future effect of competition upon these industries. In doing that, he is obliged to have regard to what might probably lead to. &#39;goods being withdrawn from the market in the distant future. When one considers the nature of the duties that will be thrust upon him, one is inclined to exclaim, with Shakespeare, &#34; Oh, my prophetic soul.&#34; How can the Comptroller-General tell what will probably happen in the distant future of Australian industry? I repeat that &#34; lower remuneration &#34; should take into account both the hours worked and the wages paid. That is the true competitive test. &#62; </para>

                            <para>- No. The Board can only give effect to what is set forth in. the Bill. We might settle this matter satisfactorily if the Minister were out of the Chamber, because the Attorney-General might then be able to speak without giving him offence. Another matter which has to be investigated by the Comptroller-General relates to whether the means adopted by the importer or seller of imported goods are unfair under the circumstances, I notice that the &#34; means &#34; which are to be investigated relate only to the importer or seller. Why should not inquiries be also made into the &#34; means &#34; adopted by our local producers? The &#34;means adopted,&#34; I should say, might include advertising, agencies, and so forth. Is it not inquisitorial in the last degree to inquire into the &#34; means adopted &#34; for the sale of goods ? There may be a reason for inserting that provision, but I should like to hear what it is. The Bill further provides that if a person is importing goods or selling imported goods, and is a commercial trust, his competition is deemed unfair. That is to say, a person who is a trust is ruled out by this legislation as an unfair competitor. He is declared to be guilty before he has been tried. The fact that he exists at all proves him to be a trade murderer. I say that that is not British justice. </para>

                            <para>- I am much obliged to ..the Minister for his exceeding courtesy. For a Minister to decline to answer a question put to him to elicit information is an insult to the House. I venture to say that a similar request has never been refused in any Parliament in the world, and no Minister but the present Minister of Trade and Customs would be guilty of such a gross act of discourtesy. Further, if competition be deemed by the Comptroller-General to be such as will result in the&#39; disorganization of Australian industry or in throwing workers out of employment, it is deemed to be unfair. I should like to know what industry resting upon a competitive basis is not more or less disorganized at nearly every point of its existence? If a new machine be introduced into a shop, it disorganizes the whole establishment, and possibly displaces labour. Is that to be deemed unfair competition? Under this definition it would be. Whenever the necessity arose for the installation of a new machine in a shop, the proprietor of that shop would &#34; be liable to be deemed an &#34;unfair competitor,&#34; because the machine incidentally displaced a few hands. , </para>

                            <para>- I declared, at the outset, that this was a Bill to reduce the most efficient in our industrial life and methods to the level of the lowest. Let me give an illustration. When the Tariff was under consideration, I moved the omission of the item, &#34;Tanners&#39; Machines,&#34; and after a debate extending over something like two days, the Minister consented to make further inquiries. His officer reported in effect, &#34; We are not making these machines in Australia, but we are making others that will do the work.&#34; It turned out that a manufacturer employing twenty men and boys in one of the suburbs of Melbourne was making obsolete machines, and that he was the only man in Australia engaged in that branch&#39; of industry. </para>

                            <para>- When a Minister has such an arbitrary power all that he has to do is to exercise it; that does not involve intelligence or statesmanship. It is also to be deemed unfair competition to pay an agent an unusually large remuneration. I have yet to learn that we have a right to inquire what a trust, company, or firm pays its agents ; I have yet to know that we have a right to interfere in the fixing of salaries as between employer and employe. So far, we have not done such a thing, except through the Arbitration Court. But here we are providing that such interference shall take place in respect of people who would not be likely to go into that Court. We, are setting out to ascertain what are the. values, the profits, and the salaries, and to interfere with the business of the community in every way. This is pure Socialism without socialistic responsibility. When any &#39; of these matters has been ascertained, the officer is to certify accordingly to the Minister. The honorable gentleman will then step into the arena, and begin his handiwork. He will first of all appoint a Board of three&#39; persons. A striking feature of this Bill is the enormous power that it vests in the Minister. May I hope that the Minister of Trade and Customs will not think, as he usually does., that I am speaking personally? I say that no Minister should have such a power ; the power should lie either in the Governor-General or in this House. I do not think that any appointment of this kind will ever be satisfactory, unless it be a Judge of the High Court. He is the only individual who could give any satisfaction in regard to this matter. The power to appoint a Board, which is to be conferred on the Minister, will open the door to favoritism. The taint of suspicion must always attach to appointments made by an individual Minister. </para>

A Board appointed as proposed in this Bill would not be the best to undertake the important work which is to be allotted it. For instance, if it were an appointment from within the trade to be investigated, it would be liable to the taint of partizanship, and if the appointment were made from outside the trade, the allegation might fairly be made that the Board lacked a sufficient knowledge of the business concerned. </para>

                            <para>- Let us have a Justice of the High Court to deal with these matters ; let him be assisted by expert assessors, but let the decision rest with him. Then, again, when a certificate is presented, and the Board is appointed, notice is to be given in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> and with that notification there is to be a prohibition of the importation of the goods affected. That, in my opinion, will be ruinous to business. This prohibition&#39; is to be only for the purposes of inquiry, and it may occur in the middle of the season. It may mean the ruin of a season&#39;s business. Since the inquiry relates to importations, I presume that the Board will hear the foreign importers whose goods they hold up. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The Government newspaper organ has made&#39; as savage and unfair attack as I have ever read in a journal, and is trying to bundle him out of public life, although there is no foundation for its statements. Inquiries such as are necessary under the Bill should be intrusted to the Tariff Commission, but one cannot hope for expedition in connexion with them. The Bill is not framed to promote expedition in any direction. It is designed, not to facilitate trade, but to hinder it. The investigation which is provided for is to ascertain whether competition is, or probably will be, unfair, and to find out what may be its effect on an industry at some future time. I hope that these provisions will be struck out of the measure when we get into Committee, because they are absolutely absurd. The Board has also to make inquiry as to any goods, things, or matters whatsoever which they consider pertinent, necessary, or material. Such inquiries cannot be made expeditiously, and should not be intrusted to any one but a. Judge. I hope that the Bill will be entirely recast, to provide for that. After a prohibition has been determined, the report of the Board is to be laid before both Houses of Parliament * if in session. Therefore, the time for the Minister to choose to play ducks and drakes with the interests of the trading community will be at the beginning of the recess. I have not nearly so much objection to -the second, as I have to the first, part of the Bill. In reality, the measure is two Bills in one - a Bill to suppress ordinary, legitimate competition, and a Bill to suppress monopolistic trusts. These two objects should have been kept separate. I do not believe in trusts any more than any other honorable member believes in them, and I do not wish to see our industrial enterprises broken down. But, in dealing with ordinary business competition, the Minister makes the decision of a Board final, whereas, in dealing with monopolistic trusts, the questions at issue must be settled by a Court. I ask the House to note this difference of treatment. Although the ordinary trader is dealt with arbitrarily by a Board, these huge monopolistic trusts are to have a &#34;fair go&#34; in the Law &#39;Courts, after the Attorney-General has taken action against them by moving for an injunction. Surely we should not be more tender in dealing with trusts than in dealing with ordinary traders. The ordinary trader ought to be able to take his case to a Law Court, but I should not mind submitting the operations of a monopolistic trust to a Board, with a Judge at the head of it. In any case, we should not consider a trust with greater tenderness than we extend to the ordinary legitimate trader. However, I shall not pursue the matter further now, as other honorable members intend to speak upon the measure. I have said enough to show that these proposals are exceedingly drastic. </para>

                            <para>- I have not dealt with it because I have not had any time in which to prepare myself for the consideration of the measure. Nothing could be more scandalous than the manner in which a Bill of this importance has been thrust before this Parliament, at the end of the session, when only scant time is available for its consideration. This treatment of it is unfair to the House, and to those whose interests are likely to be affected by our legislation. Before the measure is passed, it should be made abundantly clear that it is necessary. In any case, it is far too drastic. The bad features of the American legislation have been copied, although they are not applicable to our conditions. I can only conclude that the Ministry has a vendetta against the commercial and trading interests of Australia, and they are helping to introduce an era of Socialism which will make individualistic conditions almost impossible. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member&#39;s whole argument was directed to the non-necessity for this legislation, because of the non-existence of the evil which it has been introduced to combat. But, even if it were admitted that trusts and monopolies do not exist in Australia - and I do not admit it - wise men must be guided by experience. Prevention is far better than cure, and we are justified by what we know of other countries in taking time by the forelock, and legislating for the prevention of the conditions by which we are menaced . </para>

                            <para>- It will deal with three great trusts which are at the present time operating in Australia, the International Harvester Company, the tobacco monopoly, and the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. The two latter are already causing the consumers of their productions - for whom honorable members opposite are always expressing solicitude - to pay very dearly for them, while the first-named has public&#93; v announced its intention to secure the Australian trade in agricultural implements, as it has already secured 90 per cent, of the trade of the world. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but it has fastened one of its long tentacles upon the heart of Australia, and threatens the very existence of industries which have been established at considerable cost. If it gains the upper hand it will certainly raise the prices of its manufactures to the consumers. So far as we are concerned, the trust is a young tiger, which is at present living only on milk ; . but the time will, come when it will demand blood- the life-blood of the industrial population of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that every trust, whether local or foreign, should be brought under control. The Bill deals not only with foreign, but also with local combinations. We have had evidence of the manipulations of the trusts in America. I would refer honorable members to two enormous volumes in the Library, which contain information collected by Congress with regard to the operations of the American trusts. There they will find indications of the extremes to which the manipulations and exploitations of the trusts have been carried on. Similar operations are certain to be conducted here, and, in fact, they are being carried on to-day. The methods of the trusts are not apparent to those who look merely at the surface of things. They take good care that what they are doing does not appear on the surface. The Bill provides means by which the surface can be broken, and their operations can bc brought into the full light of day. We should be foolish if, in considering this question, we entirely shut our eyes to what has taken place in America, where trusts have assumed the largest proportions. We should take warning bv the shocking example which the &#34;United States presents of long continued indifference on the part of those responsible for the welfare of the body politic. The Legislature of America is largely to blame for not having taken action in regard to trusts when they could have been more easily grappled with. We should take heed of the teachings of history, and not allow the trusts to assume such magnitude that they cannot unless with great difficulty be combated. The trusts devise means by which the public can be completely hood-winked. They are able to cover <inline font-style="italic">uv</inline> what they are doing, and we can obtain a knowledge of their transactions only by invoking the power of the law. The evils brought about in America have been manifold. In the first place, the operations of the trusts tend to reduce employment; and in the second to increase the cost of- living. The moment that a trust gets into working order employment is reduced. We have had a case in point in Australia. The great tobacco combine has closed up a number of factories, and a number of men, from managers down to leaf strippers,, have been thrown put of employment. Evidence was given by one* of the managers of the combine that the trust was brought about partly with the object of reducing the cost of administration. </para>

                            <para>- That argument has always, been used in favour of delay. I do not think that the inquiry now being conducted by the Committee need be interfered with in the slightest degree. The question as to whether the Government shall take over the industry is not involved in the measure before us. The reduction of employment to which I have referred is always followed by two great evils from which this country has already suffered in some degree, namely,, centralization and concentration. The factories of -the tobacco combine are now carried on only in the greater centres of population. The smaller factories have been obliterated, and the employes have been thrown on the streets. I am sure that honorable members who are aware of the ill effects of centralization would not favour industrial methods which would accentuate the evil. One of the first results of monopoly is an increase in the price of the commodities which the trusts put upon the market. This increase is not always apparent. The consumer is not always aware that he is paying a higher price. When a combine has the power to reduce the quality of an article, it invariably does so, and thus in effect considerably increases its cost. The article&#39; does not last so long and does not stand the same wear and tear as does one manufactured under conditions of fair competition. The International Harvester Trust has publicly announced that it has secured 90 per cent, of the world&#39;s trade, and intends to obtain the rest. That may be a verv laudable ambition on the part of a trading concern, but it is one which I am sure that honorable members are not prepared to assist that combination to attain. As the result of a long and sad experience, we recognise that if we were placed entirely at the mercy of such a trust, the advancement of our agricultural industry would be seriously retarded, and the well-being of those engaged in it seriously menaced. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. We have had undue demands made upon us for years and years by a great combine of a similar character. Before they were threatened with local competition, the American manufacturers of reapers and1 binders required our farmers to pay prices 100 per cent, in advance of the actual value of the machines. </para>

                            <para>- I am prepared to leal with any combination of a nefarious character. I am a protectionist, and I contend that a proposal of this kind is the corollary of a protective Tariff. Protection for the manufacturer only is no protection at all. The necessary accompaniment of protection to the manufacturer, which we have secured to a certain extent by means of the Tariff, and protection to&#39; the operatives, which has been insured to some extent by our industrial legislation, is the protection of the consumer, which we can secure by means of anti-trust and anti-monopoly legislation. We are perfectly aware of the methods usually adopted by the trusts. They first of all lull the consumer into a false sense of security by satisfying him that they will bring about a reduction in prices. The International Harvester Company reduced the prices of their machines in order to kill local competition. It is the invariable practice of the trusts to reduce their prices in order to secure the market and shut out all competitors. </para>

                            <para>- The provisions of the Bill are broad enough to include every one whose operations may be inimical to the best interests of the community. The first thing a trust does is to reduce the price of the article, and when its monopoly has been thoroughly established, to raise the price again, or to put on the market goods of an inferior quality, or perhaps do both&#39;. I think I have succeeded in showing that any consideration which a trust, local or foreign, may extend to the consumer, will not necessarily be of a permanent character. The experience of other countries has been that a reduction in price, which has evidently been made for the purpose of securing a monopoly, has invariably been followed, either by an increase in the cost of the goods, or a reduction in their value, or both. We must assume that a similar result will follow the efforts which are at present being made in one particular direction in Australia. Surely free-traders and protectionists alike - because . I maintain that this question is a non-party one - must recognise that they owe a duty to the Commonwealth at large, and not to any particular section of it. We have, by our legislation, given certain assistance to the chief of our producing and manufacturing interests, and we are now entitled to consider the interests of the consumer&#39;. I contend that if this Bill be passed in anything like its present form, it will extend a substantial protection to the consumer, who, hitherto, has benefited only in. an indirect fashion. There is one other point to which I desire to direct special attention. I have already spoken&#39; of the methods which are adopted by various combines. I wish to point out that a most reprehensible practice is being adopted in this State by one of these combinations. The company in question deals with agriculturists, and endeavours to sell its machines upon the best terms. Those terms in a very great number of cases include a mortgage upon the land of the agriculturist. This mortgage, I would point out, is npt held by any local corporation. It frequently happens that the mortgaged lands fall - as they may easily do in time of drought into the hands of this company, which has no home or abiding place in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- This is a very serious matter, and may have the most untoward effect upon the development of our agricultural industries. In regard to local monopolies, I may mention that some years ago, as a member of the Victorian Parliament, I made inquiries into the methods adopted by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. I found that that company, owing to the power which it then possessed of securing different prices for its product in the various States, was able to amass a considerable profit year by year. In addition to having a monopoly of the trade in refined sugar,, it was able, at the beginning of a sugar season, to compel the growers of Queensland to accept a certain price for their cane, irrespective of the yield. </para>

                            <para>- If the Minister&#39;s opinion be correct, I sincerely hope that before the measure leaves this Chamber it will be made to apply to every combine which is inimical to the interests of the consumer. The tobacco monopoly, which does extend beyond the -borders of individual States, and which, to mv own knowledge, has secured the trade of Australia in a way that would not be permitted under this Bill, has a very simple, but most effective, method of securing its profits. It is a most effective combination, because it embraces both manufacturers and importers. Let us suppose that a distributor in a country town desires to obtain a supply of a particular brand of tobacco, which he finds that his customers fancy - and we know that there are no persons who are more fanciful in their tastes than those who drink liquor and smoke tobacco - and. that he applies to the head office for, say, five boxes of that tobacco, which we will assume is called the &#34;Mary Brown&#34; brand. He immediately receives a letter stating that, unfortunately, there is no tobacco of this brand in stock. He then asks if the combine can supply him with even a couple of boxes to meet immediate requirements. To that communication a similar answer is made, but he is informed that the combine has another brand of equal quality in stock at a price of 3d. per lb. less,, and1, eventually, he finds himself compelled to purchase it. Under such circumstances I contend that both the consumer and the distributor are absolutely in the power of the combine. Nobody outside it either imports or manufactures these particular tobaccoes. The honorable member for North Sydney has asked why this information was not given to the Select Committee which is inquiring into the question of the tobacco- monopoly. The explanation, to my mind, is very simple. The distributors are entirely dependent for their supplies upon the combine, and is it likely that they will give information against it? </para>

                            <para>- I recognise that the advocates of free and unrestricted competition have had some justification for the views which they hold. But I fail to see how any free-trader can oppose a Bill of this character, which is intended to break down monopoly and to substitute for it a healthy competition. The sole object of combines and trusts is to obliterate competition, and, therefore, the true freetrader must support a Bill which has for its object the annihilation of such bodies. </para>

                            <para>- No. I do not for a moment admit the justice of the honorable member&#39;s definition of the term &#34;protectionist.&#34; We have been told that the quality of an article will indicate the likelihood of its survival. I have already shown that in the case of one article, at least, that is not so. It has been said that this Bill is intended to prohibit importation - that it marks a further advance in the protective policy of the Commonwealth. I deny that. It is a Bill which is intended to prohibit unfair competition, and that term has been clearly defined. Under it dumping will be prohibited. That is where the prohibition comes in. This Bill will prohibit the dumping of the products of other countries at a price below their value, to the detriment of the established industries of the Commonwealth, and it will also prohibit the initiation of unfair competition which would result in the destruction of local industries. Dumping is prohibited in the interests of the three classes of the community who are specially mentioned in the Bill, namely, the producers, the workers, and the consumers. I feel sure that every honorable member will admit that although the dumping of cheap goods may confer a temporary benefit upon those who use them, it is almost invariably followed by opposite results. The dumping of cheap goods means the destruction of local industries, and the destruction of those industries must eventually place those using articles so produced entirely at the mercy of the importer. In my opinion, the principle of this measure must be affirmed. The honorable member for North. Sydney, with that extensive and successful business experience which he possesses - an experience of which this House has been glad from time to time to avail itself - must feel that there is some demand in Australia for a Bill of this character. I feel sure that his extensive knowledge of the commercial world will lead him to recognise that there is growing up in Australia a tendency among the great suppliers of the community to combine. They find it to their advantage to do so. No one knows that better than does my honorable friend. Although he may consider that some of the provisions of the Bill are too drastic, I am confident that the principle involved will be affirmed by him; that, as a free-trader, he is in favour of doing away with practices which can tend only to lessen fair and healthy competition. I am satisfied that his fiscal beliefs lead him often in the direction of securing that there shall be that proper trade rivalry which we are told must result to the advantage of all concerned. In these circumstances, I am sure that he will be found -.supporting the second reading of the Bill. Although he may be prepared in Committee to propose certain amendments, I fail to understand how he and those who think with him could at the present juncture offer any serious objection to the motion for the second reading. As I have said, the principle must be affirmed ; Australia must not be the exploiting ground of the dumper. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member will pardon me if I do not reply to his interjections, vociferous though they may be, since I should not for one moment endeavour to prove anything to his satisfaction. We have heard of the one juryman who complained of the obstinacy of his eleven fellow jurors, and I feel sure that in such a position my honorable friend would be found in the minority. I am not going to attempt to prove anything to him; but I ask him to accept my assurance that my desire is to prevent the creeping into Australia of those abuses which most people admit exist in great industrial countries. We hope to make Australia a great industrial centre, and, that being our desire, we must see to it, at the outset; that we do not allow to fasten upon our industrial life such a vampire as the combine has proved itself to be in older countries. As a protectionist, I believe that protection should be of a triple character; it should protect, not only the manufacturer, but the operative and the consumer. This Bill will afford protection to the consumer, by breaking up trusts and combines which&#39; act against his interests, as well as against those of the country generally. </para>

                    <para class="block">Apparently the Board is to inquire into the profits made by importers, and to punish a man if lie sells at a loss. It is no uncommon tiling for a  merchant to make large purchases, and then find that he is. being forestalled j but, under the Bill, if such a man is compelled to sell at a loss, he will be liable to a penalty. Throughout, the measure is most unjust to both traders and consumers. If its provisions were strictly enforced, tens of thousands of men engaged in the importation and distribution of goods would be thrown out of employment, while the consumers* - who are chiefly working people, who have nothing but their weekly earnings to depend oh - would suffer by the reduction of the purchasing power of their wages. I hope that the Labour Party will think twice before supporting the Bill. Every free-trader wishes to see manufactures established, and it is easy to establish industries which are native to the country. Such industries must be established, and will give a great deal of employment. &#39; But competition is necessary to keep manufacturers- up-to-date in their methods, and to prevent the public from being imposed on. Our manufacturers will be able to compete with fair success against those of America and the Continent, just as the manufacturers of Sydney were able, bv using up-to-date machinery, and following good business methods, to compete successfully with the manufacturers of Victoria during the period when New South Wales was enjoying free-trade. </para>

                            <para>- Every industry must become large before it can be successful. Does the honorable member think that this Bill has been introduced in the interests of the small manufacturer, the man and the boy ? In this century the man and the boy cannot compete against large factories, whose profits enable them to pay good wages, and thus obtain the best workmen ; while they are also equipped with the most up-to-date machinery. Then an importer or seller of imported goods is not &#171; give to an agent or intermediary a disproportionately large reward, or remuneration, for selling or recommending those goods. </para>

                    <para class="block">Apparently, if a merchant pays his agents well, he is to be punished for so doing. I do not think that it can be the intention of Parliament that men should be punished for paying high wages to induce brains and enterprise to enter their service. I could occupy a considerable amount of time in pointing out the unfairness of the provisions of the measure, but, as I think that the Bill will be dropped, and will come before us again in some other session, I intend to reserve my remarks for another occasion. I certainly counsel the Minister to drop it. He has had an opportunity to announce to the public that he is in favour of anti-trust legislation. I, too, am in favour of such legislation,- but I have shown why I cannot support this measure. If, as the honorable member for Laanecoorie stated, the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is filching from the planters the bounties which we pay, let that be stopped, and, similarly, let us put an end to any proved abuses in connexion with the tobacco trade; but do not let us pass abominable provisions which will cripple industry, reduce wages, and ruin thousands of men. It is our duty to help the workers to get as much as they can for their money, and to improve the standard of living, and. therefore, I hope that when the measure is brought forward next session the objectionable provisions to which I have referred will be expunged, and that it will be such as I can support. </para>

                        <para>- Every honorable member who has looked carefully into the Bill, that is, as carefully as the very brief opportunity which has been given to us has allowed, must recognise that, however good its object, its provisions extend into the channels of commerce to a degree which we cannot yet appreciate. Its effects upon, not only importers, but some of our manufacturing industries, and, consequently, upon the workers, are likely to be so great, and, in some cases, so evil, that we should give the matter our fullest attention, and allow the full light of public opinion, and of expert opinion, to be brought to bear upon it, before we come to a decision. The Bill seems one of those measures which we have been recently called upon to consider, possessing one or two very bacl features. We have been attempting by legislation to exercise by a side wind, powers which were deliberately withheld from us bv those who framed the Constitution, and we have created enormous instruments for the purpose of effecting comparatively small purposes. It is now proposed to use a steam-hammer in order to straighten a pin. The only case of importance, so far as imported goods are concerned, which has suggested the desirability of dealing with trusts, is one which affects a single manufacturer in our midst, and I ask whether we are to allow one firm to dominate Parliament to the extent of inducing us to rush through, after only a few hours&#39; consideration, a measure affecting, not only a particular enterprise, but all the industries of the Commonwealth? I would rather see a measure introduced providing merely that no harvesters shall be imported into Australia. We are being asked to create an enormous instrument, which may have influences the results of which we cannot conceive, and which may be used in a manner which we cannot anticipate, in order to effect one comparatively small result. I would also point out that we have appointed a Royal Commission, which is doing its work with extreme care, for the very purpose sf considering what should be done in connexion with those of our industries which are affected by the operation of the Tariff. That Commission could have this matter referred to it, and, indeed, it has power to consider this question without any special authority from us. We are ignoring the Commission altogether, and I think that we are thereby paying a. very poor compliment to gentlemen who were induced to undertake a very difficult task. We are proposing to take out of their hands a matter upon which we need the very fullest information, and we are, in effect, saying that we have not sufficient confidence in them to permit them to inquire into it. The Minister seems to be very confident with regard to the measure and its probable effects. I know something about trade, commerce, and manufactures, and I confess that it is very difficult for me, with my knowledge and experience, to form a conclusion as to the probable effects of the measure, and as to the injuries it may inflict, not merely upon importers, but upon the industries of the Commonwealth. The Minister quoted certain legislation in other countries as affording him warrant for the introduction of the Bill. I would ask, however, whether he can point to any laws of other countries which contain provisions similar to those embodied in the first portion of the Bill ? </para>

                            <para>- I am sure that the Minister can find no precedent for the. most dangerous provisions of this measure. In quoting the United States and Canadian laws as his authorities, the Minister overlooked the fact that he has departed from those laws, and has reversed the very principles upon, which they are based. The United States law is intended to prevent restraint of trade, and to debar trusts from exercising control of the markets, and levying excessive prices upon the consumers. </para>

                            <para>- It has not achieved much good so far, but the object is to prevent trusts from improperly controlling the market, in other words, to take out of their hands the power which they are exercising - a power which properly belongs to the Government of the country - of taxing the people for their own benefit. The money raised by taxes levied by the Government is spent in the interests of the whole people, whereas the profits derived by the trusts are devoted to the advantage of a few persons. The United States Government are not concerned as to whether the trusts are making a profit or as to whether the people who distribute the goods are making a profit. Their object is to prevent the consumer from being excessively taxed. I am thoroughly in agreement with legislation which effectually brings about such a result. Then the Canadian law is, in one important respect, different entirely from the measure before us. One portion of that law was adopted for the declared purpose of preventing the excess output of manufactures elsewhere from being dumped upon the Canadian market, and sold at cost, or a shade under cost. That law may be put in force whenever the Ministry thinks fit. It has been acknowledged by some of the Canadian statesmen that the principal effect of that law has been to act as a warning against such importations into Canada. </para>

                            <para>- The Canadian Act has been enforced in very few, if any, cases, and it is very difficult for the Canadian Government to give effect to it. The other portion of the Canadian law provides that where trusts are levying excessive prices and making excessive profits, the Government shall be able to declare that the protection given to their&#34; industry by means of Customs duties shall be removed. That is entirely opposed to the principle adopted in the Bill. The Government propose that the protection shall remain, and that an additional and extraordinary power shall be conferred upon them. If there is any interference with an Australian trust - or it may be a State trust with which this Bill could not interfere </para>

                            <para>- The matter requires time for consideration. Trusts which confine their operations to one State cannot be affected by this legislation. The Canadian system of dealing with such a case would be to remove the protection afforded to the industry by means of the Customs duties. Nothing of that kind is proposed here. What is aimed at? There may be importations which affect the output of a State trust, the representatives of which may represent to the Minister that if he allows the competition to continue, they will be compelled to reduce the wages of their workmen. Under such circumstances, a Board would be appointed to enable that trust to maintain its position by imposing a prohibition on the imports of its opponents. . That is an entirely opposite method to that which is adopted in the Canadian Act, quoted by the Minister. No parallel can be found in any legislation in the world for many of the provisions contained in the first part of the Bill. In clause 3 a most audacious attempt is made to establish the claim that the Bill has been introduced to benefit the workers, producers, and consumers. That is a very good placard. How the measure will affect the interests of manufacturers and their employes we cannot tell; but I know that it may affect them very detrimentally. We are all aware that in the various channels of trade and manufacture the finished product of one industry is very frequently the raw material of another. All products can be dealt with under this Bill. How will it affect some of our industries if their raw materials are so raised in price that it is difficult for them to supply even the markets of Australia, and impossible for them to enter into competition with the outside world ? That is a possibility with which we are confronted in connexion with this Bill. There are some provisions in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of sub-clause 1 of clause 4. and in paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">c</inline> in subclause 2 of the same clause, which show how this measure is intended to be applied, and how very injurious its operation may be. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of sub-clause  1  says: - </para>

                    <para>I cannot conceive how even a protectionist can support some of these provisions. In the previous Parliament the theories of free-trade and protection were argued threadbare. I am not going to repeat the operation, so that honorable members need not be alarmed by my reference to the subjects. The protectionists have always claimed that they do not wish to establish in Australia industries which, for a variety of reasons, are unstated to our conditions. </para>

                            <para>- People will enter into industries which for various reasons are not suited to Australia. What will follow? &#39;Finding that they cannot compete successfully without lowering the wages of their employes, they will point out that fact to the Minister, and&#39; thereupon the matter will be referred to. a Board. If the spirit of the Bill be given effect to, that Board will declare that the importation of &#39; the goods competing with that industry should7&#34; be prohibited. We have also to remember that some firms might not be able to carry on successfully because of the lack of ability which characterizes their business management. If such firms were allowed to approach the Minister, and!, exhibiting their balance-sheets, to say, &#34; Look at the losses which we are sustaining. Our only resort is a reduction in the wages of our employes, if we are to balance our profit and loss account,&#34; the Minister - who cannot possibly enter into the question of whether or not their management is good - might remit the question to a Board, which would inquire into it. with the result that the goods manufactured by firms in foreign parts might be excluded. I can give a specific instance of what may happen in New South Wales if this measure becomes law. Honorable members will recollect that when there was a duty of d. per gallon upon kerosene in that State, the local kerosene shale, of which there were large quantities, was used for the extraction of oil. At two places in that State large refineries were established for the purpose of turning out considerable quantities of kerosene oil. Naturally, it is impossible for a company which has to produce oil from shale by means of a costly process of retorting to compete with oil which nature sends forth from wells. When the duty was reduced, and finally abolished, these companies had to abandon their refining operations, and to limit themselves to the mining of their shale for various purposes, such as gas-making. </para>

                            <para>- They make crude oils principally for lubricating purposes, but they have ceased to produce refined! oil. This Parliament, with the approval of the Labour Party, has decided that, in the interests of the public,, and especially of the poorer classes, it is undesirable to impose a tax upon kerosene, notwithstanding that it would be -productive of a large revenue. If the companies to which I have referred resume refining operations when this Bill be passed, I can easily imagine that the next step taken by -them will be to form a deputation to wait upon the Minister, with a view to pointing out that, in the absence of the exclusion of oils from oversea, they cannot carry on the industry successfully unless they pay beggarly wages. Thus this Bill will afford an opportunity for the Minister, through the Board, to act in absolute opposition to the express decision of Parliament, and, by excluding the cheaper foreign article, to impose a tax upon the people of Australia, not one penny of which will find its way into the Commonwealth Treasury. Then let me take another case. Let us suppose that a machine is. being made in Australia, and that a similar machine is being imported. An improvement might be effected in the implement which would reduce its cost, and&#34; at the same time confer a great saving upon the user of it. That might exclude the imported article, which would be quite right. </para>

Under such circumstances, there would be. a danger of the Minister concluding that he should exclude the foreign-made article, and thus our producers would be denied the advantage of securing a lessening of the cost of production, which would be of assistance to them in their competition with the world. In fact, in a variety of ways, this Bill proposes to increase the cost of articles, to the producer and also to the consumer. It may affect the cost of living in every household, and especially in those which can least afford to bear an increase. Then, it is_ provided in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">d</inline> of sub-clause  2,  that -  if the imported goods have been purchased abroad at prices greatly below their ordinary cost of production, where produced, or market price where purchased. </para>

                            <para>- I do not say that. I have already said that I am in favour of preventing trusts obtaining huge profits out of the community by means of the power they secure over certain commodities. But I would say, with President Roosevelt, that we should be very careful in dealing with beneficial combinations which result in the production of goods at a much lower cost, to the advantage of the public. </para>

                            <para>- I do not say that the evils in question are hypothetical, but I hold that the provisions of the Bill, may be so described since they do not - and possibly could not - distinctly declare what is to be done to cope with the evil. It is to be left largely to the Comptroller-General, or the Minister, to decide what action shall be taken, and to that extent the provisions of the Bill are hypothetical. </para>

                            <para>- I never dreamt of any one having the vivid imagination necessary to lead to the introduction of such a provision. Indeed, the whole clause is the result of a vivid imagination. It requires a stretch of the imagination -to believe that we can benefit the consumer by telling a man who is selling goods lo raise his prices. The course I have outlined may be followed, even if no local industry be affected. </para>

                            <para>- I do not intend to speak at undue length. After providing that the importer shall get a good profit, which must result in the price to the consumer being increased, the clause goes on to declare that the importer shall not pay too much to his agents, and consequently reduce the price of the goods. That is an extraordinary position. I wonder what department of life will be free from our legislation very soon. The Government propose to see that no traveller or representative of a firm gets too much salary. </para>

                            <para>- That interjection gives an explanation of the provision which we did not receive from the Minister. Is this an indirect method of preventing the payment of commissions to buyers? We have already passed a law to prohibit practices of that sort, and now, apparently, the Ministry wishes to pass another law to do exactly the same thing. Agents, however, could pay commissions to buyers which would not come out of their salary, but would be paid by their principals; the Bill would not prevent that. All that it provides is that the Government shall see that travellers and representatives of firms are not paid salaries which are too high. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member says that he wants to destroy foreign trade. That is a frank, straight-out, candid admission ; but a Bill of twelve lines would do that. All that would be necessary to secure that object would be to provide that no goods shall be imported into Australia. Clause 5 is a sort of drag-net provision, but, as it really embraces the matters to which I have referred, I shall not deal with it specially. The second portion of the Bill is a measure to deal with trusts or combines. I have already said that I would support an effective measure to deal with trusts or combines injuriously affecting the public, but I do not wish to prevent the beneficial effects of industrial combinations. These combinations are often of benefit to a nation, inasmuch as, by cheapening the cost of production, they enable its producers to reach markets which would otherwise not be available to them. Then they are beneficial when they reduce prices to the public of the country in which they operate. Therefore, a distinct line must be drawn between combinations which are beneficial and those which are injurious to the community. I am ready to support legislation which would be effective for the suppression of injurious trusts and combines, but I do not think that the Bill will be effective for that purpose. Its provisions could be evaded in many ways. The first set of provisions are drastic, and could be made effective largely because there are no exceptions. Although they could never be applied fairly, because they are too drastic and tyrannical ; if they were applied honestly they might be effective, because there are no exemptions. But all traders are exempt from the operation of the second part of the Bill unless they are proved to be combinations or trusts. No sufficient distinction is made between combinations which are harmful and combinations which are beneficial. </para>

                            <para>- I think that the Attorney-General would have to apply for it first. This second part will be, in many cases, ineffective, inasmuch as the Constitution will not enable us to deal with trusts whose operations are confined to any one State. Consequently, it will be difficult for us to reach any trust because, by a process of subdivision, each trust can operate solely within a State, distinct from any similar trust in another State, except that many shareholders may have an interest in two or more of them. These provisions require a great deal of careful consideration. They may do a great deal of harm, and I do not think that they will prove fully effective for the end in view. The provisions of the United States law, which the Minister has described as more drastic than those contained in the Bill, have, so far, proved ineffective, and I think that; in dealing with detrimental trusts, we should require to do something more than has been attempted in America. I do not mean that we should adopt more drastic provisions, but that we should resort to more effective measures. For this reason, the matter requires the fullest consideration. and I think that we should avail ourselves of all the information that can possibly be brought to bear upon it. All wisdom and experience is not represented by Parliament, and we ought to afford those who are most likely to be affected by such a measure to give us the benefit of their knowledge and experience. The Imperial Parliament long ago recognised the necessity for adopting such a course in regard to measures relating to commerce and indus- try.. They refer such Bills to a Grand Committee. They have recognised the danger of hurrying through legislation without the fullest inquiry. Whilst we have 110 Grand Committee here, we should not attempt, in the closing hours of the session, to pass through a Bill which could fittingly occupy our closest attention during the recess. When the Minister was moving the second reading of the Bill, I asked him how he would be able to reach persons outside Australia. Clause 12 provides - that the doing of any act outside Australia which would if done within Australia be an offence against either of the two preceding sections - shall be regarded as an offence, and shall be punishable accordingly. There would be no way of punishing any person outside of Australia except by stopping their goods at the Customs House. The Minister said that the Attorney-General would find a way, but he did not seem to know anything about tha matter himself. The honorable member for Parramatta referred to the Board in the first portion of the Bill, the provisions of which apply very arbitrarily and drastically, not merely to combinations, but to every firm in Australia. The Minister can refer any question arising under these provisions of the Bill to a Board, which will convey its decision to the Minister, who can then prohibit the importation of any goods he may chose. He could entirely stop the trade of any firm or individual. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ; but the provision as to the prohibition of imports is only intended to meet the case of deleterious goods, or to importations which are not legitimate. This measure, however, proposes to extend the power of the Minister to all classes of goods. If a manufacturer managed to _ purchase abroad some of his raw, material at exceptionally cheap rates, the goods might be stopped at the Customs House, and the importer punished. These powers relate to individuals and firms not acting in combination. Trusts, however, will have the right to appeal to the Courts. It is because they have more money to fight their cases, they will have an opportunity afforded to them to employ leading counsel to subject the law to the most searching test? The trusts are kindly provided for, but the individual or firm which is not in any combination is to be simply snuffed out at the will of a Board or a Minister. </para>

                            <para>- Yes j but in view of the complicated process that may have to be gone through, the manufacturer might be ruined before he saw the end of it. No Board should have a right to decide matters of such importance. In the first place, difficulty would be experienced in securing the services of disinterested men who knew anything about the subject. I would rather have disinterested men who knew nothing, than well-informed men who would be guided by their own interests. Enormous issues would be involved in some cases, and a man might be deprived by the decision of the Board from continuing his business, or from earning his living in the industry to which he had been brought up. </para>

                            <para>- It would recommend what should be done with the goods. The New Zealand Act does hot confer powers such as the Minister proposes to take, arid, moreover, it deals only with trusts and combinations, which, under this measure, &#39; will have &#39; the right to appeal to the Courts. The Minister&#39;s proposal is a departure from the New Zealand legislation. Now, it has been said that we should trust the Minister and the Administration. Even though, by a wild flight of imagination, we could conceive that we had to-day the ablest and most honest Ministry that ever sat, or ever will sit, upon the Treasury benches, we should have no right to pass legislation of this kind which would place unheard-of powers in the hands of Ministries yet unborn. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable members are supposed to look a long way ahead, and they certainly should not be prepared to surrender to Ministers powers which might be used in such a way as to override the decision of Parliament. Parliament should reserve to itself the power which Ministers seek to exercise under the Bill. The Bill would confer more authority upon Ministers than that which can be exercised under the Tariff. It could be used more effectively to prohibit the importation of goods, to penalize manufacturers, to injure workmen, and to tax the consumer. When Parliament will not give Ministers power to create a Tariff, surely they ought to keep in their own hands powers such as those which are sought under the Bill. We decided only a few days ago that even duties which had been, as regards their amount, approved of by Parliament should not be imposed without reference 10 the Legislature. Such duties would not exclude, but only to some extent restrict, imports, and yet it is now proposed that we should give Ministers absolute power to exclude any goods. It has been said that the Bill was introduced in its present form in order to avoid the necessity of raising the fiscal question, but I would point out that this measure opens up every line of the Tariff. Therefore, it becomes the duty of honorable members to consider the duties line by line, and to decide whether they are sufficient for the purpose of restriction, and whether certain goods should not be exempted from the operation of the Bill. Many of the existing duties were avowedly imposed for the special purpose of restricting imports, and assisting local manufacturers. When we are asked to place in the hands of the Minister the power to prohibit the importation of goods, we may have to consider every line of the Tariff, in order to ascertain whether any particular article is already sufficiently protected to render the first portion of this Bill unnecessary in regard to it. </para>

                            <para>- That would not meet the difficulty which has been raised by the Minister himself. He stated that if a case occurred under this Bill in Western Australia, a Board would be appointed there, implying that the other States had no interest whatever in the decision given by that body. Need I point out to him that although the particular industry affected may be confined to one State, the whole of Australia may be seriously interested in the result? Take the kerosene industry in New South Wales, to which I have already alluded, as an example. If the companies that were formerly engaged in that industry resume operations, they may raise an objection to the free importation of kerosene upon the ground that it prevents them from paying proper wages. A Board would thereupon be appointed, consisting of three gentlemen representing New South Wales only. Would that be fair to the other States? As a result of the Board&#39;s decision, every household throughout the Commonwealth might be taxed, by being called upon to pay a higher price for its kerosene. I say that the people have a right to be heard in this matter through their representatives in Parliament, and consequently Ave should provide that no prohibition should be imposed upon any class of imports until after an address in favour of that step has been adopted by both Houses of the Legislature. I do think that there is vast danger under this Bill, not merely to the importers of Australia, but also to certain manufacturers, and consequently to the men whom they employ, as well as to the poorer class of consumers. The House would not place in the hands of the Minister the imposition of a few duties, and are we to place in his hands the terrible weapon of prohibition? I do think that before that course is unnecessarily entered upon - because .we can deal with trusts and combines without going to such extremes- </para>

I recognise the difficulty of doing that, but I am not prepared to adopt a course which will hit at a great deal that is legitimate, and accomplish something which may be detrimental to our producers. Of course, I recognise that a great deal depends upon administration. </para>

                            <para>- A protectionist or a free-trader could administer this Act in such a way as to favour his particular fiscal belief. I claim that Parliament should not abandon its power to absolutely prohibit imports in favour of the exercise of the mere opinion or whim of a Minister. That is the position which I take up, and I say that this Bill cannot be examined too closely by either its friends or its opponents, because if it is not able to withstand criticism it* should not be placed upon our statute-book. It is one of the most far-reaching measures that the Commonwealth Parliament has been invited to consider. Consequently, opportunity ought to be given for its full consideration, not only by members of this House, but also by those who are interested outside. The light of their opinion should be shed upon it before we finally pass it. </para>

                        <para>. -I quite share the opinion of the honorable member for North Sydney regarding the importance and far-reaching character of this Bill. It is intended to be far-reaching, because the evils that it is designed to cope with are of a like nature, lt is designed to prevent the establishment in this community of the evils to which I refer, and fo bring about their eradication at this early stage of their career. I propose to the best of my ability to show how far the measure goes, without discussing details which may be better analyzed in Committee. I intend to state why, in my opinion, it  does not go one step further than it should. I admit at once that it is quite possible to carry, the measure further, and I can understand the views of some honorable members, who are quite at one with us upon the necessity which exists for coping with trusts, and who would like to see the Bill extended in various directions. Matters of that character can best be considered in Committee, and I. have no doubt that any suggestions which are intended to make the measure more effective will receive sympathetic consideration at the hands of my colleague, the Minister of Trade and Customs. I have listened with&#34; great attention to the arguments advanced bv some honorable members opposite against the Bill, and I must say frankly that those, arguments lead me to the conclusion that they are opposed to the enactment of any such measure. </para>

                            <para>- I am sure that my honorable friend will avail himself of an opportunity, presently to express his own views. I do not regard this as a fiscal measure. .1 regard it as one that puts &#34;to us tha question : &#39; &#39;Are we going to defend Australian industries - Australian industries of every kind - or are we going to expose them to the aggression of those who care nothing for Australia except for the profit they can make out of it?&#34; If, unfortunately , we were to find some evilly-disposed persons bringing into Australia some instruments of destruction which would enable them to level our factories tq the ground, injure physically our operatives, and bind our citizens to their will, I am sure that this Parliament would not have the slightest hesitation in taking prompt and energetic measures against them. If the same ends can be achieved by devious methods, or bv what are, in some respects, ordinary business methods, what is to be done? If our factories can be destroyed, if our primary and secondary industries can be undermined - and, just as the Americans have done, we &#34;seek by this Bill to protect not only the secondary but the primary industries - if by all the means that are known to huge capitalistic enterprises, this can be done without check or hindrance, then nearly all our legislative: undertakings and all the paraphernalia of our Parliaments and Government.&#39;, are worthless. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable and learned member is rather excited. I do not know why he should be. The matter is one that approaches more closely ...... does any other the determination, of whether we are to have a White Australia. lt is not a question of whether we are to have protection. T.his Bill is not designed for the benefit of either the producers, the workers, or the consumers alone. It is designed for the benefit of no two of those sections of the community. It is for the benefit of the whole of the people. It is expressly stated on the face of the Bill, that it is for the benefit of the united whole. I am going to prove to those who are open to consider this matter from an impartial stand-point, that my observations under this head are justly founded on the wording, intent, and effect of the Bill. Honorable members have said that it has been introduced late in the session. It is a matter of regret on the part of the Government that is has been introduced so late, but that is not our fault. We have had a great deal of work to attend to. I am not going to pass any reflection upon any party in the House, but I do say that it is not the fault of the Government that we have not been able to devote an extra fortnight to the consideration of this measure. Although it is a matter for regret that we did not introduce this Bill at an earlier period, the way to overcome any shortcoming in that regard is by refusing to go into recess without having enacted the measure. </para>

                            <para>- I should not object to a relevant question, or to any interjection that might tend to the elucidation of any point in doubt, but when we have interjection after interjection, having nothing to do with the question before us. it is somewhat disconcerting. We are all anxious to end the session, and to return to our homes. We are anxious to take the opportunity of enjoying the coming holiday ; but the Government feel a great responsibility upon them. We have something more than our own personal convenience to consider. We must not forget that, if our view regarding the necessity of the Bill be correct, there are tens of thousands who will regard the prorogation with something like dismay, if it happens before we have done something to assist them. That is a far more serious consideration than can be any desire on the part of honorable members to hurry away from their legislative duties within the next few days. I am going to ask- honorable members to 01n , with me in determining this question finally. The Government. as I have said, feel a. great responsibility upon them, and we must do all that we can to remedy the evil. </para>

                            <para>- We discovered it- a long time ago. But we have had to deal with very serious measures. Then, again, it has not been an easy matter to frame the Bill. The work has been one for serious consideration. This Bill has not been framed without our examining evidence to a very large extent, and more than that, I may_ say that some of the considerations which my honorable friends opposite have advanced, as to the nature of the tribunal for which provision is made in this Bill, have received very serious attention at our hands. It was the intention of the Ministry to provide that the Judge of the Federal Arbitration Court should sit in this tribunal. As a matter of fact, we asked that learned gentleman to undertake the duty, and I must say for him that he was most willing to do so, but that it seemed to him that the issues to be dealt with were not matters for judicial decision. He felt that they were beyond the line of judicial determination ; that they embraced to some extent matters that were in some respects outside the ordinary range of a Judge&#39;s duty, and might bring the investigation of the tribunal into what might be regarded as the region of politics. </para>

                            <para>-- No. The awards of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court are in the nature of judicial determinations, and those awards are carried out. The presiding Justice has not to report to a Minister. His determination is strictly a judicial one, and is always regarded as such. But the tribunal provided for in this Bill will be of a different nature, and as the desire of the Government could not be otherwise carried out, we had to resort to the system followed 11 New Zealand, and provide for a Board. </para>

All that we could expect, either from a Federal or a State Judge, would be the examination of the matter submitted to him, and the f urnishing of a report upon the facts. The Minister, subject to his responsibility to Parliament - subject, indeed, to the responsibility of the whole Government to Parliament - will decide what steps shall be taken. We have done all that we can in that direction, and no charge may properly be levelled at the Government in respect to the tribunal named in the Bill. </para>

Surely the giving of a judicial decision in a criminal case - a case that may be dealt with by a Court - should not be the duty of a Board. The position is entirely different from a matter which is simply one for Ministerial action. It has been suggested that this Bill is drastic, and that there is no need for it. I have already addressed to the House some observations in that regard. Some honorable members have said that there is no evidence whatever that the International Harvester Company is a trust ; some honorable members have said that it is an ordinary company ; that it is not in the ordinary sense a trust possessed of enormous power; that it is not invested with those attributes which would cause it to be regarded in America as a trust. The evidence as to the nature of this company is altogether overwhelming. </para>

In America there is an Inter- State Commerce Commission, which had recently to consider the position of the International Harvester Company in connexion with railway rates and other matters; and in the tenth volume of its report, at page 386 and subsequent pages, it makes some observations which, I think, will convince honorable members and the community as to the position and status of this company - </para>

                        <para>The International Harvester Company was organized in 1902, apparently for the purpose of consolidating under one management several concerns previously engaged in the manufacture of farm machinery. It &#39; took over and is now operating the Deering Harvester Company, the McCormick Harvester Company, the Piano Company, the South Chicago Furnace Company, and perhaps others. In this discussion the McCormick division of the International Harvester Company will be known as the McCormick Company, and the Piano division as the Piano Company. The International Harvester Company now has the same interest in the Illinois Northern Railroad and the Chicago, West Pullman, and Southern Railroad, which the McCormick Company and the Piano Company formerly had, respectively. The Illinois Northern Railroad Company was incorporated in 1901, under the laws of the State of Illinois, with a capital stock of $500,000. While this capital stock did originally, and perhaps does to-day, stand in the names of various individuals, it was entirely paid for by cash furnished by the McCormick Company, was entirely owned by that Company down to the time of its absorption by the International Harvester Company, and is to-day the property of the latter company. </para>
                        <para>Whatever has been said with respect to the Illinois Northern, applies equally to the Chicago, West Pullman, and Southern. </para>
                        <para>The International Harvester Company owns these two railroads. Its officials are the officials of those roads in most instances. It absolutely controls the operations of the roads, as well as the routing of its own traffic. </para>
                        <para>The International Harvester Company owns the Illinois Northern Railroad. Whatever profit accrues to that railroad inures to the benefit of the Harvester Company, its owner, alone. When any one of these lines leading from Chicago to the Missouri River pays to the Illinois Northern Railroad Company $12.00 for the performance of a switching service, which is worth reasonably but $3.00, it gives to the International Harvester Company, the shipper of that carload of merchandise,$9.00. If these divisions, which have been in effect since January, 1904; are legal, there is no practical limit to the extent to which the lines granting them may prefer the International Harvester Company over other shippers. </para>

                    <para>The Illinois Northern Railroad Company and the International Harvester Company are one and the same thing. It is entirely immaterial whether this money goes in the first instance into the treasury of the International Harvester Company or that of its creature, the Illinois Northern Railroad Company. </para>
                    <para>The question presented by the operations of the Chicago, West Pullman,&#34; and Southern Railroad differs from that involved in those of the Illinois Northern, in that the International Harvester Company owns a controlling interest in the West Pullman Company, but has not the entire ownership. ... In the case before us, while other parties are in reality interested, the International Harvester Company is, without doubt, the overshadowing factor. </para>
                    <para>The Chicago, Lake Shore, and Eastern, as found, is the creature of the United States Steel Corporation. The questions presented by its operations differ from those already discussed, chiefly in that the practices are of longer continuance and of wider scope. The International Harvester Company, through the medium of its railroads, obtains no divisions whatever from eastern lines ;but the United States Steel Corporation, with its greater power, has been able to force from eastern connexions divisions on all business. The International Harvester Company has not yet been able to compel the railroads which handle its traffic to maintain its tracks, or perform its switching service within its iron working plant at South Chicago ; but the Illinois Steel Company has for the last eight years obtained from the railways transporting its traffic compensation for the maintenance and operation of the miles of track which are located within its private works. In this respect the Steel Trust, to use the popular expression, is as far in advance of the Harvester Trust as the latter company is ahead of the ordinary shipper. </para>

But when the company found that the Minister of Trade and Customs was firm in his determination to increase the valuations at which these machines were entered for duty, it reduced its selling price to&#163;70 for one machine, &#163;60 for two, and&#163;50 for three. Is there any other explanation for that reduction than that the company is determined to oust the Australian manufacturer at all costs, and, no doubt, if successful, would, when it got the market to itself, put up the price again to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;81 ?</inline></para>

I am as strongly opposed to Australian as to other combines, and in the second part of the Bill the same penalties are imposed on Australian as on foreign trusts. I do not pretend to know all the ramifications of the methods adopted by these companies, but my information has been obtained from well-known and irreproachable sources. If the statements which have been made are not true, the real facts can be demonstrated by those from whom an explanation is sought. It will be seen by referring to the Bill, however, that those who wish to attack these trusts have four fences to get over before they can succeed. </para>

But if the Comptroller-General of Customs, the Minister, the Board, and the whole Government determine, on the evidence placed before them, that importations are injuring an industry whose preservation is advantageous to all sections of the community, they will do a great deal to prevent its destruction. If the industry is of advantage to the community, it behoves us, as a Parliament, to see that it is not destroyed by unfair competition. When we have decided that it is an industry of that advantageous nature, what is the next point to be borne in mind ? We have next to consider &#34;What is unfair competition?&#34; In view of some of the mistaken criticisms which have been passed upon paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of sub-clause 1 of clause 4, I should like the attention of honorable members.

                            <para>- Order. I have already had occasion to call attention to the frequent interjections of honorable members. Interjections are bad, even when they are not made in defiance of instructions from the Chair; but when they are repeated after I have called for order two or three times, honorable members are committing the additional offence of disobeying the Chair. I would therefore ask them to refrain from interjecting, and to allow the Minister to continue his speech. </para>

The words he uses are : &#34; Com petition on unfair lines being carried on.&#34; There is no definition of unfairness ; the question is left to be determined by the Board. We have gone a great deaf further. We have done our best to put on paper something that will guide the House, and any tribunal that may be called upon to determine what unfair competition is. I think that shows that we are doing our best to plainly indicate what is in our minds, and to help the House and the country to understand the strict meaning of the Bill.

We know the charges, and also the amount of Customs duty that has to be paid, and any one can tell us the price at which the goods are being sold We know that in the present case harvesters are being sold at a price which, on the admission of the trust itself, is not sufficient to recoup expenses. Such a case would come within the provision I have just read. All we should do would be to ask the representatives of the trust to give us an explanation, and to show that they were competing on fair lines. </para>

                            <para>- I could not give an answer to a question of that kind. That must be left mainly to the Board, which will consist of competent men. No one could say, as a matter of law, that any special circumstances would be sufficient to justify the conclusion that the competition was unfair. In answer to the honorable member for Grey, who spoke about the Board, I should like to say that I acknowledge that a great deal depends upon its constitution. That is a matter for consideration in Committee. ,It is difficult for us to designate any particular man or men, or class of men, who should be appointed. At present, it is proposed to leave it to the Minister and the Cabinet, subject to their responsibility to Parliament, to appoint a Board, presumably for each particular case. It is a matter for consideration how that Board could be best constituted. As has been explained, we endeavoured to secure the services of the President of the Arbitration Court, but we were unable to do so. I am sure that if we had been successful, such an appointment would have given satisfaction to every one. Failing in that, we could see no other course than to provide for the appointment of the Board under the terms of the Bill. We could not name any particular functionaries, and I am not sure that it would be well to indicate beforehand the particular persons who should constitute it. It is left absolutely to a non-political officer, the Comptroller-General of Customs, who is in a position to know what is going on, to certify to the Minister, if he sees reason for doing so, that an industry which it is desirable to preserve is being seriously affected. It is not correct to say, as was stated in one of the newspapers this morning, that immediately he does that, the further importation of the goods is to be prohibited. That is absolutely incorrect, and any one who reads the Bill, and desires to understand it- </para>

                            <para>- Not upon the mere certificate of the Comptroller-General. The Comptroller-General looks into the matter, takes what evidence he thinks right, and afterwards places the facts before the Minister. The Minister inquires into it - and that is the second fence to be got over, because I am sure that no Minister would act without a full sense of his responsibility - and, if he thinks the matter is of sufficient importance, appoints a Board. Then, while the Board is conducting its inquiry - that is, if mischief is going on - the Minister takes precautions against further damage. He may, if} . he likes, allow the goods to come in, or he may prohibit their introduction, except under such conditions of security as he thinks it necessary to impose. Of course, he .will endeavour in every case to dislocate trade as little as possible. His desire will be to see that every precaution is taken to avert damage to Australian industries. When he has done that, the matter is referred to a Board. That body inquires into it, and it is enjoined to do so expeditiously and carefully. In Committee I should like honorable members to consider whether or not a time limit should be imposed upon their deliberations. The decision of a majority of the members of the Board constitutes its report. But, in order that the whole of the facts may be placed before the Minister and the country, the dissenting member of the Board is requested to state his opinion, and to give his reasons for holding that opinion. Those reasons may be very weighty, and they may modify very considerably the report of the majority. The_ whole Cabinet - tribunal No. 4 - have then to look into the matter, and, with a full sense of their responsibility, knowing that they will be held accountable to Parliament, they either act or refuse to act. If a majority of the Board report that there, is no unfair competition going on, there is an end to the matter. </para>

If two out of three of its members report that there is no unfair competition, the Cabinet have no power to act; but if, on the contrary, two out of three of their number report that unfair competition does prevail, the Ministry have to undertake the responsibility of investigating the matter- </para>

                            <para>- That is not so. The Bill contains no power to impose or increase a duty. I have heard a good deal in reference to not trusting the Minister. We have been repeatedly reminded of the enormous power which &#39;the Bill vests in him. Do honorable members forget that ever since 1901, when we passed the Customs Act, the Minister has possessed the power to prohibit the importation of any goods? It is within his power today and if he had been so evil-minded as some honorable members suggest- he would have done so months ago - to stop imported harvesters from entering the Commonwealth. This Bill is an evidence that any Minister occupying a position of responsibility may be trusted to do what is a right and fair thing all round. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member will have his little joke. After any prohibition has been imposed, the report of the Board has to be laid before Parliament, and Ministers will inform both Houses of the Legislature of the whole of the facts which have induced them to take such a drastic step. I contend that if Australian industries - in spite of the efforts which have been made to build them up, and in spite of the time and money which have been expended in establishing them - are to be threatened with extinction, their operatives thrown out of employment, and the consumers placed in peril of having to pay more for their goods, it is time that we stepped in to preserve them. I hope that honorable members will recollect the Ballarat speech of the Prime Minister, in which he pointed out what he understood by a White Australia. He said that a White Australia meant an Australia which was fit for white people to live in. Concerning the second part of the Bill, I desire to say that it is limited to commercial trusts and persons who conspire with such trusts. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to emphasize the point that this Bill does not make anything criminal which is not found to be to the detriment of the public. Practically this portion of the Bill is aimed at conspiracy to defraud&#39; the public, or to destroy industries. We come now to the question of aiding and abetting. I think that it was the honorable member for North Sydney who said he could not understand how we were going to carry out the provisions of clause 12. Precisely the same point was raised in connexion with the Commerce Bill. It was then explained that the act therein aimed at is an act committed in Australia. If a man in Australia commits an act in furtherance of something done outside, in defiance of this law, he will be liable. Clause 13 provides a civil remedy. The Attorney-General, acting for the whole Commonwealth, may go to the Court, and say, &#34; Something is going on in contravention of this Act. We do not wish to resort to criminal proceedings; we ask the Court to decide that that of which we complain is in contravention of the Act, and we appeal to it to stop it.&#34; There is no question of the Minister stepping in to decide the matter. It is to be threshed out in open Court. Could anything be fairer? Clause 13 is based on the Sherman Act. Whilst we provide for criminal liability, and the proper power of prevention to be vested in the Court, at the instance of the Attorney-General, we recognise that individuals may be irreparably injured. It may be that a powerful capitalistic company can come into the country, and crush local producers or manufacturers. In that event the penalty is to be upon the wrong-doers, by the giving of treble damages, just as it is provided by the Sherman Act. Such an undertaking takes the chance of ousting the local market, and obtaining an enormous advantage; let it run the risk of incurring severe penalties if it be found out. Following the example of the Sherman Act, we provide that treble damages may be recovered. Persons guilty of these practices will not be allowed to elude the obligation of giving evidence by the mere fact that that evidence may incriminate them; but they are to be protected in the ordinary way, inasmuch as no answer that they may give can be used against them in a criminal proceeding, with the exception, of course, of a prosecution for perjury. </para>

                            <para>- We have the statement of the honorable and learned member for Wannon that judgment was given in favour of the plaintiffs, but that they had not been able to collect the damages In conclusion, I would point out that we have heard from honorable members opposite that they are all very anxious to put down monopolies, and repress trusts ; that they are all very anxious to help Australian industries. I respect their desires, and accept their assurances that their intentions are strictly honorable, but I hope that they will not be too remote. I hope that my honorable friends opposite will endeavour to give effect to those intentions at the earliest opportunity. In view of the circumstances to which I have alluded, the Government feel that they would not be justified in going to their Christmas dinner, leaving a great number of their fellow-Australians, perhaps, with the prospect of not having one themselves. I believe that this is a great measure. I do not for one moment suggest that we cannot, in Committee, evolve amendments here and there which will improve it. We are here to suggest and improve. But I do say that the scope, the frame, and the central principle of the Bill are distinctly loyal to, and that I believe that they have the approbation of, the people of Australia. Although the particular wording of this Bill has not been before the country, the essence of it is well known. Time after time, Governments have promised an AntiTrust Bill, and we all know the general scope of anti-trust legislation. We have not departed very far from the Sherman Act, with the general provisions of which every one is familiar. Where we have departed from it, we have gone in the direction of providing less drastic remedies, except, as I have pointed out, in regard to the destruction of Australian industries. </para>

There is no time like the present to do these things, and, on behalf of the Government, I would sincerely and earnestly appeal to honorable members to use their best endeavours to expedite the passing of the Bill into Committee. It appears, if we are to accept the assurance of honorable members opposite, that there is an unanimous desire to protect Australian industries, and to repress the aggression of trusts upon the people of Australia. But, in the absence of such a measure as this, the vista we have before us is not pleasant to contemplate; and unless we meet it manfully and fearlessly - honorable members may call it drastically, if they will - our motto for the future will be not &#34;Advance Australia,&#34; but &#34;God help Australia.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- I must compliment the Ministry on having at this early stage in the debate put forth their great protagonist, the Attorney-General, to defend this Bill. They evidently consider there is some necessity for the careful and elaborate argument which the honorable and learned gentleman always brings to bear on questions of this sort, since he has been induced to interpose so early in the discussion of a Bill of which he is not in charge. Whilst complimenting the honorable and learned gentleman upon the ability which he always displays in the matter of exposition and research, I regret that for the sake of strengthening some weak arguments in support of our being precipitate in this matter, he should have appealed to considerations of prejudice. Such a line of action could not strengthen the case for a good Bill. The honorable and learned gentleman said that this was the first Bill presented to an Australian Legislature which called upon honorable members to range themselves as the friends or foes of Australian enterprise. Surely the honorable and learned gentleman is not going to prejudice the discussion of a far-reaching measure - and so he described this Bill - by saying that those who may happen in a deliberative assembly to differ from him as to its expediency must necessarily be the foes of Australian industry ! Such a statement is scarcely in keeping with a debate in a Federal Assembly. To my mind, it is hitting below the belt, and is hardly worthy of a member of a Commonwealth Ministry. To some extent, the honorable and&#39; learned gentleman maligned, unintentionally, no doubt, the great race from which &#39; we have descended, when he said that all our competitors cared for Australia was represented by the profit that they could make out of it. If we are to be told that those in the British Possessions, who compete with us, are actuated only by such&#39; selfish feelings towards Australia, what is ali this cant about Imperialism, and as to extending the range of sympathy throughout the British Empire, by establishing trade relations at the mutual instance of the various citizens of that Empire? I am sorry that the Attorney-General at the inception of the debate attempted to poison the wells of controversy by introducing such an exceedingly strong appeal to prejudice. </para>

                            <para>- I make no assertion, one way or another ; but it is not reasonable to try to impute an exceptional degree of want or patriotism to those who happen on a far-reaching measure of this kind to differ from the members of the Ministry. The Attorney-General has said that the Bill is a far-reaching one. If that be so, the necessity for it must have been foreseen long since. If its necessity has arisen only within the last few weeks, surely I am entitled to say that we are asked to be exceedingly precipitate in placing a measure of this compass upon the statute-book in the dying hours of the session. The excuse for doing so is not&#39; to be found in one of the closing allegations of the Attorney-General to the effect that the question of whether certain people are to enjoy their Christmas dinners de pends upon the passing of this Bill. If that does not savour of the introduction of cant and prejudice into this debate, I do not know what would. If the measure is a far-reaching one, the conditions which justified its introduction must have been foreseen long since. The honorable gentleman might have introduced a measure at a time when it could have been carefully considered and debated under that full light of publicity &#34;which is so necessary when commercial and mercantile interests are affected, and when proper attention could have been given in Committee to the points arising out of the various clauses. I call it scarcely less than fatuity to try to place this measure on the statute-book between now and Christmas Eve. The mere attempt is unfair to the interests affected, and to the great mercantile public. The Attorney-General referred to the pressure responsible for this measure as due to a recent reduction in the prices of the machines imported by the International Harvester Company. I wish to weigh with an unprejudiced mind any case presented to this House,&#39; and am, therefore, desirous that the matter shall be put before us in all its completeness, with the statement of all considerations, pro and con, and after the report of the Tariff Commission has been made, so that we may do justice to all the interests concerned. I have not hitherto heard a case presented by the local manufacturers against the International Harvester Company or other importers, which justifies me in voting for the Bill. According to statements made a few months ago in the public press, the importations of the International Harvester Company into Australia were equal to about only one-tenth of trie importations of this class of agricultural machinery from other parts of the British Dominions. It was stated in a letter published in the press that the Massey-Harris Company, whose competition is most complained of by the local manufacturers, sends&#39; about 90 per cent, of the agricultural machinery which comes here. </para>

                            <para>- I have looked carefully into this matter, and read what has been published on the subject, (arid I shall, therefore, endeavour to recall one or two points which have struck nic in the correspondence, as a corrective of the statements of the Attorney-General. He mentioned that the International Harvester Company had reduced its prices from <inline font-style="italic">&#163;&#38;i</inline> to ^70 for one machine, to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;60</inline> for two, and to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;50</inline> for three, and a similar statement was made in a letter which appeared in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of the 13th October. That letter was followed immediately by one from the International Harvester Company, in which it was pointed out that they had for some time previously been selling their machines at from <inline font-style="italic">&#163;70</inline> to ^75 each. They explained that their reason for doing so was that the combine&#39;s price was too high, and that the small manufacturers, whose machinery was imperfect, compared with theirs, had also been selling at the lower prices; and I have seen that statement repeated in many quarters. The writers very properly asked why large manufacturers, who might be supposed to have the best kind of machinery in their works, could not make a reduction in price similar to that of the small local manufacturers, whose machinery might not be quite so good. </para>

                            <para>- Some extraordinary things happen in the honorable gentleman&#39;s electorate at times. I am dealing with the newspaper dialectics only for what they are worth, and, in my opinion, the counter statement to which I have referred is of as much importance as the original statement quoted by the Attorney-General. He referred, towards the close of his speech, to the Bill itself, and it is a pity that honorable members have not a month or two in which to consider the real bearing of its clauses. We are all, as were those who walk the torrid pavements of a certain region, which I hope none of us will reach hereafter, actuated by good intentions; but the public expect something more. They require a certain, amount of scrutiny to be given to the machinery proposed to carry out any policy, even though that policy may be acknowledged to have been sent by Providence itself. Under clause 14, local manufacturers are to be permitted, not only to prevent foreign, manufacturers from competing with them, but to recover treble damages. I interjected, when the Attorney-General was speaking, that the Courts award damages only where the bad results of certain actions complained of can be directly traced, and it will require great ingenuity to prove that any local manufacturer, has suffered such special harm by the importation of foreign machinery as to justify the awarding to him of treble damages. That surmise, I &#39;think, is justifiable, in view of the fact that, so far as I know - though I have not made exhaustive researches - in only one or two instances, since the Sherman Act was passed in 1:890, have proceedings been instituted under it to recover treble damages, and they included the case referred to by the honorable and learned member for Wannon. I hope, therefore, that our friends, the manufacturers of this country, will not be duped, either by this plausible clause, or by the more plausible explanation of it which has been given. It is a little too bad that the Bill should have been framed to strike a blow at an import trade about 70 or 80 per cent, of which comes from -British Possessions, and mostly from the mother country. They have acted differently in New Zealand. That country is frequently referred to here as an example to us, .and Ministers, not having much power of initiation, are very fond of copying New Zealand legislation, relying upon the democratic reputation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Seddon</inline> to get it passed. They do not, however, copy that gentleman&#39;s virtues. The Minister has adopted only the debatable portions of his policy, and left the rest to the winds. The New Zealand Act, I think, does not apply to British goods. If that is so, our Act has about three times its compass, and directly affects a much larger importation. </para>

                            <para>- If the merits of &#34;the Bill are so clear that it does not need consideration, there is no more to be said. But it seems to me a &#39; strange course to provide against evils which are merely surmised. We have not been given proof of the need for this legislation, and have not even waited for the report of the Tariff Commission. It has been introduced on the mere conjecture that a certain state of things may arise, and continue in existence for a few weeks or months. To meet such an occurrence, we are asked to practically suspend the operation of the Tariff, and to substitute prohibition for the range of duties which was elaborated after eleven months of debate in the first session of this Parliament. I have such a regard for the true Imperialism at which we should aim, and such a feeling of kinship with the people of the British Islands, that I hesitate to agree to a measure to which only a few hours&#39; consideration can be given, prohibiting, their importations. The Bill is not only unfair to the British people with whom we are allied in blood, but it is also unfair to our local merchants. There are many merchants who are purely distributors. They do not necessarily purchase all their machinery from local manufacturers, and it has been said that one of the causes why the competition of which we have heard so much has sprung up within the last four or five years, has been that some importers have found it more economical to manufacture abroad and send their goods here than to purchase machines locally made. We should consider these large mercantile distributors, whose businesses extend throughout Australia. But it is proposed that, on the mere certificate of the Comptroller-General of Customs a Board may be appointed by the Minister, which may suspend importations, without any limit as to time, because it cannot be compelled by mandamus, or in any other way, to present a report, and may therefore delay reporting as long as it likes. The Minister thus has power to prohibit importation, or to allow it only subject to such conditions as he may think fit. I object to the delegation of this tremendous power to the Minister, who will require to be almost purity itself, and to have a marvellous capacity for recognising the honesty of others, as well as an immense grip of the conditions of manufacture and importation, to properly exercise it. The effect of its exercise may be to practically ruin some of our local distributors. I use the word &#34; distributors,&#34; because some honorable members who are supporting the Government get their back up when &#34; importers &#34; are mentioned. They seem to regard the benign dispensation of Providence which makes the abundance of one nation minister to the scarcity of another, by the interchange of products, as baneful in its operation, and, as such, a thing to be put an end to. We should pay some attention to the interests of those whom, in recognition of this prejudice, I prefer to term distributors, rather than importers, and to the interests of the general consumers, who have not been consulted in regard to this measure, although they comprise the great body of the electors. </para>

                    <para class="block">I admit that the manufacturers must be fairly considered, but the consumers, who far outnumber them, and particularly the consumers of machinery in connexion with the primary industries, are entitled to be remembered. The conditions of the primary industries are not beyond challenge. Any one who looks at the records of production in the Argentine Republic will see that right through the whole range of our products that country is becoming our dangerous competitor. Even in merino wool of high quality, the Argentine is becoming a fairly successful competitor. </para>

                            <para>- At all events, the competition of the Massey-Harris Company has been largely complained of, and the Bill aims at stopping, not only American imports, but also at putting an end to the competition of men who are British subjects like ourselves. I say that the natural corollary of all this legislation will be a series of provisions for the protection of the local consumers. The conditions of local trade, as well as the conditions of the import trade, must weigh with us. It is not enough for us to show that the imports challenge local products. We must also demonstrate that the returns upon the capital employed by local producers are not sufficient, and, further, that the remuneration given to the workers is fairly proportionate to the profits derived from the enterprise. We must satisfy ourselves that the profits derived from local industry are not too large before we destroy that competition which tends to keep prices at a fair level. The logical result of passing such legislation will be a measure for the investigation of the profits of those who have to compete with the imports which it is proposed to prohibit. We ought to be able to ascertain the amount of wages paid and the total value of the products, the return obtained upon the capital invested, and also whether the conditions are such as to lead to that gradual perfecting of machinery that is going on throughout the world. Whilst we limit competition from outside, we should see that the perfection of the Australian product is not seriously affected by our policy. I do not wish to say anything in disparagement of local products, because many of them are no doubt excellent; but it seems to me that a wholesome check is imposed even upon business men of the highest character by fair competition from outside. No honorable member will deny that it is essential that our primary producers should be able to purchase the machinery they require at fair prices. <inline font-style="italic">Prima facie,</inline> if you diminish competition, you increase the power, and by consequence the likelihood of unfair prices being charged. The effort made by American Legislatures is to increase competition, to restrain attempts to limit competition, and to prevent the levying of high charges upon the community. We may talk as much as we like about importers destroying competition, but that evil has not assumed such magnitude amongst us as to justify the precipitate determination of this question. If we limit competition from outside, <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> we shall increase local prices. That argument may not be very convincing, but it indicates one of the points from which those who are opposed to excessive haste in this&#39; matter view the question. I object to the tremendous powers which it is proposed to confer upon the Executive. This is a most vicious development of Australian legislation, for which this Parliament is largely responsible. We are delegating to others many of the powers which the electors expect us to exercise. If honorable members will look at clause 3, they will see that it is provided that the industries to be affected by this measure are to be left to the decision of the Comptroller-General. Instead of following, the example afforded by the New Zealand Act, which has a very restrictive schedule, limiting its scope, the Minister proposes to place it in the power of the Comptroller-General of Customs to say what industries shall be brought under the protection of the measure. Unfair competition is defined as having, reference to- those Australian industries the preservation of which in the opinion of the Comptroller-General or the Tribunal (which has to determine any matter under this Act) as the case may be, is advantageous to the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>The word &#39; &#39; tribunal &#34; is used there to some extent to make the clause more palatable, but the power of initiative does not lie with the tribunal. That rests entirely with the Comptroller-General. The Minister is empowered to appoint a Board, and the action upon the report of that Board will depend upon the Executive. -It is proposed by clause 3 to surrender an enormous amount of power over which we should 1 retain control, even though we do not desire to exercise it at once. The clause pretends to give the power of initiative to ;he tribunal which is to be appointed, but it does nothing of the kind. Clause 5 provides that, whenever the Comptroller-General has reason to believe - and no one can challenge his belief - that any person is importing goods that may be sold in unfair competition with Australian goods he may certify accordingly. The word &#34;unfair &#34; opens up a very wide question. All those considerations <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> which I have referred, such as the fair returns obtained upon the investment of local capital, the conditions of labour, the proportion of the total profits paid to labour, and other matters, should be inquired into. The conditions of production and exchange, so far as external commerce is concerned, should also be examined before the Comptroller-General decides that certain competition is unfair. But he has arbitrary power conferred upon him, which he can exercise without any guidance or reason. If we do not mean to convey that, it will be necessary for us to insure that inquiries such as I have suggested are made. The Comptroller-General will then have to enter upon avenues of inquiry, along which he will have to travel far before he can find a firm footing. Upon receiving a report from him, the Minister will appoint a Board, and immediately the importation of the goods in question, except on such conditions as he may prescribe, will cease. Such action may involve, not only the importers, but also the distributers, in very heavy loss. So far as I am aware, there is no precedent for legislation such as that now proposed. Under clause 4, the unfairness of the competition is assumed, practically for all purposes, unless the contrary can be shown. It is assumed, under sub-clause 2, <inline font-style="italic">io</inline> exist not only for the purposes of the Comptroller-General in giving a certificate, but also for the purposes of the report of the Board. There is no limitation of the effect of sub-clause 2 merely to the discretion of the Comptroller. Therefore, unless the importers could show that their competition was not unfair, the Board could report at once, without hearing evidence, that it was unfair. I do not think that that is a proper power to vest in the Board., It is certainly repugnant to all the principles which should govern judicial bodies in arriving at : their conclusions. Unless the Board can be satisfied by evidence - which may not be easily procurable - because, say, an American exporter could not bring witnesses here except at very great expense - that the competition is not unfair, they can at once report to the Minister that it is unfair. A Canadian or American exporter would find it very difficult to prove, on the comparison of the conditions of production and the rates of wages paid litre with those prevailing in America, that his prices were not unfair. Then, again, the Bill makes no exception in favour of reasonably lowering the prices of commodities, or for that disorganization of industry which may &#34;reasonably be expected to occur under the conditions of international trade. It assumes that the effects of the ordinary conditions of exchange must be baneful to an industry. That is the <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> assumption, whereas we know as a matter of fact that there is no local trade which will not be affected, more or less, by large exports from other countries. This Bill assumes that competitive imports tend to make the conditions of labour unfair, to decrease employment, and to unduly diminish the profits of capital, and makes the rebuttal of the assumption in cases difficult. It is therefore repugnant to British justice. Reference has been made to American legislation, but on looking at the Sherman Act, I can find no provision which is aimed against attempts to lower prices. </para>

                    <para class="block">That section shows the distinction in objects between American legislation and the Bill ; the one being against enhancement of prices through artificial trade limitations, and the other against the lowering of prices through competition assumed to be unfair. That is the language of the American Act, which, as I say, is altogether different in character from the Bill before us. There is only one Act with which I am familiar which contains a provision in regard to the lowering of prices. It is a State Act which was passed in Arkansas, and it forbids any act being done which would tend to advance, reduce, or control prices, or the cost to the producer or to the consumer of any product or article. In Tiedeman&#39;s work on <inline font-style="italic">State and Federal Control of Personal Property.</inline> Vol. 1, which was published this year or last year, the general principles underlying the American Acts are stated to be - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>First, that the act of entering into such combination or contract is itself an actionable conspiracy, which is punishable criminally ot actionable civilly according to the provisions of the particular statute, and, secondly, that all contracts, agreements, or combinations which have the purpose or effect of restraining trade and suppressing competition are illegal whether the restraint was reasonable or unreasonable - the restraint of trade being in the direction of the diminution of competition so as to enhance prices. I would further point out that our powers of legislation in regard to internal matters are exceedingly limited. In America there are State as well as Federal laws dealing with&#39; such matters. There, the Acts, which are directed against trusts, are chiefly State Acts. Since allusion has been made to the Colonial Sugar Refining Company, I should like to refer the Attorney-General to a decision given in connexion with the American Sugar Trust. In the case of the <inline font-style="italic">United States</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">E. C. Knight,</inline> 156 U.S. page 1, a question arose as to the &#34;Federal power to control the operations of the Sugar Trust in America. As bearing upon that question, I have made the following extract from the opinion of the Court : - </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>In order to give Federal jurisdiction to a Court it must be held that the article does not become a part of Inter-State commerce until it has started from one State to another </para>
                    <para class="block">That is a very far-reaching decision. The operation of these Acts is nearly always local. In Australia it would be very easy for an internal trust to establish independent&#39; trusts in the different States, and so evade the Federal law. We know, from the broken package case in America, that when an article once gets into the stream of interchange between the States, it becomes subject to Federal control. But when its transit ceases, and the package is broken, it is no longer subject to Federal control. Consequently, I cannot see, even if we amend this Bill, how we can do more than touch the Colonial Sugar Refining Company in relation to its exchanges between the States. </para>

                            <para>- It is clearly laid down by all writers that the Federal jurisdiction over commerce does not begin until an article has reached the stream of interchange between the States. But after it has reached its destination it ceases to be under Federal jurisdiction from the moment the package is broken. Consequently, the main principle which I deduce from the quotation I have given is not affected by any decision such as that to which the Attorney-General has referred. Section 1 of an Act which was passed in New York in 1893 says : - </para>

                    <para class="block">Clause 10 of this Bill, which deals with restraints on trade between the States or with foreign countries, is an exceptional one. I think that it is susceptible of amendment. In adding the final words to that clause, which render it penal for a trust to do anything which may have the effect of injuring Australian industries, we are opening up possibilities which were certainly not contemplated by the framers of the American legislation. In&#34; the earlier part of the Bill there is no provision made to protect small producers against internal competition or State monopolies. These are the men who, prior to the establishment of the International Harvester Company, reduced the prices to the consumer. They are not protected by this Bill against the State combination, which may completely destroy them. </para>

I have no desire to trespass any further upon the attention of honorable members, but I think I have adduced some arguments which tell against the too hasty passing of this Bill, and against precipitate action on our part. My own feeling is that the evil has not arisen.

                        <para>-It is a pity that a very important proposal of this kind should be brought before us at this stage of the session. The Attorney-General has stated that the ideas embodied in it have been before the public for months, and that the people have been demanding a. measure of this character for some time. If honorable members will cast their minds back to the first occasion upon which an Anti-Trust Bill was promised in this Parliament, and if they will examine the measure before us, they will at once realize that a complete change has taken place in the ideas of those who asked for it. An Anti-Trust Bill was promised in the first instance by the right honorable member for Adelaide, and it was intended to prevent the formation of local combines and trusts. It was admitted that the Tariff would probably foster the creation of those bodies. The Government of the day, which comprised the present Minister of Trade and Customs and the Prime Minister, promised that the Bill would be introduced at an early date. Their pledge in that connexion was not fulfilled, and no attempt would have been made to deal with this question but for the fierce controversy that has arisen over the. importation of harvesters. It is an unfortunate fact that the largest manufacturer of harvesters in Victoria has been able to exercise so much political influence. He has been able to exert sufficient influence to get the valuation of harvesters raised at the Customs House, and also to precipitate the introduction of this particular measure. I am not one of those who object to the passing of a Bill which will deal rationally with trusts and monopolies. When Henry Demerest Lloyd, the well-known American writer upon this subject, was in Australia some years ago, I had the pleasure of many conversations with him, and I was in possession of his books when there were only two or three of them in the Commonwealth. I have taken great interest in the literature bearing on American trusts, and have paid particular attention to the question.&#39; It has agitated the public mind for some time. I venture to say that the means adopted in this Bill are not such as will adequately control local industries ; on the contrary, they will increase their power. They will lead to local trusts springing up in many branches of industry in which they are at present unknown, and will press most injuriously upon the producers of Australia. The measure with which we are now dealing owes its origin to the harvester incident, and it is my intention to devote a few minutes to a re-statement of that matter, in order to show that many unjustifiable aspersions have been cast upon the importers of the machines. I wish to show that they have been subjected to a great many misrepresentations. Only a few days ago a well-known Victorian senator journeyed to the Mallee and the Wimmera, and delivered an address at Warracknabeal, and also two lectures at Horsham, which is within my electorate, in support of the imposition of an exceptionally heavy duty on harvesters. On the following Saturday the farmers of the Horsham district held a meeting to consider the question, and only seven were in favour of his policy. That does not lead one to believe that the Canadian exporters of harvesters have driven terror into the hearts of our farmers. Notwithstanding an exposition of the situation by a keen debater and an experienced orator, resolutions were passed against the imposition of an additional duty. I have been inundated with resolutions passed by many of my constituents, urging me to oppose any measure likely to restrict the importation of harvesters, or to increase the duty upon them. </para>

It is hardly necessary for me to mention that every one of these letters was entirely unsolicited by me. Most of the resolutions were passed without my knowledge, and most of the correspondents to whom I have referred are personally unknown to me.

                            <para>- I do not wish to attribute blame to the Minister. The Department took action without asking for any explanation from the importers, and although charges of unfair competition were made against them as far back as April last, they have not yet been afforded an opportunity to state their case before the Tariff Commission. It is true that the Commission paid them rather a back-handed compliment by suggesting that they should give evidence before it in Adelaide. Not being absolute idiots, they refused to do so. They urged that their evidence, like that of their opponents, should be given in Melbourne. I am now informed that in January next - after a lapse of nine months - they are to be afforded an opportunity to go before the Commission in this city. I do not say that an opportunity to state their case has been wilfully denied them by the Tariff Commission. The trouble has possibly occurred owing to a faulty arrangement of work. But we are now asked to pass legislation very much in the dark, inasmuch as the importers have not had a chance to express their view of the matter. On the other hand, the campaign started by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> to protect his business against foreign competition has been conducted for many months with great skill and ability. Accusations have been hurled against the Massey-Harris Company and the International Harvester Company, and at a time when the. public mind has been strongly inflamed by <inline font-style="italic">ex forte</inline> statements this Bill has been introduced. In the closing hours of the session, we are asked to agree to it, without having had an opportunity to give it reasonable and proper consideration. We have been asked to proceed with its consideration on the day following the Ministerial explanation of its provisions. The Attorney-General, striking one of his heroic attitudes, declared that the Bill was to divide the friends and foes of Australia. That being so, no one can deny its importance. I have been anxious to check it, and to compare it with the legislation of America and other countries, but it was only yesterday that I was able to secure a copy of the Sherman Act, whilst the New Zealand Act reached me only this afternoon. Most of the books and papers dealing with this subject are practically under the control of the Government, and when they desire to use them, it is exceedingly difficult for private members to obtain them. I do not wish to blame the Ministry for this ; they wished, of course, to have the use of these books, to enable them to prepare the Bill. But I hold that honorable members should have been afforded a reasonable opportunity to study similar laws passed by other Legislatures, in order that they might determine in what respect the Bill differs from existing legislation in other parts of the world. </para>

                            <para>- I do not blame the honorable gentleman. But it is hardly fair to expect an honorable member who has obtained possession of the Sherman Act, and the decisions thereunder, about three hours after the speech made by the Minister in moving the second reading of this Bill, to be able to debate these proposals in detail. The consideration of a measure of this kind must extend over not a few hours, but several days. We know that its preparation has occupied several weeks. Its approach has been heralded by paragraphs in the newspapers, and it was only placed in the hands of the printer on Monday or Tuesday last. The Bill was introduced and explained to us only yesterday by the Minister of Trade and Customs, while a memorandum relating to it appeared in. this morning&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> and the Attorney-General made a speech on it&#39; this afternoon. Is it fair to ask honorable members to pass it absolutely without consideration? In no Parliament of the world would legislation of this kind be brought forward as this has been; and in that opinion I am supported by an excellent article appearing in this evening&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline> a newspaper which cannot be said to be unfriendly to the present Government, since none has been more eulogistic of the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General than it has been. It points out that for the Government to press the Bill through the House at this time would justify charges of indecent haste in dealing with a very important measure, and it shows that if a similar Bill were introduced in the House of Commons, or in any other deliberative assembly, it would be referred to a. Select Committee, in order that its provisions might be thoroughly investigated, and those likely to be affected might be heard. The article goes on to state that. - </para>

                    <para>It is incumbent on Parliament to look most closely to the means by which it is intended to give effect to the principle, with a view of ensuring, so far as that is possible, (1) that no needless restriction is placed on trade ; (2) that interests affected by the Bill are fairly treated. No opportunity is given for that. Honorable members have not had an opportunity to properly consider the probable effects of the clauses of this measure, or to compare it with similar legislation in other parts of the world. Outside wild-cat Legislatures like that of Arkansas, a measure of this kind would not be similarly treated in any other part of the world. A reason for the introduction of the Bill may be found in the attempt by local manufacturers of harvesters to prevent the importation of such machines from abroad. Material facts are being suppressed, and a skilful selection of misstatements has been made, to induce the public to believe that the total exclusion of foreign-made harvesters is necessary to prevent the destruction of the local industry. But if it is reasonable to prohibit the importation of harvesters, it is equally fair and reasonable to prohibit the importation of all implements used by farmers. We know, from the sworn evidence of those connected with the local manufacture of harvesters, that they desire to absolutely prohibit importations, although they have had to admit that they themselves have combined to keep up prices in Australia. Both <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> Moore have made that admission. It is further admitted that the effect of the combination was to considerably increase the price of agricultural machinery to the farmers. </para>

                    <para class="block">Not only have the local manufacturers not suffered, but they are doing, better than they were. Why, therefore, should the importation of harvesters be prohibited? Until quite recently, the imported machines were sold at the same price as the locally-manufactured machines. Then a number of local manufacturers, headed by McKay, commenced to agitate for the prohibition of the importation of harvesters, and made a number of misleading statements in the endeavour to blacken their trade rivals. The International Harvester Company of America, thinking that it was not good enough to persist in keeping up prices, chiefly for the benefit of McKay and Co., and be blackguarded by that firm, determined to leave the combine, and&#39; to sell its machines at what it thought to&#39; be a fair profit, allowing McKay and others to shift for themselves. It therefore reduced its price to .&#163;70, which is more than has been charged by some of the local manufacturers for a similar machine, a fact which is conclusive evidence that the operations of the company are not disastrously affecting the local makers. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moore</inline> gave evidence before the Tariff Commission that, in 1902, Martin and Company were selling stripper-harvesters at <inline font-style="italic">/&#34;.6o</inline> a machine, and in a previous debate in this Chamber I laid on the table a telegram from a constituent of mine at Murtoa, stating that they had quoted to the Farmers&#39; Union ^70 as the price of a single harvester, with a reduction of 10 per cent, if any farmer, or combination of farmers, took three machines, which would have brought down the price to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;6$</inline> each. </para>

                            <para>- No; all these prices are free on truck. We have had a howl of anguish from McKay because his profits will be reduced if harvesters are made cheaper to the farmers ; but he will still continue, to make a good profit, and a much larger amount than any honorable member is ever likely to make. If the present com- petition is allowed to continue, farmers -will be able to get machines during next year for between ^70 and ^75, while prices will go down still lower in the future. Tt has been said that the American manufacturers have pirated an Australian invention ; but, as every one knows, it- is impossible to lawfully use patents which are protected in this country, and McKay&#39;s exaggerated statements resolve themselves into this - that the Americans are using time-expired patents. McKay himself, however, does the same, and not a manufacturer in the world could carry on his business if he did not use such patents. Many persons think that, as patentees have had the advantage of the designs of the brains of others, they should not be given a monopoly of any invention, and that view is held by both Socialists and individualists. While I do not agree with it, I admit that any particular patent is merely the culminating result of the efforts of many men, through, perhaps, many centuries. McKay, in the manufacture of his machines, uses time expired patents - American, English, and Australian - and, if that is piracy, he is as much guilty of the crime as is the International Harvester Company. The word, however, is an improper one to use in this connexion. Every manufacturer is at liberty to use time-expired patents, and no more blame is attachable to an American firm for doing so than is to be laid to the door of H. V. McKay and Company. I could, if it were relevant, show the House that a certain firm of manufacturers in this city which has been calling out for the prohibition of imported harvesters were once agents for some American machines - disc harrows, I think - and copied those machines so faithfully that certain private marks of the American company were repeated on the copies. </para>

We have been told that, unless the importation of American machines is prohibited, 3,000 men will be thrown out of work here. That statement was made in my electorate by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith,</inline> and has been made by various public speakers throughout the suburbs. No statement that has been made is more devoid of truth. It is a gross and wicked exaggeration that has been put before the people, with the object of deluding them.

                    <para>If the 3,000 persons employed in the industry, as alleged, that amount would provide for an average annual wage of only <inline font-style="italic">?50.</inline> That, on the face of it, is absurd. The 3,000 employes referred to includes every person engaged in the manufacture of agricultural implements, of whatever kind, and only a fraction of the number would be employed solely in the production of harvesters. Yet the public have been told that 3,000 men would be thrown out of employment, unless the importation of foreign harvesters was prohibited. These statements are indicative of the means which have been adopted to inflame the public mind on this question. They exhibit a reckless disregard of the truth. So far from the local industry having been crushed, we find that there is a very considerable export of locally-manufactured harvesters. Recently the Minister was good enough to inform me that over 400 locally-made harvesters had been exported during the current year. I have no doubt that these figures represent a large increase upon the export of a few years ago, and an industry which is capable of assuming such proportions cannot be said to require much spoon-feeding at the hands of the Legislature. There may be reasons why the Americans can produce machines more cheaply than can the local manufacturers, but it must not be forgotten that, inclusive of the Customs duty of ?5 per machine, the cost of bringing a harvester from Toronto to Melbourne amounts to <inline font-style="italic">?20.</inline> The local manufacturers enjoy the full benefit of this enormous protection. I have no objection to that, but I am strongly opposed to a man who enjoys a privilege of that kind - a privilege which none of our farmers can have extended to them - seeking to further exploit our producers. The object of this Bill is to exclude all competition, and if that result were brought about, there would be nothing to prevent half-a-dozen or a dozen firms in Australia from raising their prices as high as they chose. The manufacturers openly state that their object is to. prevent the importation of harvesters. It would be impossible to discuss this question without raising the fiscal issue. My objection to the proposal of the Government lies in the fact that they are proposing to empower the Minister to exercise powers in regard to the imposition of duties and the prohibition of imports which should be left entirely in the hands of Parliament. All the Minister has to do is to go to the Comptroller-General, and say to him, &#34; McKay has been biting my ear, and wants the importation of harvesters prohibited.&#34; The Comptroller-General would look into the matter, and decide upon <inline font-style="italic">ex parte</inline> statements that a <inline font-style="italic">prima facie</inline> case had been made out. Then the Minister would appoint a Board, of which the honorable member for Melbourne Ports and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> might be members, and upon their making their report, the Minister could go to the Cabinet, and with their approval, either prohibit the importation of the harvesters, or subject them to a duty of?25 or?50 per machine. Only a few days ago, honorable members refused to permit the Minister to exercise any such power in regard to the duties on metals and machinery under division VI.A  of the Tariff. They decided that the duties should be imposed only by resolution of both Houses, and I am glad to pay that honorable members of the Labour Party took a firm attitude on that question. Customs duties should be increased only by Parliament, acting in the full light of day. If the Bill were passed the only way in which Parliament could override the decision of the Government would be by turning Ministers out of office. There are many reasons, apart from fiscal considerations, which influence honorable members in supporting a Government, and many of them might prefer to submit to what they considered to be an injustice rather than turn a Ministry out of office. If the Bill reaches the Committee stage I trust that we shall take care to provide that no duty shall be increased or prohibition imposed without the consent of Parliament. I would go so far, in the interests of expedition, as to make the action of the Cabinet subject merely to a resolution of both Houses of Parliament. Those who are asking our protection should show us that they are prepared <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> accord some privileges to those in whose interests they profess to be taking action. I should be prepared to support a provision under which no employer who seeks to prohibit competing imports would be able to place himself beyond the control of the Wages Boards. Before a man could come to Parliament and ask for a special privilege, or even before he approached the Minister and asked for a searching inquiry, he should be called upon to show that he was paying the union or standard rate of wage and employing his men for only eight hours daily. Any man who wishes us to prohibit imports which compete with his products should Show that he has clean hands. He should not ask for special advantages at the expense of our producers, the majority of whom are exposed to the competition of the Indian ryots, the Egyptian fellaheen, and the products of the cheap laws of the United States and Canada, unless he can show that he is paying the full union rate of wage. He should&#34; shOw, further, that he is not making an excessive profit. I am sure that honorable members would not agree to the restriction of imports if it were found that the local manufacturers were underpaying their employes, and were at the same time making such profits as would enable them to pay a good rate of wage after making allowance for a fair return on the capital they had invested. I do not object to the manufacturer making even a very good profit, but I have no sympathy with the man who, in spite of the fact that he is making thousands of pounds per annum, squeals as if only a copper stood between him and destitution. Some of the manufacturers have been very glad to obtain the support of honorable members in connexion with contentious proposals such as those embodied in the Trade Marks Bill, but. so far as I am concerned, they will be called upon to give something in return for any privilege they may obtain at our hands in connexion with the exclusion of imports. They will have to show that they are not merely talking with their tongues in their cheeks when they say that they are prepared to maintain a fair rate of wage. They will have to furnish genuine proof that they are treating their men properly. I should like to refer to the unfair treatment which is meted out to the two different classes of persons against whom the provisions of the Bill are directed. I am one of those who believe that the fact that a man is an importer furnishes no reason why he should not receive fair play. He should be treated with as much consideration as if he were a. manufacturer. I would ask honorable members to contrast the treatment which is meted out to importers, under clause 4. with that which it is proposed to extend to local trusts under clauses 10 and 11. The importers are to have their cases submitted to a political Board, whereas local trusts have to be proceeded against by ordinary methods of prosecution, or the Attorney-General has to take proceedings to obtain an injunction. In a case of prosecution some one will have to stand the racket of instituting proceedings in the Police Court, and if there is a committal! the defendant will have the advantage of appearing before a Judge and jury, and of&#34; having his case conducted by a skilful advocate. He will have his case adjudicated&#34; upon by a judicial tribunal, whereas the importer will be called upon to appear before a political Board appointed bv the Minister. Under certain circumstances, the importer will have no opportunity to do anything, because the case will &#39; be assumed against him. It is provided in clause 4 -  </para>

                    <para>That may mean anything. A dozen different meanings may be attached to it. What the &#34;ordinary circumstances of trade&#34; are is a question upon which the seventy-five members of this House would express a dozen different opinions. It is to be decided not by a judicial, but by a political tribunal, which is bound to be of a partisan character. Then subclause 2 provides that competition shall be deemed to be unfair, unless the contrary is proved, if the person importing goods, or selling imported goods, is a commercial trust. How will that provision operate? The kerosene supply of the world is practically obtained from two companies - the Standard Oil Company, and the British Shale Transport and Trading Company. One of these firms is a trust, and the other an enormously wealthy company. Under the operation of the Dibbs Tariff, kerosene used to be manufactured in New South Wales. A duty of 6d. per gallon was imposed upon that article, to assist in the establishment of the industry. Will it be possible under this Bill for a manufacturer who may possibly produce enough kerosene to light the houses in one small suburb of Sydney, to approach the Minister and say: &#34;I cannot carry on operations in the face of the competition of these powerful companies. I therefore ask you </para>

                            <para>- It seems to me that that is possible under this Bill. Are we going to refuse light to residents in the backblocks because a commercial trust for which we are not responsible has control of the kerosene supply ? It appears to me that if the matter be followed to its logical conclusion, the case which I have cited is one which the provisions of this Bill fit to a nicety. There are other examples, which show what an extraordinarily drawn measure this is. If an importer gives too large a remuneration to his travellers, that may constitute an inducement to the Minister to certify that the competition is unfair. Another provision of the Bill states that an importer cannot purchase a cheap lot of goods abroad, because competition shall be deemed to be unfair - if the imported goods have been purchased abroad at prices greatly below their ordinary cost of production where produced, or market price where purchased. </para>

Board. &#39; On the other hand, the way is paved so nicely for the local trusts that it is practically impossible for them to come under the operations of the Bill.

                            <para>- If honorable members will refer to the Sherman Act they will see that it contains a general provision that contracts in restraint of trade are void. That Statute also embodies a section, the safeguarded. The literature of America reveals the fact that the best way of dealing with trusts is for the Government to control the means of communication, and to make trade between the States as free as possible. This Bill contains no far-reaching proposal of that kind. On the contrary, it contains a provision which will confer on the Minister power to increase the Tariff without reference to Parliament. The only remedy for an abuse of that power that we possess is the power to turn him out of office. Many of the biggest trusts in Australia will not be. touched by this measure. </para>

                            <para>- I have read a good deal in reference to it, and I do not think the Attorney-General will be able to apply it to a company in which the persons interested take their payment in shares. In such circumstances, it is quite possible for individuals to sell out and leave no trace of their original deal. But under the Sherman legislation, I believe, they could be reached in another way. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that it is very difficult to catch them. Nevertheless, the attempt should be made. I have never regarded the operations of trusts with unconcern. I have always believed that legislation should be enacted to control them. I go further, and I say that in Australia we enjoy many advantages which will tend to prevent the undue creation of trusts, if Parliament is only watchful. But under the provisions of this Bill, if we do not create trusts, we shall call into being all the evils attendant upon them, and that without benefiting the public. It is not my intention to delay honorable members by speaking at greater length. I crave the indulgence of the House for the somewhat disjointed nature of my remarks. </para>

                    <para>Mr.WATSON (Bland).- I am one of those who have thought for a considerable time that there is great necessity to deal with what is perhaps the most outstanding feature of modern industrialism. The concentration of capital, its accumulation, and its greater power to-day, as compared with a few years ago, have led to developments in industrial organization that have been recognised by every inquirer into social events throughout the world. It is increasingly evident that, whether by State or any other form of Socialism, or whether by restrictive legislation, society will be compelled, in the ordinary march of events, to take some steps to curb the increasing power which is being vested in the hands of the few by the vast accumulation of capital, and by the better organization of industrial forces. I am far from denying that some forms of trusts or combinations of capital act in a most beneficent way. There can be no doubt that better organization leads, in the first instance, to economy of production and distribution. Nor can there be any doubt that by forming a trust any set of producers, manufacturers, or others can produce more cheaply, and put their goods on the market more economically, than they can when they are competing with each other, and absorbing a great deal of energy and money in keeping their goods before the market, and maintaining useless stocks. That is a truism that is recognised to-day all the world over. Modern methods tend in that direction, and it is useless to expect that Australia, any more than the rest of the world, will escape from all the evils which, in the present condition of society, follow in the train of irresponsible power. I was glad to hear the honorable and learned member for Wannon say, towards the close of his speech, that he believed in the public ownership of public utilities. That is a doctrine that the Labour Party, and a number who do not belong to that body, have been trying, for many years to instil in the minds of the community. But I was under the impression, in view of the campaign upon which the honorable and learned member&#39;s leader has entered, that private enterprise was to be the feature of the future, so far as Australia was concerned. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so. I quite agree with the honorable member as to the ownership of public utilities. The only point at issue between us is as to what constitutes a public utility. I hold that with improved organization, with the greater appreciation of the economy that follows upon organization, the conditions are changing, so rapidly that that which may not be regarded to-day as a public utility will inevitably be regarded as one to-morrow. As soon as one line of industry is under the control of one set of individuals, who, like the Standard Oil Trust, for instance, pay all their employes, from the manager down to the ordinary labourer, good wages, and so make them loyal to them, while, at be same time, they fleece the people a.t every available opportunity, we may expect others to be dealt with in the same way. Surely the Opposition must see that when such a condition of affairs is reached, one of two courses must be taken. Either legislation of this kind must be introduced, with the object of returning to the public some control, and of securing to them some chance of receiving the benefit of competition; or, on the other hand, the community must step in and, in some form or other, resume the industries, and work them for the public benefit. Apparently, therefore, it is only a question of time and degree, and circumstances, as between ourselves and the honorable and learned member for Wannon and his friends. </para>

I have followed, as closely as an outsider may do, the course of antitrust legislation in the United States, and I am free to confess that that legislation has not been attended with the degree of success that one would have liked. Apparently, a loophole has always been discovered, by means of which the law may be broken and its intentions evaded. But that should not deter us from making an effort in the same direction. There is no reason why we should not profit by the mistakes, if they be mistakes, of the United States, or, at all events, by the example which that country has set us. It may be that the measure which is now before us will not prove more effective than the legislation of the United States has done; but even if that be so. we shall have at least the satisfaction of knowing that we have tried ordinary methods before resorting to more extreme measures to secure the public interest.&#39; The United States have undoubtedly had a most trying experience, There is a great deal of truth in the suggestion put forward bv the honorable and learned member for Wannon that the private control of railways and other means of freight-carrying has had much to do with the abnormal success of some forms df trusts and combinations in that country. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. A number of factors have combined to help combinations in that country - factors which I admit do not exist here. But making allowance for that, it must become more and more apparent to capitalists as the years go by that they can run their businesses much more efficiently by an arrangement amongst themselves. That has been evidenced by the tobacco monopoly which exists to-day in Australia. As to the question of imports, I hold that we have a right to consider Australia&#39;s interest in regard to Australia&#39;s industries. It is al! very well for some honorable members to declare that it is to the interest, say, of the farmer that he should be able to obtain his harvesters at the cheapest rate. I admit that if the farmer could be assured that, as the result of fierce competition, he would be able for a considerable time ahead to purchase harvesters at a very -low rate, or even obtain them free of cost, some degree of benefit would immediately result to him. But whether that benefit would be equivalent to the collateral advantages of having the whole country a busy hive of industry, and so providing employment for his children and his children&#39;s -children, is a question I do not propose at present to argue. If the trust system of invasion of markets is to obtain in this country, in common with others, there is no reasonable guarantee that prices will remain at a low rate for any considerable time. It is the commonest of experiences that so soon as the dominant industrial concern has crushed competition out of existence, or rendered it so helpless that it can do nothing as against the larger enterprise, prices are put up to the highest possible limit, and the users of implements, or the consumers of other products similarly affected, are at the mercy of those who at first professed friendship for them. </para>

                            <para>- I do not say that an industry in which such incidents have occurred has been killed ; but competitors have been forced out of the market, and the dominant party has immediately increased its prices. It is only natural that any body of men who succeed to irresponsible power, whether it be in politics or industrialism, will abuse that power, and use it to the full est possible extent for their own personal advantage. It would be most unfortunate for the farmers of Australia if a foreign trust were able to force out of the market the local producers of implements, leaving them at the mercy of the manufacturer abroad. The International Harvester Trust, whose resources we are assured by all reports from America are almost illimitable, boasts that at present it holds 90 per cent. of the world&#39;s trade in implements. It is as clear as noonday that, in its endeavour to get possession of the Australian market, it will use every effort, first of all to scotch local competition, and secondly, to reimburse itself in respect of the losses incurred thereby, by forcing up prices as soon as it has obtained control. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly they are. When the Bill is under consideration in Committee, the honorable member will find that I am as anxious as I hope he is to curb local combines as well as those from outside. In my view, there is a reason for taking action in this connexion, so far as importations are concerned. Whether we are justified in following the lines laid down in the Bill is a matter for consideration when we come to deal with its details in Committee, and I do not propose to speak upon it at length at the present stage. I trust that the general principles of the measure will be affirmed. It is not. as some honorable members seem to think, proposed to confine the application of the Bill to importers ; it is intended to impose reasonable conditions upon local manufacturers, and to punish any attempt to create monopolistic combines in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Nothing is more adversely affecting the fortunes of our producers to-day than the existence of the local shipping ring to which the honorable member refers. The local companies, by an arrangement between themselves which is equivalent to the formation of a trust, are fleecing our consumers and producers alike, who are at the mercy of a little knot of men who control the shipping trade, and impose what freights they choose for the conveyance of goods from State to State. By an ingenious system of rebates, such as operates in the shipping trade all over the world, they bind to them those who have freights to send, in a manner which makes escape impossible. Only a little while ago I saw a letter from a man who complained of the treatment which his firm was receiving at the hands of the shipping companies, but who said that the information must be regarded as confidential, because he dare not think of what would happen if he publicly stated all that he knew in this connexion. </para>

                            <para>- That makes it so much the more difficult for an ordinary producer to break down a monopoly in it, and is an additional reason why the Government should interfere when there is an abuse of power by a combination. In ordinary businesses, in which any person who possesses a few pounds can set up, a monopoly is impossible. But the tendency of modern industry is such that an increasingly large amount of capital is required to start in any business, and consequently opposition is becoming increasingly difficult to establish. </para>

                            <para>- They tie the producers up in such a way that there is no escape. They are like the fly in the spider&#39;s web, and cannot break away without outside assistance. It rests with this Parliament to say whether they shall receive assistance, or remain victims to the rapacity of the combine. Then there is the tobacco combine. Up to the present the evidence of its malevolence towards the public is comparatively little, but it is only gathering strength, of which it will take advantage later on, when an opportunity presents itself So far, it has succeeded in lessening the cost of the production and distribution of tobacco very materially, but a distributing monopoly may work injury to the public, by increasing the price of tobacco. </para>

                    <para>Mi. WATSON.- There have been a number of such combinations. The Colonial Sugar Refining Company is another large monopoly. I was in error a year or two ago, when I said that the Millaquin mill, in Queensland, was their only competitor. I have since discovered that there is a refinery in Melbourne which is nominally a competitor. </para>

                            <para>- The point I wish to make is that the existence of two or three small concerns does not prove that there is not a monopoly. In America the concluding indictment against the great beef trust of Chicago was that it designedly allowed a few small concerns to exist, though it controlled 75 per cent. of the meat trade in the United States. That was intended to afford the public some sort of guarantee that the trust was not a monopoly ; whilst, at the same time, the combine fixed the prices at which beasts were to be bought, and also the prices at which meat was to be sold. The small proprietors were all right, so long as they remained civil ; but woe betide any one of them if he dared to cross the path of the big combine. He would find himself frozen out in a very short time. So long as the small men did not seek to run up the prices of the steers, or to unduly reduce the price of meat, they were allowed - as the lion allows the jackal to pick the bones after he has concluded his feast - to carry on their small operations. Therefore, the fact that there are two or three small concerns which carry on the refining of sugar in Australia, affords no proof whatever that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is not a monopoly which operates detrimentally to the public. I have been informed by those who have made this matter a study, that we pay for the refining of our sugar - that is, the &#34;difference -between the .cost of .raw. sugar and of the refined article - just double as much as people in other parts of the world are called upon to pay. </para>

If that be so, it is clear that the Colonial Sugar Refining Company is operating against the public interest.

                            <para>- I do not think that that would place the company beyond the scope of the Bill, if we thought fit to include it in the definition of &#34;trust.&#34; One honorable and learned member assured me that the definition of &#34; commercial trust,&#34; as set forth in the Bill, would allow of a single . company being brought within its purview, if it was acting detrimentally to the public interests. That is to say, the definition of &#34;commercial trust&#34; is wide enough to include a single company which can be proved to have done something in restraint of trade, and to the detriment of the public. If the Bill does not sp provide, it should, in my View, be made to do so. We should be able to summon the company before the bar of public opinion, and subject its operations to some sort of examination, in order to assure&#39; ourselves that the community is not being unfairly treated. In my opinion, the company is not treating the community well, but if it can demonstrate the contrary, I shall have no further cause of quarrel with it. If the Bill does not clearly indicate that the company will be affected, we should! amend it. Some reference has been made to the local harvester trust.&#39; In my view, a combination which keeps the price of harvesters up to ;&#163;8o per machine - or, as it was until recently, <inline font-style="italic">&#163;90</inline> per machine - is not treating the users fairly. The price of the machines should be reduced to considerably less &#39;than ,&#163;80. Of course, it is said - and there may be some truth in the statement - that the  methods  of pushing business adopted by their competitors from America, who have been able to spend more money than the business was worth for the time being, have forced our manufacturers to incur a similarly huge expenditure, which, of course, has been added to the cost of the machines. If that be the case, it only argues that our manufacturers must, in the interests of the consumers, organize their business on such lines that they will be able to sell the machines to the public at a price representing a fair advance on the cost of production. Therefore, we require legislation which will enable us to deal with local trusts and combines, and with monopolistic companies, whose operations are of the same nature. </para>

                            <para>- That is another question. There seems to be necessity for legislation affecting both the importers and the local manufacturers. In each instance, I think that we require, for the protection of the public, something partaking of the nature of this measure. I do not intend to say a great deal in criticism of the Bill itself. In the first place, I think it would be altogether wrong for us to intrust the selection of the Board that is suggested to any Minister, no matter who he may be. I believe that we have every right to be proud of the records of our Ministers of State generally, and I- have- no desire to cast the smallest reflection upon any one who has occupied, or who may occupy, the highly honorable position of Minister of Trade and Customs. </para>

                            <para>- I think that the action to which the honorable member refers was justifiable. I contend that if the Minister appoints the Board, he will be placed in a false position, and would be open to all kinds of imputations of unfairness in regard to matters of great importance. If a freetrade Minister were in power, and he happened to select a majority of free-traders, there would be an immediate outcry from the protectionists that they were not receiving fair play. Similarly, if a protectionist Minister were to appoint a majority of protectionists, a like outcry would be made bv the other side. Therefore, in the interests of the Minister himself, and especially in the interests of the public, who have a right to know upon unimpeachable authority what are the facts, it is highly desirable that no one of less standing than a Judge of the Supreme Court, or a Justice of the High Court, should conduct an inquiry of the description contemplated. In Canada, as has been pointed out, the Tariff provisions with respect to trusts enable an inquiry to be held, but it must be conducted by a Judge of the Supreme Court. In answer to the statement put forward by the Minister, that His Honour the President of the Arbitration Court felt that he would not care to undertake work of a semi-political character, I may say that the Judges of every Supreme Court in Australia, at one time or another, undertake, as Royal Commissioners, work of a character similar to that held in view. At present, Judge Rogers and Judge Owen are engaged in conducting inquiries of that description in New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The Judge would have to find only as to the facts, so far as they were ascertainable. And it would not be derogatory to a Justice of the High Court to ascertain facts such as would be brought under his notice in cases of the kind dealt with in the Bill.

Some time ago I expressed the view that the work of the Court would increase to such an extent that an additional Justice would be necessary. I was prepared, in the meantime, to vote for the appointment of three Justices only, with a view to ascertaining what the work would really amount to. It is being demonstrated more clearly every day that the work is growing to such an extent that we shall have to reconsider the matter. Therefore, the suggestion that a Justice of the High Court would not be able to find time for this work may be put aside. I think that Ministers should consider whether; there should not be some preliminary inquiry in regard to local combines before the Attorney-General takes action - just as is provided for before the Minister takes action in regard to imports. My own position is absolutely tentative, but it occurred to me that an inquiry might be held before we force on the Attorney-General the duty of taking action in the manner proposed. </para>

                            <para>- The present Attorney-General may be succeeded by one who will have a much narrower conception of his duties as a public officer. I must admit that there seems to be a great deal of force in the objection raised to the hurried consideration of this measure. I am strongly in favour of the principle embodied in the Bill, and I believe that there is grave necessity for taking action. But it must be admitted, even by the most enthusiastic members on this side of the House, that the Bill is a most important one, and will be far-reaching in &#39;its effects. </para>

                            <para>- In regard to those ends, I am quite at one with the Prime Minister. But the experience of anti-trust legislation in America is that there is considerable doubt as to how far it can be made effective. Because of that doubt, there is the greater need for us to pick our steps carefully, so that when the Bill is passed it will achieve its purpose. The Sherman Act, from which is taken that portion of the Bill which deals with local trusts and combines, has been in operation since 1890, and yet the trusts have continued to flourish. Amending legislation has since been enacted, and some of it is proving effective. How long it will take the trusts to break through the amending legislation it is difficult to say. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that the case is urgent. That, however, affords only a greater reason for so marshalling our forces that when we make the attack we shall be sure of demolishing the enemy. Upon that ground, I think &#39;that we should go no further at the present moment than to affirm the principle involved in the Bill. The delay of the few months that will elapse between the prorogation and the next meeting of Parliament - we cannot postpone its consideration for long, in view of the fact that we must go to the country in less than twelve months-- </para>

                            <para>- That is a detail that might be attended to. I cordially approve of this attempt to limit in some way the operation of trusts and combines. If a majority of honorable members feel that the Bill ought to be postponed, I trust that after having had an opportunity to study the measure in detail they will come prepared to pass it next year. In that way greater benefit will accrue than if we passed the measure in a hurry at the fag end of this session, when honorable members have had no chance to familiarize themselves with its full import. </para>

There are thousands of men in this country whose living depends upon the machinery which it would bring into operation. The honorable member for Bland has spoken of the great Beef Trust. Two years ago, the authorities were fighting that trust in America, and the other day many of the members of that trust re- turned to Chicago and surrendered, and were fined ,&#163;5,000. Two days afterwards the price of beef was raised 3d. per lb., and they thus secured enough profit to pay the fine. </para>

                            <para>- The moral which I draw is that while some people sing that America is &#34; the land of the free, and the home of the brave,&#34; it is not so. It used to be. Now it is the land of the boodler and the home of the slave. I say that this is the day of salvation. We ought to pass the Bill at once and give it six months&#39; trial. If it endangers the wellbeing of Australia we shall be in a position to repeal it. The same Parliament that enacts it can unmake it. I will not deny that honorable members are tired and worn out. I am more fit to be in the hospital than to be here. At the same time, whilst the livelihood of hundreds of native-born Australians are in jeopardy as the result of Wie operations of outside trusts and combinations, this Parliament should not prorogue without doing something for them. I believe that it is our duty, notwithstanding the feelings of my honorable friends in Opposition, to take action. We have a duty to perform, and as a labour protectionist I shall stand by any Bill of this character. In the United States, the trusts are stronger than the Government, and one of the greatest Presidents since George Washington has been fighting them for the past three years. But what has he accomplished? Absolutely nothing. The same thing will happen in this country if we do not legislate against it. I am satisfied that this Bill is the forerunner of Socialism. We have only one hope left. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bryan,</inline> who will be in Australia in the course of a few months, wrote to  President  Roosevelt some time ago as follows: - </para>

                        <para>. - I have listened attentively to some very able speeches which have been delivered to-day. I was specially interested in the utterance of the honorable member for Bland, who always makes a good speech when he deals with matters of this kind. I desire to say that it was not the wish of the Government to include in this Bill provision for the appointment of a Board. It was their intention, in the first instance, to appoint a Judge in lieu of that body. In regard to the appointment of the President of the Arbitration Court, to whom reference was made by the honorable member for Bland, I wish to say that an attempt was made to obtain his services for the position, but he did not consider he had time in conjunction with his other duties ; if, however, it is possible for that gentleman to fill the position, nobody would be more delighted than the Government, and I am confident that nobody would fill it better than <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> O&#39;Connor. Had we been able to appoint the  President  of the Conciliation and Arbitration Court to deal with these matters, I should have been relieved of a very great responsibility in administering this measure - a responsibility that I have no desire to have cast upon me. I have mentioned this matter merely to show that it was not the desire of the Government to refrain from providing that these questions should be dealt with by a Judge, but that, in the circumstances, we were compelled to provide for the appointment of a Board. The position of the Commonwealth is different&#39; from that occupied by New Zealand, since it consists of six. States, whilst New Zealand is a separate Colony. Had we been in the same position, no doubt we should have been able to select certain responsible persons, as has, been done there, to carry out this  Work.  I would remind honorable members, however, that we shall be able in Committee to deal with this and other questions. We shall be able for instance, to consider the desirableness of amending the provisions relating to trusts on the lines suggested by one of my honorable friends. I have already said that the Bill is a far-reaching one, but it rests with the Committee to decide whether it shall be. made even more so. I trust that honorable members will not consider that there has been any desire on the part of the Government to vest in themselves more power than is absolutely required for the proper administration of this measure, for, as I have already said, the responsibility which will be cast upon the Minister administering is one that I, for one, should be glad to see placed on others. </para>

                    <para>I am strongly opposed to all trusts that are calculated to injuriously affect the people. I hold that we should have a law dealing with combines who send their goods to Australia, as well as with local combinations; but I am anxious to see a Bill passed that will be in every way effective. We have been told that the anti-trust legislation of the United States has proved a failure, and, that being so, we should endeavour to profit by the experience of that country. It seems to me that by postponing the further consideration of this Bill until next session we shall be enabled to make it more effective. The honorable member for Darwin spoke of the failure of the anti-trust law of the United States to cope with the conditions created by the beef trust, and it seems to me that he furnished a strong argument for the postponement of this measure. Some remarks have been made as to the delay in bringing it forward. It must not be forgotten, however&#39;, that the Government took office shortly after the opening of the session, and consequently did not enjoy the advantage of a recess in which to prepare the necessary measures for our consideration. Nevertheless, we have been kept closely at work, and our record of legislation is better than is that of any previous session. As we are likely to meet again in a few months, </para>
                    <para class="block">I think we may well delay the consideration of this measure until then. That will not only enable us to give further attention to it, but will afford the people of Australia an opportunity to become fully seized of its purport. So far, most of the people of the Commonwealth have not learned of its provisions. I do not suppose that a copy of the Bill has yet reached the State of which I am a representative, and whilst I am a protectionist, I wish to fairly represent the free-traders in my constituency, and to give them an opportunity to express their views in regard to it. It would be much better if all Bills were circulated throughout Australia a few weeks before we are called upon to deal with them. We are legislating, not for a small State over which the mails can be distributed daily, but for a vast continent, and we should, therefore, give the people ample time to learn the effect of the measures with which we are called upon to deal. I am not blaming the Government for having introduced this Bill so late in the session. They have undoubtedly done good work. I recognise that they have succeeded in passing many measures, but I am extremely anxious that a Bill for the preservation of Australian industries shall be a thoroughly effective one. It is only because of that desire that I have been induced to submit this motion. If it be the intention of the Committee to deal with the Bill this session, I hope that the discussion will be brief and to the point. But, on the other hand, if the majority of honorable members support my motion, I trust that the Government will take it as an indication that, in our opinion, the further consideration of the Bill should be delayed until next session. </para>

                            <para>- I admit that, and grant that the strain upon honorable members has been severe. It has probably been greater noon some of us than upon the bulk of the House. But the stress upon ourselves, and even some imperfection in our work, may be overlooked in this case, since the bulk of the House appears to be at one in regard to the importance of the question and the greatness of the principle at stake. This is no new departure from my point of view. I have always regarded measures of this sort as amongst the most necessary safeguards in modern industrial legislation - as inseparable from the commercial developments that have taken place of recent&#39; years in civilized countries. Parliaments have either to face them in defence of the people whom they represent, or to consent to the passing of their powers into the control of the great financial corporations that are becoming a menace to the general prosperity and to the stability of democratic institutions. As soon as the first Administration of which I was the head began work, we took up the task where it; had been left by my then colleague, the right honorable member for Adelaide, and proceeded to frame a Trust Bill which should deal both with aggression from abroad and the possible growth of local capitalistic combinations. The experience both of the old world and the new has shown that if financial magnates are left to their own devices, under unrestricted competition, modern developments have worked such a transformation that what were at one time the characteristic conditions of &#34;a fair field and no favour &#34; have now become the conditions of the gravest tyranny of modern times. Experience has shown that it was a necessity that in the growth of industrialism there should be a time during which individual expansion was absolutely uncontrolled, and then a period when combination was recognised and authorized by law, with many beneficial results. But it was not then realized, as it has since been discovered, that corporate power and authority, with its distribution of responsibility and its concentration of the power of money, might become a serious danger. It has become a danger so great that there are now to be found intelligent and well-informed men who are asking themselves whether the limited liability principle, upon which present day operations so much depend, is not tending to work more injury than it is now working good. It has become clear that, if it is to be retained, it will have to be restrained - that the responsibility that has been evaded by its being divided into almost infinitesimal morsels will have to be restored to all corporations, and that, unless the State is prepared to see itself dispossessed by a larger power, it must exercise the authority it now enjoys to assert&#39; its primacy on behalf of the people. I do not intend to enter even upon an outline of the history of the development of the great modern trusts whose tentacles are visible in all directions, or to say a word more than is necessary to the consideration of this particular proposal. But I wish to point out to the Committee that the trust peril is not of our seeking. Its imminence has been forced upon us, not only by these general considerations, which I now dismiss, but by the fact that, as protectionists, and as men who aim at industrial justice, we have to deal with an invasion from abroad which, through our Customs law, brings us face to face with trusts and their deceptive tactics. What is their method of working ? A trust does not consist simply of a manufacturer, or a company, or a combination of manufacturers; nor does it consist only of a number of companies making goods of the same kind. If it did, it would be comparatively easy to deal with. But, as the experience of the United States has shown, a trust may include the company that mines raw ore, another company that manufactures it, a third company beyond it which sells the perfected article, a railroad company that transports it, an insurance company that insures it, and the steamers of accompany that conveys the product from place to place. That being so, how are we, in administering the <inline font-style="italic">Customs</inline> law of Australia, to endeavour to levy a duty upon the fair market value at the port? of shipment of the product of a trust? How are we to arrive at that value named in our law when we are dealing with a trust that in one or more of its agencies alters its manufacturing charges, its freight charges, its shipping and insurance charges, as it pleases? How is it possible for the Customs to discover by ordinary methods what is the! fair market value of the products of such a combination? That is the actual problem we have to face. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. We are confronted at the Customs by trusts the fair market value of whose products has to be ascertained amid entirely novel complexities, in a manner for which we have no precedents. But, having regard to the Tariff we have placed on the statute-book, we have to determine that value. If not, -our Customs duties would give an advantage to these corporations, as against every other importer, and as against our own Australian industries. We have not created this question ; it knocks at our doors. To preserve our Australian industries we must enter upon an investigation which will be difficult and complex. The Government spent more than two months in considering and reconsidering the subject, in the endeavour to find some tribunal which would command public confidence, and possess the knowledge and authority necessary to enable it to obtain the information required to arrive at any just determination. </para>

                            <para>- It is not an absolute law of nature, though no doubt it is desirable, that Parliament should be prorogued before Christmas. It would be better that we should meet again after Christmas, and sit as long as is necessary, giving the measure the consideration which it deserves, than that we should go away without having dealt with it. The Bill has been caricatured both inside and outside this Chamber, and we must submit to that, but, in itself, it is a simple measure. It merely provides that when an officer of high standing and long experience certifies that unfair competition exists - which we have attempted, though perhaps incompletely, to define for the guidance of those who will administer the law - an inquiry is to be held by the best tribunal possible. The Government can then acton the finding of that tribunal. It must be remembered that the Government must take full responsibility for everything which is done under the measure. It will act with its life in its hands, conscious that it must answer to Parliament and to the constituencies. If the inquiry shows that the impression that competition was unfair was a mistaken one, if suspicion is discovered to be unfounded, or a case cannot be proved, no injury will be done, beyond the causing of inconvenience incidental to the probing into the circumstances of particular firms. The prohibition that may be used, if unfair competition is proved, is not the prohibition of all goods of a certain kind imported from abroad, but the prohibition of the goods of particular companies or corporations which are so linked together as to form a trust. It is aimed at a redressing of the balance, so as to put fair importers on the same level, and to do justice to all Australian industries. </para>

The first part of the Bill merely provides that, where unfair competition is suspected, an impartial inquiry shall be instituted, and the Government must take the responsibility for acting on the facts which are found. The cases which will be dealt with are few, and, at the present time, suspicion points to only two or three instances. </para>

                            <para>- That Commission is doing excellent work in considering the effect of the Customs duties on the normal conditions of trade; it is no part of its heavy task to inquire into the importations of trusts, which are abnormal. They could never be dealt with by a protective Tariff. If duties were imposed high enough to prevent the operations of trusts, they would prohibit all honest importations as well, and honorable members opposite would not like to see&#34; that done. All that is proposed is that, if importers form themselves into combination&#39;s, such as I have described, and import their goods in breach of the fair conditions set forth in the Bill, they shall be dealt with and the industries of Australia shall be protected, until Parliament can pronounce upon the action which the Government has thought fit to take. </para>

                            <para>- That is the main provision as regards trusts ; but, as the honorable member pointed out, there is a general provision against dumping, when exercised upon a scale worthy of the application of this complicated and elaborate procedure. Minor importations would not be worth noticing. The second part of the Bill deals with trusts operating within, as well as with those operating without, Australia. There the provisions of the Sherman law have been so ameliorated as to be capable of application to Australian conditions. These clauses will provide a means of bringing to book those engaged in enterprises which, highly advantageous to the few rich, are destructive to deserving Australian industries. Those two statements summarize, with a few exceptions, the provisions of the Bill. In both instances there is to be an inquiry ; the parties concerned being heard, and only those who are attacking our producers being dealt with, while Parliament will have ample control of the actions of the Government, and will be able to punish any abuse of the power intrusted to it. Are not those proposals simple and fair? Could any simpler proposals be made for the protection - of Australian industries which deserve to be protected? </para>

                            <para>- There will be no obstacle raised by the Government to any improvements which honorable members may suggest in the phraseology of the Bill. All we desire is to get a good effective measure. There will be no clinging to words or to phrases. What we want is authority to take action after there has been at\ independent inquiry into the facts. All we seek is the opportunity to protect honest Australian industries. We therefore appeal to the House to consider the measure, and, if they can, to make its provisions more adaptable to our circumstances while passing it into law. We shall welcome suggestions for its improvement. I admit that this .is pioneer legislation. In America they have been trying for fifteen years to pass effective trust laws, and have not yet succeeded, though they appear to be on the verge of doing so. </para>

The lords of finance there, who have their fingers in insurance businesses, railways, shops, transport, telegraphs, telephones, and every other form of enterprise, have created conditions in America which are very different from those in this country. We may envy the United States their material prosperity, the ability, and energy of their people, and their rapid progress: but there are many other things which we do not envy, and from which we pray to be delivered. We should use our best efforts to protect ourselves in time against many of the abuses now rampant in America. This Bill is an attempt to do so. This will not be the last legislation of the kind which Parliament will have to pass; it is only the beginning. Neither if we deal with the Bill now, nor if we put it aside, shall we see the end of it. We cannot evade the issue. Honorable members wish to put off dealing with it for a few months ; but why not give the &#39; Government the simple powers which this Bill offers, or whose exercise will practically be confined to an investigation during the period when Parliament is not in session. Then when we meet again facts will have been proved by an independent and impartial authority, on which action can be taken. </para>

                            <para>- Of&#39; course, we can do something. The wheels of Government- will not be stopped if the Bill is not passed. But it would be better if we could proceed on a path marked out beforehand, and by a means which would allow the promptest action to be taken. I recognise that the strain of this session has been great, and particularly during the last few weeks; more than honorable members should ordinarily be asked to bear. I therefore do not blame those who complain that it is more than they are able to sustain. But, having been able to thresh out and to reduce to their simplest terms, two plain propositions which will enable us to deal with trust or dumped imports from abroad and trusts at home, let us make a beginning with the work which we must undertake for the preservation of Australian industries. I venture to appeal to honorable members, even at this late stage of the session, to make still greater personal sacrifices, so that we shall not go into recess until an effective measure has been placed on the statute-book. If we do so, we shall enjoy our holidays much more than if Parliament is prorogued, and we go to our homes knowing that we did not grapple with this difficulty when we had an opportunity to do so simply, justly, and effectively. </para>

If that is a mistaken idea, the position should be squarely faced. I am entirely in favour of the measure, but it seems to be impossible to pass it within the short time remaining at our disposal before the close of the session. Let me say. in answer to the Prime Minister, that there is no idea of taking the business out of the hands of the Government, or of inflicting any humiliation upon them. I understand that the motion for the second reading was agreed to out of consideration for the Government. </para>

                        <para>- I should not have addressed the Committee had it not been for the remarks uttered by the Prime Minister. I consider it due to myself that I should explain the position in which I stand with regard to the Bill. I have accorded to the Government very liberal support since they have taken charge of the public business, and I stood by them when they adopted special measures to prevent the Opposition from further obstructing business. I then told them that I would do all that I could to assist them in carrying out their programme. I did not understand, however, that we should be asked to deal with a number of measures which honorable members have had no opportunity of considering. I have been absent for a few days, and upon my return this morning, I found that the Government had introduced an entirely new piece of legislation, which would seriously affect the commercial and industrial interests of the whole of the Commonwealth. I do not intend to vote for any measure with the provisions of which I am not conversant. I have not been able to even read the Bill, far Jess to make myself acquainted with its provisions, or to judge as to its probable effects. The speeches which have been delivered by members of the Government, and other honorable members, should serve to present matters in a clear light to the electors, and I think that having proceeded so far, the Government will be very ill-advised if they force the matter further at the present time. I am not opposed to legislation directed to the restriction of the operations of trusts, but I will not commit myself to panic legislation, and especially when I do not understand its purport. Whilst I am prepared to maintain an open mind, and to study the question as fairly as I can, I shall not support the Government if they per.sist in their efforts to force this legislation through during the closing hours of the session. If the measure is of such great importance as Ministers represent, why was it not introduced at an earlier stage? The Attorney-General was very anxious to secure the appointment of the Tariff Commission, which is now investigating, among other things, the condition of the iron industry, and the influence exerted upon it by the operations of foreign trusts. Yet we are being asked to pass this Bill without having the results of that investigation before us. Surely, we are entitled fo know what is the finding of the Commission. If the matter is one of urgency, why has not the Commission, which comprises a number of protectionist honorable members, brought forward its report? It seems to me very much as if those who were engaged in the agricultural implement industry were rather afraid of the result of the inquiry conducted by the Commission, and that they wanted to force the House into taking action which would not be justified if&#39; the full facts were made known. That is one of the reasons why I view this Bill with suspicion. I want more information with regard to it, before I commit myself to supporting it. I hope that time will be given to the public, and to those who would be specially affected by the Bill, to fully consider it&#39; in all its bearing. I would recommend the Government to postpone its further consideration for the present, so that it mav be dealt with at a later stage, when the result of the inquiries made by the Tariff Commission are before us. If the report of the Commission justifies such a course, the Government should ask honorable members to meet early next year, and deal with the matter. In view of the suspicious circumstances surrounding the Bill, I cannot support it. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot understand why honorable members should hesitate to go on with the Bill. There can be only one explanation, and that is that they are anxious to get away into recess. I think that honorable members should be prepared to deal with this important matter without delay, because there is no doubt as to the urgency of the situation. If we cannot deal with the Bill before the Christmas holidays, we should meet early again in January. Personally, I am prepared to go right on. The measure is a simple one, and its purpose is quite clear. It confers upon the authorities certain powers of investigation, which will relieve the Minister of Trade and Customs of the necessity of taking action such as that for which he was recently denounced. I shall certainly support the Prime Minister in his desire to proceed with the Bill this session. If he does not do so, I trust that we shall meet during the first week of January for the purpose of dealing with this very important question. </para>

                            <para>- I am quite aware of that. But certain allegations have been made, and I say that we could have vested the Government with extraordinary powers to deal with this special case. Subsequently we could have considered the general question of trusts. As it is, we are being rushed into legislation which the Minister of Trade and Customs himself admits is very far-reaching. During the past two days I have endeavoured to ascertain how far it will reach, but I have been unable to &#34;do so. It mav interfere with every business enterprise in the country, and we ought to have time to consider it in all its bearings, and to deal with it calmly and judicially. If the harvester trust threatened to ruin our local industry, I believe that the House would arm the Government with plenary powers to meet the case. </para>

                        <para>- I very much regret that the House, in its wisdom, cannot see its way clear to proceed with the consideration of this Bill. It is a very important measure, and any reader who is conversant with the political literature of the world must recognise that trusts are a source of danger. The Japanese, for whom the honorable and learned member for Parkes has so great an admiration, have grasped the tobacco trust by the throat, and have practically crushed it out of existence. Surely he should assist to pass legislation of this character. Might I suggest to the Prime Minister that, if we cannot pass this Bill this session, we should proceed with other work, and have a special session in January for the purpose of dealing with the question. I regard this as the most important Bill that has been submitted for our consideration during the current session. What have we to fear ? Even if the Bill were carried in a form which was far from perfect, does anybody suggest that harm would result? What Statute is perfect? If we approved of this Bill at the present time, the Government would have an opportunity during the recess of formulating a better measure, the merits of which would appeal to every honorable member. Surely this is not going to be made a party question. Personally, I always respect a free-trader who is honest in his convictions, because I know that he will certainly help his own race in preference to another. Within the past few days I was visited by an old schoolmate of mine - one of many who have lost their positions as the result of the operations of this harvester trust. He said : &#34; You have known me for years, and you are aware that I cannot save much when I have to support a family of eight. I have a little home for which I pay no rent; but I am feeling the pinch now that I am for the third week out of employment.&#34; I repudiate the suggestion that I am speaking on behalf of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay.</inline> As a matter of fact, I have reason to loathe one of his actions. I know that he removed from Melbourne in. order to avoid complying with the Factories Act. But in this Bill there is a principle involved. There are other manufacturers who are honestly endeavouring to comply with the law, and it is on their behalf that I am speaking. I say that if we cannot pass the Bill before the session closes, we should meet in January for the purpose of dealing with this question. Surely within a fortnight we should be able to pass a Bill which would permit the Government to do all that is necessary before the beginning of next session. </para>

                        <para>- Any idea that honorable members could give this Bill reasonable consideration before Christmas is manifestly absurd. That might have been possible if the measure had dealt only with one foreign trust. Under the circumstances, I shall certainly vote for its postponement. So far as the prorogation is concerned, that is a matter for the Government to consider. If they desire that Parliament should re-assemble in January, in order that this matter may be properly considered, I shall certainly be one to attend. </para>

The feeling is that we have passed through a very long and arduous session. It is all very well for the honorable member for Melbourne to suggest holding a special session. He must, however, recollect that his home is in Melbourne. </para>

                            <para>- If Parliament were to meet in January at Charters Towers, what possible hope should we have of getting a House? I am sure that the honorable member for Melbourne would attend, but he and I would be about the only members present. We must recollect that the representatives of the distant States should at least be afforded an opportunity to get into touch with their constituencies. If I were to devote six solid months to canvassing, I could not visit every part of my electorate. When honorable members appreciate that fact, they will understand why it is necessary that we should have some recess. I contend that it is our duty to visit every portion of our constituencies. Those who reside in the outlying parts should not be neglected in favour of those who live in more populous centres. I hope that the Government will consent to defer the consideration pf this measure until next session. I say unhesitatingly that if I thought that by voting for the motion I should reflect the least discredit on the Government, I should .refrain from doing so. But I do not consider that any such construction could be placed upon my action. From what I have heard from various honorable members, it would appear that there is a general desire that the further consideration of the Bill shall be postponed until next session, in order that the House may have a reasonable opportunity to investigate the whole subject, and I may tell the honorable member for Melbourne that if this course be followed, he will obtain support from quarters whence he least expects it. </para>

                        <para>- I regret exceedingly that it is apparently impossible this session to reach finality in the consideration of this Bill. But there is nothing to prevent the Government from -appointing a strong judicial Committee to make full inquiries into the question of the importation of harvesters. Having been placed in possession of the information so obtained, together with the evidence taken before the Tariff Commission, the Government should experience no difficulty next session in carrying into law such a measure as this. To my mind, however, the Bill, as presented, is not strong enough ; it will not safeguard the interests of the workers or the consumers, and I candidly confess that I am more concerned with those sections of the community than I am with local or foreign combinations of manufacturers. I hope that if the motion be carried, the Bill will be brought forward next session in such a form that it will deal effectively, not only with foreign trusts, but with those formed in Australia. I trust that it will cover the Sugar Refining Company, and the tobacco monopoly, as well as the brickmaking and pottery combines, and, indeed, every other trust. I shall vote with the Government ; but if they be defeated on this motion. I trust that they will appoint a Committee to make full inquiry, and that its report will be ready for our consideration when we meet next session. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that the Government will be defeated on this question, for, although several honorable members have urged the postponement of the clause they are certainly not opposed to the Bill. I shall vote with the Ministry, although at the present time T feel that the House is stale, and that at this late stage of the session we cannot bring to bear upon this question that freshness of mind that is so absolutely necessary to its proper decision. The constituency which I represent is, perhaps, more closely interested in this matter than are many others ; but I do not think that the importations of harvesters that may take place between now and January will seriously affect the position. It is not the fault of the Government that the Bill has been delayed; and I think they ought to be satisfied with the splendid work that they have accomplished this session. As a straight out Government supporter, I appeal to them to agree to the postponement of the Bill, in order that we may be able to approach its consideration early next session with clear minds and renewed energy. </para>

                            <para>- I am told on credible authority that thousands of mortgage deeds are being sent out with the harvesters of the International Company, that the company is taking liens over the goods and chattels of the farmers, and that in time to come we shall find here a foreign garrison, which is very undesirable. I am not speaking from mere hearsay. I have seen one of these forms, and the agents of the company are travelling from place to place, obtaining the liens that I have mentioned. Therefore &#34;now is the accepted time&#34; for the passing of this Bill. We have been told that there is no hurry; but I would say, with the utmost earnestness, that it is not a case of Hannibal being at the gate. Hannibal is inside, and if we pass the Bill only for the purpose of coping with the operations of the International Harvester Trust, we shall do good work. It has been said that tHat combination might be dealt with bv special legislation ; but such legislation is always bad. It is highly desirable that we should pass such a Bill as this, rather than appoint a Commission or special tribunal to investigate the harvester question. As to the suggestion that it should be referred to the Tariff Commission., I maintain that the question is entirely beyond their province. If the allegations we have heard with regard to the deliberate attempt to stifle native industry be true, the harvester combine deserves but little sympathy. There is a question of patriotism involved. Are we to see our natural industries wantonly stifled while we stand idly by? Yet that is being done by the importers&#39; monopoly. If it be only a matter of the convenience or inconvenience of honorable members - the hurrying away to eat mince pies and roast turkey at Christmas - let us throw such considerations to the winds, and determine to complete the proper business of the session. </para>

                        <para>- These clauses as they stand are of such a character that I am satisfied that the High Court would not investigate a case without requiring that the two parties should be represented by either counsel or attorney. No Court that desires to carry on its business expeditiously would willingly permit two parties, unless they showed themselves to have the competence of counsel, to conduct their own cases. . Therefore, the Committee may assume that the High Court would in every case require the parties to be represented. The clauses provide that one suitor may recover from the other costs amounting to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;100.</inline> I would ask honorable members whether they consider that that is a condition that ought to exist? I pleaded for the High Court, because I considered that it was an eminently superior, and more impartial tribunal than a Committee of the House. But we know very well that parties can appear before an Elections and Qualifications Committee without incurring any costs. I want honorable members to see where these clauses will lead them. They would expose the poor candidate, who might fail in his suit, on account of the neglect of some electoral officer, to the risk of having to pay &#163;100 ; and as no Court would undertake to hold an inquiry without ordering the suitors to be represented, there is every chance of that amount being incurred. </para>

                    <para>- I wish to thank the Minister for having introduced the clause. I think that he has more than kept his word. I shall not, however, rest content, but shall, at the first opportunity, endeavour to take all these inquiries out of the jurisdiction of the High Court. I do not think that suitors in election disputes should be put to the expense of even&#163;100. I think that where a justifiable difference of opinion exists as to the result of an election, the parties should be able to get justice without incurring any cost whatever. There is no reason why the Government should not appoint counsel to act for both parties. I am afraid that under the conditions spoken of by the honorable and learned member for Parkes, the costs as between lawyer and client would be just as great as at present. </para>

                    <para>- I think that the clause will make some difference, because if discretion is vested in the Court, the result will probably be that where facts only are involved they may dispense with counsel, and that where matters of law are likely to arise they will permit them to appear. I should like to ask the Minister whether he is quite sure that the question of allowing counsel to appear can be determined before the Court actually sits. It would be unfortunate if the parties did not know beforehand that counsel would be permitted to appear on their behalf. The poor litigant would save nothing if he briefed counsel before the Court sat, and then found that his legal representative could not appear for him. </para>

                        <para>- My experience of the High Court is the reverse of a pleasant one. &#39; The honorable and learned member for Parkes has said that under this provision it would be within the power of that tribunal to order the parties to any disputed election to be represented by counsel. If so, I say that the first paragraph of the clause is valueless, and I do not see much virtue in the second paragraph, which declares that in no case shall more than one counsel or solicitor appear on behalf of any party. I know that in the case which . I contested, three eminent barristers were engaged on the opposite side. </para>

The underlying principle of the clause is that, subject to certain modifications which are absolutely necessary, no party shall be represented by counsel or solicitor. In the first place, neither counsel nor solicitor are to appear except by consent of all parties. If the parties agree to counsel being briefed, no one can find fault with the adoption of that course. In the next place, a party is not to be represented by counsel or solicitor except by leave of the Court. It is quite possible that where the parties had refused to agree to legal assistance being retained, the presiding Justice would not exercise his discretion to allow counsel to appear. I feel confident that he would exercise it only when there was some important question of law to be investigated in the interests of the parties concerned. </para>

                        <para>- The reserving of judgment leads to increased cost. Our desire is that decisions shall be given as expeditiously as possible. I urge honorable members not to accept the amendment, for in the light of my own experience, I think that the presiding Justice would sometimes find it invaluable to have counsel appearing. By passing the clause as it stands,, we shall, in effect, exclude counsel from the Court in relation to the consideration of questions of fact. Practically, this will be simply a Court of investigation. I ask honorable members to consider the position of the parties themselves. A litigant might have a very complicated and difficult question of law to face, or awkward points raised by an astute opponent. Besides, I ask the Committee to remember the absolute helplessness of some persons, even in appearing before a Committee of Elections and Qualifications. It is not every man who is gifted with the power of speech and of reasoning, or is able to properly put his case before a tribunal. </para>

Moreover, I ask the Committee not to do the Court the injustice of depriving it of the assistance which is essential if we are to have sound decisions on important questions of law. If what is done now does not prove satisfactory, it will be possible for us to make further amendments of the law, and I have already promised to do my best to obtain a simpler procedure, so that we may have what all desire - an impartial Court, which will try cases in the most expeditious and cheapest manner possible. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. CAMERON</inline>(Wilmot).- Before the establishment of this Court election petitions were heard by a Committee of this House, a procedure which, I believe, is followed in come of the States Parliaments. That Committee not being composed of legal men, there might have been some reason for giving it legal assistance ; but surely a properly qualified Judge should be able to decide cases coming before him without the help of counsel.&#39; Of course, if all the parties wish to employ counsel, I have no objection to that being done, but I hope that the amendment of the honorable member for Melbourne will be carried. </para>
                <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. CHANTER</inline>(Riverina). - When Parliament established the Court of Disputed Returns it provided that it should be guided by the substantial merits and good conscience of each case coming before it, without regard to legal forms or technicalities, or the laws of evidence. Our wish was to create a tribunal before whom any man could appear and state his case, without being hindered by a want of knowledge of legal procedure. The Court is not called upon to decide matters of law ; those can be dealt with by the Full Court. The marginal note of section 199 of the principal Act reads, &#34;Real justice to be observed.&#34; I naturally feel very strongly about this matter, because I have been through the mill, and ground pretty small, and I know what a serious mistake Parliament made in setting up the present tribunal. I hope that we shall get back again to this Court, which is the highest in the land. Even if the clause is amended as proposed, there will be nothing to prevent a party who is sufficiently wealthy from , feeling eminent counsel to sit alongside him, and prompt him in regard to legal procedure. I want to prevent that sort of thing. I shall vote for the amendment, because I think that, if carried, it will improve the clause ; but I hope that we shall yet retrace our steps, and make a Parliamentary Committee the Court of Disputed Returns. </para>
