                    <para>. - By leave of the House I desire to say a few words in the nature of a personal explanation. This is the first time in my political career that I can recollect any necessity for making such a statement ; but my honorable and learned friend, the member for Ballarat, feels that 1 have done him a grave injustice, and I certainly would not willingly do an injustice to any member of Parliament, but would rather err on the other side. In speaking the other night, I drew attention to certain communications which, apparently, from the report of his speech at Ballarat, had been made by him to a large number of 'his friends throughout the Commonwealth. He said that, in consequence of these communications, he had had to delay making his speech until just before the opening of the session. I have re-read carefully the whole of the speech, and I think that the honorable and learned member will now feel inclined to agree with me that his remarks on this subject were rather unfortunately worded, and that it is indeed unfortunate that they were put into the speech at all. I stated that I thought that, as he .was communicating with his friends, he should also have communicated with me. As he has said, and as I have already mentioned, he did on one occasion see me at the Treasury for a little while, and we talked about the effect of a report from the Tariff Commission coming before Parliament during the then ensuing session. I said that I could not see how such a report could be made, and pointed out what I had said when the Commission was originally mooted, with regard to my view that if a report were presented I could take no part in doing anything to break the pledge which I had made to my constituents. My honorable and learned friend assures me that he ,has had no more communication, and indeed that he had not as much communication with any other honorable member as he had with me on that occasion. I willingly accept his assurance. If the communications he made to others were no greater than that he made to me, they were not very great. I cannot, however, get away from my opinion that my honorable and learned friend should, before speaking at Ballarat, have discussed more fully with me what he was going to say, seeing that I have occupied a position which I think he ought to have occupied. On his assurance that I was mistaken with regard to the communications ,he spoke of, and that he had no greater communication with other honorable members, or with other persons who were not members, than he had with me, I withdraw any imputation which I may have made in regard to this matter. I accept without hesitation his assurance, but I say that the wording of his speech was very unfortunate. I could draw no other conclusion than that I drew from his remarks. At the same time, since he feels that I have done him an injustice, although I still hold the view that I was entitled to a greater communication in connexion with his speech than I received, I willingly accept his assurance, and hope that any wrong impression which may have gone forth and injured his reputation will cease. </para>

                        <para>- As this may be the last opportunity I shall have for a little while to speak from this bench. I should like" to convey to the Prime Minister and his colleagues, on behalf of the members of the direct Opposition, our reciprocation of the most generous feeling that he has evinced during the time that he has been in office. I am sure that for every one of the members of the Ministry we. on this side, have the highest personal respect. We have had to differ very materially from them, and welcome their disappearance from office; but that is quite another matter from our personal feelings in regard to them. As we might have expected from the long political experience of most of them, there is nothing to which exception could be taken in regard to anything but their policy, to which we decidedly object. </para>

                            <para>- The portfolio might be in worse hands. A man named William Thomas Sheehan has been detained at Queenscliff by the military authorities, in my opinion altogether against the law, and certainly in violation of the rights which every man in the Commonwealth should enjoy as a British citizen. Sheehan enlisted a few months ago at the Victoria Barracks, Melbourne, in response to an advertisement for recruits. He assures me - and his statement is confirmed by three other men who were recruited at the same time - that he was told that if he did not like the service he could obtain his discharge upon applying to the proper authorities within three months, and paying the release fee of £2. He states that this information was conveyed to him by the enlisting officer, Sergeant-major Paul. I have taken the trouble to verify the statements, and I find that a similar promise was held out to other recruits who were enlisted at about the same time. For reasons that were good or bad, Sheehan did not like the service, and within the prescribed period tendered his release fee of£2 and applied for his discharge. He now finds, however, after having been three months in the service, that he cannot obtain his discharge, and he is threatened with punishment if he deserts. I wrote to the Minister conveying the statements communicated to me by Sheehan, and I have received a reply which reads as follows : - </para>

                            discharges under Part X., para. 18, of the Regulations, as you know, no soldier in the Permanent Forces can claim his discharge until the expiration of his term of service; but he may, at any time within three months after enrolment, obtain his discharge free, if approved by the District Commandant. I understand that in the case under notice the Commandant did not so approve. Sheehan, it is stated, did apply to see the Commandant, who, however, did not see him, but gave a decision as before mentioned. Sheehan does not appear to have made any request for his application to be referred beyond the Commandant.

If he deserts, he will be cast into gaol at Queenscliff for seven days with hard labour, 'and will be detained in barracks for a further similar period. It may be a mere trifle to the Minister that a man should be detained contrary to the terms of enlistment as explained to him by the sergeant-major- </para>

All these men were promised, by the only noncommissioned officer whom they saw prior to enlistment, that they would have the right of discharge at the end of three months, and it seems unfair that they should be now denied an opportunity to leave the service if they so desire. Sheehan is now virtually confined to barracks, and is not permitted to see the Commandant to make his complaint. If he makes his escape he will be punished as a deserter, and he is unable to see the District Commandant. ' In the communications sent to the Commandant the reasons given by Sheehan for wishing to obtain his discharge are not properly or fully stated by the Commanding Officer, and I contend that he has been most unjustly dealt with. </para>

I have made full inquiries, and I know that Sheehan's representations were not properly conveyed to the District Commandant. The Commanding Officer, instead of allowing Sheehan to see the District Commandant, and to make his complaints, forwarded an incomplete statement of his own.- The Minister has a statement of what Sheehan's complaints were, and also of what was sent along by <inline font-weight="bold">Major Hawker.</inline> It is the right of every man, whether he be a soldier or a citizen, to state his own case, and not to have some one else's words put into his mouth. He should have the right which he now has not got to put his own complaints in writing. I think that the Minister even, during the short time for which he may remain in office, should make further inquiries into this matter. </para>

                        <para>- I crave the indulgence of the House to bring under notice a matter of some importance. Information which has been conveyed to me tends to show that a promise made to honorable members by the Treasurer is in danger of being broken. When the last Estimates were under discussion, he told us that the Public Service classification would be subject to the review of this House before any action was taken. I am informed that a number of postmasters who have hitherto been classified as senior to certain telegraph operators have been reduced to the position of juniors. I am informed, further, that the Public Service Commissioner has directed these telegraph operators to at once take up the senior positions. If that course be pursued, the postmasters will practically lose their rights, and the hands of the House will be so tied that it will be impossible to remedy any injustice that may have been done. I would, therefore, ask the Minister for Home Affairs to make inquiries with a view to insuring that no steps shall be taken to carry out the classification scheme until honorable members have had full opportunities to discuss it. </para>

A large number of officers will be placed at a great disadvantage by the proposed change and I hope that the Minister will give honorable members an opportunity of considering the classification scheme before they are asked to vote supplies for the current year. It is highly important that the rights of these officers should be protected and legally defined before supplies are voted. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly. I am sure that had we been capable, in the emotional circumstances of last Thursday, of following one another's remarks as closely as would be possible under normal conditions, no misunderstanding would have arisen, because, prior to the speech of the right honorable gentleman, I had already mentioned to the House that the words I had used with reference to the communications which had passed between myself and other honorable members and persons with regard to the political situation had been enlarged very much beyond the meaning I had intended to convey. The communications referred to were mainly by letter, and were replied to in 'my customary way, which, as honorable members know, is, even for correspondence, rather brief. The comments were almost invariably made by my correspondents, and my replies related only to the two general questions mentioned by me to Ministers, and in no way to the position of the Ministry. I felt sure that, after having called attention to these remarks, and having given him an opportunity to read them, the right honorable gentleman would see that his inference that I had in any respect treated him less considerately than others, was unjust, and that, on the contrary, I had expressed my views to him far more fully than to any one else, except his leader, the Prime Minister. With reference to the feelings which have existed between honorable members and- Ministers, I may say that the pleasant relations between myself and Ministers have remained unbroken during the whole term of office of the present Government, and that in any communications they have had with me they have in every instance observed the most strictly constitutional and proper procedure. </para>

If it could be shown that any man had been unjustly detained in barracks at Queenscliff, this House would willingly see that the wrong was righted. The Minister may assume that he has no further responsibility, but I would remind him that he has failed to abolish; the infamous rule that a member of the rank and file of the Royal Australian Artillery should not be permitted to submit himself for examination with a view to qualifying for a commission. </para>

                            <para>- Then the information given to me some time ago is absolutely at variance with the facts. I know of an Australian who served in South Africa and was honoured by promotion to a position of commissioned rank in the British Army, but who, upon his return to Australia, was not allowed to retain the title which he had earned on active service. The Minister was written to on this subject, and the reply received from him was a tissue of absurdities. </para>

                            <para>- I apologize to the honorable and learned member if I have misunderstood him. On receiving a letter from him relative to the case of Sheehan, I immediately sent for the papers, and obtained all the information that I could1 in reference to it. I confess that I do not remember all the details set forth in the papers, although it is only a week since I saw them. One deals with so many matters as a Minister that one cannot always recall all the facts of a particular case ; but my recollection is that, so far as I could understand from the papers, Sheehan was fully advised of the regulations under which he was enlisting; that he enlisted voluntarily, and that on the facts before me, he had no just ground for complaint. The honorable and learned member for Corio now makes a number of statements as to the general course of procedure in the Permanent Artillery. </para>

                            <para>- I am emphatically informed that they were. I have not treated this or any, other matter lightly. It is true that I did not personally make inquiries in regard to it. I could not go to Queenscliff in search of the officer who swore these men, but I was informed that he stated personally that he read the regulations to them, and that they knew the terms on which they were enlisted. Sheehan objects to certain regulations in regard to food and clothing - he does not like wearing a white helmet, nor does he care for paying for vegetables. </para>

For the mr&gt; ment, I was inclined to believe that it was also to be found in the letter on the subject which the honorable and learned member addressed to me. So far as I can recollect, one of the man's complaints was that he had to pay id. per day for vegetables for the mess. </para>

                            <para>- I shall see that the further allegations that have been made are inquired into, but I must certainly object to the assertion that I have disregarded this man's rights. I have done all within my power to inquire into the matter, but unfortunately I shall not be permitted to remain long enough in office to fully investigate it. That is not my fault, although it may be Sheehan's misfortune. The liberty of the subject is just as dear to me as it is to any one else. I have done all that I can in regard to the complaint, but the fresh facts which have been brought forward must be investigated. I cannot accept the unsupported statements of the honorable and learned member for Corio, because they are merely based on hearsay ; they must be investigated before action is taken upon the assumption that they are correct. I have only to say in conclusion that I will leave a minute on record directing attention to the matter, and that so far as I am concerned, it shall be inquired into. </para>

                        <para>- I rise to correct a misapprehension that has arisen in regard to my failure to vote in the division upon the amendment to the Address-in-Reply. Owing to my keen regard for cleanliness and to the primitive methods in this modern structure whereby honorable members may satisfy their desires in that respect - as well as to the tactics of honorable members on the Government side who allowed a most important debate to suddenly collapse - I was unable to be in my place in the House on Friday when the division took place. I was thus prevented from recording a vote which I should have cast with very great pleasure. I realize that had I been able to record my vote on that occasion I should have done a service to the country. I should have assisted also in the effort to give the Prime Minister of the day an opportunity to study the Socialism of the Labour Party so that he might not further trench on ground with which he was unfamiliar. Before a general election takes place the right honorable gentleman will have an opportunity to fully study the question and at least to do justice to the party which has given him this opportunity for reflection and repentance. </para>
