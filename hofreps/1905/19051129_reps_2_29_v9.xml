To do so would involve a serious delay which it is imperative to avoid if the difficulties attending the negotiations for the existing service are not to be repeated. </para>

                    <para class="block">I consented to the postponement of this motion yesterday, because I had no desire to interfere with the arrangement entered into between Ministers and other honorable members with regard to certain business. I think, however, that the matter should be disposed of to-day. The ruling to which I take exception was given during the debate upon the proposed new standing orders. Whilst I was speaking, the Deputy Speaker, with whom I regret to have to disagree, called me to order for repeating an argument which had been already used by another honorable member in the same debate. He referred to standing order 276, which reads as follows: - </para>

                    <para class="block">I should like to draw attention to the fact that no question of irrelevance or tedious repetition was involved, but that a broad ruling was given in the terms I have indicated. I respectfully submit that when the Deputy Speaker gave his decision he was under a misapprehension as to the ruling which you, sir, had already given. You were very careful in giving the ruling recorded at page 5366 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> to point out that so far as repetition of argument was concerned, it was the duty of honorable members to avoid the repetition of arguments used by other honorable members in the same way during the same debate. Further on you said - </para>

                        <para>Many honorable members will probably recollect a ruling I gave some two or three years ago, when, I think, the consideration of the Tariff was drawing to a conclusion. A letter which had been written concerning the Tariff was read two or three times by different honorable members, and I ruled, under standing order 276, that the letter having already been read more than once, I could not allow honorable members to repeat it in the same relation. </para>

                    <para class="block">In your rulings on this point, you have specially pointed out that honorable members are not entitled to repeat arguments in the same way that they have been used by other honorable members or in the same relation. I presume that if an honorable member pointed out that -two and two make four, . and that another honorable member did the same thing, and still another followed his example, you would be entitled under the Standing Orders to call upon the third member to refrain from repeating arguments used previously in the same way, and in the same relation. If, however, the decision of the Deputy Speaker that no honorable member is entitled to repeat arguments already used is to hold good, debate will be seriously hampered. For instance, the Prime Minister is frequently absent from the Chamber attending to public business outside this House, and it may be desirable, upon his return to the Chamber, to repeat an argument used in his absence. Under the ruling of the Deputy Speaker, however, it would be impossible to adopt that course. Further, we know that in connexion with important matters - such as. for example, the second reading of a Bill - the first five or s.ix speakers present most of the arguments that can be advanced for or against the measure. Under such circumstances, those who were nor lucky enough to be included amongst the first five or six honorable members to catch <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker's</inline> eye. would be denied an opportunity of putting their views before the public, and before their constituents. </para>

At that particular crisis in our his tory it was most important that the representatives of rural constituencies should have a full opportunity of giving expression to their opinions. In conclusion, I should like to point out that time after time the necessity arises, for repeating arguments which have been previously advanced. We all know that many lawyers find it is only by constant repetition that they are able to establish their case before a jury. Whilst it may be necessary to put into operation the standing order to prevent irrelevancy and tedious repetition, I submit that the Tilling of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> if adhered to, will prove inimical to the best interests of debate in this House. I therefore move the motion standing in my name. </para>

If the ruling of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker</inline> is applied generally to the conduct of business in this Chamber, it must necessarily reduce our proceedings to an absolute farce. If it is disorderly for one honorable member to use an argument that has previously been employed - not by himself, but by some other honorable , member - it seems to me that not only will discussion of any measure be confined to a very limited number of speakers, but, in some instances, it will be entirely blocked. </para>

                            <para>- Every honorable member will feel the effect of the ruling to which I have referred. I have been looking through the pages of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> with a view to ascertaining if there be any notable exception, and I find that there is scarcely a member of this Chamber, who, at some time or other, has not employed arguments which have been previously used either by himself or other honorable members. Upon some questions there may possibly be only two or three main arguments which can be advanced, either for or against them. I can easily conceive that if the ruling of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker</inline> be upheld, one honorable member may rise, and put forward all those main arguments, and by so doing absolutely prevent any further discussion of the question at issue. As a matter of fact, under the ruling to which I allude, even a reference to arguments which had been advanced by other honorable members 'Av&gt;as prohibited. It seems to me that if a question is to be discussed at all, it is impossible for it to be fairly debated without honorable members referring to arguments which have been already used, and, perhaps, for purposes of clearness and emphasis, repeating them. It is easy to imagine that a proposed law which is advocated by honorable members upon one side of the House may be opposed by the first speaker upon the other side of the Chamber, on the ground of its injustice. The injustice which it would inflict may be the central argument upon which the whole opposition, to the proposal rests. Does anyone suggest that because the first honorable member - who has been fortunate enough to catch <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker's</inline> eye - has used that' argument in opposition to the proposal, other honorable members ought to be prevented from employing it? It is due, not only to the members of the House, but to their constituents, whose mouth - piece they are, that they should have the freest right to express their opinions upon a matter of that kind, even though they might feel called upon to repeat arguments which had already been adduced. If it were not so, it must be clear to anybody who considers the matter, even from a superficial stand-point, that a Presiding Officer who was disposed to be tyrannical would be vested with power to effectually " gag " every honorable member. That condition of things ought not to obtain in a free Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker</inline> relied, in support of his action, upon the Standing Orders of the House of Commons. Hi's supposed authority is to be found on page 300 of May's <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Practice,</inline> which says, in relation to irrelevance or repetition - </para>

                        <para class="block">It will be seen there that the attention of the House has first to be called to the conduct of the member who is guilty of persistent irrelevance. <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> continues - and akin to irrelevancy is the frequent repetition of the same arguments, whether of the arguments of the member speaking, or the arguments of other members; an offence which may be met by the power given to the Chairman under Standing Order No. 24. </para>
                        <para class="block">It will be observed that there is a very important qualification imposed by the introduction of the word " frequent." My reading of the standing order in question is that it is not disorderly to repeat an argument which has previously been used either by the same speaker or by another honorable member ; but it is disorderly to frequently repeat it. That is an important qualification, which appears to have been entirely lost sight of in the Deputy Speaker's ruling. It seems to me that the standing order of the House of Commons does not preclude reference to arguments which have been used by other honorable members, nor the repetition of an argument which the speaker himself has previously used. What it does preclude is the frequent repetition of the same argument. Turning to page 828 of the appendix of <inline font-style="italic">May,</inline> I find the following, which deals with the question of irrelevance or repetition : -  (27th November, 1882, and 28th February, 1888) That <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> or the Chairman, after having called the attention of the House or of the Committee to the conduct of a member who persists in irrelevance, or tedious repetition either of his own arguments or of the arguments used by other members in the debate, may direct him to discontinue his speech. </para>
                        <para class="block">In this connexion, I say that we have a standing order - I refer to standing order No. 276- which gives <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> power to deal with honorable members who are guilty of tedious repetition. And there was no necessity under the circumstances to fall back upon the British House of Commons procedure, unless it was desired by the Chair to arrogate powers which the Standing Orders did not confer or contemplate. But May's <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Practice</inline> does not support the Deputy Speaker's attitude. In the quotation whi(ch I have just made, it will be noted that the word " repetition " is again qualified by the word "tedious." Tedious repetition, I take it, means more than one repetition. Indeed, k means more than one repetition by the same person. .From both these readings it seems that a reasonable interpretation of the standing order is that an honorable member may use an argument which has been previously employed by another honorable member irrespective of whether he does so designedly or as the result of inadvertence. But it is clearly disorderly for him to indulge in tedious repetition of that argument- -in other words, to say the same thing over and over again. If it were not so, it would be useless to debate any question, because two or three honorable members might virtually advance all the main arguments either for or against any specific proposal. </para>

                            <para>- Such a ruling would, therefore, operate very unjustly. The honorable member for Bland himself might be excluded from speaking under such circumstances. He might spend a considerable amount of time consulting- authorities in the library in order that he might be qualified to address himself to a certain question, and yet he might be denied an opportunity to give expression to his ideas ; because during his absence some one else had forestalled him and employed the arguments he intended to employ. He might attend in this Chamber with the intention of delivering an important speech - a speech which not only concerned the House and his constituents, but the country at large, and which by virtue of its importance ought to go before the country. But under the ruling of the Deputy Speaker, he might be absolutely prevented from delivering that speech, and consequently the pearls of wisdom which might otherwise have flowed from his lips would be lost to the present generation and to posterity. I am not arguing this question from any sense of personal ill-usage. I am eliminating the personal element entirely, and viewing the matter simply from the stand-point of reason and justice. It seems to me that if the ruling of the Deputy Speaker be enforced within such narrow limits, the proceedings of this House as, a deliberative assembly will be reduced to an absolute farce. </para>

                        <para>- Apparently, some honorable members are anxious to decide this question - which is one of far-reaching importance - without any debate whatever. It is with considerable diffidence that I address myself to the motion, and I can assure honorable members that they will not facilitate its early settlement if I am interrupted' at the outset. I think it is a pity that the members of the Government, who should be the constitutional guardians of the liberties of honorable members, have not addressed themselves to this question with a view to showing whether or not, in their opinion, the ruling of the Deputy Speaker, if upheld, would curtail those liberties. </para>

                            <para>- In this regard, at all events, I am a convert to, the views of the honorable member. I think that he will agree that in a Chamber so large as is the House of Commons it would be impossible to give that liberty of speech which should be extended to members of so small an assembly as this is. If we had 600 or 700 members of this House, each exercising his opportunities to speak, obviously no business could be transacted ; but we have only seventy-five members, and the difficulty of properly representing the sparsely-populated constituencies of this great continent are such that every honorable member should be given complete freedom to express the views of his constituents. While I. should be the first to admit that to repeat over and over again arguments used by previous speakers would be to take an undue liberty in a House of this character, I cannot agree with the ruling of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker</inline> that to repeat an argument which has been used, it may be only once or twice, bv a previous speaker must necessarily be out of order. What would be the position if that ruling were upheld'? An1 honorable member, hostile to the question at issue, might easily forestall another who wished to put a certain question in a serious way before the House, and, having forestalled him, he might take a point of order that arguments already used by him were being repeated. </para>

                    <para class="block">I feel that the House should dissent from this ruling. There is another consideration, and it is a constitutional one, which concerns all honorable members alike. Rulings from the Chair are designed not only to maintain order but to facilitate business, and all business in this House must be conducted upon a representative basis - the basis on which we hold our seats. That being so, it is clear that any ruling which aims at the root of the representative basis upon which we hold our seats in this Chamber should not be upheld. Let us consider the position which must arise if this ruling be accepted. The honorable and learned member for Illawarra has a large number of constituents who have entrusted' him with their representation in this House. Rightly or wrongly, they think that no other representative should be left to voice their views. The honorable member for Melbourne, for example, might be able to put the views of the electors of Illawarra with even greater forcefulness than could the honorable and learned member representing that constituency. But I hold that the electors of that constituency are the only people entitled to judge of that matter. If this ruling be upheld, it is clear that the rights of the constituencies will be interfered with. That is the principal ground upon which I support this motion. I trust that the Government will give us that assistance which we are entitled to expect from them in dealing with it. As this ruling must necessarily affect all parties, the House should endeavour to forget the rancour or feeling under which it has been labouring for some time, and deal with the question in a dispassionate way. </para>

The question will be put to the House, and I therefore ask honorable members to deal with it in a judicial manner. The question with which we are concerned relates not to the past, but to the future. Let us divest ourselves of any of those bitternesses which necessarily resulted from the all-night sittings on. the occasion on which this ruling was given. If that be done, honorable members will recognise that this ruling, if upheld, must seriously curtail the liberties of the House, and will therefore support the motion of the honorable and learned member for Illawarra. </para>

                            <para>- Evidently. The corporate existence of Parliament in those circumstances would be destroyed. We should have a gathering of irresponsible individuals, whose places in this respect might be supplied by so many gramophones or phonographs which, without the exertion of physical force, could keep on repeating what had' already been said. The contention of those who have supported the motion would reduce the proceedings of the House to chaos. Here, as in the House of Commons, the unlimited right of an honorable member to repeat his own arguments, or those of others, would lead to absolute paralysis of business. Are we compelled to choose between a doctrine of that character and the ruling now submitted' to us? I regret! that the motion, as proposed, appears not to truly represent the actual position. </para>

                            <para>- I do not wish to dispute that point. But surely honorable members will agree that the consideration of this ruling requires us to have regard to the time, the place, and the moment of its deliverance. No one would say that in no Circumstances should an honorable member be permitted to repeat his own arguments, or those of another to which he desired to reply. Such a ruling, if not fatal to debate, would seriously cripple it. I venture to submit that when we look at the time and circumstances of the ruling, we shall find that arguments were being repeated with the object of convincing no one, elucidating nothing, advancing nothing. Their sole object was to occupy the time of the House. That is absolutely forbidden in express terms by the Standing Orders of the House of Commons, and is also forbidden by one of our own Standing Orders, although its terms are less explicit. In these circumstances the ruling that that was not the time or the occasion on which an honorable member was justified in repeating his own arguments, or those of others, was a proper one. Everything depends upon the time, the place, and the circumstances. </para>

                            <para>- I beg to differ from the honorable member, and tq assert that the ruling places no limitation upon debate that has not been already imposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and, indeed, by our own Standing Orders. Our Standing Orders, properly read, and the rulings of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> as I have heard them, properly understood, imply that while there are times and places at which, a re-statement of an argument is absolutely necessary, and is in many other cases justifiable, there are also times and places in which it is absolutely unnecessary. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and the Chairman are not to interpose in such circumstances, and, with the weight of their independence and mature judgment are not to guide us, for what do we require a Speaker or Chairman? Do we expect the Standing Orders to operate automatically? Do we not intend that they shall be applied by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> and the  Chairman  according to the problem that happens to be submitted to them. It appears, therefore, that the fair and reasonable view is that the ruling having regard to the circumstances in which it was given was absolutely right; and that, while in other circumstances it would not apply, that fact does not detract from its soundness. I venture to assert that it would be impossible for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> in any ruling; to define all the circumstances in which such' a ruling should be accepted absolutely, qualified in some particulars, or rejected. I take no exception to the submission of this motion, and certainly none to the way in which it was put before the House. It was dealt with argumentatively, and as briefly as possible. But I take a different view of the ruling from that which the honorable and learned member for illawarra has adopted. He has read it as applying absolutely at all times, to all honorable members in all debates. My reading of it is that it applies only to the time and place and debate in respect of which it was given. In such circumstances, it was right. In others it might have been wrong. On a general principle our Standing Orders condemn repetition or irrelevance, as do the Standing Orders of the House of Commons, When repetition becomes irrelevant, tedious, or useless!, when- a point has been made and sufficiently enforced, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> or the Chairman must be allowed to intervene to enable public business to be transacted. We must trust them to interpose at the right moment to prevent abuse of the forms of the House and loss of public time. I submit that under the circumstances of the case <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker</inline> took the proper course, and should be upheld by the House. </para>

                        <para>- As the Prime Minister is of opinion that no exception can be taken to the submission of the motion, I shall not debate that aspect of the question; but I wish to say, as briefly as may be, that I think he has evaded the question before the Chair. The honorable and learned member for Illawarra asks the House to dissent from the ruling that an honorable member is not entitled to repeat an argument which has already been used by another honorable member. The Prime Minister said that when there has been tedious repetition of an argument for the purpose of delaying business, it is within your province, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> or that of the Chairman, as the case may be, to as.k an honorable member to discontinue his speech. T do not think any one could take exception to such a ruling. But the ruling which we are challenging is quite different. It is given on page 5370 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> in the following words: - </para>

                        <para>My ruling was that an honorable member would be guilty of irrelevance or repetition if he were to use arguments used by an honorable member previously in the same debate. </para>

                    <para class="block">Therefore, it was twice stated that it is not within the province of an honorable member to repeat arguments used by another honorable member. Not a word was said about circumstances, time, place, and conditions, nor were any of the qualifications added which the Prime Minister has introduced. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker</inline> had ruled that an honorable member is not entitled to repeat an argument which has been used by a dozen previous speakers, when it is obvious that the repetition is for the purpose of delaying business, 1 should have supported the ruling, and opposed the motion. That, however, is not the ruling which was given, and the motion of dissent asks the House not to allow the hard-and-fast rule to be laid down by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker</inline> that, once an argument has been used, it cannot be used again by another  speaker. </para>

                            <para>- To enforce such a ruling would be a most iron-handed proceeding. We shall! shortly be dealing with certain clauses of the Trade Marks Bill, the arguments in regard to which will revolve round the point whether what is known as boycotting will result from the passing of those clauses. The same arguments will be repeated over and over again, though presented in different ways, and it is necessary for the information of the public that they should be so repeated. But, under the ruling which I have read, no honorable member would be entitled to address himself to the subject after, say, two speeches had been delivered on each side of the Chamber. I do not object to any reasonable prohibition of repetition, and would strongly support any ruling against unreasonable repetition ; but when an officer of the House rules that a member is not entitled to repeat an argument which has been used only once before - which was the ruling of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker</inline> in so many words - it is the duty of those who differ to express dissent in the manner provided for in the rules of the House. The Prime Minister has admitted that repetition is sometimes desirable, though at other times it is not desirable. But, having admitted that it is under some circumstances desirable, it is his duty to vote for the motion, because the motion dissents from the ruling that repetition of an argument which has been used only once is not permissible. I intend to support the motion, because no reply has been made to the contention of the honorable and learned member for Illawarra, whilst the speech of the Prime Minister evaded and clouded the real issue, by introducing qualifications and limitations which were not used in the ruling of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> and were not mentioned during the debate. The rulings referred to by the honorable and learned member as given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> seemed to me to be supported by <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> and all the leading parliamentary authorities, and to such rulings, of course, we all bow. </para>

                            has already ruled, and it is in accordance with the practice of the House of Commons, that repetition may consist not only of a re-statement of a matter by the honorable member who is addressing the House, but also of a re-statement of the arguments of those who have preceded him. As the statement which the honorable member was making has already been made by other honorable members, I ask him not to repeat it.

                    <para class="block">So that the final statement of his ruling by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> was that, to use arguments previously used by another honorable member in the same debate, would be to be guilty of irrelevance or repetition. There is nothing to limit or qualify or mitigate the absolute generality and severity of the ruling. If an honorable member uses an argument, no other honorable member can use it in the same debate, without being guilty of irrelevance and repetition. I do not know how it could be irrelevant, and presumably repetition is the offence. I think that even the Deputy Speaker will admit that his ruling is expressed in too general terms. It was expressed at a trying time, when a good deal of difficulty was being experienced, and I submit that there are some very important limitations to be placed upon it. So far as I am concerned, if this House were to become seized of the fact that the ruling was not of that broad, drastic, general character that its words implied, I should be satisfied. I should be very loth to vote for any mo- Hon dissenting from the ruling of the Chair under any circumstances. I believe that the Chair should be supported to the utmost of our power; but it is because the ruling in question is so broad and sweeping in its character that I feel bound to direct attention to the fact that it is, on the whole, a deliberate decision, which makes no reference to any particular circumstances. I imagine that the honorable and learned member for Illawarra would be satisfied if he were informed that there were unexpressed limitations connected with the ruling. I do not see how the House could support it in its present broad form. I trust that we shall receive some intimation that it is not meant to be construed to mean as much as it says, and that we may be able to avoid the necessity of voting either by way of assent or dissent upon a ruling given, as I freely admit, under circumstances of some difficulty. </para>

                        <para>- J look upon this as a non-party question. The position of the Opposition to-day may be occupied by us next week, and I look upon the motion as a most serious one. Although I am reluctant to question the Deputy Speaker's ruling, I realize that the privileges of honorable members must be maintained at all costs. I would refer honorable members back to the time when a severe drought afflicted nearly all parts of Australia, and members representing outlying districts in all the States, with the exception of Western Australia, had to use precisely the same arguments in support of a remission of the fodder duties. If the Chairman had ruled that after the second honorable member had spoken, the arguments previously used must not be repeated, the whole debate would have been stifled. Then, again, in the case of the discussion on the Orient mail contract, many honorable members on both sides of the House used the same arguments, although they may not have been couched in exactly the same words. If you, sir, had put a stop to that discussion on the ground that honorable members must not repeat the arguments already used by others,' we should have all felt very much aggrieved. Of course the circumstances under which the . ruling in question was . given were quite exceptional. I must confess that when I heard it given, I regarded it as one of the most extraordinary that I had ever known of,. I am sure the sense of the House is entirely against the idea that an honorable member should be debarred from repeating an argument previously used by another speaker. However careful honorable members might be in their efforts to avoid a conflict with the Chair, such a ruling would have the effect of stifling debate. Many honorable members have prepared second-reading speeches, and have failed to catch the Speaker's eye until the debate has proceeded at some length. They have then found that many of their arguments have been anticipated, and that the ground has to some extent been cut from under their feet. If, under such conditions, you, sir, were to rule that the House could not listen to me, for instance, merely because I was repeating arguments that had been previously employed, I should_ consider that you were dealing with mp very arbitrarily. For the reasons I have stated I think we should be very careful to guard our privileges. I am ready to pay due respect to the Deputy Chairman, who may think that he was perfectly justified in the ruling he gave. If, however, he made a mistake, it would be well for him to acknowledge it, and to allow the matter to rest there. If the motion is pressed, I shall have to 'vote for it. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that during the last few minutes we have drifted into a very serious position. If we negative the motion we shall, in effect, affirm in its bald outline the ruling of the Deputy Speaker. I think we should pause before we adopt that course, as it would carry us further than any honorable member would desire to go. By supporting the Deputy Speaker in his ruling, we shall affirm a principle which may have the most serious effect upon our debates. I should like to see the motion disposed of by means of some amendment, or by some statement of the Deputy Speaker to the effect that his ruling, which was given in the heat of debate, went further than on calmer consideration he thinks lit ought to have gone. It would be better to overcome the difficulty in some such manner, rather than to negative the motion, and thus affirm a most dangerous principle. </para>

It would be clearly wrong for us to affirm the principle that no honorable member should be entitled to repeat an argument that had been previously used. In justice to the Deputy Speaker, I must say that I understood his ruling as conveying what was said bv Mm after. I had withdrawn my opposition. In the heat of debate, I should not have been likely to withdraw my opposition if I had understood the ruling as it is now construed. </para>

                            <para>- I am quite willing to' accept the Deputy Speaker's assurance to that effect. At the time, I certainly understood the ruling to mean what was implied iri the statement made by the Deputy Speaker, as recorded at page 5369 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and I think that a, few words of explanation from the honorable gentleman will entirely remove all apprehension on the subject. It would not be possible for us to carry on our proceedings under the ?same rules as to limitation of debate, as might with propriety be applied to an unified Parliament. A statement may gain considerable weight by repetition, owing to the fact that honorable members represent so many different States, and so many different sections of the electors of the Commonwealth. No disadvantage could attach to allowing one honorable member after another to speak in the same strain upon such a subject, for instance, as the remission of fodder duties in a time of drought. The very multiplicity of statements might afford the best possible ground for interfering with the Tariff, and dislocating trade arrangements. Therefore, the repetition of argument in certain cases may be desirable, and in keeping with a strictly relevant discussion. If the ruling were interpreted in the strictest sense, the representation of the States might be to a large extent stifled, and the citizens of those States would have to look to the Senate, instead of this House, to protect their interests. I am bound to say that I understood the ruling to have particular reference to the time and to the circumstances under which it had been given. </para>

I think that the prospect to which I have referred, is one that we may well ponder over, and I am inclined to vote against the motion, purely from that point of view. One honorable member has suggested that probably I, as well as other honorable members might fall under the whip of the Deputy Speaker in this relation. That is quite possible. We have all sinned in some respects by repeating arguments which have been previously used in debate. That, however, is no excuse for deliberately laying ourselves out to repeat those arguments. </para>

                            <para>- Except upon a very few matters, I am not entitled to speak for the party of which I happen to be the leader to-day. Certainly I do not speak for that party upon this question. I would suggest to the honorable member for Illawarra that, after all, we have the ruling of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> upon this matter, and it seems to me that that is the only ruling to which effect is likely to be given, so far as this House is concerned. Leaving out of account the possibility of altering the standing order so as to make it more strict than it is, I take it that the ruling given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> several times during the debate of last week points to an insistence upon the repetition being "tedious " before an honorable member is ruled out of order. Irrespective of whether we carry or reject this motion, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker's1</inline> ruling will stand. I am content to leave the matter there. I would ask the honorable and learned' member for Illawarra to make some allowance for the fact that not only honorable members, but possibly <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> may easily have been " rattled " to some extent by the experience to which the occupants of the Chair had been subjected owing to the action of the Opposition. Some allowance might fairly be claimed by each of us in respect of anything that was said during those weary hours. </para>

                        <para>- I think, sir, that perhaps I had better say a word or two in regard to this matter. In doing so, I desire to reciprocate the very hearty expressions of good-will which have fallen from the lips of the mover of this motion. I recognise at once the inherent right of every honorable member - and I should' be the last to interfere with it - to dissent from any ruling- which may be given. I. also feel that the decision of this House will be of a strictly impersonal and non-party character. In the first place, I should like briefly to relate the circumstances under which mv ruling was given. Those circumstances must be taken into consideration, and I do not think some of the instances given are apposite. The adjournment of the debate had been moved, " and several honorable members had addressed themselves to the motion. The honorable and learned member for Illawarra then rose to advance reasons in support of it. He spoke for some time, and then attempted to use the condition of the officers of the House as an argument in favour of the proposal to adjourn. I drew his attention to the fact that that argument had been previously used in the debate. I hive looked up <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and I find that it was employed by two honorable members, namely, the honorable and learned member for Wannon, and the honorable member for Macquarie. I had a distinct recollection of it having been used, and I drew die attention of the honorable and learned member for Illawarra to that fact, but did not give an v ruling. He then asked whether the fact that an argument had been previously used by another honorable member would debar him from repeating it. I then gave my main ruling, which was not quoted by the honorable .and learned member for Wannon, but which was read by the honorable and learned member for Corinella. It is as follows : - </para>

                            has already ruled, and it is in accordance with the practice of the House of Commons, that repetition may consist not only of a re-statement of a matter by the honorable member who is addressing the House, but also of .a re-statement of the arguments of those who have preceded him. As the statement which the honorable member was making has already been made by other honorable members, I ask him not to repeat it.

                    <para>That ruling was at once questioned by the honorable and learned member for Werriwa, who handed me a dissent in writing, which I ruled out of order, because to my mind 5/t did not express the ruling which I had given, either fully, or even impartially. The honorable and learned member then withdrew his dissent, but in the meantime the honorable and learned member for Illawarra had prepared another. Between the period when I gave the ruling, and 'that at which the dissent was handed in, the matter had been referred to two or three times. There was a good deal of confusion prevailing, and directly the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> proofs were supplied to me, I noted that where I used -or intended t'o use - the plural, the singular had been employed by the reporter. _ Following the usual practice, had I considered it desirable. I would certainly have made my subsequent rulings agree with the original ruling, by altering the latter to the plural. That is the point to which the honorable and learned member for Corinella has alluded. When the honorable and learned member for Illawarra handed in his dissent, I felt that it did not express my ruling, and honorable members will recollect that I suggested at least one alteration in it. But 1 had .another alteration in my mind - an alteration to the use of the plural. As, however, the honorable and learned member was anxious that I should accept his dissent, I did so. At the same time, I feel that it does not express the original ruling which I gave. That ruling, I desire to say, was quite in accordance with the ruling of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> and also with the practice of the House of Commons. </para>

                        <para>- I hesitate to add to this debate, and should not have done so but for the remarks of the honorable member for Bland. If anything would induce me to advise the honorable and learned member for Illawarra to withdraw his motion it is the attitude which has been assumed towards it by the leader of the Labour Party, who even yet seems to be almost savage in his desire to stifle debate. I see no trace of his calming down upon that matter, even after having secured possibly the severe application of the closure rules to future debate. One would have thought that the honorable member would have been a little saner and calmer after his recent triumph. However, he still appears to catch at any straw which will justify him in stifling the arguments of opponents. As the honorable member for Macquarie interjected, that is all verv well from the honorable member's point of view. Everybody knows that there has not been very much in the nature of repetitive arguments from the Labour corner recently, and really there has been no need for it. I should imagine that repetition on the part of honorable members sitting there goes on in quite another place, so that further repetition in the House is unnecessary. Consequently we find the honorable member for Bland voicing the opinions of the caucus, and scarcely any other honorable member of it giving utterance to the sentiments of the party. That may be a very commendable thing from the stand-point of party discipline, but it does not apply to other parties in the same way. </para>

                            <para>- I am not aware of it. I am afraid that I was not in the sense in which the honorable member is referring to the matter. However, I do not wish to talk about last session. We have quite enough to do in focussing our attention upon this session. While the honorable member for Bland was perfectly justified from his point of view in advancing the arguments that he did, and in catching at a mere straw thrown to the wind by the honorable and learned member for Werriwa in order to provide himself with some justification for proceeding further to stifle debate. I think that a broader and saner view of the matter will show him that he is entirely wrong. The ruling of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> if it be upheld, means neither more nor less than the application of another form of closure, even more direct and effective than any of the forms which have already been adopted by the House. I venture to submit that, the House has no intention of placing any such arbitrary power in the hands of any  speaker,  neither is there any constitutional justification for so doing. Certainly there is no authority for such a proceeding. When the honorable member for Laanecoorie rose to make his explanation, I expected that he would have seen fit to modify in some way the attitude which he assumed upon the occasion to which allusion has been made. Instead of that, he finds fault with the drafting of the motion., and emphasizes his view as to the correctness of his ruling on the occasion referred to. He attempts to buttress his own ruling upon that occasion by the ruling given previously by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> in relation to the same question. Therein I think he makes a very great mistake. I draw a clear distinction between the unqualified statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker</inline> arid the more qualified statements of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> in relation to this point. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr, Speaker</inline> gave his ruling, he pointed out that it was not in. order to repeat arguments to which utterance had already been given " in the same way " by other honorable members. Then, again, he used the qualifying words, " in the same relation." That makes a vital distinction. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> went further, and said that arguments were not to be repeated in the same way and in the same relation. He meant; no doubt, that honorable members should not be permitted to continue droning out statements uttered in almost identical language by other honorable members. I do not cavil at <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker's</inline> ruling. It is a wise restriction to place upon debate. But I do not think that he intended to lay down the rule that there should be no repetition of argument in connexion with any matter before the Chair. Such a ruling would mean that only two or three honorable members would be permitted to speak on any question. There are certain well-defined lines of argument in connexion with almost every debatable subject that comes before the House. Take the union label clauses of the Trade Marks Bill, with which we are to deal almost immediately. If an honorable member is not to advance arguments against the union label on the ground, for instance, that it may lead to boycotting, there will be little debate on the whole subject. When we come to discuss the union 'label clauses, one or two arguments will form the staple of the whole of the opposition to them. </para>

Unless reasonable latitude be allowed in the repetition of the main arguments relating to amy question, we may as well have no further debate. I take it that the qualifying words used by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> in delivering 'the ruling to which reference has been made, cause it to differ in a vital degree from the ruling of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker.</inline> It may be that we should' have regard to the circumstances in which the ruling was given, and under which debate had taken place ; but, making every allowance for those circumstances, I do not consider that the explanation </para>

Since hearing the speech made by the honorable member for Bland, I am more averse than ever to this motion being pushed to a vote, inasmuch as it is clear that, irrespective of the consequences that may happen when he is on this side, and struggling against great odds, as we appear to be doing, he is ready to give his support to any proposal that will have the effect of curtailing debate. I hope, therefore, now that the matter has been ventilated - and particularly as we have recognised the difference between the qualifying words used by

                        and trust to his wisdom and guidance in future debate.

                            <para>- We have millions of imitators, but very few original thinkers. If we were precluded from following the language and ideas that have been expressed by others for thousands of years, no honorable member could make a speech. I have heard little originality in this House, and it seems to me that it is essential to our well-being that there should be repetition. The present is only an evolutionary repetition of the past. As the ruling, if upheld, would cause the Opposition to give up hope, I feel that I should support <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy Speaker,</inline> but having regard to the rights and liberties of the House, I feel that I ought to support the action of the honorable member for Illawarra. On this question, therefore, I am a "Yes-No" man, and I therefore trust that the motion will not be pressed. If it is, I shall have to think very seriously, and that is what I do not wish to do. In this country everything prospers, but no one thinks, and that is what I do not wish to be called upon to do. </para>

                    <para>- An earlier clause provides that where the Registrar refuses to grant an unopposed application, an appeal may be made to the Law Officer before an appeal is made to the Court. I understood the Attorney-General to say that that arrangement has been found advantageous in many cases. But when the Registrar has given a decision in favour of one of two or more opposing parties, I doubt the wisdom of allowing an intermediate appeal to the Law Officer. </para>

                        <para>- Counsel is briefed at times in connexion with important applications. Under clause 35, the applicant may appeal direct from the Registrar to the Court, but under clause 45, both parties must consent before a direct appeal can be made to the Court. I think that if either party wishes to go direct to the Court, there should be no intermediate appeal to the Law Officer. I doubt whether the hearing of cases before the Law Officer prevents ultimate appeals to the Court in an appreciable number of instances. If contending parties have fought before the Registrar, they are not likely to be satisfied with the decision of the Law Officer, who, whether he be the Attorney -General or the Crown Solicitor, may not necessarily be an expert in trade marks law. I ask the Attorney-General to make no provision for an appeal to the Law Officer in the case of an. opposed application. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the appellant from the Registrar's decision should have the right to say to whom he will appeal. The simplest thing to do is to allow an appeal direct to the Court from the Registrar in the case of opposed applications. Under the English law, the decision of the Registrar is subject to appeal to the Court, or, with the consent of the parties, to the Board of Trade, which is the exact opposite of the provision in the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. In England there is only one appeal from the decision of the Registrar - to the Court, or, if both parties consent, to the Board of Trade. I suggest to the Attorney-General that we should provide for only one appeal here - to the Court, or, if both parties consent, to the Law Officer. I do not think that the Law Officer would have much to do under such circumstances. In my opinion, it is undesirable to have an intermediate stage. </para>

                    <para>. - I have obtained a special report on this subject, which supports me in the opinion that, if it were provided that all cases should be taken to the Court, the result would be that in trivial matters a man would have either to abide by a decision of the Registrar, at which he felt aggrieved, or to undertake very expensive litigation. </para>

                        <para>- I would give either party the right to appeal to the Court direct. It must be remembered, however, that if they appeal to the Supreme Court, there is a possibility of a further appeal to the High Court. If the appeal in the first instance is to the Law Officer, the party who loses may agree to end the proceedings, as he has not lost very much ; but if the appeal is to the Court, and the decision carries heavy costs, there will be an inducement for the losing party to proceed still further. I think that we should allow applicants to avail themselves of the cheapest procedure, and that we shall go far enough if we provide that, if either desires, the appeal shall be to the Court. </para>

                    <para>- I think that the honorable and learned member for Corinella should be satisfied with the arrangement suggested by the Attorney-General. I am almost prepared to leave the clause as it stands. I would not put it in the power of one party to say that he would not use the Law Officer. It must be remembered that the Court referred to is the Supreme Court of Victoria, or the High Court, and, probably, parties in a distant State like Western Australia would not like to be dragged to Victoria. </para>

                    <para>- I wish to know whether sub-clause 2 is in its proper place? I do not see what the question of entry of name has to do with the assignment or equities arising in connexion with an assignment. This sub-clause appears to have crept into the wrong place. After reading the first sub-clause, I should never have suspected the presence of subclause 2, because it does not seem to have anything to do with the rights of a registered proprietor as to assignment. Subclause 3, although connected with subclause 1, is not quite properly placed in the clause. Sub-clause 2 should come under the part of the Bill headed "Registrable Trade Marks." </para>

                    (New England).The contention of the honorable and learned member for Corinella with regard to sub-clause 2 should be borne in mind. In my view it should form a separate clause, because it has nothing to do with' assignment. Very often a mistake is made by lawyers, owing to provisions being grouped under the wrong headings.

                        <para>- I wish to direct the attention of the Attorney-General to the definition of "user" at the end of the clause. It seems to me that although we may find similar provisions in other Acts, we may, by adopting, these words, present opportunities for doubtful practices. It is provided that for the purposes of "the clause, " user " shall be deemed to be continuous, if there has been no interruption for a longer total period than twelve months. It appears to me that a man might use a trade mark once a year for five years. </para>

                    <para>- It seems to me that this clause might create a great deal of difficulty. I should like to know how the apportionment would be made in the event of a partnership being dissolved, and of the partners agreeing to divide the interest in a trade mark. It may happen that two partners in, a firm possess only one trade mark in respect of a certain line of goods. Should they dissolve partnership, it seems to me that some confusion would result in the matter of the future application of that trade mark throughout Australia. I should like some information from the Attorney-General as to how such a difficulty would be settled under the terms of this clause? </para>

                    <para>- I agree with some of the arguments of the honorable member for Wentworth, but I disagree with "others. For example, he asked why a fine, in lieu of imprisonment, should not be imposed for the offences mentioned in this clause. I contend that the Committee ought to steadfastly set its face against any suggestion of that sort. It may very easily happen that a person occupying a good position may commit forgery!, and in such circumstances even a fine of ^100 would not constitute adequate punishment. It would be perfectly ridiculous to fine a man <inline font-style="italic">Â£100</inline> for committing an offence that might enable him to make thousands of pounds. I hold that the Court should be given power to impose a very severe sentence for an offence under this clause. If the amendment be accepted, the Court will be at liberty to make the punishment fit the crime. </para>

                    (Angas\ - I do not think that it is necessary to debate the proposal made by the honorable member for Wentworth. Gradations of forgery are recognised by the ordinary Crimes Acts, and forgery of certain documents is punished with greater severity than is the forgery of others. The offence dealt with in this clause is morally, although not technically, equivalent to forgery, and three years' imprisonment will be the maximum penalty. It will be open to. a Judge, in dealing with an offence against this clause, which he does not regard as a serious one, to order a short term of imprisonment, and, under the Acts Interpretation Act, without hard labour,

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. KELLY</inline>
                    (Wentworth).- If there be different kinds of forgery, the type with which this clause deals may possibly be one that we should punish with the utmost rigour. The average case of forgery affects the rights of only one man, but the forgery of a trade mark would affect the rights, perhaps, of a whole community. I have the utmost diffidence in putting my views in this regard against those of members of the legal profession.

                        <para>- I should give a Judge full discretion to impose up to five years' imprisonment for the forgery of any label. The position put by the honorable and learned member for Angas is not a new one. The Judge dealing with the offence is the proper authority to discuss the extent of the offender's culpability. Some honorable members have failed to recognise that, where there is a possibility of making a great profit by wrong-doing, a severe penalty must be provided as a deterrent. </para>

                        <para>- Any offence under this clause must necessarily be an offence against the community, since a trade mark is a guarantee of value to the consumer. If we increase the penalty from three to five years' imprisonment, it will still be open to a Judge dealing with an offence under the clause to refrain from imposing the maximum sentence. Surely we can trust our courts with the proper administration of justice. Surely we do not desire to have one set of penalties for the rich and another for the poor. A wretched bank clerk, drawing <inline font-style="italic">Â£60</inline> per annum, who forges a cheque for <inline font-style="italic">Â£5,</inline> may be imprisoned for ten years, and yet it is proposed that, in the case of a rich corporation, which may, by uttering a forgery, gain many thousands of pounds, the maximum penalty for the offence shall be only three years' imprisonment. </para>

                    <para>- If the Attorney General turns to clauses 56 and 57, he will find that a registration that has been removed for non-payment of fees, may be restored upon payment of the necessary fees, but that no power is given to restore a registration which has been removed for causes other than non-payment of fees, after notice has been given. Under the Victorian Companies Act, the Registrar had power to remove companies from his register; but it was found necessary to bring in an amending Act to empower him, on due cause shown, to restore any name which had been taken off. </para>

                    <para>- I wish to know why the Attorney-General has omitted one of the powers of correction given to the Registrar in the English Act, namely, to strike out any goods or classes of goods from those for which a trade mark is registered. That power, which is provided for in sub-section 4 of section 32 of the English Act', seems a 'desirable one to confer. It might happen that the registered proprietor of a trade mark might wish to disclaim certain classes of goods, and I do not see why he should not have power to do so. </para>

                    <para>- I ask the Attorney-General to consider whether some definition of " registered proprietor " should not be inserted. I take it that the registered proprietor referred to in the clause is a proprietor registered under the Bill ; but a proprietor registered under a State Act, whose rights are preserved under the Bill, might require to take some of the steps provided' for in the clause, and, as the clause stands, could not do sp. If a registered' proprietor were defined to mean a proprietor registered under the Bill or under any State Act, the case would be met. </para>

The rights, of a man registered under a State Act are protected; but it is not intended that he should have power to alter the Commonwealth register. His rights are preserved, so far as the State register is concerned ; but it would be going too far to provide that a pei son not registered under the Bill shall have power to alter the Commonwealth register. </para>

                    (Corinella).- I wish to draw the attention of the Attorney-General in connexion with this clause to a point which I raised in connexion with clauses 58 and 59. It appears reasonably clear that the measure contemplates the registration of assignments of trade marks, as a whole, and not of assignments of trade marks for territorial areas. Sub-clause 3 of clause 49 provides that any equities in respect of a trade mark may be enforced in the same way as equities in respect of other personal property, which seems to provide for an equitable, that is to say, an unregistered, assignment of a trade mark in regard to any State. I should like the Attorney-General to consider whether such partial assignments should' not be put on the register. No notice of a trust can be placed on the register, but I understood from the Attorney-General that a trade mark could be assigned in reference to a given area.

                        <para>- Then it might be necessary to say that a trade mark could not be registered for a smaller area than a State. The honorable member for South Sydney has referred to a case 5n which a manufacturer, whose business extended over several States, assigned his interests in each of them to different persons. Similarly such a manufacturer might retain his rights for one State, and transfer them for the other States in which he was interested ; but the persons to whom they were transferred could not, under the Bill, register the trade marks assigned to them. They would have only equitable rights under an unregistered assignment. The whole policy of our registration Acts, however, involves the principle that it is more desirable to have transactions registered than to allow them to remain unregistered! I do not propose to move an amendment, because to meet the case amendments will be necessary in previous clauses. I think that a person to whom a trade mark has been assigned for a particular State should be allowed to register it, instead of having only an unregistered equitable right. </para>

                        <para>- That registration is already provided for. One objection to the course which I suggest is that when the rights are split up, trie separate proprietors may alter their trade marks. I quite admit the difficulty, but it seems to me that the great advantage of being able to register an assignment outweighs the disadvantage. We might, for example, provide that when a trade mark is so assigned in part, it should have added to it the words, " in the State of Victoria," or some other words, indicating the extent of the assignment. I do not think that this would create any difficulties or complexities in the Trade Marks Office, but, if it did, it would be preferable to have the complications in that quarter rather than as between members of the outside public. </para>

                    <para>- Personally, I doubt the policy of allowing trade mark rights to be split up in the way suggested by the honorable and learned member. The tendency of our legislation is to widen the area of the operation of trade marks, and to prevent several marks of a similar character from running together. Owing to the operation of the States laws, and the vested rights which have been created under them, we cannot avoid in some cases permitting two or three marks to run together. We have provided that where the same trade mark has been registered! in two different States-; it shall, when extended to other States, be of a Federal character. But there is no provision that the operation of a Commonwealth trade mark should be confined to one State as regards one proprietor, and to other States as regards other proprietors. Such a condition of affairs would be most confusing to consumers, because the same mark might be applied to goods produced by different persons. I do not think we should give the power suggested. </para>

                    (Indi- Attorney-General). - Whilst we ought to afford every facility for disposing of property in small parcels, we must not lose sight of the fact that we are endeavouring by legislation to arrive at uniformity in regard to trade marks throughout Australia. I can see that it would be very awkward if, in England, a trade mark could be split up so that it could be held by different proprietors in every county, and similarly I can foresee the confusion that would arise if a Commonwealth trade mark were split up into parcels, as it were, for use in different States.

                        <para>- We have already met the requirements of past history, as far as it is possible to do so. I think that a Commonwealth trade mark ought to be what its name implies. One serious difficulty would arise 4f we adopted the principle of splitting up, suggested by the honorable and learned member for Corinella. Suppose, for instance, that a certain person obtained a Commonwealth trade mark, and was afterwards permitted to sell his rights for Queensland. If a retailer from that State purchased goods from the Victorian holder of the trade mark, and' took them to Queensland, he would be prevented from landing them. </para>

                    B. EDWARDS (South Sydney}. - The argument of the Attorney-General, so far as it relates to future trade marks, is incontrovertible, but I do not think that we have made sufficient provision for the division of interest in rights to trade marks which have grown up under the States laws,. We should certainly pay regard to the necessity for splitting the rights acquired in the past. In regard to those who now have registered rights in one or more States, the question arises whether we should' not permit them to continue the business arrangements into which they have entered in regard to other States. I would urge the necessity of introducing some simple provision for the transfer of registered trade marks. When the Patents Act was under consideration, provision was made at my instance for a simple transfer of much the same character as that adopted in connexion with the Torrens system of land transfer. Section 21 of the Patents Act provides -

At present the transfer of a trade mark may involve the expenditure of ,Â£30 or ^40, and I am sure that honorable members will be glad to do anything they can to reduce the legal expenses which business men are now called upon to incur. </para>

                        <para>- But a man's material assets may have disappeared, and he may be left with only his good-will and his trade mark. We ought to give such a holder of a trade mark - -who will probably be a poor man - facilities for passing it on to the purchaser of his business, so that he may obtain the best value for it. We should not place difficulties in the way of transferring these legal rights. At the present stage I shall content myself with giving notice of my intention to move the insertion of a new clause, which will provide for an easy form of transfer. I think that we ought to give the proprietors of existing trade marks power to " split " them up between the various States. We ought to give the registered proprietor of an old-time trade mark the power to transfer his rights in New South Wales to one man., and his rights in Western Australia or Victoria to another individual. But in regard to rights which may be subsequently acquired) I agree that we ought not to allow any such " splitting " to take place. </para>

Such a provision would assist to get rid of the confusion that will otherwise arise by the use throughout the various States of the Commonwealth of a number of similar trade marks. </para>

                    (Indi - Attorney-General). - In reply to the remarks of the honorable member for South Sydney regarding the desirableness of enabling a simpler form of transfer to be effected, I wish to say that at first I thought he was referring - as in the case of the Patents Act, or as was suggested by the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, in the case of life assurance policies - to a short form of transfer to enable property to pass from one person to another. That plan would be difficult to apply in the case of a trade mark, because in connexion with a patent or a life assurance policy the thing which is transferred is transferred by itself. It is the only thing that needs to be transferred. But, in the case of a trade mark, we cannot pass the equitable right in it without passing the right to the good-will of the business in connexion with which that trade mark exists,
                    <inline font-style="italic">t</inline>
                    understood at first that that was the difficulty which the honorable member for South Sydney desired to overcome. Now, however, I understand that he is thoroughly seized of the fact that, when a person gets a conveyance of property, he has to get it in the old form. But the honorable member wishes to provide that, when a person goes to the Trade Marks Office, he may present a short document to the Registrar, and that that officer shall transfer the name on the registrar. That is all right in itself, and the regulations will provide for it. Clause 79 says -

                    (New England).What I understand the Attorney-General to say is that a trade mark must be transferred along with the good-will of a business, and that the documents transferring it must be those which contain a transfer of the good-will of that business.

                    <para>- This clause seems to me to have within itself the possibility of great protection to all who are interested in trade marks. The desire of honorable members, I understand, is to secure greater facilities and less complication. As the Attorney-General knows, the ordinary transfer of land is effected by one of the most simple documents in the world. By the use of that form, lands to the value of hundreds of thousands, of pounds are annually transferred and registered. Surely some simple form of that character could be adopted by the trade marks authorities. I see nothing in this clause to prevent that being done. </para>

If we have the assurance of the Attorney-General that the intention is that the regulations shall provide for a simple form of registration, enabling a man to secure his title as easily as he may secure a certificate of title under the State Land Act, we should be satisfied. There is nothing in this clause that is likely to cause complications. On the contrary, it will enable .the Department to make 'the process of transfer as simple as could be desired. </para>

I should like to assist him in giving effect to his desire ; but the difficulty is that it is impossible to transfer a trade mark simply. Although a policy of assurance or a title to land may be transferred, apart altogether from something else, a trade mark cannot.

Assignment is not prescribed for by the Bill ; it will not be necessary for the purposes of this measure, and, above all. the regulations may not prescribe that which we wish to have prescribed. What I suggest is that we should insert words providing that a trade mark may be assigned in the form in the schedule, and then in the form, set forth in simple language, we might have the words " together with the good-will of the business in- ." A man would then see upon the face of the form in the schedule an intimation that he was also to include his business. We could provide in the Bill itself that an assignment might be, not must be, in a certain form, leaving to those who wish to use a very elaborate form of transfer the power to give effect to their desire, but enabling the public generally to ascertain by turning to the schedule that there is a simple form of transfer of a trade mark, together with the business attaching to it. I submit this suggestion to the Attorney-General, but do not think that he should act upon it on -the spur of pressure in the House. He should look into the matter, and see how he could best achieve the purpose which the honorable member for South Sydney has in view. </para>

                    B. EDWARDS (South Sydney). - There mav be a legal difference between "good-will" and "trade mark"; but I feel quite safe in stating, after some experience, that when I purchase the trade mark of a business, I secure that business, no matter who purchases the good-will. By way of illustration, let us assume that I purchase the trade mark in respect of Lea and Perrins' sauce, and that - if it be possible to separate the good-will from the trade mark - another man purchases the good-will. In that event, I feel confident that I should be able to give the purchaser of the goodwill a long start and beat him badly.

                        <para>- That is so. The trade mark, as the greater, must always include the good-will. I have no objection to the proposal that it shall be stated in the form of transfer that " trade mark" shall include "good-will," because a man who parts with his trade mark has nothing left in the shape of good- will to sell. I strongly agree with the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne that we should deal with this question in the Bill itself. The Attorney-General has stated that it is the intention of the Government, of which he is a distinguished member, that regulations shall be drafted to carry out the object that I have in view. But that is not sufficient. The Attorney-General may unhappily pass away, politically, and his successor may not be disposed to deal with the matter by regulation. </para>

                        <para>- It is not only possible, but eminently desirable. We should then know that our intention was being carried out. Unless we embody our intention in the Bill itself, we shall have only the assurance which the Attorney-General has endeavoured to give us, and the knowledge that Governments, in the discharge of their Executive functions, as a rule do not do more than they are compelled to do. Australia was in the van of progress in the matter of the simplification of the process of transferring land, and scrip, sometimes worth' far more than is a trade mark, may also be transferred in a very simple way. At my instigation, we have made a similar provision in regard to patents, and I think that we should follow the same course in connexion with the transfer of trade marks. </para>

                        <para>- In some cases it costs from five guineas to forty guineas to transfer a trade mark; whereas if my proposal were adopted a transfer could be made at a cost of from1s. to 2s. 6d. It is no part of the province of this Parliament to create work for professional gentlemen. We should provide a ready means of transferring commercial rights from one person to another. A partially-ruined trader might have nothing left but his trade mark, and instead of penalizing him by requiring him to employ professional men to effect the transfer of that mark at considerable cost, we should enable him to transfer it as easily as one may transfer one's interest in land, scrip, or life assurance policies. A man may transfer his interest in these things for the expenditure of a shilling or two, and why should we make him pay pounds for the transference of his right in a trade mark. </para>

                        <para>- Is it not desirable to state in this clause that in the first action the right to the exclusive use of a trade mark came into question, and the determination was in the plaintiff's favour ? I think that that would be better than to provide that the Judge shall formally certify that the plaintiff is not to have his costs as between solicitor and client. Then too, should not the plaintiff before bringing a. subsequent action be obliged to notify the subsequent defendant of the prior trial, so that the latter, before running the risk of being saddled with costs as between solicitor and client, may have an opportunity to leave the action practically undefended? I think that the clause as it stands is rather wide. The defendant in a subsequent action, if he knew that the right to the exclusive use of a trade mark had come into question in a former action, and was determined in the plaintiff's favour, might feel it useless to challenge that right, and I think that he should be saddled with costs as between solicitor and client only, if he persisted in raising an issue determined in the plaintiff's favour in the previous case. </para>

                    <para>- I do not quite like this clause. It seems to me that it involves an abnegation of our constitutional rights. Under section 5 1 of the Constitution, we are fully empowered to deal with trade marks, and it seems to me that we are now being, asked to surrender some of our rights in the Constitution by giving back to the Imperial authorities the right to apply to the Commonwealth any law of the United Kingdom for carrying into effect any arrangement made with the Government of any foreign State for the protection of trade marks. I do not think we should do that. In clause 100, it is proposed to deal with British Possessions which have made certain provisions for the protection of trade marks on reciprocal lines, and my idea is that if we enter into any arrangement with foreign Powers we should do so upon a similar basis. If it appears to the Governor-General in Council that foreign countries have made provision for the protection of trade marks registered in the Commonwealth we ought to give reciprocal protection to the trade marks registered in such countries. I do not care, however, to submit to the control of the Imperial authorities in this regard. I notice that it is provided that applications under the clause should be made within six months. I should like to make the registration for English or foreign trade marks subject to the condition that they were not identical with one already on the register, 'with respect to the like goods, or so nearly resembling a Commonwealth trade mark as to be likely to deceive. Under the clause as it stands, any registration made by a citizen of the Commonwealth, under the protection of our own law, could be set aside if some similar trade mark were registered in a foreign country. It would be quite sufficient if we extended to foreign countries the powers proposed to be taken in clause 100 with regard to British Possessions. </para>

                        <para>- It would be better to do that than to allow the King in Council - which would mean the President of the Board of Trade - to do so. I think that we should exercise some control over the power proposed to be exercised under the clause. I would point out. further, that there is no provision made in this clause for reciprocal action, such as is contemplated" in the case of British Possessions. Some of the States have entered into reciprocal arrangements among themselves, and I see no reason why we should not follow a similar practice in regard to British Possessions and foreign countries. But we must keep the control in our own hands in the same way tha,t Queensland did in regard to the treaty with Japan relating to Asiatic immigration. That gave the Government of Queensland the right to bring into force the treaty which the Imperial Government had concluded with Japan. If we take up the position that the Governor-General, acting on the advice of his responsible Ministers, shall be the only person who can bring this provision into operation, a similar article will always be inserted in new treaties. If the honorable member for South Sydney has no amendment to submit, I am prepared to move that the' word "King" be struck out, with a view to insert' in lieu thereof the words "the Governor-General." </para>

                    B. EDWARDS (South Sydney). - I ask the honorable and learned member for Corio to consider whether the insertion of the words " foreign state or " before the words "British Possession" in clause 100 would not achieve the object which we both have in view. If we applied that provision to foreign countries, as well as to British possessions, we should insure that we should receive reciprocal .rights from those countries, and we should give our own representative of the Crown the power to call this latent legislation into existence. Personally, I have a decided objection to introducing into our legislation the King's orders in council.

                    <para>. - There seems to be some misunderstanding about this provision. If honorable members will look at the Patents Act they will see that a similar provision is embodied in section 121, and for a very good reason. We wish to secure protection for our trade marks and patents in those .countries which are parties to the International Convention, as well as in our own. The International Convention of 1884 was not originally signed by Hi's Majesty's Government, but it was afterwards subscribed to by the Imperial authorities. Only the King can apply it to the British Dominions, if it is applied at all. The Commonwealth is not a party to that agreement, and I suppose if we requested the British Government not to apply it to us it would npt be applied. If we choose to say that Australians shall be excluded from the benefit of having their trade marks protected in other parts of the world, His Majesty will doubtless give effect to our wishes. Upon page 532 of <inline font-style="italic">Sebastian</inline> it is clearly laid down that the benefits to be gained are reciprocal. We have already inserted .a similar provision in the Patents Act. Honorable members will recognise that it would- be awkward if we could not secure for a patent protection all over the world. I cannot carry in my mind every provision which is contained in the Convention, but my view is that this clause is necessary if we wish to enter into the concert- if we wish to say that any person applying to register a trade mark in the United Kingdom or the Isle of Man, or in the other countries which are parties to that Convention, shall be granted priority here in accordance with the date of its registration. </para>

                        <para>- That may be so. I understand that under the International Convention which applies to patents where reciprocal treatment is given in any of these States, our trade marks will be protected in the country which reciprocates. The only doubt that I entertain is as to whether the countries which are parties to that Convention are reciprocating. It has been pointed out to me by the representatives of large publishing firms that some countries have not extended to us that reciprocal protection that they are required to extend under the International Convention. I think that this clause should be retained in the Bill. I ask the Attorney-General to look into the question of whether other countries have carried out their international obligations. I have been informed that, in regard to copyright, they have not. </para>

                        <para>- But the principle is the same in both cases. I doubt whether all the countries have carried out the conditions of the treaty under which it is necessary for them to pass a special Act to give reciprocal protection. We are passing this provision with that object, but in doing so we are merely re-stating for Commonwealth purposes what is already the law. I have some doubt as to whether, under this Bill, we are giving the reciprocal protection that we ought, and whether we can come under the provisions of the International Convention. I do not wish to amplify the matter, but that is one of the reasons why I asked last week whether the Bill had followed the lines of Imperial legislation sufficiently to give us the benefits that are conferred under the English Act. My attention has been drawn to this fact by a pretty experienced patent attorney, and expert in trade marks. He points out that, owing to the fact that this Bill, as introduced, was not up to date, it. was questionable whether we should get that reciprocal treatment in other countries to which we were entitled under the terms of the Convention.

It is the peculiar phraseology of the clause which I regard as objectionable. What is the instrument that governs our action ? I know of nothing outside the Constitution; but by the use of this peculiar phraseology we seem to be admitting that there is some other authority for it. Whether rightly instructed or not, I am of opinion that such an admission is weak, if not wrong. The difficulty might be met by striking out the first line, and providing that " Where any Jaw of the United Kingdom is applied," and so on. That would show our readiness to fall into line with a policy that was being carried out by the rest of the Empire, and at the same time it would rid us of a somewhat objectionable form of phraseology.

If we put in the words I have suggested everything will be conserved.

                <para class="block">The object of this amendment is to protect the rights of those who have registered in the Commonwealth under our own law, any one of whom, by an accidental coincidence, might be confronted with the fact that a similar trade mark had been registered in a foreign country. I think that we should protect the rights of .those who have registered here. As_ the clause stands, a person who had registered, say, a star as a trade mark under the Commonwealth law, might find, upon treaty rights being brought into effect at the request of the Governor-General, that some one in Germany or elsewhere had registered a star in respect to similar goods. In that event the latter would take priority, notwithstanding that the local man had been the first to register his mark. The amendment is certainly necessary to protect the rights of many holders of trade marks in the Commonwealth. </para>

This clause does not override vested rights. It merely provides that a person who has applied for registration abroad is to have priority as against another applicant. I am not sure that if we inserted the amendment it might not by implication give rights as to everything else, unless we expressly included any other directions. 1 do not think this clause interferes with the rest of the Bill. When another person is registered as the proprietor of a registered trade mark, this clause will not give superior rights to any one in Australia, except in priority, not to the owner of a registered trade mark, but to another applicant.

A man in Germany or France should not have power, simply because we enter into treaty rights, to oust the legitimate applicant for a trade mark here, because the latter, by a coincidence, has adopted the same design. It seems to me that the clause even goes beyond that. The amendment I suggest would not interfere with treaty rights. A foreign applicant would merely be limited to the extent that he would not be recognised here if application had already been made for the registration of a similar design. </para>

Whilst giving reciprocal rights to foreign bodies we should take care to protect those who have been induced to register under our law. If any distinction is to be made it should certainly be in favour of those who have registered in the Commonwealth, and complied with the conditions as to fees and so forth imposed by our own law. </para>

                    <para>- I think that we are on the horns of a dilemma in regard to the question that has been raised. On the one hand, we wish to make it clear that the clause is not designed to allow a foreign trade mark to OUS.t an Australian trade mark, whilst", on the ether, we do not want to impose such limitations as would prevent it from operating. One would have to study the wording much more closely than I have been able to do, before coming to a conclusion on that point. I think the intention <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> be reasonably gathered1 from the clause is, that a foreign trade mark cannot be registered over the head of a trade mark registered prior to it. But such is the wording that counsel would find a great deal to say upon the other side. In view of the fact that at every step one takes in our series of Courts, the previous decision is usually reversed, we need to exercise care. In sub-clause  3  it is provided that - </para>

That is to say, a trade mark which is good in country " A," although not registrable in Australia, is to secure protection here, because it is good in that country. </para>

                    (Corinella).- This clause is borrowed from the new English Act, but, whereas the English section provides that " any association or person ' ' may undertake the examination of goods, the clause provides that " any Commonwealth or State authority, or any association or person " may do so. Then the English provision speaks of an examination of goods in respect to " origin, material, mode of manufacture, quality, accuracy, or other characteristic," all these words referring to some value in the goods themselves; but in the clause the words "or conditions ' ' have been inserted after " mode," and they refer, not to any quality in the goods, but to their history.

                <para class="block">English Act, refers to the history of the goods. What it means is the place of origin; as, in the case of guano, the islands from which it has come. If the word "origin," as used in the clause, refers to the circumstances under which goods are made, why are the words "conditions of manufacture" also used? The English section provides that goods may be marked to show that some authority certifies them to be of certain quality or grade; but, under the clause, the conditions of manufacture may also be certified to. This is a tremendous step towards legalizing the trade union label; but I would suggest to the Attorney-General that the words should be omitted from the clause,- and the matter left to be dealt with in Part VII. The clause differs from the English provision :.1SO in the fact that the Minister of Trade and Customs is substituted for the Board of Trade. I cannot at the present moment think of any other authority who might take the place of the Board of Trade. </para>

                        <para>- He is a verv bad substitute, because it is conceivable that we might have a Minister whose views would unconsciously be coloured by his political opinions. I admit that we could not imagine such a thing happening in. connexion with the present Minister ; but future Ministers may not all be like him. If the words " or conditions " are left in the clause, it can be used, not only for the legalization of workers' trade marks in the way proposed 'to be sanctioned by the Attorney-General, but even in the way in which they are used in the United States, where the consent of the registered proprietor of a mark is required before it can be used. Therefore, the clause is really worse than the Attorney-General's workers' trade marks provisions. Any association, if the Minister judges it to be to the public advantage, mav be authorized to register a brand relating to the conditions of the manufacture of goods, and have the goods issued with that brand on them, whether it is, or is not a trader, and is, or is not possessed of a goodwill in connexion with such examination and certifying. The association may have no ownership in the goods, and, as a fact, may have nothing to do with their manufacture, but may farm out its label to favoured maufacturers. . That is the objection to the union trade mark provisions as they came from the Senate, which the Government recognised as a valid one. </para>

Whether the Minister said " yes " or " no," a purely trade matter could be made a political question of the most acute character. I have looked at this clause very carefully, and I find that it would enable everything to be done that could Have been done by clauses 73 to 78 that we have just struck out of the measure. </para>

                        <para>- Then why not leave out the word's "or conditions"? My objection, applies most strongly to them. The clause with those words in it would enable everything to be done that could have been done under the provision that was passed by the Senate. The Minister could find a hundred reasons for coming to the conclu-sion that the registration would be for. the public advantage. Will the Attorney-General deny that a trade union could, under this clause, with the consent of the Minister, get a union label registered and applied to goods produced under union conditions? Further, will he deny that that union could refuse to grant the use of the label to an employer? </para>

                        <para>- If the clause is to go through as it is, I would sooner have none of it. I desire to direct the attention of honorable members to the wording of the clause. It provides that where any association undertakes the examination of any goods in respect of conditions of manufacture, and certifies the result of such examination by a mark used upon such goods, the Minister may, if he judges that it would be to the public advantage, permit the association to register the mark. It does not need a lawyer to understand what that means. That means that any association may have its mark, and that it may examine goods in respect to conditions of manufacture - as to whether they are union-made goods or not, not as to whether they are made under fair or unfair conditions </para>

                        <para>- I say the same thing, and if the honorable member will look at some amendments I have suggested, he will find that I am in favour of adopting that course. The clause would enable a trade union to undertake the examination of goods, and to certify whether they had been made under union conditions- irrespective of whether other goods have been made under fair conditions. And if the Minister considered it in the public interest - and I think some Ministers would have generous ideas upon that point - the association would be enabled to register its mark as a trade mark. The mark would then belong to the union, which could agree or refuse, as it chose, to place it on goods. It could decline to attach the mark to goods made under conditions that would justify its being applied to them. All the union would have to do, would be to undertake the examination of the goods with respect to the conditions of their manufacture, and no doubt they would perform; that part of the work with great cheerfulness. They would also succeed in giving the Minister reasons why their label should be registered. I think that some Ministers, in the generosity .and kindness of their hearts, might be very easily persuaded on that point, and yet the only bulwark between the position I have put and the discriminating use of the union label is the non-approval of the Minister. Much as I esteem that gentleman, and highly as I value his powers of resistance - I have seen him resist the opposition coming from this corner with great vigour- </para>

                        <para>- I have not. I fear that he would not be able to resist it. I say that these words have been inserted for a specific purpose. To my mind, it is desirable that the <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> dispute between honorable members, as to the wisdom of incorporating these provisions in the Bill, should take place upon definite proposals, and not upon a proposal to insert a few words which are apparently harmless, but the introduction of which, as a matter of fact, is fraught with the greatest danger. Unless the Attorney-General agrees to omit "or conditions of manufacture," I trust that the second reading of this clause will not be carried. </para>

                    <para>- I desire to express my personal obligation to the honorable and learned member for Corinella for having directed our attention to a feature of this clause which had previously escaped my notice. It seems to me that the words which have been introduced by the Attorney-General add another objectionable restriction to those which have already been imposed under the Commerce Bill. Hitherto public attention has been wholly directed to Part VII. of this measure. Nobody ever dreamed that any other part of it was pregnant with the, possibilities to which reference has been made by the honorable and learned member for Corinella. I say that the Attorney-General should have frankly assisted the Committee to understand the extent of the application of this clause. The more I read it, the more I am convinced that he has approached as closely as he can to the definition of a worker's trade mark. I trust that the discussion upon this proposal will be limited to the merits or demerits of such a trade mark. Nobody ever suspected that any other portion of the Bill contained an insidious provision of this character. </para>

                    (Angas).- After looking through this clause, to which I referred yesterday, I am further convinced that I was not altogether wrong in surmising that these variations from the English Act have been made deliberately, in order to allow the union label to be registered, apart altogether from the specific clauses with which we have yet to deal. My first impression has been confirmed by the shape which the new clauses have now assumed. If honorable members will read the last series of proposals tabled by the Attorney-General, they will see that they do not clearly declare what a union label means.

                        <para>- My impression is that the alteration which has been made fits in with the scope that the Bill has acquired, by reason of the excision of some words which appear in English legislation, and of the addition of others. I agree with the remarks of the honorable and learned member in this connexion. The words "mode of manufacture" may appear to be comparatively innocent; but I may tell honorable members that in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Regina</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Bramall,</inline> which was brought under the Merchandise Marks Act of 1887, they were held to refer to the question of whether an article had been machine-made or hand-made. That has nothing whatever to do with the union label. What particularly struck me when I saw these words introduced, was that in some of the leaflets issued by associations in America for the purpose of expounding the objects of the union label, it is actually stated that they are intended to secure certain forms of label. Is not that significant? Leaflets have been distributed in the United States, setting forth the objects of the union label, and in these it is stated that it is designed to secure fair conditions of labour. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> B. Reynolds, who is the head of the well-known college settlement in New York City, on behalf of a committee who were organizing to push the union label, issued a leaflet explaining what the label was designed to do, and in one part of this leaflet it is stated that - </para>

                <para class="block">These are the words of the head of a representative body which met chiefly to discuss the extension of the union label, objection having been raised that its use was against the consumer, as the products to which it was applied were not always of the best quality. One of the professed objects of the union label is to insure better " conditions of1 labour." In this clause, we have the words " conditions of manufacture," but "conditions of labour," in relation to the union label, have been held to refer to proper sanitation, shorter hours, and the class of house in which the goods bearing the union label are manufactured. I think it ought to be fairly clear to the Committee that by retaining these words we really extend the scope of the Bill, and that even if the subsequent clauses be not accepted by the Committee it will be possible for the Minister to recognise the union label. The clause would enable a certificate to be placed upon goods indicating that they had been manufactured under conditions which the unions thought suitable. In addition to that, this clause falls in with those dealing with the Commonwealth label which appear in Part VIIA. in the list of amendments. Even if that part be not accepted, this will practically accomplish all that is desired. There may be some difficulty in applying the clause. A man may not have power to walk into a factory to see under what conditions work is carried on. No right is given, but we know that men do make such inquiries </para>

                        <para>- I admit that there are certain difficulties in the way of the application of the clause in the direction I SUE gest. I may be met* at the outset by the statement that ar manufacturer is not compelled to allow a man to enter his factory to ascertain the conditions under which his goods are manufactured. But if he were allowed, a man might go into a factory and inquire generally as to the conditions under which goods were produced there. He might say that the men were compelled to work ten hours a day for very low wages, that the apprentices were in excess of the number that should be employed, and that their wages were below the current rates. This clause will accomplish all that is desired by the union label. </para>

                        <para>- I do not wish to anticipate action on the part of the honorable and learned member, but some one must move their omission before the debate closes, because a division ought to be taken on the question of whether this clause should pass as it stands. The Attorney-General may convince us that it is a very useful addition to the English legislation - that it will bring the Bill more into harmony with the Act of 1905 ; but until he is able to do so I shall remain of opinion that the words to which I have referred should be excised. </para>

                    (Indi- Attorney-General). - I can only say that my honorable friends have discovered a "mare's nest." The extent to which the clause departs from the English Act is perfectly plain on the face of it. First of all, the words "Any Commonwealth or State authority" have been inserted. We know that the Commonwealth authority has not yet done anything in this direction, although it may do so in connexion with the Commerce Bill. But the State authority does in many instances undertake the examination of goods for export, and for other purposes, to the advantage of the country.

                        <para>- Quite so. Trade unions could not come under this clause, and I never supposed that they could. I cannot understand how it can be said that a provision as to an association of persons who undertake the examination of goods for any one who asks them to do so can be applied to a trade union. What is the meaning of "association" as used in this clause? It is simply this: That there are some persons, whether in association or not, who hold themselves out as expert examiners of goods, and who may issue certificates in respect of goods that are submitted to them. We have, for instance, the goldsmiths, who issue certificates in respect of gold and silver plate; but this clause is to apply to all goods. Certificates may be issued by an association, and if it acquires a high reputation, the Minister, if he thinks it to the advantage of the public, may permit it to secure a trade mark. But this is not to apply to trade unions. </para>

It is conceivable, we are told, that an examination of goods as to their conditions of manufacture may be necessary for purposes other than those relating to their origin, material, mode, and so forth, but for what other purposes?

                        <para>- Why not? We have had reasons before to-day to distrust Commonwealth and State Cabinets, and I, for one, am not prepared to give the Minister of Trade and Customs any further powers in this direction than those which he now enjoys. In the marginal note we are told that this clause relates to the standardization of goods, and the application of trade marks to them. I find, on referring to the Commerce Bill, that there is to be no inquiry under that measure as to the nature of goods, although it has been specially charged with such matters. Reference is made in it, not to the method of manufacture, but to the manufacturer or producer. Why, therefore, should a distinction, be made in this instance ? There is nothing in the phraseology of the clause which would exclude trade unions from its operation. </para>

" Conditions of manufacture " are words which refer to something other than quality or mode, or make-up of goods, and it would be part of the functions of a well-regulated trade union to see that only goods manufactured under union conditions were certified to. The insertion of the words in the clause may have been accidental, but the Attorney-General hag shown a recognition of the force of the criticism which they have provoked in his willingness to suggest an amendment to meet it. </para>

There is reason in the Commerce Bill, and possibly in some States Acts, for providing for the marks of a Commonwealth or State authority, though I do not know that it is very desirable to extend the functions of Government in the manner proposed.

If the word "association" were struck out, it would prevent the Wholesale Jewellers' Association of Melbourne, for instance, from registering its hall mark, because it is not the owner of the goods to which t-hat mark is applied. </para>

                    (Indi- Attorney-General). - When the honorable and learned member rose first he suggested a fear that trades unions might make use of the words " conditions of manufacture " in order to accomplish all that it was desired to achieve under the part of the Bill relating to the use of workers' trade marks. I have absolutely removed that suggestion, and still he is not satisfied. If that were the only reason 'that actuated the honorable and learned member, why is he still persisting in striking out the words?

                        <para>- I have never put that as a test of sweating. The States would say whether the goods were made under sweating conditions or otherwise, and the only fear must be - and the honorable and learned member was challenged to state his reasons, and he did not do so - lest the State will undertake to inform the people whether or not the goods are made under humane conditions. I am not going to yield to an objection of that kind. </para>

                        <para>- I am not dealing with that question. My point is that we are dealing with a proper subject for trade mark law. A similar provision has been adopted by the British Parliament. The principle of this clause is one that has been challenged in this House and outside of it. It has been held that you cannot have a proper conception of trade mark unless the mark belongs to the owner of the goods. </para>

The principle of this clause is that the ownership of the trade mark is not in the person in whom the proprietorship of the goods is. vested. If the words objected to are resisted on the ground that we should not permit the State if it chooses to inform the people as to the conditions of manufacture, I cannot accept the amendment. </para>

                    (Corinella).- The Attorney-General has charged me with being unwilling to allow the public to be informed as to whether or not goods have been manufactured under sweating or humane conditions. I want to tell him that that statement is utterly incorrect. My quarrel has all along been with the false theory that only union-made goods are turned out under humane and proper conditions, and it is for that reason that I have taken up the attitude of opposition to these particular words and to other clauses. If the Attorney-General had taken the trouble to read certain amendments I have suggested in connexion with other clauses, he would have found that I recognise that the real issue should be between sweated ' and non-sweated goods. In all the States that have Arbitration Acts or Wages Boards which control the hours and wages and kindred conditions of labour, those industries to which the awards of the Courts or the determinations of the Boards apply, are carried on under proper conditions, whether the employes be unionists or non-unionists.

                        <para>- There are evasions, no doubt, and the evaders should be severely punished. The distinction between unionists and non-unionists does not affect the issue of sweating at all, and it is because that false issue has been raised - an issue alien to the whole spirit of Australian legislation - that honorable members are quarrelling with the proposal of the Attorney-General. I thought that the Attorney-General would have known better than to make such charges. He made an <inline font-style="italic">adcaptandum</inline> appeal to imagined ignorance, instead of an appeal to reason. It was unworthy of him, and unworthy of the position he occupies to use any such arguments. I object to the State or to an association making a distinction which is not a real distinction between fairly-made and unfairly-made goods. </para>

                        <para>- No; but the distinction between non-unionists and unionists could be made under the provisions of the clause, and that is the cause of my quarrel with it. My objection to the words proposed to be struck out is that they make it possible to introduce a false standard of comparison in Australia - one which is alien to the spirit of the wise Australian legislation which has provided fpr Arbitration Courts and Wages Boards to regulate the conditions of work. </para>

                    <para>- There is another phase of this question which I should like to present with a view to indicate the necessity of retaining the words which the honorable and learned member for Corinella wishes to strike out. Any one who has watched the trend of legislation in the States must realize that the interests of the public are being conserved to a greater extent every day. A Pure Foods Bill is before the Victorian Parliament, and measures of a similar character have already been passed by other States Legislatures, and we should, by means of the Bill now before us, endeavour to assist the States to carry on their good work. It can readily be recognised that in order to make effective the work of a State Department, or the work of an association which may be formed for the specific purpose of examining and certifying as to the quality of goods,, some provision must be made for the registration of the marks which will indicate that the goods have been made under satisfactory conditions, and that they are pure and up to standard. Let us take the case of the Victorian butter industry. Not only is the produce examined as to quality and branded accordingly, but inquiries are made as to the conditions under which it is manufactured. In the event of faulty samples of butter being received, inspectors are sent to the factories from which they were received to instruct the managers in the most approved methods of production. </para>

                        <para>- I am stating facts which I contend have an important bearing upon the amendment. Every one knows that the conditions of manufacture affect the quality of many goods - particularly articles of food. At present the States authorities make provision for the inspection of meat and rabbits, and other articles of food, with a view to protecting the public as far as possible against the dissemination of disease. It is well known that goods made in sweating establishments have been the means of spreading disease, and it is surely necessary to provide some safeguard against the sale of such articles. Unless goods are made under wholesome conditions they cannot be pure. I contend that if we agree to the amendment, we shall incur considerable risk in this connexion. </para>

                        <para>- No. But I object to introducing provisions of that nature into this Bill. We ought to have been told what was the intention and purport of the measure. It is not a Trade Marks Bill in the ordinary sense of the term at all. It is a measure which seeks to promote the health of the* people, and to insure that they shall work under fair conditions. I say that we have not the constitutional power to do anything of that kind. During the present and previous sessions, we have been endeavouring to secure an alteration in the Constitution, so as to permit the Commonwealth to legislate in regard to factory inspection and' uniform industrial laws. We cannot do that without first securing an amendment of the Constitution, but we can " sneak" those matters into this Bill, I suppose? </para>

                        <para>- Trade marks do not affect the health of the people, or the conditions under which they live and labour. They affect solely the quality of articles of merchandise, and they have nothing necessarily to do with the conditions under which goods are produced. Certainly they have nothing to do with the health of the people. We require another set of laws entirely to compass those objects. What we cannot do under the Constitution by means of factory legislation, we are endeavouring to clandestinely effect in this Bill. That is not straightforward conduct; and I venture to say that it will be entirely ineffective for the purposes contemplated by honorable members opposite should it ever be placed upon our statute-book.

If we desire to enact factory legislation and to provide proper sanitary conditions for the workers let us support the honorable member for Melbourne Ports in his endeavour to secure an amendment of the Constitution which will enable us to obtain control of these powers. Then, we may use them throughout the length and breadth of Australia. I say again, that in this Bill we are seeking to usurp a function which is already provided for in the Commerce Bill. That measure inquires into the condition of rabbits, meat, &amp;c, and vests the Minister with power to brand them. </para>

Would it afford an additional guarantee that the beef was fit for human consumption? I say again that under the Attorney-General's amendment we are setting up a piece of factory legislation which will enable us to assist the States in the inspection of factories and in the determination of the conditions which various goods shall be made. It is not within our legislative compass to do that. To insert this clause would, at the best, be a meddling interference with the States. If we want these further powers let us take the straightforward course suggested by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, and ask the States to grant them to us. </para>

                    WILLIS (Robertson).After having listened to the discussion upon this measure, I am bound to confess that the honorable and learned member for Angas was right when he said that the clause is unnecessary, and should be struck" out. If the honorable and learned member for Corinella is sincere in his desire to nullify the bad effect of the provision, he will agree to the suggestion of the Attorney-General, who is willing to confine its operation to a State which may appoint an officer for the purpose of having a trade mark registered. Either the honorable and learned member is opposed to the clause entirely, or he is not. If he is opposed to it he should vote for its excision, but if he merely wishes to nullify its bad effect he will accept the suggestion of the Attorney-General. In my opinion, the deputy leader of the Opposition was right when he declared that the object of the clause is to give an additional power to trade unions. It amplifies what is proposed in Part VII. of the Bill. The amendment of the honorable and learned member for Corinella will have no more effect than will the proposal of the Attorney-General, and, consequently, I decline to support it.

                    (Kooyong). - I admit at once that the Attorney-General has gone a considerable distance towards removing the fear that I had entertained in regard to the possible application of this clause. But in the most complete way he has justified the discussion which has taken place. He admits that he had in his mind that a State or Commonwealth authority might interfere with the conditions under which goods are produced. I am sure that the public did not for one moment believe that such a sinister proposal was hidden in this clause, and I regret that the Attorney-General has not dealt more frankly with the Committee. Honorable members opposite must not imagine that they possess a monopoly of the desire to protect the workers. I claim that I am as anxious as is any honorable member to improve the lot of the working classes, and in support of that statement would point to my record outside. The desire of the Opposition is that this Bill shall be so framed that the public will be able to tell at a glance for what purpose it is designed. We do not wish it to be converted into a Public Health Bill, a Wages Board Bill, or anything of that kind, and we hold, therefore, that it should relate strictly to trade marks. In the opinion of the Opposition, the proposed new Part VII. is opposed to the interests of the workers, and will afford ground for a fair fight between the opposing forces. But we did not expect that an outpost in the shape of this clause would be put forward lest the main army might be defeated. We have not been fairly treated, and I resent the suggestion made by the Attorney-General, that the Opposition, in opposing this clause, are influenced by a desire to prevent all work being carried out under humane conditions. Our opposition is based on the one ground that such a provision as this should not be introduced in this part of the Bill, and that we ought to have had from the Attorney-General a frank explanation of the effect of a new clause brought in by himself. If we cannot repose the fullest confidence in the Attorney-General, we have reached a sorry stage. The honorable and learned gentleman told me the other day that he was Attorney-General not only for the Ministry, but for the House, and I should like him to deal with the Committee from that stand-point. He must have made the mental reservation that there was a power in this clause which did not appear on the surface, and he should have acted frankly--

The ordinary forgery provisions of a criminal code make the forgery and the <inline font-style="italic">mens re</inline> the two things necessary for a conviction. Here, apparently, the principle observed in the Customs Act of assuming the guilt of a person until he proves his innocence is applied to a limited extent. I would ask the Attorney-General what are the reasons for departing from the ordinary form of the criminal code ? </para>

                    (Indi- Attorney-General). - I cannot for the moment place my hand on the English Act from which this is taken, but I think that it is in the ordinary form. The offence referred to in paragraph
                    <inline font-style="italic">a</inline>
                    speaks for itself. The false application of a registered trade mark to any goods, which is dealt with in paragraph
                    <inline font-style="italic">b</inline>
                    may be the mere fact of false application, whilst I think that the offences mentioned in the succeeding paragraphs are of such a class that the person charged should at least prove that he had no intent to defraud So far as. three of these cases are concerned. I do not know how we could do otherwise than presume the guilt of the person concerned. But, as to one of them, I can understand--

It prevents blackmailers from pretending to be honest friends of the public, but it does not protect the importer who has innocently contravened the provisions of the Act. I shall not propose any amendment, but I think that the Minister or the Collector of Customs should be empowered to forego forfeiture of goods when satisfied that the importer has not wilfully contravened the Act, provided that the forged trade mark is erased, and, perhaps, some penalty paid. I do not think that an innocent Australian consignee should suffer for the wrong-doing of a foreign consignor. </para>

                    <para>- Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> provides that goods imported into Australia bearing the registered trade mark of any locally-manufactured article shall be forfeited to the King. It is desirable that the Customs authorities shall have power to confiscate goods to which a locally-registered trade mark has been fraudulently applied, but the paragraph to which I refer may be used by a local manufacturer as a weapon against an importing competitor. An imported article may bear as its registered trade mark, let us say, a lion, and under this provision a local manufacturer, by registering a lion as his trade mark, could prevent further importations. </para>

Australia is only a small market for many of the manufacturers of other countries. Knives go from Sheffield to all parts of the world, but the Australian market is not large enough to justify Sheffield manufacturers in using special trade marks to meet Australian conditions, until they know that that is absolutely necessary. If a local manufacturer were to register one of these trade marks, he could cause the forfeiture of all goods then in transmission. </para>

In view of the early, close of the session, we must sit not only. for longer hours, but upon more days than we have hitherto devoted to the business of the country. I hope that honorable members after this early adjournment will give us their best assistance in disposing of the Trade Marks Bill this week, because, even with the extra days and hours at our disposal, our strength will be taxed to the utmost to dispose of the measures awaiting our attention before Christmas. </para>

                        <para>- It would be almost as great a pity to interfere with the private liberties of honorable members in regard to going to and returning from their homes, as it would be to endeavour to force through the Trade Marks Bill by the application of the " gag." It seems to me that we ought to know definitely what we may expect, because many of us have to make arrangements ahead. For instance, I have made an appointment to proceed to my constituency with a Minister in order to attend to certain departmental requirements. If the House is to sit late on Friday next, and meet on the following day, I shall have to abandon all my plans. It should be fully understood that the decision to sit on extra days is not due to any action on the part of the Opposition in delaying business, but to the desire of the Government to push through an undue amount of work before the session closes. </para>

                    <para>- I hope the Prime Minister will adhere to his determination to make the fullest possible use of the time at our disposal between now and Christmas. In view of the time that has been lost, if not wasted, during the last few months, it is extraordinary to hear honorable members in opposition raising an objection to devoting a little extra time to the business of the country. They should have some consideration for representatives of the distant States, who are anxious to return as soon as possible to their constituents, whom they have no opportunity of visiting more than once during the year. We have very little to show for the time that we have been in session, and I hope that the Government will insist upon carrying through their programme. I shall give them all the assistance I can. </para>
