                        <para>- I would ask the Prime Minister whether he has noticed that the nitrogen-producing plants, by means of which American agricultural scientists have been impregnating the soil with bacilli, with the object of increasing its productiveness, are reported to be growing prolifically in the Mount Lofty Range, near Adelaide; and, if so, whether he will cause inquiries to be made with a view to the utilization of the Australian plants, should the representations in regard to them prove to be justified, in less favoured localities in the Commonwealth? I would suggest that, in the first instance, the Prime Minister should communicate with <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Holtze,</inline> the director of the Adelaide Botanical Gardens, and of the Government, experimental orchard at Mylor, in the Mount Lofty Range. </para>

                        <para>- I think that we are all acquainted with the marvellous expectations that, have been cherished in the United States in connexion with nitrogen-producing bacilli, and if there be, as there seems to be, some warrant for these expectations, the discovery referred to by the honorable member should prove one of the utmost importance. I shall have pleasure <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> directing that the matter be further investigated. </para>

                        <para>- I think that all but one of the communications have been published in the press. The first announcement by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Quick was not communicated to me, but appeared in the form of a statement in the newspapers, which I had overlooked until I was questioned in regard to it in the House. At a meeting of the Commission in Adelaide <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Quick, as chairman, remarked that he had postponed an intended meeting of the Commission in Melbourne in consequence of a statement attributed to me in the press. In my first glance through the newspapers I did not discover the statement to which reference was made, but a latter search disclosed the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Quick&#39;s impression was gathered from an inference drawn by the writer of a newspaper article from certain remarks made by me in the House. Such an inference was not in my mind at the time I spoke. I informed <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Quick to this effect, and also advised him that I had just mentioned to the House that it was still possible that progress reports would be received from the Commission before the close of the session. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Quick expressed regret that I had been misinterpreted. In view of the inference which had been drawn from my remarks, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Quick had stated that no reports would be presented by the Commission until after Christmas, but on my pointing out to him that any report received after Christmas would have the slenderest chance of being considered immediately, he intimated that an effort would be made to present a report before Christmas. </para>

            <para>I do so for the purpose of entering a preliminary protest against the manner in which this Bill is being forced on our attention at the present time. A little while ago we were told that certain measures, notably the Immigration Restriction Amendment Bill, the Seat of Government Bill, and the Electoral Bill, were important, and must be passed this session. The measures mentioned are of the very first order of urgency and importance, and yet the Bill now before us has been suddenly thrust into the forefront of the Government programme. A week ago the consideration of the Electoral Bill was definitely fixed upon as the business for to-day, but we find that, without any announcement to the House, another Bill has been substituted. The Prime Minister told me only a few minutes before we rose on Friday that this Bill would be considered to-day, and the announcement caused me no small degree of surprise. </para>

                        <para>- I have no wish to do anything of that kind, but at the same time, I do not intend to be bounced by the Attorney-General. His words are idle so far as I am concerned, except that they may provoke unpleasant retorts. I conceive that I am merely doing my duty in raising my present objection to the action of the Government. Honorable members were not told that there was to be any departure from the programme previously indicated by the order of business on the notice-paper. The Electoral1 Bill is of infinitely greater importance than the measure now before us. I am not now speaking of the relative intrinsic importance of the measures, but of their urgency so far as their order of precedence is concerned. There cannot be, even among those who are specially interested in the proposal relating to the use of union labels, any idea that this measure is of more urgency than the Electoral Bi:,1 </para>

                        <para>- I do not quite understand the honorable member. If he will indicate any way in which the matter can be readily dealt with by the Committee, I shall be quite ready to accommodate him. In my view, the matters to which I have referred are of more urgency than the Bill now under discussion. We were told by the honorable member for Gwydir that 800 persons had been left off the Electoral roll in his constituency, owing to the defective organization of the Electoral Department. We are led to be&#62;lieve by the responsible officers that this disorganization is due to defective legislative machinery, and I think we ought first to direct our attention to matters which are of extreme importance to this House and to the Commonwealth, and allow to stand in abeyance a matter which, at best, can affect only a section of the people. There is no reason for forcing this Bill upon our attention at the present stage. In addition to the matters of urgency, to which I have referred, there is the Sugar Bounties Bill. I have never seen any Government chop and change about with their business as the present Ministry have done. We discussed for two days the Sugar Bounties Bill, which deals with a matter profoundly affecting one of the greatest industries in Australia, and now that measure has apparently to take a back seat until we can dispose of the Bill before us. Then there is the question of population, which, according to the Prime Minister, is supremely urgent. He has introduced amending measures relating to the influx of population to Australia, which have been declared time and again to be of urgent public importance. I have never heard the Prime Minister say that the question of adopting the use of union labels was an urgent or important one. The Attorney-General, even in his wildest flights of pretended sympathy with the unions of Australia, has never said that the question of the use of union labels should be placed in the forefront of the Government programme. Now we are asked to set aside a number of important measures in order that we may betake ourselves to the discussion of a Bill of a highly controversial character, which will provoke long debate and probably create? a good deal of feeling. I protest against this Bill being considered before we have dealt with the measure relating to the redistribution of the electoral power of Australia, before we have dealt with those measures which affect the great sugar industry, and the relationship of the Government proposals to our revenue, and before we have dealt with the question of the introduction of suitable population to Australia, without, which these union-label proposals will be ai dead letter, even if we assume them to be good. All these matters are of infinitely more importance than is &#34;that which <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> now ruthlessly thrust before the attention of the House. ~ Then I object for another reason to precedence being given to this Bill. It is in its very essence, a Bill to create strife. I can describe it in no other way. It is also a measure which possesses no good features by way of a set off. On the contrary, it will sow the seeds of discord between employers and employes in Australia, and will create a rancorous bitterness which we have not known heretofore, but which has been created1 in the country where union-label proposals are most popular - I refer to the United States. But whatever reason may exist there for passing a measure of this character, there can be none in Australia. We have provided other means of settling our industrial disputes, and of arranging and adjusting the relations between capital and labour. Whatever provisions may be applicable to industrial conditions in other parts of the world, they cannot apply to Australia in the sense in which this Trade Marks Bill would apply them. </para>

                <para>I hold that we are aiming at bringing into effect ai proposal which has -no good to recommend it, and which will only create strife in the ramifications of our Australian industrial life. Therefore, I protest as earnestly as I can against forcing the measure through at this time, and under the circumstances .before us. </para>

I hope that this House will meet such tactics as they deserve to be met. The deputy leader of the Opposition to-day - as he has frequently done - has made statements concerning myself which are absolutely unjustified. His remarks this afternoon are entirely in the nature of an after-thought, because, when he asked the Prime Minister the other day what business he intended to proceed .with to-day, there was no expostulation or protest by him. When, in the course of his remarks. &#39; he was challenged upon that important point, he did not venture to answer, but interposed remarks which were absolutely unworthy of him. </para>

The Government have proceeded with business practically in the order in which it appeared upon the business-paper. The Trade Marks Bill was set down for consideration many months ago, and it was in deference to the wish of a deputation representing the Melbourne Chamber of Commerce - a deputation which -was introduced by the honorable member for Kooyong - -that we consented not to press it at that time. We agreed to allow them an opportunity to give the measure their very fullest consideration. Now, when we resume its discussion in the ordinary course, the deputy leader of the Opposition - using the forms of the House - intervenes with a proposal that the Chairman do leave the chair. I ask honorable members to accord that motion the treatment that it deserves - to allow the honorable member and his supporters to talk as they please upon it, and thus to assist us in getting to business as soon as possible. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; it has appeared on the business-paper for a significantly long time. Some time ago, to-day was specifically set apart for the further consideration of a very important measure - I refer to the Electoral Bill. For some days the further consideration of that </para>

                <para class="block">Bil&#93; has been set down for to-day. We all recognise that that Bill is an important one - not intrinsically important as contrasted with some of the great questions of policy which are involved in other measures before the House, but important because of the necessity which exists for passing it before this session closes, in order that the new processes to be observed in connexion with the election soma twelve months hence, if not sooner, may not be interfered with. Consequently, I think that the deputy leader of the Opposition was more than justified in inquiring the reasons for the change which has been made in the order of business. But because he protested the Attorney-General forthwith threatened every honorable member who may differ from him in his view of the measure under immediate consideration. He declared in a way which I think was needlessly far from being conciliatory, that the press had stated that the Opposition were going to use all the forms of the House in order to delay its passing. When he was told that that statement was entirely unauthorized - and he himself produced very cogent evidence of the fact that it was unauthorized by pointing out that the deputy leader of the Opposition raised no protest upon Friday - the Attorney-General said, &#34;Well, if it was not inspired, at any rate, it appears to be correct.&#34; He appealed to the House to view the matter from that point of view. That is a deliberate invitation to the majority to use its numbers in lieu of its reasoning faculties - a not unfamiliar sight in Legislatures, it must be admitted. He thus made a distinct threat against those who may feel it their duty to give this important measure that consideration to which it is entitled. </para>

                        <para>- The majority in favour of the Government last session was not very large, and it was somewhat precarious, even when allowance is made for its size. That, however, is hardly a reason why the Chairman should leave the chair to-day. I regret that I have been led to digress somewhat by the irrelevant interjections which have been made by some honorable members in the Labour Corner. I think we are all agreed that there are portions of the Trade Marks Bill which give rise to certain divergences of opinion, which involve very important questions of policy, and which inevitably must compel a good deal of discussion. The Government cannot expect a minority - I am informed that the numbers upon the union label provisions are very close - to allow a measure of this kind to pass without placing their views fully before the Committee and the country, in the reasonable hope that they may make converts and so transform their minority into a majority. </para>

At the present time I find that there are nine measures upon the business-paper, quite apart from the numerous notices of motion by private members, which will be included in the first batch of slaughtered innocents. There is the Electoral Bill, to which I have already referred and the passing of which is particularly urgent. There are also the Sugar Bounty Bill and the Excise Bill, which I imagine a. considerable number of honorable members think must be passed this session. </para>

                        <para>- And, as they are aware, I am supporting them. It is essential in the interests, not only of Queensland,, but of Australian productions, that those measures should be passed. The Prime Minister has told us that he desires the session to close before Christmas. I am quite sure that, however we may differ from him upon other questions, most of us agree that this Parliament should not be expected to sit all the year round - that attendance here for five or six months in the year makes a sufficient demand upon the time of honorable members. I say frankly that a session of that duration makes quite enough demand upon honorable members. We do not occupy seats in this Legislature as a permanent means of earning a livelihood, although some people, judging by the way they speak of the necessity of Parliament sitting continually, appear to think we do. Whether this Parliament sits in Melbourne or Dalgety, a six months&#39; session should be quite sufficient. We must remember, also, that a general election must take place at the latest at the end of next year. It may come earlier, but I am afraid that it will not. In any event, it must take place at the end of next year, because the Senate elections must be held during the course of 1906, and none of us would be prepared, unless a very considerable interval intervened, to support the holding of a. general election for members of the House of Representatives apart from the elections for that Chamber. In view of this fact, it must be recognised that, if any variation is to be made next year in regard to the time at which Parliament shall be called together, our deliberations must commence earlier than hitherto. In other words, we must meet in May instead of in, say, July. </para>

I find that we have the Census and Statistics Bills which should not occupy much time, and also the Copyright Bill, awaiting our consideration. The latter is a long and important measure, which has not vet passed the second-reading debate. These Bills, together with the Bill to amend the Immigration Restriction Act, the Contract Immigrants&#39; Bill, and the Manufactures Encouragement Bill, which are said to be of an urgent and aressing character, are sufficient to occupy the attention of the House for some time. </para>

                        <para>- I wish them to be passed, but my desire is that they shall be fairly dealt with. The Government have arranged the business of the House in such a way that there will not be a fair chance for them to be passed this session, or, at all events, to be properly considered before they are finally dealt with. I was surprised to learn that the Trade Marks Bill was to be further considered to-day. The Attorney-General tells us that the delay in resuming its consideration has been due to his desire to comply with the wish of certain critics, who desired to give further attention to it. That sounds excellent. </para>

                        <para>- That is so, but notwithstanding that statement, the further consideration of the Bill was forthwith delayed, and now, although no one anticipated that its consideration, would be resumed this session, it is once more brought forward. I do not know whether or not this is due to the fact that the Attorney-General has a leisure week; but the statement made late on Friday that the Trade Marks Bill would be the first business for to-day certainly caused some surprise. I have the greatest doubt as to the wisdom of certain portions of the measure, and I cannot undertake to support them until I hear more in their favour than has yet been adduced. As one of those who think that an important matter of this kind should be fully and fairly discussed, and not pushed on by mere efforts of brute force at the end of a session, I wish to make my protest against the Government proposal. The business on the notice-paper, as it stands, is sufficient to occupy our attention for a session, and the most contentious of all this business is that which is now brought forward. As a matter of fact, the business of the House took a fresh start last week, many new measures being then placed on the notice-paper. I know that it is only beating the wind to make any protest ; that, as the honorable member for Riverina pithily puts it, the Government have control of the business, and have a majority consisting of honorable members who will do anything that they ask. I venture to say, however, that they will find that many of their supporters will require more information in regard to the Trade Marks Bill than we have been accustomed, during the past few months, to receive from the Ministerial benches. </para>

                    a matter of fact. I had a conversation in the lobby with the Prime Minister in regard to this very matter, and did my best to dissuade him from taking any course which would interfere with the passing of the Electoral Bill. I pointed out the urgency of that measure, and told him that even if it were passed at once the Department would not be placed in thorough working order before the expiration of the present Parliament.

The honorable and learned member reminds me of the cuttle-fish, because whenever he finds himself in trouble he clouds the political&#39; waters in order that he may escape. That is what he did a few days since, and as soon as I rose this afternoon he met me with a rude interjection. I do not think that that is the way to expedite the business of the House, nor do I consider that the making of piteous appeals to his confreres in the Ministerial corner to &#34; sit tight &#34; will help him. Does not the honorable and learned gentleman see that these piteous appeals to his own side to refrain from speaking makes our obligation to fairly criticise these measures all the greater.

                        <para>- I do not object to these interjections ; they occupy a little time but serve no useful purpose. They certainly will not deter the Opposition from criticising this proposal in a fair and reasonable way. I have not the slightest doubt that that criticism will be searching, though I hope that it will not be unfair or unduly prolonged. If anything would tend to lengthen it, it would be the rudeness of those in charge of the measure, and the conspiracy of silence on the part of certain honorable members in regard to some of its provisions. I appeal to the Committee as to whether this is not a measure whose provisions should be debated and explained. No measure coming before us needs more searching criticism. It was most unfair for the Attorney-General to attack me as he did when I rose to protest publicly, as I had already protested privately to the Prime Minister, against the consideration of the Bill being forced on us to-day. I do not know what he intended to be the application of his remark about tombstones, but certain honorable members have been seriously thinking of subscribing to a tombstone for him, since his frequent absences from the Chamber have given us ground for believing him to be dead and gone. Probably the reason for the long postponement of the measure has not been a desire to compliment the honorable member for Kooyong and the Chambers behind him, so much as to consult the convenience of the Attorney-General. I have no intention of taking advantage of the forms of procedure to obstruct the measure. All I intend to do is to see that it is thoroughly and fairly discussed, and I hope that the Attorney-General will not make any more attacks on me for doing what it is undoubtedly my duty to do. </para>

I have no wish to prolong the discussion. It is generally Ministerial members who do that, whilst members of the Opposition are blamed for it. Although the Trade Marks Bill is the first order of the day on the notice-paper: to-day. for weeks past it has stood sixth, seventh, eighth, or ninth, and only on Friday last was eighth. Have not the Opposition a reason to protest against this sudden alteration of position, which has resulted in springing the measure upon the Committee? </para>

                        <para>- We hare come here to do business, and to pass other measures besides the Trade Marks Bill. I should not like the Government to be compelled to put up the shutters because the absence of the Labour Party left them no majority to work with. The Trade Marks Bill affects the Labour Party more than any other party, and consequently it would not be surprising if, directly it was passed, they were anxious to get into recess. The.mea-. sure is a controversial one, which it will take several nights - probably a fortnight - to pass. At the end of the time representatives from other States will wish to leave for their homes, so that they may spend the Christmas season with their families. What likelihood will there be of getting other measures through then? </para>

The Opposition have almost whined in their pleading to the Government that this measure should not be proceeded with at once. But, instead of being answered graciously, we have been spoken to by the Attorney-General in bullying tones, with a reference to tombstones, though I do not know what that reference meant, unless the honorable and learned gentleman wished to express his desire to see the Opposition under tombstones. At all events, his remark put me into a most miserable state of, mind, and I certainly cannot understand its application to the honorable member for Parramatta, who, as a. rule, is most jocular and genial. A literary acquaintance of mine, the sage of Chelsea, said that the best gospel ever written was that a lie should never .live. I apply Carlyle&#39;s statement to the remark of the Attorney- </para>

Surely he has not lost all interest in New South Wales. Last week, I was told to shut my eyes and open my mouth to see what I would get in regard to the Bill, but I said that I could not be taken in with promises of that kind. By keeping my eyes open, I have found that, although there are nine dishes on the bill of fare for to-day, the Seat of Government Bill is not one of them. It is not even an <inline font-style="italic">entree.</inline> In my opinion, this is a make-believe menu, and if we asked for a good many of the dishes set down on it we should be told, &#34; I am verv sorry, sir, but that dish is off.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- I do not intend to waste time by discussing the Bill under the motion that the Chairman do leave the chair. I am giving reasons why the Government should reconsider their attitude in regard to the Bill. For months it has been buried beneath other business ; and one might have thought that it was a measure having to do with the politics of Bulgaria or some country other than Australia, so little did we hear of it. The Attorney-General tells us to-day that the measure has been held back to meet the convenience of its critics outside, but the other day the newspapers reported him as saying that he would not delay the measure at all. Which statement does he stand by ? I do not know whether the honorable and learned gentleman is usual 1v peevish, but I hone that in future he will treat the Opposition differently. The honorable member for Parramatta has been grossly insulted by him, while he had no ground for saving that the Opposition are &#34; stone-walling.&#34; </para>

                    <para>- I desire to frankly announce that I shall do everything that lies, in my power to prevent the passing of the provision for the adoption of trade union labels. Every member of the mercantile community believes that the Government are endeavouring to pass legislation which will have a most pernicious effect upon our industries and upon trade and commerce generally, and if any waste of time occur? responsibility must rest upon the Government. The measure, as originally, drafted, was one which we should have been glad to assist the Government in passing into law, but it now has upon it a most objectionable excrescence in the form of the provisions for the adoption of trade union labels. It is quite a mistake for the Attorney-General to suggest that the honorable members who sit in the Opposition corner have been guilty of obstructing the, Government in their general conduct of the business of the House. On the contrary, we have done everything in our power to assist them in placing upon the statute-book measures which we regard as calculated to promote the best interests of the community. .Commercial men and manufacturers have given the Bill the most careful consideration, and they will fully approve of my conduct in declaring that I shall fight it to the bitter end. The Attorney-General stated that he desired to consult the interests of the members of the business community who waited upon him, .and I admit that he gave fair and reasonable hearing to their representations. He knows full well, however, that the members, of the deputation were not satisfied with the amendment he proposed, which, in fact, is regarded as even more objectionable than the original provision. We fought the Commerce Bill because we did not believe that it was a just measure. </para>

I am sure that my statement to this effect would be fully supported by many of the workers who are employed by the companies with which I am associated. My object has always been to secure fair play for every man, and any assertion to the contrary would be absolutely untrue. I do not adopt the apologetic attitude that has been taken up by .some honorable members v who have preceded me. Although I shall do nothing to waste time, I wish honorable members to know that the gloves are off, and that I shall oppose in every possible way a measure which, to the best of my belief, would have disastrous results.

                    <para>- I cannot take any exception to the course adopted by the honorable member for Parramatta in affording honorable members an opportunity to protest against the action of the Government in connexion with this measure. The programme before us is of such a character that the most sanguine cannot expect that it will be overtaken! during this session. The Electoral Bill is of immediate importance in view of the possibility that honorable members may unexpectedly be called upon to face their constituents. Then the Sugar Bounties Bill and the Sugar Excise Bill require to be dealt with in the interests of Queensland. Then there are the two measures for the amendment of the Immigration Restriction Act, which the Prime Minister has declared to be of the greatest urgency. Besides all these Bills, we still have to deal with the final stages of the Commerce Bill. Yet we are called upon to consider the most debatable Bill in the whole of the Government programme. We can quite understand why it is so debatable. The late Government themselves did not introduce the Bill in its present form. </para>

                        <para>- Apparently it is a question of bargaining, and I am opposed to any Ministry abandoning their principles for the sake of bargaining. Apart from that consideration, however, I claim that it has been too much the custom of this Parliament to accept the most important &#34;tacks&#34; to measures - &#34;tacks&#34; with the most far-reaching results - rather than risk their tenure of office. We had an instance of that in connexion with the Immigration Restriction Act. Did the provision which has caused the most trouble in the administration of that Act appear in the Bill in the form in which it was originally introduced? Certainly not. At first the proposal in question was opposed by the Government, but it was afterwards accepted. Similarly the provision prohibiting the employment of black labour upon mail steamers was not included in the Postal Act as that measure was originally introduced. As a matter of fact, the Government opposed it in the Senate, but when the Bill reached this Chamber they accepted the provision. Here we have another instance of the same procedure. I do not blame the Watson Government for their action. They naturally intended this Bill to deal with what are commonly supposed to be the objects of a trade marks measure. </para>

                        <para>- The Attorney-General is telling us the same old story - &#34;We are not so bad as our predecessors.&#34; He knows that I am speaking of &#34;tacks,&#34; which have more far-reaching effects than have the original measures themselves. This is another illustration of that practice. The provisions in regard to the union label were &#34;tacked&#34; to the Bil&#93; introduced by the Watson Government. The present Government have not only accepted those provisions, but have accepted them as part of the arrangement by which they hold office. </para>

                        <para>- I have already told the honorable member that if he did not mean all that I inferred I misinterpreted his language. But the fact is patent, nevertheless. The honorable member insists upon this measure being dealt with during the present session. I cannot understand the reason why he should insist upon pressing forward the union label provisions qf the Bill. He has maintained, both in this Parliament and in another, that our object should be to promote peace between employers and workmen. By sup- porting this Bill, he is introducing, not peace, but strife. After we have established tribunals in some of the States, in addition to the Federal tribunal, for the settlement of industrial disputes, the honorable member and his party are now acting as if thos,e institutions were useless. They are supporting a measure which will not only result in strife between employers and employes, but which will introduce strife into every household in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- What I have stated is a fact. The honorable member knows that the first effort to enforce the union label provisions will be by way of boycott. An attempt will be made to influence individuals and households, to boycott certain goods, because they do not bear a particular label. That is the only power which is sought by the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- So far as I am aware, no Trade Marks Act passed for general trade mark purposes, contains any provision for legalizing union labels, or union marks. I do not object to the Government submitting these provisions in a separate measure. They have a perfect right to do so, if the pressure put upon them is sufficient to induce them to adopt that course. What I object to is that such provisions should be mixed up with, and tacked to, a general Trade Marks Bill. The Ministry are making use of this measure to force these objectionable provisions through Parliament. That is an undesirable thing in connexion with any legislation. We have already objected to it in connexion with financial measures. If a Bill has a certain object, it is most undesirable that we should tack <inline font-style="italic">to it</inline> provisions having an entirely different object. They should be embodied in a separate Bill. It is open to the Government even now to adopt that course; they might very well place the provisions relating to the. trade union label in a separate measure. I hope that the Government, as well as the honorable member for Bland, will recognise that it is futile at what is practically the end of the session to enter upon the further consideration of this very debatable measure if anything practical is to be done. I trust that the Ministry will realize that even some of their own supporters are not -with them in this regard ; that . they see more clearly than they do the great danger which legislation of this class must necessarily involve. The Legislatures of Australia have done more than has the Parliament of any other coun-try to establish sound labour conditions, and why should we revert to the methods adopted in countries where it has been impossible by other means to improve the position of the workers. Why should we revert to a barbarous system, which must stir up strife and cause embitterment as between master and man? Why should we pass a law which, if carried to the extreme, must disturb our producing, manufacturing, and trading interests without securing any good result ? The Legislatures1 of most of the States, as well as the Commonwealth Parliament, have passed measures which some persons, at all events, consider will secure reasonable working conditions, and yet an attempt is being, made, without any necessity whatever, to force the passing of a Bill containing provisions which the High Court will? I am sure, declare illegal. I feel confident that, if appealed to, the </para>

                        <para>- The probability is that he was right, but I am not one of those who believe in the passing of legislation which we are assured will be declared invalid. Apart from the Federal Act, we have in Australia State conciliation and arbitration laws which apply to all but a small section of the population, and surely, if they are found to be advantageous, the Legislatures of those States which have not yet taken action in this direction will pass similar measures. That being so, why should we pass a Bill containing provisions that will lead to strife in private and domestic circles? Above all, I cannot conceive why, at the eleventh hour of the session, and when other legislation that is much more pressing awaits our consideration, an attempt should be made to force into law a measure of this kind, which is not only experimental, but which, in view of legislation that we have already passed, is unnecessary, and also contains provisions that might well be embodied in a separate Bill, to be dealt with in the coming session. </para>

                    (Wentworth).&#39; - I also arn indebted to the honorable member for Parramatta for giving us an opportunity, now that an attempt is being made to force this measure through the House, to discuss the question in its broader sense, instead of being confined, as we should otherwise have been, to a consideration of each clause as submitted. The honorable member who- has just resumed his seat showed that the Watson Government when in power had not the anxiety that they now profess for the passing of a measure providing foi a union label. The honorable member asked what was the reason foi this; but, as was only to be expected, received no satisfactory reply. I think it is fairly obvious that the Labour Party in this House did not think at that time that the passing of a law relating to the union label was essential.

I think that the reason for the change of front is very obvious to any one who examines the history of last session, especially in relation to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. As that measure originally stood, it could and would have been used to compel people to join political unions, and so to compel them to subscribe to the labour leagues, and, in fact, to the electioneering expenses of the members of the Labour Party in this House. </para>

                        <para>- The Bill now before us will be just as effective, so far as giving a preference to supporters of the Labour Party is concerned as would have been the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill as introduced. The immediate outcome of the passing of this Bill will be a series of boycotts. Not only will goods which do not bear the union label be boycotted, but shopkeepers offering for sale any article on which the union label does not appear will be treated in that way. </para>

                        <para>- Can the Minister be marked with a union label, when only last session the honorable gentleman was one of those who was most anxious to keep as far away as possible from certain associations? It is obvious that when this boycott has been established, all workers must necessarily join a union, otherwise there can be no sale for the products of their labour. If they do, the unions which register union labels will become political bodies different altogether, from those now coming within the scope of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. These new political unions, for every recruit they secure, will pay a considerable sum into the party war-chest. </para>

                        <para>- The object that the Labour Party have in view, in attempting to pass the union label provisions of this Bill, may not seem a particularly noble one, but one cannot but be struck by the unanimity with which they are now urging it. This piece of legislation, which is designed in the interests, not of the workers themselves, but of the representatives of the Labour Leagues in this House, is the only measure in which any interest has been evinced during the life of this Parliament by the Labour Socialistic Party. Other measures of national importance have come and gone, but many of the members of that party have scarcely honoured&#39; us with their wisdom or their presence. One has only to propose something intended to strengthen the personal and political position of the members of the Labour Party in order to cause every one of them to become at once instinct with life, and to take his place in the House. It is a sorry thing that any party in this House should take such a selfish view of their responsibility to the country. But the Labour Party, as a party, must soon lose its cohesion, and begin to disintegrate. No party can .continue to exist for any length of time whose principles are absolutely foreign to the interests of national politics. We know that the members of that party are all eager to become members&#39; of the legal profession, and those who have followed the history of arbitration in New South Wales are aware why that is. The Labour lawyers there have taken out of the war-chests of the unions&#39; funds which have been, the accumulation of years. The New South Wales unions had, by ceaseless endeavours extending over a long term, collected not inconsiderable reserves against contingencies, but during the last two or three years we have seen the representatives of the workers in that State become lawyers, and, as lawyers, use the greater part of the funds of the organizations for their own expenses. </para>

                        <para>- No ; they take them by process of law ; but the result is that the lawyers are getting fat, and the unions are getting thin. No doubt this Bill is intended to expedite that process, and all members of the Labour Party will be able to get fat when they have been able to put two or three measures of this kind on the statute-book The aims of these honorable gentlemen are not unselfish. Although they speak on the platform, and in the press, of their disinterestedness, and of the selfishness of all others, they are the only persons who have benefited by the &#34;Labour&#34; legislation which has been passed in Australia during the past five 3&#39;ears. </para>

                        <para>- In view of the utterances of the Vice-President of the Executive Council last session, one might expect him to occupy a chair in some obscure corner of the Minister&#39;s room for the next fortnight, while the honorable member for Bland, and others, are discussing this Bill. The honorable gentleman and the Treasurer, in view of their indignant indictments against similar legislation last session, might be expected to oppose the Bill. No doubt it is very pleasant to occupy a throne, and, regardless of the man behind it, to stare with impassive countenance across the footlights, but the honorable and fearless gentleman is so anxious to move his arms, as the strings pull that he involuntarily makes interjections in support of legislation in which he does not believe. I hope that he and the Treasurer will, in the course of the next fortnight, tell us whether they intend to indorse what they said last session, or whether they have thrown away the last shred of principle. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. We wish them to proceed with business in which the whole country is interested. The Electoral Bill, for instance, is an urgent measure which should be passed this session. Any amendments made in our electoral machinery should be made sufficiently early to enable the officers intrusted with the conduct of elections to become conversant with them before putting them into operation, and so to avoid mistakes. But, in humble obedience to the suggestion of the honorable member for Bland, the Government have submitted the union label provisions,, which concern only a section of a class. The whole country is interested in the Trade Marks Bill, apart from the union label clauses, the Electoral Bill, the Sugar Bounty Bill, the Excise (Sugar) Tariff Bill, the Immigration Restriction Amendment Bill, the Contract Immigration Bill, the Census and Statistics Bill, and the Copyright Bill. Yet a fort- night of the five weeks remaining to us is to be given up to the dis.cussion of a measure which vitally interests only the representatives of a section of a class. The honorable member for Bland said, by way of interjection, that he had suggested giving a fortnight to the consideration of this Bill, and if he&#39;, who is so desirous that it shall become law, thinks that this discussion should occupy a fortnight, the probability is that (he Bill will not be passed for a month or two. Why, then, should not the Government put it on one side, and let us deal with such measures as the Sugar Bounty Bih and the Excise (Sugar) Tariff&#39; Bill, which could be put through in a very few days? After the first few great principles involved are settled, those measures can be easily disposed of in Committee. Then there is the Immigration Restriction Amendment Bill, which honorable members of the Labour Party are supposed to be anxious lo pass into law. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable members of the Labour Party have been speaking from every platform in Australia with regard to the necessity for immigration, and yet they are now imposing a very .large bunker in the way of desired legislation. The Contract Immigrants Bill, which was introduced by the Prime Minister only last Friday, should be proceeded with without delay. <inline font-style="italic">X</inline> do not regard that Bill in its present shape with any particular favour, because it appears to me to provide specifically for administration upon all-fours with that which has been carried out in the past by the Prime Minister and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton. Then, again, the Copyright Bill is of immense importance. Do honorable members of the Labour Party pretend for a moment that that measure will not affect for good more people than will the boycott proposal contained in the Bill before us? We know that the provis&#39;ons relating to the use of trade union labels will upset the whole trade of the Commonwealth. They are being strongly resisted by the storekeepers throughout the country, because it is recognised that retailers will be compelled to sell union-made goods, or none at all. An r such condition would cause a complete upset of existing arrangements, and consumers would incur considerable loss. If a monopoly were created by the use of union labels, which afforded no guarantee as to quality or value, the results would be detrimental to consumers generally, because any increase in price would be passed on to them by the storekeepers. Not only the storekeepers, but the manufacturers, exporters, importers, and consumers at large are standing shoulder to shoulder in their opposition to the proposals. We should not be called upon to embody in this Bill a proposal for the adoption of union labels, which will afford no guarantee of value, or indicate the origin of the goods, or prevent the piracy of trade descriptions. I am very sorry that the union label provisions were not more strongly opposed in the Senate, and I hope, that it is not too late to put the President&#39;s ruling to the test. I contend that the trade union label provisions are beyond the scope of the Bill, and I suggest that the Attorney-General should adopt the same course that was followed in Canada., where, after it was decided that provision for union labels had nothing whatever to do with trade marks, a separate Ball was introduced. If this course were adopted, the country would know exactly the price the Government have to pay for their continuance in office. It is unfair to the country to graft on tn a non-contentious measure highly debatable proposals such as those which have been embodied in the Bill. If the Government will consent to withdraw the objectionable provisions now in the Bill, they will have no difficulty in carrying out the rest ofl their programme before Christmas. If a separate Bill relating to the use of trade union labels were introduced next session. I -am sure that, in view of the imminence of the general elections, honorable members would refuse to pass it. If the Attorney-General sincerely believes that benefit would be conferred upon the general community bv the union label provisions of the .Hill. he should withdraw them, and afterwards embody them in a separate measure, rather than attempt to surreptitiously pass them now. </para>

                        <para>- Let me tell the Attorney-General that the course adopted in Canada was a far more open and frank method of proceeding. It was there declared that to attach bogus union label proposals to a Trade Marks Bill was not constitutional or honest, and I would advise the Attorney-General to adopt the straightforward course that was, without passing the Bill, followed in the Dominion. Until he does that, I can only characterize the action of the Government as an attempt to surreptitiously honour the none too honorable bargain into which they have entered with the Labour Party. </para>

                    <para>- I am reminded by the circumstances under which this Bill has been brought under our notice this afternoon of a statement made in the old days when the United Netherlands were fighting with all their strength against the power of Spain. It was then said, of certain persons, that every man had his price; and it appears to me that that statement is true with regard to Ministers. They have their price; but nott in hard cash - I do not wish that to be implied. Only a little while ago Ministers denounced the Labour Party and all their doings. They told us) that when they were previously in power they had to eat dirt, and submit their wills, consciences, and judgment to the control of members of the Labour Party. That was the price which they had to pay for being kept in office. They have) now deliberately gone back to the Treasury benches with a smaller direct following than previously, and have shown themselves content to rely to a still further degree upon the support of the Corner party. The service rendered by the Labour Party must be paid for in some way or other, and that is the reason why the Trade Marks Bill has suddenly shot up from a very low place on the business-paper to its present prominent position. Several Ministers do not believe in the Bill, and we know that in their heart of hearts they believe that it will prove to be a curse to the community. Still, they will vote for it. even at the sacrifice of their honour. They are not the rulers of the country, and they know it. Those who control the destinies of Australia are the members of the Labour Party, and they are making Ministers eat dirt, not by the peck, but bv the bushel. Rather than occupy the position of honorable members opposite, I would cut my throat and die in the gutter. It is humiliating to see men of ability - for the possession of a mere semblance of power - paying the price that is being exacted from Ministers. </para>

It does not contain one word in reference to a union label. If it was important to the masses that some such provision should be inserted in this measure, why did not the Labour Government include it in that Bill?

                        <para>- The Trade Marks Bill was introduced by the Watson Government on the14th July, 1904. The honorable member for Wentworth has referred to certain members of the Labour Party who have succeeded in becoming barristers. All honour to them. It is an honour to men who have worked their way up to that position. But, of course, we must remember that a number of these very men have denounced lawyers as the greatest curse to the community. </para>

And they have assisted to pass Acts which would bring grist to their mill. I do not say that they have been actuated by that motive, but it is a. fact that a great portion of the funds of the unions, finds its way into the pockets of these lawyers.

                        <para>- Certainly he is. My point is that the labour representatives have repeatedly denounced lawyers as the curse of the community. Yet upon the very first occasion which offers, they themselves become lawyers. This afternoon the honorable member for Bland intimated that the Labour Party desired to see this Bill pass on. account of the great advantages which it would confer upon the masses. </para>

                        <para>- I am aware that in Parliament, although we may think what we like, we are bound to accept the assurance of an honorable member. At the first opportunity, honorable members of the party to which I am referring set to work to qualify themselves, for admission to the legal profession. I do not suggest for a moment that that was a &#39;dishonorable course to adopt ; but I wish to show the absolute inconsistency of these men. On becoming Members of Parliament they have availed themselves of their leisure to fit themselves for membership of the legal profession. The honorable member for Bland stated that the one man who gained most from the labour unions, in the direction I have indicated, was not a member of the party. Whether that be so or not, it cannot be denied that he has. made two or three attempts to secure election to Parliament as a labour candidate; that he is one of those who in the past denounced the lawyers, but to-day is growing rich by acting as legal adviser to the unions. </para>

                        <para>- Fighting really for injustice. The contributions of the unionists, instead of being devoted to a purpose that would improve their position in life, are going into the pockets of these lawyers. I wish to support the statement made by the honorable member for Wentworth, that, although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beeby</inline> has not been returned to Parliament, he has stood on several occasions as a Labour candidate. Then, again, as honorable members are aware, the honorable and learned member for West Sydney is a lawyer, actively practising his profession, whilst in the Parliament of New South Wales we have <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holman, Mr. Sullivan,</inline> and others who are also practising. </para>

                        <para>- That is another matter. The fact that I have not continuously represented the one district is testimony to my straight going. I have never swerved from what I believed to be right, and have not hesitated to support that which I believed to be best for the workers. I was returned to this House as a supporter of the very principles I enunciated when first I sought political honours. I have always stood by my principles, and my occasional defeat has been due only to my refusal to &#34; trim.&#34; It has been stated that the Trade Marks Bill is the one measure which we ought to pass this session, because it will confer great advantages on the masses. I hold, &#39; however, that other Bills awaiting our consideration are of much more importance to the workers. Take, for instance, the Sugar Bounty Bill. </para>

                        <para>- My objection to it is that it is a proposal to take out of the pockets of the people a large sum of money and hand it over to one section of the community. The amount paid by way of bounty to the sugar-growers of New South Wales has been an absolute gift to them, because sugar-cane has always been grown in that State by means of white labour. We are told, however, that the extension of the bounty may increase the number of white workers employed in the cane-fields of Queensland. I have my doubts as to that, but the representatives of Queensland, who, for the most part, are members of the Labour Party, desire that the Sugar Bounty Bill shall be passed as early as possible, in order that the planters in that State may team their fate. In the interests of the toilers, for whom the members of the Labour Party profess so great an anxiety- </para>

                        <para>- If I had the power, T. would force them very quickly. The honorable member&#39;s question indicates that they should be forced, and no doubt he would be very pleased if they could tie forced by us. But he has not the courage to break from&#39; the caucus to help us. These two Bills hang one upon the other, and, if they become law, are likely to be of advantage to the workers. But those who profess to be the friends of the workers are not seeking to bring about this advantageous state of affairs. There is also on the notice-paper a Bill to amend the Immigration Restriction Act, so that that measure may be differently viewed by the world at large. It is much&#39; more important that we should improve our relations with the world at large than that we should enact union label provisions in a Trade Marks Bill. We have heard a great deal of the manner in which the Immigration Restriction Act has brought us into disrepute. I believe that the amending Bill will improve the Act, although it retains the hypocritical pretence that certain men are to be kept out, not because of their colour, but because they are not properly educated. Then there is the Contract Labour Immigration Bill. We know that Australia has, been misrepresented in the old land. Men have come here under permit to land, and have been told that they must stay only a certain time. Apparently these permits were not necessary, and therefore were illegal. But under the Immigration Restriction Act, no man who is under contract can be brought here unless it is shown that he is possessed of skill not obtainable in the community. Time after time difficulties have occurred when men have been &#39;wanted for the starting of new industries, or to bring out improved methods. Notwithstanding our pretended desire for the immigration of British people, men of our own race have been prevented, from landing on our shores because they have been under contract. The amending Bill seems to me to be worse than the original Act, and it has been made more stringent at the desire of the Labour Party. The Prime Minister has expressed the desire to modify the original Act in the interests of British people who desire to come here, but the Labour Party have practically intimated that they will not allow that to be done, and we can come to no other conclusion than that they have forced the Government to make the Bill more restrictive. Of what use will the union label provisions be to the labouring classes? Their effect will be to cause strife and discord between employer and employe&#34;. We should, on the contrary, strive to develop a feeling of respect for each other amongst employers and employes. No union will be able to directly compel a manufacturer to put a union label on his goods, but if he refuses to comply with union conditions, unions will be able to boycott his goods, by preventing unionists from buying them. It may be that a manufacturer employing none but unionists, and observing .union conditions, will decline to use the union label ; but, if he does, he will be boycotted. Where a man employs both unionists and non-unionists, even though, he may comply with union rules as to wages, hours, and conditions of labour, he will not be able to use the union label, and, as a consequence, will be boycotted. No law should be passed to compel any man to become a unionist, nor should any law be passed to prevent a man from becoming a unionist. I stand for the right of every man to choose his own method of employment, and we should <inline font-style="italic">not</inline> prevent men from being either unionists or non-unionists, as they prefer. It is said that the union label provisions are necessary to prevent fraud, and the honorable member for Bland said that the honorable member for North Sydney was supporting fraud. Those who know the honorable member for North Sydney are aware that no one is mom prepared to do the right than he is. I believe that he has more sympathy with the workers than has the honorable member foi Bland, and has a greater desire to prevent the countenancing of fraud. Not a man on this side of the Chamber desires to countenance fraud, and I am prepared to move the insertion of a clause which I think would accomplish all that is desired, if honorable members wish only to discountenance fraud. I would provide that it shall not be lawful to affix to any goods or articles any trade mark that falsely states the conditions of labour under which such .goods or articles have been produced. If all that is desired is to prevent manufacturers from placing on their goods descriptions purporting to declare that the goods were produced under proper labour conditions when they were not so produced, my suggestion will meet the views of honorable gentlemen. But if some such suggestion is not accepted, the only conclusion open to us will be that the Bill is intended to force men into unions, and! to create strife and trouble between employers and employes. We should set our faces against such legislation as that. The sooner Parliament is prorogued the better. Some remark of the kind was made coming over in the train to-day, and I replied, &#34;This is magnificent weather. Let the forces of nature have full play., and shut up Parliament, and prosperity will increase.&#34; Legislation will not make every one better and happier, and I am certainly opposed to legislation which will assuredly create strife. I should be only too happy to support the Bill if I thought that it would be of use; but I do not think that it will be, and I have always been opposed to any unnecessary interference with human liberty. Every man should be as free as possible to do what he can for those dependent on him. I am distinctly and positively opposed to the union label provisions of the Trade Marks Bill, and shall use all means to fight and to destroy them. </para>

                <para class="block">England did not carry out his threat to commit suicide in the Chamber. It seems to me that the extraordinary transposition of the order of Government business must necessarily excite a good deal of adverse criticism. On Friday last, the Trade Marks Bill stood tenth on the notice-paper. Of the preceding nine items of Government business, one has been dealt with, and the others remain on the paper, but this measure has been suddenly jumped from the last to the first place on the Government programme. What particular urgency is there for the Bill? I venture to say that the Electoral Bill is much more important. Honorable members who had to put up with the bungling at the last election, and who know that private individuals, as well as the Government, had to incur unnecessary expense, will recognise that a considerable time will be advantageously occupied in making preparations for the next election, and that the more promptly we pass the Electoral Bill the better chance we shall have of putting an end to an unsatisfactory condition of affairs. No serious attempt is being made to push on with that measure. There is nothing in this Bill to call for arw self denying ordinance on the part of the Government, and it seems to me that there is no necessity for them to make it the <inline font-style="italic">piece de resistance</inline> of their programme. Why, then, is it urged forward with such fervour ? The reason is undoubtedly to be found in the fact that it contains provisions for the use of union labels. These are such as have never been passed into law in any other part of the Empire. An attempt, which resulted in a dismal failure, was made to enact such provisions in Canada, and it is noteworthy that the Registrar of Trade Marks in the Dominion decided that a union label was not a trade mark within the meaning of the Act. </para>

                        <para>- The sympathizers with the trade unions in Canada were compelled to bring forward the proposal relating to the use of union labels in a separate Bill, and to rely, not upon any colourable imitation of a trade mark, but upon the inherent sovereignty of the Canadian Dominion to bring a special enactment into force. The measure introduced into the Canadian Parliament was not passed, nor is it likely to be passed for many years to come. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and in his written opinion, which is marked by his characteristic modesty and judicial bearing, he gives very strong reasons for holding that the provisions are <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> of the Federal Constitution. That being so, it seems extraordinary that at the tail end of the session we should be asked to pass them into law. It would be the height of affectation to deny that the anxiety of the Government to push forward the measure is due to the fact that it contains certain provisions which two-thirds of the Government following - namely, the members of the Labour Party - insist upon having passed into law. They furnished the votes which were required to establish the Government in office, and it is only natural that their wishes in regard to some measures should be complied with. It cannot be claimed that the merchants, traders, or manufacturers are panting for a Trade Marks Bill. They have got along satisfactorily ever since the Federation has been: established without any such measure, and they could go on for another forty years without suffering any serious inconvenience owing to the want of it. The Government regard the Bill as urgent because it contains provisions which are to be used, as in the United States, for the purpose of persuading, cajoling, and forcing men into joining the labour organizations. Honor able members will recollect that last session three months were occupied in discussing a measure which to some extent implied collective bargaining, and provided for preference to unionists, and it would be mere affectation to pretend that it is possible to dispose of the union label provisions of the Bill now before us within a fortnight; that lis, if any reasonable attempt is to &#39;be made to reply to the mass of criticism which has been hurled at them both by the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> and by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cussen</inline> and others. I am opposed to the clauses referred to because I am thoroughly convinced that they are unconstitutional. If they were constitutional, I should still object to proposals which I regard as of a coercive type, and as intended to be used for the purpose of forcing men into joining certain labour organizations. </para>

                        <para>- The provisions referred to have two objects. The first is to legalize an instrument of boycott, and the second is to differentiate between men on account of their conditions of employment. It cannot be urged in favour of these provisions, as is urged in America, that the men in the unions are being paid at higher rates than are those outside. In Victoria forty trades have been brought under the operation of the Wages Board provisions of the Factories and Shops Act, and all trades in New South Wales are liable to be brought under the operation of the State Arbitration Act; whilst on South Australia provision has been made for Wages Boards. </para>

                        <para>- I have no doubt that the Labour Government now in power in South Australia will take care to bring many other trades under the operation of Wages Boards. We know that, in all the trades in Victoria and New South Wales which have been brought under the operation of Wages Boards, or the provisions of the State Arbitration Act respectively, no sweating can exist, because labour conditions are regulated for unionists and non-unionists alike. The union label provisions are not intended to secure first-class wages for workmen, but are designed to enable trade union officials to coerce men into joining their organizations. I think that I shall be able to show at a later stage that, owing to the operation of union label legislation in the United States, many workmen have been dismissed from their employment because they would not join certain trades unions. They were receiving the same wages as were the union workmen, but, for reasons best known to themselves, decided to remain outside the unions. I think that the deputy leader of the Opposition was perfectly justified in challenging the extraordinary change of front on the part of the Government which has resulted in a Bill - which cannot by any stretch of the imagination be called urgent - being lifted from the ninth to the first position on, the Government programme. No indication was given to honorable members until the last moment on Friday afternoon of any intention on the part of the Government to alter the order of business, and it seems to me that their action calls for vigorous protest on the part of members of the Opposition. </para>

                    <para>- I cannot understand why the Attorney-General should consider himself aggrieved because the deputy leader of the Opposition has felt himself called upon to enter a protest against the extraordinary course adopted by the Government. On Friday last they submitted a programme covering the business to be transacted on that day and to-day. On Friday last the Electoral Bill occupied the first place upon the business-paper, and it was followed by the Sugar Bounties Bil&#93;, the Excise Bill, Census and Statistics Bill, Copyright Bill, Manufactures Encouragement Bill, and Trade Marks Bill, in that order. Honorable members who left the House early upon that day were under the impression that the Government intended to proceed with the Electoral Bill this afternoon. The Ministry thought so little of the Trade Marks Bill that it was the last item upon the business-paper. Now, however, we find that the whole of the business has been re-arranged, &#34; without honorable members having been consulted in any way. Apparently there is some reason for this alteration. Yesterday I read in the newspapers a paragraph to the effect that an attempt would be made in the Senate to block the passing of the Appropriation Bill until some honorable members were sure of the attitude which the Government intended to adopt in regard to a certain measure - presumably the Trade Marks Bill. Is this re-arrangement of business the result of representations which have come from a certain quarter? In the other Chamber, the Appropriation Bill is not being proceeded with. The Senate is engaged in considering the Commerce Bill. Yet the chief reason urged by the Government for the speedy passing of the Appropriation Bill was that they desired to afford the Senate a fair opportunity of considering it. We passed it upon that understanding. </para>

                        <para>- The ruling which you have given, sir, serves only to emphasize the serious position in which this House has been placed. We were led to believe that there would be no need for any further Supply Bills this year. Upon Wednesday evening last, the Government deliberately wiped the items relating to Supply and Ways and Means from the business-paper. If they wish to introduce a measure dealing with Trusts or with the Tariff, they will be again compelled to set up a Committee of Ways, and Means. That will give rise to debate. We all recollect what happened when Supply lapsed during the period that the Reid Government were in power. A whole sitting was occupied in discussing a motion to restore it. Because the deputy leader of the Opposition occupied ten minutes in criticising the Government conduct of business, he has been accused of &#34;stone-walling.&#34; If the Appropriation Bill be not passed in time to permit of salaries for the present, month being paid to our public servants, what are we to do ? We shall have to take some steps to ascertain what the Senate has done with that measure. The Government have led us to believe that they are anxious to close the session. </para>

                        <para>- I do not doubt that statement for one moment. But does the programme which was submitted to us by the Prime Minister evidence any sincere desire to terminate the session before Christmas? I have no hesitation in saying that if we deal with all the business upon the notice-paper, we shall be kept here for two or three months. The passing of the Appropriation Bill is usually an indication that the session is about to close, and that there will be no necessity for any further Supply Bills. But if the Appropriation Bill be not passed- </para>

                        <para>- The Government induced the Opposition to agree to the Appropriation Bill in order that the Senate should be afforded a fair opportunity of dealing with it. Since the Ministry intimated their desire to close the session, the Prime Minister has submitted two very debatable measures. I presume that he intends the House to deal with those Bills seriously. In introducing them, the honorable and learned gentleman made a very elaborate speech, and if he does not intend to persevere with them, he was guilty of a gross waste of time. Some honorable members affirm that the Opposition have incurred the adverse opinion of the electors, because we have thought it our dutv to criticise the way in which business is conducted iri this House. Recent events, however, show that that is not so. </para>

                        <para>- I am aware that some people say that the result was due to apathy on the part of the electors. But there is no evidence of that, especially as 7J per cent, more electors voted upon that occasion than voted at the last general election. In addition to that fact, the Labour candidate was a popular man; but whilst the party previously won the seat by 450 votes, they were defeated on this occasion by about the same number. I dare say that the honorable member for Southern Melbourne will assert that the result of the general election in Western Australia is an evidence of the popularity of his party. We have to remember that the political existence of the Government depends upon the support which they receive from the Labour Party. On one occasion I was told at a meeting that there was a combination on the part of the right honorable member for East Sydney and the honorable and learned, member for Ballarat to &#34; down &#34; the party. </para>

                        <para>- That was the suggestion put forward. But what is the present position? We find the Labour Party supporting a Government, two members of which&#34; have been described by them as enemies of labour, and I suppose that the honorable member for Melbourne Ports and the Government whip at the next general elections will go before their constituents and repeat the anti-Labour speeches which they made two years ago. I have no desire, however, to discuss these matters, because I do not wish to waste time. There is no foundation for the assertion that the Opposition wish to fritter away the time of the Committee. </para>

                        <para>- I shall be called to order by the Chairman when I am transgressing the rules of debate. This Bill was considered on the 27th July last, and now, after many delays, has been placed in a prominent position on the business-paper. This shows that the masters of the Ministry have issued their ultimatum. In view of the alliance into which they have entered, the Government could not have expected anything else. We cannot blame the Labour Party for compelling those whom they described a few months ago as their avowed enemies, to carry out their purpose. They are using them for all that they are worth. </para>

                        <para>- I should not have referred to the honorable member for Southern Melbourne, but for the interjections made by him. I rose merely to complain of the want of business capacity shown by the Government. Ten measures appear on the business-paper, and some of them, involving very important principles, have scarcely been considered, although honorable members desire to see them passed. </para>

                <para class="block">Ministry, so far as this measure is concerned, is the most extraordinary that I have witnessed. Amongst the measures still awaiting pur attention is the Manufactures Encouragement Bill, which I have from the first opposed, notwithstanding that my constituency is one of the few Federal electorates that are interested in it. Large deposits of iron are to be found in the electorate of Macquarie, and it was my opposition to the Manufactures Encouragement Bill which led to my return to this House being contested at the last general election. The Prime Minister has informed us that he intend to propose some important amendments in that measure, and I hold that he should tell us exactly what changes he contemplates making. Then, again, the Sugar Bounty Bill and the Sugar Excise Bill involve very important issues. The debate on the second reading of the first-named measure occupied our attention on Friday, but our consideration of the Bill has been suddenly arrested, and it now stands, third on the business-paper. I have no desire to deal at length with that matter, although honorable members must recognise that, if I wished, I might occupy some time in debating it. I am here to-day only to criticise the conduct of business, and am referring merely by way of illustration to the position of the various measures awaiting our attention. Why should we be left in the dark as to the intentions of the Government? We are told that they are very anxious to close the session, and I think that every honorable member who has any private business to transact must also desire to see the Parliament prorogued as early as possible. It is only a. sense of duty to our constituents that impels us to remain here, at considerable inconvenience and loss to ourselves, in order that these matters, may be fully discussed. The Opposition hold that it is unwise that a number of important Bills should be rushed through the House in the closing days of the session. If the Government succeed in. inducing another place to act in accordance with their wishes, they may discharge from the business- paper many of the orders of the day now appearing on it. If that is their intention, they ought to say so. </para>

                        <para>- My complaint against the Government is that they will not tell us what measures they intend to deal with. On Friday, we were led to believe that the Sugar Bounty Bill would be proceeded with to-day, and I went to some trouble to prepare figures in connexion with the remarks which I intended to make. Now we are told that it is not intended to take that Bill to-day, although on Friday the measure was debated at considerable length, some honorable members stating that if the proposal&#39;s of the Government were carried into effect the Commonwealth would suffer great loss, while others said that they thought it would be of advantage to the Commonwealth to pass the Bill. The measure involves many debatable points as to whether, and, if so, for how long, the bounty should, be extended, and as to whether there should1 or should not be a second extension. I should like the Government to proceed with the Representation and Electoral Bills, because proper machinery for holding elections is necessary for all true legislation. What guarantee have we that, when the Trade Marks Bill and the Appropriation Bill have become law, the Government will not drop the Electoral and Representation Bills, &#39;and leave our electoral system in a chaotic state for a further period? Honorable members did not show any carping spirit when dealing with the Representation Bill. Many of us who have experienced the inconvenience of, and know the loss occasioned by, the want of action on the part of a previous Government, had a great grievance ; but, in view of the importance of the measure, and as we were desirous that it should become law, we talked very little about our wrongs, and helped the Government to pass the Bill. </para>

                <para class="block">We are prepared to deal similarly with the Electoral Bill, because we recognise that without proper representation legislation must be unsatisfactory. There should be no inequalities under our electoral law, and electors should have every facility for the exercise of the franchise, though we should be very jealous about providing proper safeguards against wrong-doing in connexion with elections. The late Government felt that, although a dissolution was necessary, Parliament should not be dissolved until electoral matters had been set right ; but the House determined that there should be no election. I have nothing to say about that determination further than to remark that it was wonderful that honorable members, who, a few months previously, were asking for a dissolution, suddenly objected to our proposal that the opinions of the people of the country should be ascertained. If it was a right thing for the Watson Government to ask for a dissolution, because the House was incompetent to do good work, what change had taken place within a few months which made it wrong to have an election in June last? Was the change of attitude due to the fact that certain honorable members knew that the views of the electors had changed, and that a general election would bring about an alteration in the state of parties in this Chamber ? I have not risen to occupy time unduly, nor do I think I should have spoken at all had it not been for the unfair attack of the Attorney-General on the deputy leader of the Opposition. When I came here this afternoon I had no intention to say anything on this subject, nor did the deputy leader of the Opposition mean to do more than enter his protest against the action of the Government. I was astounded at the ungenerous and unfair attack made upon him by the Attorney-General. The honorable member for Parramatta has shown a desire to assist the Government in proceeding with business, but because he entered! a protest against their change of front he was accused of all sorts of wrong-doing. I protest against their, want of business capacity in submitting a number of measures which, if intelligently considered, cannot be passed this session. <inline font-style="italic">If</inline> the Government had out before us fair proposals, the Opposition would have been only too glad to assist them in bringing the session to a close. I have a sincere desire to have the session closed, but I do not wish legislation to be passed without proper consideration. We have a right to expect from the Government  a clear statement of what they intend to do this session. If their proposals are fair and reasonable, we shall be only too glad to assist them. Of course, if the Government say that they are going to extend the session into next year, we shall be able to understand their present programme, but if they wish to close the session before Christmas, they must put before the House reasonable proposals. The Opposition would be prepared to assist them in passing any such programme. </para>

                    <para>I regret very much that the Prime Minister did not give us some idea of the business that we would be asked to discuss to-day. We left the House on Friday under the impression that the Electoral Bil! would be brought up for discussion. I have always held the view that the Government are to blame when they do not make an attempt to preserve some. kind of order in regard to the business to be presented to the House. Honorable members should have an opportunity to prepare themselves to deal with the questions submitted to them. I know that many honorable members pay no attention to anything that comes before the House. </para>

                        <para>- I withdraw the remark, since it is considered of too sweeping a character. I would merely say that many honorable members take no interest whatever in this measure, and are utterly unprepared to discuss it. Moreover, they are quite unfitted, by their lack of training, to properly consider it. . I submit that, in the first place, more than one-half of the members in this Chamber could not come prepared to discuss this measure to-day, because they have mo opportunities to prepare themselves beforehand. For a week past we were informed that it was proposed to deal with the Electoral Bill and the Sugar Bounties Bill, and T submit that any man who attempted to properly deal with those measures could not within the same week approach, in an appropriate frame of mind, the consideration of the question now before us. The reason is perfectly clear. There are nearly 100 clauses in one measure, and I do not know how many in the other. The Electoral Bill contains many important clauses; the&#39; proposed amendments are very numerous, and will involve careful consideration. The fact that our business is being very poorly conducted is to be attributed to the continual chopping and changing on the part of the Government in respect of the measures before us. When the present Electoral Act was before us a sudden change had been made in the order of business, and I then pointed out how unfair it was to expect honorable members, unprepared as they were, to deal with such an important subject. I said that I had had time only to discover that the Bill was framed upon two contradictory principles, and that it was not clear what course we ought to follow until a decision had been arrived at as to which of these principles we should follow. My objection was laughed to scorn. I then declared that before two years were over important amendments would have to be made, and my prediction is fully borne out by the fact that an important amending measure is now on the business-paper awaiting our discussion. We have reached a parlous state in regard to. our electoral administration. We framed an Act under which even Ministers think they have no power to deal with the question of representation. One or two amendments in the original Act would have made all the difference. I only quote this instance to show how dangerous it is to change the order of business without giving honorable members an opportunity to prepare themselves for logical discussion. Some honorable members do not come prepared to discuss anything. They think that if they follow the Government, any measure approved of by Ministers must be quite satisfactory. They appear to forget that the fact that Ministers have to sit here for many hours, and also have to perform the administrative work of their Departments prevents them from properly considering the various measures presented to the House. As proof of this, I need only point to the fact-that a measure is rarely dealt with by the Cabinet as a whole. It is brought forward by a particular Minister, and if, from any cause, he should be absent, not one of his colleagues is able to take his place in conducting the measure through the Chamber. My point is that we should not be asked to proceed with a Bill of this kind without due notice. The measure is divided into two parts, one of which deals with trade marks, pure and simple, and the other part with matters which should properly be embodied in a Union Labels Bill. Members of the Labour Party ought to be the first to object to the incorporation in a Bill of this kind of provisions which properly belong to another measure. Surely, the principle involved in the union label provisions is of sufficient importance to justify its being dealt with in a special Bill. Then we could fight out the principle, and if it were approved by the majority, its supporters and opponents alike could devote their attention to framing the measure in such a form that it would accomplish its purpose. I leave honorable members to judge whether there is any possibility of our being able to follow that course in the present instance. The Bill has been drawn up in such a hotchpotch fashion that no member of the general public could possibly understand that legislation relating to union labels was to be looked for under the head of trade marks. We are forcing laymen to consult lawyers in regard to every matter upon which we legislate. Under these conditions&#39;, no layman can possibly claim to have any knowledge of the law, and even lawyers will be bound to confess that they are not certain as to what Parliament may have done in regard to any particular matter. They look at one/ Act, and lay down the law very clearly to their clients. The latter are obliged to go to Court, to find that owing to some other provision relating to the same matter which, unfortunately, their lawyer had overlooked, the whole meaning of the Act has been modified, and that the advice given to them is valueless. In the meantime, the unfortunate litigant Gas had to incur very heavy expenses. I contend that Acts of Parliament should be so described in their title that people at a glance would! be made aware of the principles- which they affirm. There would then be an amount of certainty about the law which does not exist to-day. What party is chiefly responsible for the creation of lawyers&#39; work? I am bound to say that members of the Labour Party, by neglecting to give attention to very serious questions of this character, are very great offenders. I am bound to say that our legislative actions are causing confusion, even amongst the legal profession itself, as to what the law really is. Nowadays, lawyers will not give an opinion off-hand in respect of any subject submitted to them. It seems to me that there are three rules which should always be considered by a Legislature. Its laws should .be so simple that everybody can understand them. They should be as few as possible, so that people would have a chance of becoming thoroughly conversant with their provisions, and they should be so drawn as to effectual Iv accomplish the purposes which they were intended to achieve. In order that our laws may be simple, it is obvious that we ought not to introduce into them matters which are foreign to their general purpose. It is for these reasons than&#39; I object to including iti the Trade Marks Bill provisions which properly belong to a Union Label Bill. </para>

                        <para>- I would enter my objection to the principle involved. There are scores of laymen who are able to arrive at as sound a decision upon any subject as is a trained lawyer. I am perfectly in accord with the desire to pass a Trade Marks Bill. I wish to see such a Bill passed as will safeguard the interests of the honest trader as against his dishonest competitor, and to insure that one man shall not live upon another man&#39;s reputation. What I am not in accord with is the proposal to embody in this Bill a principle of a character entirely foreign to its scope. We are here to see that no class enjoys any advantage at the expense of another class. We are in the position of trustees, with the whole public as beneficiaries. If we had some fund now unknown upon which we could draw, there would be no hardship whatever if we singled out a particular class, and said to them,. &#34; We intend to give you so much money.&#34; But that is exactly what we cannot do. We have no unknown fund upon which to draw - no unknown resources. The only resources at our command are those arising from the progress of industry in the community. Consequently, when we single out any special body of men, and say to them, &#34; We shall confer upon you certain privileges,&#34; we are utterly mistaking our functions. It is upon such a principle that we are acting here. We are, in effect, saying to one class of citizens, &#34; We intend to provide such a distinctive mark that we shall place in the hands of the 150,000 trade unionists the power to establish a boycott against all the rest of our citizens.&#34; If the Bill permitted any unregistered body to come forward, and take advantage of its provisions, I should not object! to it. But this measure goes further than that. It provides that no body of citizens, other than the particular bodies which have already been formed into unions, shall be allowed to register a union label. I hope that the honorable member for Bland will recognise the difference. </para>

                        <para>- My reading of the Bill is that a body of unionists already registered under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, or one of the State laws, would alone be entitled to place a union label on the goods produced in the trade to which it relates. If 100 unions desired to register, why should they not be allowed to do so? Why should they <inline font-style="italic">not</inline> be allowed to put their separate marks upon goods produced in the trade to which they relate? </para>

                        <para>- This affords us1 an excellent illustration of the difficulties with which we are confronted. Certain parts of the Bill originally dealt only with trade marks, and if the provisions, in regard to union labels had been embodied in a separate measure the draftsman would not have had to consider two different principles. I presume that this Bill is really designed to prevent fraudulent trade descriptions. </para>

The only means by which we can give effect to a Bill so designed is by providing a cheap and easy method of suing for a breach of it. When, the vendor of goods bearing a fraudulent trade mark must take the responsibility of offering such goods for sale, we shall secure that effective &#34; policing &#34; that we need. </para>

                        <para>- I regret that, while many honorable members assert that such a procedure is discreditable, they refuse to take part in deliberations that would, perhaps, enable us to overcome these difficulties. We have to take care that the benefits arising from our legislation, which applies to a population of nearly 4,000.000, are far greater than the evils it is designed to cure. It is curious that all good is accompanied by some measure of evil, and we should not lose sight of that fact when we are passing legislation that will affect a large portion of the population of the Commonwealth who have not the time or the means to fight against proposals that run counter to their wishes. We should take care that our laws will operate wisely and well, and that the bulk of the people, so far from deriding our legislation, as they are doing now, will&#39; say that it is sound, and will accomplish necessary purposes. Ignorance of the law does not excuse any one for disobeying it, and therefore we should take every care that our legislation is plain and effective. What I believe to be the chief duty of the Legislature is to state the principles of the laws of the country. After that, everything will depend upon administration. As an instance of a. simple statement of principle, let me cite that clause of the Great Charter which says that justice shall not be sold or delayed to any man. What a wonderful superstructure of law has been built on it. A thousand and one cases have been decided in connexion with- that statement of principle. The great barons who framed it no doubt thought that it had nothing to do with their serfs, but, as age has followed age, justice has given a wider and still wider application to it, and hundreds of reforms have taken place to accomplish the end in view. The days of corrupt and venal Judges have ended. We have taken from the King the right to remove Judges at pleasure, and have made Judges practically irremovable during ordinary good conduct. I am sorry that, although it is true that justice is not now sold, it cannot yet be said that it is not delayed, because the &#34; law&#39;s delay &#34; is still notorious. Still, in the last century many reforms of procedure were brought about, so that now a litigant may commence a suit at the beginning of the year, with a chance of reaching finality before the end of it. I am aware that in America an appeal may take as much as four years, but I hope that we shall not follow the example of America in these matters. We should make our laws as simple as possible, and any one Bill should embody only the one principle, any new principle being given effect to in another Bill. If that is d&#39;one, the public will know exactly what our legislation means. Of course, legislation cannot be quite as simple a thing nowadays as it was in times past, because of the greater complexity of life. I regret that the Attorney-General has in the Bill before us disregarded the elementary principles which I nave laid down. But, although he may have felt himself forced by the exigencies of political life to do what should not have been done, we should set our faces against such action, and should insist that the measures of this Parliament shall be simple and&#39; straightforward, so that any one may read them. The road of the law is already too tortuous and devious, so that none may travel it but at serious expense. But why should we not seek after simplicity? In this Bill the draftsman has been compelled to deal with quite different principles, so that complexity is inevitable. We are all agreed that the man who infringes a trade mark used for the protection of honest goods should be punished, because we do not wish to see the fruit of industry, foresight, sagacity, and prudence stolen, but the Bill is not content with enforcing that principle. When introduced in the Senate it contained about eighty-five clauses, and dealt with trade marks only, the Ministry of the honorable member for Bland being responsible for it. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, if one may be considered to be blocking a measure which is not before us by debating one which is. Some of these proposals will not be heard of until the Greek kalends. They are mere window dressing, put on the notice- paper, year after year, to mislead the public into believing that Parliament intends to do what it has no intention of doing. The honorable member for Bland&#39;s Government followed the right course in dealing only with trade marks in the Bill which it introduced in the Senate, and it is a pity that the present Government are not following his example. If they had&#39; done so. the measure would have been speedily passed. The effect of inserting a new principle into the Bill has been that even a clever lawyer like the honorable member for Indi has to nsk the Committee to deal with forty-four amendments, with over thirty-four new clauses, and with sixty-two sub-clauses which have the effect of clauses, or, altogether, 140 amendments, clauses, and subclauses. Is this the sort of legislation to bring before the House at the fag end of the session? In addition, I understand that there are numbers of consequential amendments which, of course, must be dealt with unless we are shortly to pass an amending Bill. By embodying two principles in the Bill, the Government are preventing honorable members from fairly discussing them. I am in favour of punishing the infringement of trade marks, and I see no reason why any body of men should not, if they wish to do so, register a particular label. T do .not see any reason why any body of citizens combining for that purpose should not be able to carry it out. Wealthy corporations can do so, and any body of men should be in a position to associate with similar objects. There is, however, another principle/involved in the Bill, namely, that those citizens who first form themselves into a union shall be the only ones entitled to register a trade mark. Every other combination is to be regarded1 as bogus, and cannot use a mark descriptive of their trade, which the first union registered may have taken up. My contention is that if 150 different bodies of men like to form themselves into associations for the purpose of registering trade marks, they should be able to do so. I should deal with this question in quite another way if I thought that the provisions of the Bill were to be used as a weapon of boycott. That could easily be done if the principle underlying the registration of union labels were embodied in a separate measure, but at present I do not know where I am, and I am sure that no other honorable member does. I venture to say that no honorable member, probably with the exception of the Attorney-General, has devoted more time than I have to this measure. Therefore, when I say that I can see that the Bill embodies conflicting principles which I should favour if they were incorporated in different measures, honorable members who have not studied the question must at least admit that there is some force in. my objections. </para>

                        <para>- My difficulty arises from the fact that the Bill is framed on two different principles, and that the whole of the clauses ought to be recast. At present some of them have been framed more widely than is necessary for the purpose of trade marks legislation pure and simple, in order to cover union labels, which&#39; should be dealt with in another measure. There are some clauses which relate to union labels and to trade marks. </para>

                        <para>- A number of clauses relate to both matters, and they ought not to be framed in that manner. The provisions regarding trade marks and union labels respectively should be separate and distinct. The fact that the great majority of members of the Labour Party have not been able to contribute one word to the discussion of this measure shows that they have an imperfect conception of it. Many of them, possibly, have not had time to master the subject, whilst others have had no inclination to do so. </para>

                        <para>- I am1 merely enunciating elementary principles, which are so simple that I should be ashamed to explain them to any intelligent man outside of this Chamber. I have to state the case for the information of honorable members who are following the Government as simply as I should place it before school-children. I derive no pleasure from telling honorable members that they are going wrong. It would be far more comfortable for me if I could stay away with the assurance that the business of Parliament was being conducted wisely and well. But I am compelled to travel 1,200 or 1,300 miles every week, in order to put some kind of brake on the wild, frantic, ignorant legislation which some honorable members are prepared to pass. If honorable members opposite would confine their efforts to enacting useful legislation, we should be only too glad to retire with the proud consciousness that they were capable of standing by the people as a whole, and of refraining from legislating in the interests of any particular class. The whole history of Liberalism is that of one continuous, struggle against class. Whether laws are framed for the benefit of the wealthier classes or of the poorer classes, the moment you depart from eternal principles you proceed along the downward track. Fortunately for the progress of humanity, laws cannot set a barrier to everything. After all, legislation affects our lives to a very small extent at present. But we must take care that we do not make the public tired and angry with our perpetual meddling, and cause them to rise and abolish this institution. Meddlesome and interfering legislation was persevered with to such an extent in some of the States of the American Union that the people rose, and practically abolished their Parliaments.. In some cases they restricted their sittings to thirty days in the year, and in other instances decreed that they should meet only once in two years. That was due to perpetual meddling, such as is now being attempted bv this Parliament. In all quarters outside of this House we hear people saying, &#34; Close up the Parliaments for five or ten years, and put a stop to the doings of those meddlesome men.&#34; And there is some justification for the expression of such a desire. I regret that the majority of honorable members upon the Government side of the Chamber do not appear to grasp the full meaning of the Bill before us.. I do not refer to honorable members of the Opposition, because those who are hostile to the Bill show that they fully appreciate the situation, and are prepared to set their face against proposals which are opposed to the best interests of the great masses of the people. I might have proceeded to s.hOw that I could oppose the principle contained in the Bill as it stands upon the best possible grounds. I admit that if the proposed amendments are accepted they will modify some of my objections. </para>

He would urge that the rules made in regard to one organization should bind all organizations. He would say to the Court, &#34; Is it not a fraud upon the public that another union can take advantage of a slip in the Act to register a distinctive trade mark for itself ?&#34; I can just imagine the fine scorn with which he would appeal to the presiding justice; that, if the contention were correct, it would be open&#39; to a thousand little unions, each containing ten or fifteen members, to register themselves as a union to obtain a distinctive trade mark. </para>

                        <para>- An attempt has been made to force all the workers engaged in the same calling into one union, so that no other body can be registered. Whilst it is perfectly clear that fifty bodies may be registered under the Trade Unions Act, I contend that the Arbitration Act has practically repealed the provisions of that Statute. </para>

                        <para>- Is. that the way in which the number of trade unionists is inflated? Apparently we ought to divide the membership of the various unions by one half in order to arrive at an accurate estimate of their strength. When men are compelled to join one union they cannot afford to belong to other organizations. The unions are very kind to the labour members in Parliament, inasmuch as they are providing them with sufficient law to keep them going. </para>

                        <para>- My statement is that the unions prefer to employ as their legal advocates, men with labour sympathies. I should be the very last to quarrel with them for so doing. Edmund Burke recommended a study of the law to all men entering public life. No public man will deny that a knowledge of the law is of great assistance to him. But I do say that a. too close study of the law is not calculated to liberalize the mind as it should do. Some men who follow the law occasionally get so bound down to the meaning of a word that they allow the sense of a whole paragraph to escape them. &#39; </para>

                        <para>- At any rate I have accomplished some good by causing honorable members to understand that there are two principles embodied in this Bill. Before I began to speak, they were evidently under the impression that it was a mere collection of words. Unfortunately one has to repeat himself, because honorable members have not been afforded an opportunity of grasping the meaning of the provisions with which we are asked to deal. It is. simply another instance of the evil resulting from an alteration in the order of business. Some honorable . members might have been prepared to proceed with the consideration of the Electoral Bill, the Sugar Bounty Bill, or the Sugar Excise Bill. </para>

                        <para>- My complaint is that they have agreed to blindly accept measures prepared by the Parliamentary Draftsman. The Bill is a noxious one. We are prepared to give the Government every assistance to deal with trade marks, and some of us are also prepared to allow any body of men the right to register a mark for themselves, provided that that power be properly safeguarded ; but1 we certainly do not desire that the registration of the first union that happens to apply shall deter others engaged in. the same trade from being registered. If a small body of men consisting, perhaps, of thirty or forty men engaged in a given trade were allowed the sole right to place a union label upon the goods manufactured in that trade, serious results might follow. There is no provision in this Bill to regulate the rules of the unions, and, according to my reading of it, a union consisting of, say, forty men might secure the registration of a label, and refuse to allow any addition to be made to its ranks. If we allow the union label provisions of this Bill to stand they may give rise to corporations similar to those which prevailed in France prior to the Revolution, when membership of a union was so valuable that a poor individual was never able to secure enrolment. Fortunately, the Revolution abolished such bodies. I would also remind honorable members of the position of some of the great corporations and guilds in London. In certain oases these guilds compri&#39;se some of the wealthiest men in London, and their membership consists of twelve or fifteen individuals having within their control a revenue of thousands of pounds per annum. There are guilds so wealthy and powerful that they have been able to prevent the widening of some of the streets of London, and special Acts of Parliament have had to be passed to deal with them. Owing to their wealth and influence, the improvement of the city in some directions has been absolutely blocked. And yet it is proposed&#39; under this Bill to give power for the formation of close corporations which may boycott merchants and manufacturers, and say to them, &#34; Unless you give us so much, we shall not allow you to place the union mark on your goods.&#34; If we concede this power to such bodies we shall open a vast field for black-mail. </para>

                <para>Another point is that the union label! provisions may also be used as a weapon of oppression against the very class for whose benefit they are designed. The Labour Party are supporting legislation that must be absolutely inimical to the interests of those whom they profess to serve. Even if our laws were &#39;framed with the greatest possible wisdom they could not do more, than express the sense of the Commonwealth Parliament of the day. But our laws do not express the opinions of the most thoughtful and intelligent of the Parliament; as a rule, they represent the standard of intelligence of the least thoughtful of those amongst us; because, as a rule, they are in a majority. Our legislation is seldom up to the standard of intelligence of well-informed men outside. Even if it were, it would be obsolete a few years hence. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member imagines that to blunder through with our work is to get through with it. Honorable members who are endeavouring- to force this measure through the House in the belief that it is in the interests of the masses will find themselves grossly deceived. When the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill was before us I pointed out that it was based partly upon the provisions of the New South Wales Act, which had just come into operation, and which I felt confident had! &#34; failure &#34; written across it. I pointed out then that in the course of a year or two many men whom it was designed to benefit would declare that it was a menace to those who were the most capable and provident in the community. How many unionists are there in New South Wales to-day who do not recognise the truth of those words? And yet many honorable members laughed at my prophecy ! The Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, notwithstanding that the public were led to believe that all trade troubles and difficulties would cease the moment it became law, has so far remained a dead letter. The workers themselves are objecting to the Act because it prevents them from striking for higher wages. Why, should any Court have the right to insist that men shall work for a certain wage when they could otherwise obtain a higher rate? In the ordinary course of events, there is a remedy for every wrong, and we should not give one class of citizens power over another without amply safeguarding that power. The history of the world shows that people are disposed to tyrannically exercise the powers which they possess. That being so, what are we to expect if we give one section of the community, who have not had a reasonable opportunity for study, vast powers over their fellow-citizens ? Sometimes this class will sacrifice the interests of years for a momentary advantage j they will rarely consent to make a sacrifice to-day in the sure and certain hope that by doing so they will secure a great gain a little later on. In these circumstances, 1 have no hesitation in saying that great injury will be inflicted upon the community if we pass the Bill as it stands. I am in favour of its trade marks provisions, and am partly in accord with certain other provisions which it contains ; but I hold that the latter should have been embodied in a separate measure. If they be construed as I apprehend they will be, they will be pernicious in the last degree. The trade union clauses of the Bill may be used not only as a means of boycotting, but also as a weapon against the workers. Once the great body of the people understand that an attempt is being made to force them to do this or that in which they do not believe they will revolt just as some of the unions in Western Australia revolted against the State Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and as unionists in Charters Towers and portion of New South Wales have also revolted. I fearlessly assert that the Ministry had no right to bring before us at this late period of the session a Trade Marks Bill in which is incorporated a Trade Union Label Bill. I have shown that over 140 amendments, clauses, and sub-clauses have to be dealt with, and I have been told that yet another string of amendments is to be submitted. Under the circumstances, we shall be doing a wrong to the people, and to ourselves, if we hastily pass this legislation. </para>

                    (Wentworth). -The Act is to commence on a day to be fixed at the sweet will of the Minister ; but I should like to point out that, as it covers many provisions quite different from those generally included in Trade Marks legislation, it should not be brought into operation too hastily. The moment that the union label provisions are put on the statute-book a system of boycott will be instituted which, if successful, &#34; will block every channel of trade and commerce in the country. In the official magazine of the American Federation of Labour, published in July, 1902, is set forth as clearly as possible what may take place under the system of boycotting now sought to be legalized. The origin of the union label of the United States of America is spoken of in the following words : -

                    <para>The union label is entirely American in its origin, and American in its use. While trade unions exist in other countries, and are, especially powerful and influential in Great Britain, it is only in America that this unique sign of skilled and sufficiently paid labour is in recognised use. </para>

I am endeavouring to show, by analyzing the operations of the union label in the United States of America, what we. may expect from the passing of these union label provisions, and am giving that as a reason why a sufficient time should be allowed to elapse before the Act is brought into operation. Unless I am able to state the history of the union label in the United States of America, I shall be unable to put before the Committee an argument which it is entitled to hear. </para>

                        <para>- I propose to confine my remarks strictly to the question of the date of the commencement of the Act, and before I sit down shall move an amendment. I intend to show honorable members what we must expect the moment the Bill is passed ; and to do so I shall refer to the history of the union label in the United States of America, where, according to the publication from which I have just quoted, it was originated to give the public an opportunity to differentiate between sweated and unsweated labour. There is no need to make such a differentiation in Australia, where we have Wages Boards and Arbitration Courts to mete out justice to unionists and non-unionists alike. I grant that the union label was originated in America for a good purpose - to prevent sweating ; but it has been used in a reckless and evil way. I propose to show that the boycotting which has taken place in the United States, and which will occur here when the provisions in the Bill relating to the use of union labels come into operation, renders it necessary to postpone the operation of the measure for as long a period as possible. I wish to quote from the official journal of &#34;the federated labour organizations of the United States - the largest labour organization in the world. In that publication is a list headed, &#34; We do not patronize,&#34; and the intimation is made that the union working men and union working women who sympathize with labour have agreed not to patronize the firms mentioned in the list. </para>

                        <para>- I almost regret that you. sir, should have been so impressed by my arguments that you consider that they damn the Bill altogether. I do not ask the Committee to go quite so far as that. I merely desire that they shall recognise the seriousness of the prospective boycott, and the desirability of providing that the Act shall not come into operation until the trading community have had1 &#39;an opportunity to adapt themselves, to the new conditions. Unless I am able, by quoting American labour publications, to show what is likely to happen in the Commonwealth, I shall not be in a position to enforce my contention that the Bill should not come into operation at any moment that Ministers may think fit. I propose to give a brief <inline font-style="italic">resume</inline> of what has happened in the United States. In the publication to which I have previously referred there appears, a list of tradesmen under the heading, &#34;We do not patronize.&#34; This list gives the names of firms engaged in almost every branch of trade, including brewers, bakers, cigar-makers- </para>

                        <para>- I propose to move an amendment. The clause provides that the Act shall come into operation on a date to be fixed by proclamation, and I propose to move an amendment to the effect that, so far as one portion of the Act is concerned, it shall not come into operation before 1st January, 1907. I have necessarily to submit reasons why we should differentiate between one portion of the Bill and another. I have already explained, much against the will of members of the Labour Party, that boycotting is carried on in the United States with the assistance of the legislation that has been passed there relating to union labels. I wish to quote from the utterances of the paid organizers of* the United Slates Labour Federation to show that this boycott is in operation from end to end of that country, and that similar results may be expected to follow upon legislation such as that now proposed. If the union label provisions are passed, there will eventually be no market for goods that are the product of non-union labour. Storekeepers will either have to sell union-made goods or submit to be boycotted, and will have to make fresh arrangements for the purchase of their stocks. At present, all they require to do is to find out where and how they can purchase to the greatest advantage; but in future they will have to think, not of the value that they are able to give to their customers, but how they can best pander to their prejudices without incurring loss. </para>

                        <para>- I rise to a point of order. I have no objection to the honorable member making a few remarks upon the question when the proper time arrives, but I should like your ruling as to whether it is competent for him at this stage to discuss the union label provisions of the Bill. It does not seem practicable to provide that a portion of the Bill which has not been specified shall come into operation fourteen months hence, whilst the other provisions shall be brought into operation by proclamation. The honorable member has not yet moved any amendment, and it is obvious that if the course now being pursued by him is permissible, it will be possible for about twenty discussions to centre round the one principle. </para>

Perhaps it would be more convenient, however, if he were to hand in his amendment. </para>

                        <para>- I do not propose to read any more extracts from these reports. I recognise that the Labour Party are not anxious that these matters should be prematurely made public. The honorable member for Bland has sought to draw a very subtle distinction between boycotts originated by this, great federation of labour and boycotts which might result from the use of the union .label. In the publication from which I have already quoted I find the following notice : - </para>

                <para>The object of that notice is to boycott that particular newspaper throughout the United States. This is the result of the operation of the union label in that country. The moment that we pass this Bill a similar condition of affairs will be created in Australia. Not- only will union sympathizers refuse to buy goods which do not bear the union label, but they will decline to deal with any storekeeper who does not stock union-labelled goods exclusively. Surely it is clear to the Attorney-General that he must differentiate between that part of the Bill which deals with the union label and that portion of it which deals with <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> trade marks ? The union label clauses of the Bill are entirely new, and are fraught with the most serious consequences to the trading community. That being so, if we must pass this legislation, it is clear that we should! give storekeepers sufficient time to adapt themselves to the new conditions. Many are probably making their purchases from wholesale firms in the metropolitan centres, and the latter in turn are doubtless making purchases from manufacturer&#39;s here or abroad. If the wholesale firms find that the market for goods that do not bear the union label is interfered with, it will be necessary for them to search for markets where union label goods are obtainable. At the present time, only a small minority of the workers of Australia are enrolled in unions, and in the event of the passing of this Bill, the demand for goods bearing the union label would be far ahead of the local supply. We must have time to adapt ourselves to these new conditions, and I, therefore, trust that the Attorney-General will grant the concession I seek for the trading community of Australia. </para>

                    (New England).- I should prefer the postponement of this clause, pending the consideration, of the remaining provisions of the Bill. If the measure be passed as introduced, I shall be disposed to move that it shall not come into operation until 1950. That part of the Bill to which the Opposition object is shown by the quotations read by the honorable member for Wentworth to be fraught with great danger. It will constitute an instrument of the greatest tyranny and oppression. The union label provisions of the Bill are being forced upon the Committee against the desire of the Ministerial party. I am confident that they are really opposed to that part of the Bill, and that if we could deal with it by ballot, they would promptly reject it. If they could vote on the sly-

                        <para>- I am prepared to vote openly. The Labour Party must recognise that the union label provisions of the Bill will be used as an instrument of tyranny; that they will be used to starve into submission men who would not otherwise join the unions. I object to such provisions, and should like the clause to be postponed. If we allowed the Bill to remain inoperative until 1950, the then members of this House would probably recognise the responsibilities of their position, instead of seeking, as honorable members are now doing, to given effect to a principle which has proved nothing hut a curse to the very men for whose benefit it is proposed. </para>

                    COOK (Parramatta).- I certainly support the suggestion that if the clause be not amended as proposed, it should be postponed until we have dealt with the rest of the Bill. I should like to point out that the provisions in regard to workers&#39; trade labels will apply to articles of over-sea commerce. Clause 78h, in the list of amendments, circulated by the Attorney-General, strikes me as being prohibitive, and, unless carefully watched, might very well be worked in the interests of a particular fiscal policy. It provides that -

                        <para>- I shall content myself by saying that the question of jurisdiction will probably arise in regard to goods manufactured abroad, and labelled similarly to those made in Australia. It is customary for merchants to order their goods for several seasons ahead. I understand that it is not uncommon for goods to be ordered a couple of years ahead, and I suggest to the Attorney-General that he. should defer the coming into operation of a measure whose provisions affect the industrial life of the community so widely as the provisions of this measure will. Therefore, , I ask him either to postpone the clause until we have dealt with the other provisions in the Bill, or to fix a definite period for the coming into operation of the Act. </para>

                    <para>. - Either the provisions of Part VII. of the Bill are good provisions, or they are not. If they are bad provisions, they should not come into operation at all ; but, if they are good provisions, there is no reason why they should not come into operation simultaneously with the rest of the Bill. I see no reason for making a distinction between the time of coming into operation of the two parts of the Bill. In my opinion, there is ample proof that the provisions of Part VII. are good provisions, though that is. a matter which will be discussed in detail later on. As the honorable member for Wentworth made a reference to what has occurred in America, and it has been thought relevant, I should like to point out that so much has the trade union label commended itself to the people of the United States of America, that it has, found favour with the Legislatures of State after State, and Territory after Territory - Legislatures which are usually worked on behalf of capitalists as much as on behalf of the workers. </para>

I am speaking of the decisions, on the State Acts. I should like to quote a few lines from the magazine from which the honorable member for Wentworth has quoted, to explain the office and functions of the union label. It was adopted, first, by the cigar-makers, in 1874, and by the hatters in 1888. The writer of the article says : - </para>

                    <para>Thus it is that this ensign of labour, which originated in a most practical way, &#39;has become a symbol of a sentiment, as well as of a practical and living issue. As the union label progressed and broadened in its domain, it deepened in its significance, until, to-day, it means that the work on which it is placed is done by skilled workmen, under wholesome conditions. It insures the payment of reasonable .wages. It stands for shorter hours of work. It indicates the efforts of organizations constantly striving to secure and maintain these and other important results. The union label is, above all, a weapon to defend the, trade unions from various kinds of antagonisms, whether they aim to increase the hours of labour or decrease the price paid for it, and whether emanating from the unfair competition of -the sweatshop or the duress of powerful combinations of capital. The union label has had its misfortunes. It has been maligned by the suspicious, and counterfeited by the jealous and dishonest. But as the storm adds vigour and sturdiness to the tree which survives it, so have these trials added strength and vigour to the union label. That little seed which a few zealous cigar-maker planted on the Pacific Slope has grown to be a mighty tree. </para>

                <para class="block">That is a view which I think we shall be able to show is the right one. I. do not intend to discuss at this moment the subject of boycotting, because the provisions of our criminal and civil law are ample to repress it, and numerous instances are to be found in America, in England, and in other British communities, in which the courts have repressed it. I can see no reason for postponing the operation of the provisions relating to trade union labels. I can&#39; understand the action of honorable members in moving the rejection of Part VII. ; but if these provisions are worthy of inclusion in the Bill, there is no reason why they should not come into operation with the&#39; rest of the Bill. If they are not worthy of inclusion, they should be excluded. </para>

                        <para>- A label so nearly resembling a worker&#39;s trade mark as to be likely to deceive would be dealt with by the courts as a colourable imitation of that label, even though it might not bear on it a word printed on the trade label. If, for instance, the French flag, or the British flag, were adopted by a worker&#39;s union in Australia as a registered label, the label of a firm sending goods here from another part of the world might be declared a colourable imitation of it, or one calculated to deceive, and the goods might be excluded. Since the Bill contains these provisions, time should be given to make known their effect. That was recognised in connexion with the Commerce Bill ; but the honorable and learned gentleman proposes! to take a different course in connexion with this measure. </para>

Certain labels attached to imported goods are not registered here at the present time, and in the event of the Bill being hurriedly brought into operation, there would be nothing to prevent persons, on the spot from racing to the Commonwealth office, and registering these trade marks. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; I would suggest the 1st July, 1907, or some other reasonable date. I think there are good reasons why the date of commencement should be fixed ; but I am quite willing to consult with the Attorney -General on that point. It may be of advantage to the States Governments to know when the transfer of the Trade Marks Departments is to take place, so that they may make provision for the employment of officers whose services will be no longer required in that branch. I do not wish to take action at this stage, but I trust that in the event of the amendment now before the Chair being withdrawn, the Attorney-General will consider the representations I have made. </para>

                    (Wentworth). - I should not have troubled the Committee again, but for the quotation made by the Attorney-General from an American labour publication, with regard to the causes for the adoption of union labels in the United States. I would point out that conditions which exist there do not obtain in Australia. The Minister quoted the statement that &#34; The union label insures payment of reasonable wages.&#34; What would happen if we passed provisions for the use of union labels with that object in view ? We have already a properly constituted tribunal to deal with the question of wages, so far as a Commonwealth authority is competent to exercise control. If the union label provisions of the Bill&#39; are designed with the same object, it is clear that we shall be constituting a new authority over and above-

If the Attorney-General can see his way to adopt that course, I shall be quite satisfied, because, on reflection, it seems to me that that is, perhaps, the best thing to do. We really do not know how far-reaching this Bill will prove to be. </para>

                        <para>- But the honorable member must recognise that the Bill is clearly divided into two parts - one containing provisions which might reasonably be expected in a measure dealing with trade marks, and the other consisting of absolutely foreign matter. If the Attorney-General will consent to the postponement of this clause until the remaining clauses have been dealt with, I do not think that he will delay the passing of the measure in any way. I think we should consider the question of when the. Bill shall come into operation after we have dealt with the provisions of the Bill itself. If the union label proposals become law, the Attorney-General must recognise that we shall establish a new set of conditions throughout Australia, which the trading community will be called upon to meet. If those proposals are not carried there will be no need to postpone the date upon which the Act shall come into operation. </para>

                    (Indi- Attorney-General). - I do not think that we should differentiate between the various parts of the Bill. In my opinion, there is very much to be said in favour of the position put by the honorable member for North Sydney. When this clause was inserted, the intention was that the Bill should commence on a date to be fixed by proclamation, but it was understood that, as the Commonwealth would have to take over a good many State officers, some time must necessarily elapse before the Department could be got into proper working condition. In connexion with the Patents Act, I think that eight months was absorbed in this way. Probably six months would be required in the case of this Bill. For that reason I am quite willing to insert at the end of clause 2 words which no doubt will be practically observed by any Government that may be in office. If the amendment of the honorable member for Wentworth be withdrawn, I shall move to add to the clause the words &#34; not less than six months after the passing&#39; of this Act.&#34;

                    <para>The union label is a weapon which, above all, is intended to defend trade unions against various kinds of antagonism, whether they aim to increase the hours of labour or decrease the price paid for it, and whether emanating from the unfair competition of the sweat-shop or the duress of powerful combinations of capital. </para>

                <para class="block">It appears to me that those conditions do not obtain in Australia, or that they obtain only to a very small extent. The fact that they prevail in America is no argument in favour of the adoption of a union label here. We have already established Courts to regulate wages and hours of employment and to prevent those evils occurring which the adoption of the union label in America was intended to correct. Consequently, by this legislation, we are merely double-banking the methods of dealing with the same evil? In my opinion, the less that we interfere with industrial pursuits the better. I have no desire to see unfair conditions obtain, but I realize that the union label will be used for purposes of oppression and tyranny, and that its adoption will bring about a great deal of unrest. I think that we should deal with the other clauses of the Bill before considering the provision which is under consideration. </para>

                        <para>- I am strongly tempted to do so. I object to this clause for a variety of reasons, which, to my mind, are practically irrefutable. I object to it in the first place because I am opposed to the Bill itself, with these extraneous and highly contentious matters embodied in it without rhyme or reason, and because the Government had no mandate whatever from the electors to introduce such a measure. They are simply being pressed by the third party in the House to proceed with it. </para>

It will be injurious to the workers, the producers, the manufacturers, the distributors, and the public generally, and I shall vote for any further amendment to defer its coming into operation until a period much later than that suggested by the Minister. As a discussion of the operation of the trade union label laws in force in the United States, and the ruling of the courts in regard to their validity, has been permitted, I propose to bring forward some testimony- </para>

I know that protests on the part Of the Opposition are absolutely futile, because the Ministry are relying upon brute force to carry this measure through. All reasonable argument is absolutely useless, because honorable members opposite are in a majority, and have determined to follow a certain course regardless of whether or not it is in the interests of the community to do so. As the Opposition are in a minority, and have no power to prevent the passing of a Bill that must be attended by evil consequences, they can do no more than protest as emphatically as possible. I make no secret of the fact that I shall avail myself of every opportunity allowed by the Standing Orders to obstruct this iniquitous measure, and prevent its being passed. </para>

                        <para>- It is evident that another difficulty has arisen. While I am quite content to agree to the amendment in regard to the commencement of one set of the provisions in the Bill, I am not content that the other set of provisions should come into effect within six months of the passing of the Act. It is doubtful whether they are constitutional, and, therefore, an opportunity should be given to test their validity. I do not think that six months would be sufficient to give that opportunity. </para>

                    (New England).The Bill is so drastic in its nature, and so different from any legislation hitherto passed in any British country, that I think it should be prevented from coming into force at all. I have no objection to those provisions which relate solely to trade marks, but I shall do all that I can to prevent Part VII. or any substituted provisions, from coming into force. It is time that we put our foot down on legislation of this character, which runs across the grain of all that has been done in the past. Ministers would not attempt to force such a measure through the Committee if it were not for their arrangement with the party sitting behind them. I believe that the Bill is utterly distasteful to the great majority of the people, and, while it can do very little good, will do a great deal of harm, because of the manner in which it will upset trade arrangements. I hope that the Minister will consent to an adjournment to-night, because many honorable members have had a long train journey.

The honorable member for Barrier is very brave now that he knows that he has a large number behind him; but the fact that the Labour Government did not insert the union label provisions in the original Bill which they introduced shows how hypocritical are their statements that their desire is to benefit the people outside. </para>

                        <para>- In my opinion, the clause should not be allowed to pass, because the Bill is a bad one, and should not come into force at all. We should destroy the measure clause by clause. I have no desire to stop here all night, but, in view of what we conceive to be the interests of the general community, we have a right to adopt every means within our power to prevent the Bill from being passed! into law. I should have no objection to the measure if Part VII. were eliminated; but I am sure that if the Bill is passed in its present form it will prove an instrument of tyranny. I shall, therefore, oppose the clause. </para>

I take it that he is willing to postpone the consideration of all contentious clauses, and as the clause now under discussion is .obviously contentious, I would suggest that its further consideration should be deferred1.

                        <para>- I am very sorry to hear that. I object to the Bill being brought into operation at any time prior to the next general election, because I think that the country should have an opportunity of expressing its will with regard to the union label provisions. The Committee ought not to agree to this clause until that issue has been submitted to the electors. It must be recollected that at the last general election the people had no opportunity of expressing their opinions upon the proposals embodied in the measure because it was never anticipated that legislation of this character would be brought before Parliament. For that reason, amongst many others, I object to the clause in its present form. </para>

                    <para>- I should like to understand exactly the position, taken up by the Attorney-General in regard to this clause. Everybody recognises that a Trade Marks Bill is not only a necessary, but a useful measure. But upon the present occasion we are threatened with certain proposals which will be discussed at a later stage, and which have been sprung upon us owing to the baneful influence exercised by the Attorney-General over other members of the Cabinet. </para>

                        <para>- I quite agree that if the union label1 clauses had been embodied in a separate Bill the path of the Government would have been rendered very much easier. Had that course been adopted, it is quite possible that members of the Labour Party who are more interested in those proposals than is anybody else, would have secured all that they desire. I have no wish <inline font-style="italic">to.</inline> offer any factious opposition to this measure,, but I hope that the Attorney-General will, without delay, make a statement of his intentions in regard to both its contentious and non-contentious provisions. </para>

From their previous utterances upon another matter which is closely allied! to this, I know that their speeches would be very interesting.

                        <para>- I should like to put this view to honorable members : I think it would be a fair thing to raise a general debate upon the new amendments proposed&#34; by the Attorney-General. When we reach Part VII. of the Bill, unless some opportunity is provided for initiating a general discussion, we shall find our hands tied by the well-known rule in Committee that we must confine our remarks to the particular clause which is under consideration. The proposals of the Attorney-General by way of amendment practically amount to a new Bill. They embrace thirty-three new clauses and sixty-six sub-clauses, to say nothing of the other portions of the measure. His proposals in regard to the union label contain that number of clauses and sub-clauses - quite sufficient material to have warranted the bringing in of a separate Bill. The honorable and learned gentleman&#39;s proposal is of sufficient importance to warrant a general debate upon the whole subject; a debate in which I should like the honorable member for Bland to take a prominent part. There are many matters which I should be pleased to have explained and discussed, and I believe that a general discussion of the whole question, precedent to a consideration of the clauses in detail, would facilitate rather than retard the passing of the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that the honorable member can complain. Some of the speeches made to-day, and especially that delivered by the honorable member for Werriwa, were of great value. I repeat that the amendments circulated by the Attorney-General warrant a general debate before we proceed to discuss them seriatim, and I propose to raise that debate on clause 3 by moving the omission of Part VII., which relates to trade union marks. That would bring the whole subject under review. The Attorney-General says that he desires to show some work for the sitting, and I suggest that he might very well agree to the passing of the non-contentious clauses of the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- There are some members of &#34;the Opposition who believe that they can usefully discuss the subsequent clauses, and suggest amendments which would improve them. It is because of that fact that we are not prepared to consent to-night to the passing of all the clauses up to Part VII. of the Bill. If we pass fifty-seven clauses to-night the Attorney-General will be able to say that we have done a good evening&#39;s work. I suggest to the honorable and learned gentleman that he should consent to the adoption of this course, clause 3 being postponed only to allow a general debate to be raised, and the remaining proposals, down to Part VI., to be passed. I submit that we can do very much better work for the country by sitting during reasonable hours than by remaining here late at night, wearing ourselves out in fighting for what we believe to be our rights. </para>

                    <para>- I can fully sympathize with the suggestion of the deputy leader of the Opposition that, at some stage of the proceedings in Committee, there should be a general debate upon what is admittedly a very contentious question. The general principle involved in the proposal to extend protection to trade union marks was discussed very lengthily on the motion for the second reading of the Bill. The leader of the Opposition then made a very long, though interesting speech, and I too spoke at some length. Many other honorable members also addressed the House, and every one of them concentrated his attention upon the union label provisions of the Bill. Honorable members practically offered no objection to any other aspect of it. </para>

With regard to the suggestion of the deputy leader of the Opposition, I should not see any objection to the postponement of clause 3, with a view to facilitate the discussion to which he refers ; but I do say that had it not been for the motion submitted by him &#34; That the Chairman do now leave the chair,&#34; we should have done much more business during this sitting than we have yet transacted. I do not object to such tactics if honorable members consider it necessary, to resort to them, but those who wish to see the business of the country attended to have a right to ask that the non-contentious clauses shall be passed without objection. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable members have had several months in which to consider them. I am prepared to listen with deference to the honorable member&#39;s criticisms. If there is to be considerable discussion on any clause, there is no reason why it should not be postponed; but, in my opinion, we are not justified in adjourning until we have done a fair amount of work. We should have dealt with all the clauses but those in Part VII., had the Opposition been ready to face their discussion in a reasonable fashion. </para>

                    (Indi- Attorney-General). - The proposal of the honorable member for Parramatta that we should deal with the first fifty-seven clauses means that we should do barely an hour&#39;s work. The measure has&#34; been carefully considered by the members of the other Chamber, and the Bill has been before this House for many months. No amendments, however, have been circulated in regard to its provisions, except those for which&#39; the Government are responsible, and that, coupled with the fact tha* no suggestion has been made in- regard to the measure by the Chambers of Commerce, make it a fair assumption that there is no objection to them, and that they are purely non-contentious. If honorable members will look at the list of amendments which the Government have circulated, they will see that they involve no party question, and no question of policy ; their intention is merely to make the Bill workable. I understand that the honorable member for North Sydney and the honorable and learned member for Corinella desire to raise some point on the three clauses comprising Part V., and I am willing to postpone those clauses, though I do not know what the point is. The succeeding clauses deal purely with office machinery.

                    (Corinella).- The Act, under the amendment to which the Attorney-General has agreed1, is not to take effect until six months after its passing, and it is difficult, therefore, to understand why&#39; it should be regarded as, a measure of such urgency that it must be passed in one night. It is unquestionably a measure of great importance, and it is highly necessary that the public should be made well aware of its provisions before it comes into operation. T say without any hesitation that the Attorney-General cannot point to any instance in which a technical measure of this kind was passed in a single night. Elsewhere the clauses of the Bill, were discussed one by one, and debated for weeks. It is now proposed that the whole of these clauses should be passed in a single night.

                        <para>- Order ! I conceive it to be my duty to expedite public business, and when I thought that the honorable, member for Bland, the honorable member, for Parramatta, and the Attorney-General were endeavouring to enter into an arrangement by which the public business would be facilitated, I did not interfere. Their efforts failed, however, and I cannot allow the matter to be further discussed. I hope that the honorable and learned member will see that I am doing him no personal in-, justice, but that I am endeavouring to consult the best interests of the country. </para>

                        <para>- I do not wish to sit all night. I think that the proposal that we should pass more than one-half of this measure was of too generous a character. There are some good reasons to be advanced in favour of the motion. When the honorable member for Parramatta moved a similar motion this afternoon in order to protest against the action of the Government, he expressed himself briefly, and I had the . privilege of speaking for about twenty minutes. The debate extended over some five , or six hours, but I must confess that the whole of the speeches delivered dealt very fairly with the question under consideration. Later in the evening, when the Attorney-General assumed an attitude of determination, honorable members agreed to the suggestion that a large number of clauses might be passed on his assurance that they were not contentious, and that the amendments proposed by him would make the measure practically all that could be desired. But the present attitude of the Attorney-General appears to me to be utterly unreasonable. </para>

                        <para>- The proposal of the Government to pass the whole of these clauses to-night is sufficient justification for an honorable member taking any course, which the rules of the House permit, to prevent that object being accomplished. Neither my judgment nor my voice consented to the view that the first four parts of this measure contained no contentious clauses - no provisions as to which debate might not reasonably arise, or as to which suggestions might not well be made for the improvement of the Bill. Nevertheless, I was prepared to accept those assurances, even against my own judgment, and to consent to the Bill being passed up to the end of Part IV. That suggestion was rejected almost with&#34; contempt. We were told that so much of the measure was to be passed, and that until that was done a proper amount of business would not have been transacted. That is not the way to treat men who have already surrendered their own views in order to meet the opinions of others. When allegations of that character are made and are backed up by threats of force, we have no choice but to exercise our rights and to insist that proper consideration shall be given to this Bill. Whatever may be the merits or demerits of the debate which took place earlier this afternoon, there can be no doubt that to propose, after 11 o&#39;clock at night, to pass nearly 100 clauses through Committee- </para>

If, upon the 15th November last year, the then Government had proposed, at a quarter-past 11 o&#39;clock at night, to pass 100 clauses of a measure through Committee, lie would have resented it. </para>

                        <para>- Another reason for urging that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> should leave the chair is that the champion of toil - the Attorney-General - has himself left the chamber. We have known in Victoria for some time that we could not follow a better example, and now that fact is dawning on the Commonwealth. Will the Minister of Trade and Customs, who has temporarily relieved him, say that he has carefully read the first fifty-seven clauses of the Bill? </para>

                        <para>- I do not believe in passing practically the whole of the clauses of an important measure in one evening after 11 o&#39;clock, and I intend to make my objection, to that course felt. We do not now hear jibes about the proposal of the late Government to introduce Standing Orders to limit debate. Perhaps, if the Chairman left the chair, the present Government would put in an hour or two in drafting Standing Orders to meet the case. One objection to these late sittings is that honorable members cannot subsequently approach the measures submitted for their consideration with that clearness of intellectual vision which is desirable when matters of great public importance are being dealt with. I do not pretend that the Trade Marks Bill will be advanced by the present debate, but I am not going to be a party to pushing through the measure at the point of the bayonet. I shall not allow the Attorney-General, or any other Minister, to say what we shall or shall not do. No doubt, if I had five minutes&#39; talk with the Minister of Trade and Customs I could make some arrangement with him, because I see a melting look in his eye. </para>

                        <para>- The Attorney-General, who adopted an utterly unreasonable attitude, asked a great deal more than that. He wished us to accept his assurance that, beyond the union label clauses, there is nothing in the Bill which this deliberative assembly should deliberate on. He did not say, though he went near to&#39; saying, that he would postpone any clauses he was asked to postpone; he said that he would postpone clauses in regard to which reasonable points were raised, but he was to be the judge of what was reasonable. I do not think he views these matters with an unprejudiced eye or unbiased mind. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt; but keenness is not the only requisite for the performance of the important duties of a Minister of State. The Attorney-General cannot point to any occasion but one in his experience on which the quantity of work done was anything like equal to that which he suggests should be done to-night. That occasion was when an Insolvency Bill was before the Parliament of Victoria, about the drafting of which a number of honorable members had grave doubts. The honorable and learned gentleman was Attorney-General at the time, and he had one of those moods of firmness which occasionally vary his reasonableness and conciliatoriness. Honorable members at length became tired, and finally told the Minister that they would hold him responsible for the drafting of the measure. As a consequence, ninety clauses were passed in the one evening, and that measure has been a constant source of income to the members of the legal profession ever since. Several Ministers have been good enough to signify to me their concurrence that it is time that the House rose, and all that is required to bring about the desired result is the consent of the Attorney-General. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable and learned member will probably see the reason for that. There is no common law of the Commonwealth in the same way that there is common law of the States. In cases for which the State Acts do not provide, the common law applies. The provision referred to is inserted in the measure merely to make sure that the common law will apply. The same principle has been accepted in the Judiciary Act. </para>

                        <para>- But I am not sure that it should not. be undertaken. Clause 8 deals with the question of partial registration, which for various reasons may not be valid in all the States. A registration may be good in two or three States, but not in a fourth. I have given a good deal of anxious thought to the cases of trade marks registered in Victoria, but not in New South Wales, or not registerable by reason of other users. I experienced a good deal of difficulty in connexion with that matter. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. but the point is one which may very properly be raised and discussed by both laymen and lawyers. Clauses 10 and 15 appear to be purely formal, but clause 16, which relates to the essential particulars of the trade mark, varies to some extent from the provisions of other Acts, and I should like to know why. </para>

                        <para>- The question as to what are the essential particulars of a trade mark is a very important <inline font-style="italic">one from the</inline> point of view of the commercial community. Clause 21 is practically a new clause. At first sight it seems satisfactory, but I should like to have some information regarding it. Clause 23 is proposed to be amended. </para>

                        <para>- No ; but the whole question has been raised as to whether registration will be permitted for a trade mark applying to the whole of the goods manufactured by a particular firm, or whether separate trade marks will be required for each class of goods. That is a question that requires serious consideration. Then again, clause 28 deals with concurrent user - a very difficult matter, which has always given trouble, and which will continue to give trouble, because the question of whether a concurrent user is honest or otherwise is always open to debate. Then the form of application provided for under clause 32 certainly requires consideration. </para>

                        <para>- But the clause lays down certain conditions which must be embodied in the application, and the prescribed form must contain these, or else it will be bad, because it will be inconsistent with the Act. Upon clause 34 I desire to raise specifically the question of appeals to the Law Officer. That matter is a very important one. The foundation of the argument is that it simply interposes another step in the process of appeals. </para>

                        <para>- In important cases counsel are briefed. However, that is a matter upon which some debate may legitimately take place. Let us suppose that some person applied to register a trade mark in respect of Panama hats, and let us further assume that the application was opposed before the Registrar, and that it passed on to the Law Officer. Under such circumstances, neither party would be satisfied, and the matter would inevitably go to the Court. In that case there would be an unnecessary step. </para>

Clause 63 provides that the register shall be open to the inspection of the public on payment of the prescribed fee. &#39; Clause 64 does not seem to be a very objectionable one. There is no domination by any party involved there. Clause 63 provides that certified copies or extracts from the register may be made evidence. That provision seems a reasonable one. Clause 66 forbids false entries being made in the register under a penalty of three years&#39; imprisonment. Clause 67 permits of the correction of the register and the following provision requires assignments to be registered. Clause 69 allows the Court to alter registered marks; and clause 70 permits it to rectify the register. Clause 71 requires very serious consideration. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the Attorney-General has met us half-way. At the same time, in offering to agree to the provisions of the Bill up to Part IV., we went a long way towards meeting him. But if members of the Opposition do not think that these clauses ought to be passed tonight, I cannot quarrel with them. If the Attorney-General had spoken earlier in the evening in the same way that he spoke to me a few minutes ago, there would have been less heat imported into the debate. </para>

                        <para>- The Attorney-General has promised to recommit any clause which honorable members may legitimately wish to have recommitted. That is to say, he has not to be convinced that a clause is wrong, but merely that honorable members desire to recommit it for the <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> purpose of improving the Bill. I leave myself entirely in the hands of the Opposition in regard to this matter. If, after what I have said, they feel that they can consent to the course suggested, I shall be quite willing to acquiesce in it but I shall not feel aggrieved df they regard the measure as of too great importance to be treated in that way. I rely chiefly on the promise of the Attorney-General to recommit any clause the recommittal of which may be reasonably asked for. </para>

Even if we were to admit, for the sake of argument, that in the earlier part of today&#39;s proceedings there was unnecessary discussion, it must be acknowledged that the passing of fifty-seven clauses of a Bill-

                        <para>- The Attorney - General was offered fifty -seven clauses of this Bill. More than that, the course suggested was assented to by some members of the Opposition who had amendments to submit in those clauses, and who wished to discuss some of the points which have been raised by the honorable and learned member for Corinella. They were willing to allow those provisions to pass, and to trust to the Attorney-General recommitting them if necessary. The honorable and learned gentleman should feel very gratified indeed that the Committee were wilting to agree to fifty-seven clauses of his Bill at one sitting. It has already been pointed out that in another place the consideration of those clauses occupied a period out of all proportion to that which they would have occupied had the offer to which I refer been, accepted. But the honorable and learned gentleman wishes to say to the Opposition. &#34; You shall do so and so.&#34; </para>

                        <para>- The Attorney-General made a proposal, in reply to which a very, favorable offer was put forward by the Opposition. The honorable and learned gentleman cannot deny that had he accepted it he would have made more progress than could be made in any other circumstances during a single sitting. In order to allow of that offer, some honorable members of the Opposition were prepared to forego certain amendments which they had contemplated moving. The present position is that at the end qf the sitting - and no one can foresee when the sitting will be brought to a close - we shall have to deal with the clauses that the Opposition were prepared to allow to pass to-night. </para>

I also offered to agree to the recommittal of any clause at the request of an honorable member who desired a recommittal, not for the purposes of delay, but to improve the Bill.

                        <para>- I have always said that the honorable member himself treated us very reasonably, but that some of his party did everything-thev could to delay business. I can understand a Ministry attempting, towards the close of a session, to arrive at an amicable agreement with the Opposition to expedite the business of the House, and in such circumstances they should be treated with reason. When they are so treated, however, I object to their saying to the Opposition, &#34; You shall do what we ask, or remain here.&#34; All-night sittings in other Legislatures have resulted in the custom of nothing being done until after midnight. Then measures have been rushed through without consideration, and various errors have escaped observation. Such sittings have also resulted in unpleasant scenes, and I would therefore discourage them as far as possible. But the Opposition made a reasonable offer to the Government. No one can point to any sitting of the House at which more clauses of a Bill have been passed than those to which we intimated our willingness to agree to-night. </para>

                        <para>- I have known days to pass without anything resulting from the deliberations of a Legislature. Even in the history of this Parliament I have known several&#39; days to be occupied in the consideration of one clause of a Bill. Such an instance occurred when many of those now on the Government Benches sat in Opposition. I certainly think that if the Attorney-General had accepted our offer </para>

                        <para>- But that offer has not been accepted. As an illustration of the confusion into which we are drifting, I would point out that many amendments have been introduced, and that although those originally circulated by the Attorney-General provide sufficient material for a separate Bill, he has circulated another sheaf of amendments that have not yet been fully considered. </para>

                        <para>- The Government and the Opposition has each taken its own course. The Attorney-General seems not to have provided for the alteration of the heading of Part. VII. to Workers&#39; Trade Marks. I should like to know whether the provision in clause 4 - &#34;This Act&#34; includes all regulations made thereunder, is necessary. I think that that provision is covered by the Interpretation Act. Although we passed that Act to shorten our measures, we still find provisions in Bills which the Acts Interpretation Act was in- tended to make unnecessary. I should like an explanation from the Attorney-General as to the effect of clause 5. </para>

                        <para>- In the States the common law of England prevails, subject to any statutory provisions to the contrary ; but there is a rule in the United States of America that the common law of the States is not the common law of the United States. We do not know how the rule may operate here - whether the common law of the States would be the common law of the Commonwealth, and therefore we provide that, subject to any Act of the Parliament, the common law of England shall apply throughout the Commonwealth. It is a practice which has been followed in other measures, such as the Judiciary Act. </para>

I do not think that every point is met. For instance, a triangle may be the trade mark of two firms, one doing business in New South Wales, and the other in Victoria. Suppose that the Victorian proprietor was the first to apply to register that mark for the Commonwealth, how would the other proprietor be dealt with ? </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that the meaning is quite clear. At any rate, the wording of the clause might be more definite. Clause 10 provides that the Act shall be administered by the Minister of Trade and Customs for the time being. The words &#34;for the time being&#34; appear to be unnecessary, because the Acts Interpretation Act provides that any Minister, who is acting for the time being, shall be considered to be the Minister charged with the administration of an Act. Furthermore, it seems to me that the system of bringing an Act under the administration of a particular Minister is very undesirable, and that it would be much better to follow the course adopted in some other Parliaments of merely describing the Minister as &#34; the Minister administering the Act.&#34; On some occasions, provisions such as that contained in the Bill have proved troublesome. Clause 12 provides that an office shall be established which shall be called the Trade Marks Office. I wish to know if it is intended to establish an office apart from that which is devoted to the registration of patents? </para>

It may be necessary to arrange the work inside the office so that one officer may act as Commissioner of Patents and another as Registrar of Trade Marks. That is a matter of internal arrangement. </para>

                        <para>- In my opinion, it is undesirable to have a separate office, because any such arrangement must involve increased expense and make supervision more difficult. With regard to Part III., relating to registrable trade marks, I had intended to move an amendment in clause 15, which provides that a registrable trade mark shall consist of essential particulars, without additional matter, to the effect that the particulars should be applied only to such articles as were produced, prepared, manufactured, or owned by the person in whose name the trade mark was registered. That is opposed to the principle of a Bill that has been inserted in another place, although it is in accordance with the provisions of other Trade Marks Acts. My amendment is an important one, and involves a principle which, after consultation with the deputy leader of the Opposition, I was willing to surrender, in order to make a liberal concession to the Attorney-General. Under the circumstances, I may, in some form and in some place, move an amendment to the effect I have mentioned. Clause 16 sets out the essential particulars of a registrable trade mark. I notice that in clause 19 it is provided that certain words and devices must not be used in connexion with registered trade marks. For instance, it is not permissible to use any representation of the King or Queen, or any member of the Royal Family, or the word &#34; Royal.&#34; It seems to me that that provision goes too far. I know that the word &#34; Royal &#34; is in use in some countries, and that it is presumably registered. If &#34; Royal &#34; is to be objected to, why should not the use of &#34; Regal &#34; and other words signifying connexion with royalty also be prohibited? </para>

                        <para>- I do not know whether that is so or not, but in the United States a baking powder is advertised under the name &#34;Royal,&#34; and as the article is largely exported to Canada, I should think that the trade mark was registered there. I understand that the Customs authorities threatened to seize certain goods that bore the Royal Arms, although in many cases articles have been so marked for many years. It is provided that neither the flag of Great Britain nor of the Commonwealth, nor the national arms of Great Britain, or of the Commonwealth, shall be used in connexion with any registered trade mark. </para>

Apart from that altogether, I should like to know what the Attorney-General intends to do. He has made no such provision as that contained in the British law in reference to trade marks in use before the Bill comes into operation. </para>

                        <para>- Certain rights to trade marks acquired1 prior to the Act passed in 1875 have been recognised in Great Britain, and it seems to me that some similar provision should be made in this Bill. I am quite sure that some of the prohibited designs are registered in some of the States, or rights have been acquired by user for which some provision will have to be made. </para>

                <para class="block">I do not think there is any provision of that sort under the heading pf workers&#39; trade marks. I do not see why there should be a provision of that character in connexion with one trade mark and not in connexion with another. There are a number of other clauses which I have noted, and to which the same remark is applicable. I do not propose to deal with the whole of them, but if they are necessary in the case of a trader&#39;s trade mark, why should they not be necessary in that of a workers&#39; trade mark? I notice that the proposal contained in Moulton&#39;s Bill has been embodied in clause 21. I know that there is no more frequent cause of dispute between persons registering trade marks, and even between firms themselves, than the question of whether the pictorial representation of goods or words having reference to their character or quality shall not of themselves be deemed distinctive. I am not prepared to say whether the adoption of the proposal contained in Moulton&#39;s Bill is the best way of settling the matter. I quite agree that there should be something clearer than the provision which is embodied in most Trade Marks Acts ; but I have not had ah opportunity of considering all the cases affected, and whether the Moulton Bill best meets the situation.

At one time a trade mark could be registered by a proprietor or manufacturer of goods if it differed from any other registration, and could be applied to all his wares.

                        <para>- In some of the States the law has been pretty liberal in allowing classes of goods of a similar nature to be grouped together - the articles being named - so that the registrar might know to what goods the particular trade mark was meant to apply. In other States the tendency seems to have been to compel those registering to individualize as much as possible. Instead of allowing them to use to any considerable extent groups of goods of a similar nature, the authorities insisted upon the registration of a mark in connexion with almost each article. I would point out that such a provision bears very harshly upon the smaller manufacturers - upon those who produce a variety of articles in small quantities. They can ill-afford to pay these numerous fees whilst their stronger competitors, who perhaps issue as great a variety of goods, but in much larger quantities, can readily pay the fees fixed by the regulations. Under this Bill, we have no indication of what those fees will be. The matter is left to prescription. I do not know whether it will be necessary for me to move an amendment setting out that articles of a similar nature, manufactured or produced by the same firm or individual, shall be grouped together, and shall be registered for a fee proportionate to the particular items of the grouping. At any rate, there should be an opportunity of grouping goods of a similar character - as has been done under the administration of many Trade Marks Acts - so that the smaller men shall not be liable to a very heavy charge upon them relatively to their larger rivals. </para>

They might obtain registration of a trade mark through an agent who might subsequently leave Australia, and it does not seem necessary or desirable that they should have to keep constantly on the spot an agent at whose address notices could be served. These notices might be of the utmost importance to the persons registering the trade mark, and yet in the event of the proprietors not residing within the Commonwealth they would not reach them in time to allow of the proprietors taking action. I do not know that such, a provision appears in the English law, and I fail to see why we should insist upon an address in Australia being given by a person who is not domiciled here. I think that an address within the British Empire ought to be sufficient. In that event, notice could be sent to the address given, and sufficient time should be allowed the person concerned&#39; to defend rights that were being attacked. There are some other clauses in this division which I do not at this stage propose to read. Division III. deals with opposition. In clause 38 it is provided that a notice of opposition in duplicate to the registration of a trade mark shall be lodged at the Trade Marks office; but by a subsequent clause workers&#39; trade marks are excluded from this provision. The same remark will apply to clause 39, which requires that although a person opposing an application for registration may not reside in Australia, he shall furnish an address for service at some convenient place within the Commonwealth. There is more reason for a person opposing registration of a trade mark being required to give an address within the Commonwealth than there is for requiring the person whose registration is being attacked to do so. </para>

                        <para>- I rise to a point of order. I wish to know whether on the motion that the Chairman do now leave the chair, the honorable member is in order in dealing in detail with the clauses of the Bill ? My impression is that whilst he may be entitled to refer incidentally to the general features of the measure with a view to illustrate an argument in support of the Chairman leaving the chair he is not justified in dealing in detail with the provisions of the Bill and in arguing on every aspect that it is possible to import into them. </para>

On similar occasions I have known the discussion to range over almost every conceivable topic ; but I have been showing that the very clauses which the Opposition offered to pass to-night contain many matters worthy of examination, and, in some cases, of amendment. I think I have proved that our liberal offer, if accepted, would have expedited the business of the Committee; but that as it was rejected you should leave the chair and report progress. I can, if necessary, cover a wider range of discussion, but in order that &#39;there may be no complaint on that score, I have endeavoured to adhere as closely as possible to the motion. </para>

                        <para>- I can give, and have given very good reasons why the Chairman should leave &#34;the chair. One of these is that some of the provisions of the Bill require greater consideration than honorable members have been able to devote to them since the numerous amendments prepared by the Attorney-General were circulated. Even the Attorney-General himself has shown by his replies to some of my queries - replies which he gave very courteously - that he has not recognised certain points that have been raised, and that it is very desirable that before we pass the union label provisions of the Bill he and honorable members generally should have a further opportunity to examine and consider them. Surely no better reason can be adduced in support of the motion? On similar occasions I have listened to a debate that has not had the remotest connexion with the question of whether or not the Chairman should leave the chair, and yet objection is taken when I am absolutely dealing with the question immediately under consideration. In support of my contention, I had, when interrupted, to allude to only a few more clauses. I do not intend to discuss those clauses, because the one remark will apply to them generally, that the workers&#39; trade marks are excluded from certain provisions that are to be applied to other trade marks. In some cases, there is a reason for this, but in many others there is none whatever. Before we proceed further with this part of the Bill we . should have from the Attorney-General a statement why the workers&#39; trade marks are to be excluded in this way. If advantageous provisions or restrictions are to be extended to certain trade marks, I cannot see why they should not be applied to others. I allude to clauses 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 47, 52, and 56. If these provisions are necessary in order to control the registration of general trade marks, why should they not be extended to workers&#39; trade marks? I should like to have a full explanation on that point from the Attorney- </para>

Although the sugar bounty affects the whole community, they appear to be ready to throw it to the four winds of heaven for a proposal which affects only a section of the people of Queensland. The members of the Labour Party are at all times prepared to sacrifice their country for sectional aims.

                        <para>- Judging by the criticism levelled at the Bill by the honorable and learned member for Corinella and the honorable member for North Sydney, it would have taken from half-past 2 yesterday afternoon until 11 o&#39;clock at night to deal with fifteen clauses, whereas the Opposition agreed to pass fifty seven clauses in order to obtain an adjournment at a reasonable hour. The Attorney-General, however, asked his <inline font-style="italic">confreres</inline> to sit tight, and I venture to think that his action will find very little sympathy amongst his colleagues. I challenge the Vice-President of the Executive Council and the Postmaster-General to say whether they believe in the union label clauses. I should like to hear the honorable member for Richmond speak on the subject from this side of the Chamber. </para>

                        <para>- We are told that we must pass the Bill and the Sugar Bounty Bill too. When Ministers are so unreasonable, there is nothing for us to do but to fall back on the poor, despised Standing Orders. It is a brutal thing for the Attorney-General to compel the Minister of Trade and Customs, who has until re- , gently been confined to his bed through illness, to remain up all night. At 4 o&#39;clock in the morning honorable members are tired and incapable of performing business. </para>

                        <para>- If they are, I think that the Chairman should leave the chair so that the House may seriously consider the matter. Some little time ago the leader of the Opposition proposed to amend the Standing Orders, and he has been taunted ever since by members of the Labour Party, who are how disposed to favour an alteration. In the meantime, we must obey the Standing Orders as we find them, and the best way in which we can honour them is by utilizing them from time to time, when we consider that we shall serve a useful purpose by doing so. Honorable members may take exception to my suggestion that we are serving a useful purpose at the present time, but members of the Opposition consider that they are conferring a benefit upon the community by preventing legislation from being rushed through this Chamber. </para>

                        <para>- They succumbed to the brutality of the Government - the very thing of which we are now complaining. In face of the evidences of haste on the part of the Senate, all the greater obligation rests upon us to impose a wholesome check upon the passing of Bills without the fullest consideration. Honorable members are manifestly unfit at this hour to properly consider an important measure like that now before us. I venture to say that when they were last before the electors, they certainly did not tell them that they would allow a measure of this kind to pass whilst they were lying asleep upon the benches in the Chamber. The leader of the Labour Party assured us that he had not been in communication with the Government concerning the trade union label proposals, but I should like to know why honorable members have been stricken with dumbness concerning a measure in the framing of which they profess to have had no hand. </para>

The sooner he ceases to employ the language of the schoolmaster the sooner we shall get to serious business.

                        <para>- When the honorable member was in the Chair it used to be constantly remarked of him that he was possessed of a deaf ear and a blind eye. My second point is that this Bill ought not to be proceeded with until other measures of greater importance, and of more urgency have been dealt with. Yesterday I appealed to the Attorney-General to defer its consideration, and to proceed with the Electoral Bill. If there is one honorable member more than another who should be anxious to see that measure pass it is the honorable member for Riverina. I know al! the v risks that the honorable member incurred at the last general election. Yet the honorable member allows the Trade Marks Bill to elbow out of its place on the Government programme a great measure of electoral reform. We know that owing to the want of proper supervision the rolls are stuffed with the names of deceased and absent people, and that their thorough revision and policing, even if the Electoral Bill were passed to-day, would occupy all the time intervening between now and the next general election. For the first time in the history of this Parliament we have on the notice-paper a Bill that will remedy many of the defects of our electoral system, of which complaint has been made ; but it now appears at the bottom of the list. It was expected three months ago that we should proceed with the Copyright Bill, but by a shuffle of the cards that measure has also been placed almost at the bottom of the business paper. Last week we discussed1 the Sugar Bounty Bill as well as the Contract Immigrants Bill and Immigration Restriction Act Amendment Bill; but tha Trade Marks Bill is now given precedence. Mav I point out that although the Sugar Bounty Bill affects Queensland as a State, the representatives of that State have suddenly become silent in regard to its importance. </para>

                        <para>- There are now three or four representatives of Queensland in the Chamber, and I&#39; desire to know why they have consented to precedence being given to a Bill which at the most can only partly affect that State. Only a few days ago the honorable member for Wide Bay told us that the Sugar Bounty Bill was of first rate importance; that business in &#39; Queensland was already paralyzed owing to the uncertainty as to the intentions of the Parliament, and he begged the House to proceed with the utmost despatch to deal with the question. It would appear, however, that honorable members of .the Labour Party are prepared to sacrifice the interests of the State as a whole to their class objects, and. to matters relating to only a section of the people. Then, again, the honorable member for Coolgardie is prepared, apparently in order that the demands of a clamorous minority outside may be satisfied, to sacrifice the project for coupling Western Australia with the other States of the Commonwealth by means of the transcontinental railway. There is also the question of the Capital Site. Honorable members who read the newspapers must be aware of its pressing urgency, and of the feeling that is running so high between the most populous State of Australia and the Parliament of the Commonwealth tin respect to its determination. In the State of which I am a representative the question is assuming a very awkward shape, and I venture to say that if any trouble arises it may profoundly affect every State in the Union, and in a way that may be disastrous to the Commonwealth. I am no prophet of evil in this matter, and speak more freely because I feel that I have nothing with which to charge myself in respect to it. I have tried to do my best to have the question determined. </para>

                        <para>- Another question of urgency which should take precedence of the Trade Marks Bill is that of the defence of Australia. Every one knows that we are in a shocking state of unpreparedness. The Prime Minister time and again has denounced our military system as being worthless for the purpose of effective defence, and as requiring immediate attention, with a view to its improvement. We all remember the paper which he presented to the (House embodying his splendid speech upon this subject - a speech full of warning and indicating that many thousands, nay mil lions, of pounds must be spent in&#39; order that we may secure that state of preparedness to defend ourselves which is necessary in view of the contiguity of Eastern nations. Surely a matter affecting the safety of the Commonwealth should take precedence of every other question. Then there is the question of population. Only a few days ago the Prime Minister in Sydney addressed himself to it in a speech of his usual brilliancy and vagueness. The only point that he made, however, was that we require more population. He did not offer a single suggestion as to the way in which population might be attracted to Australia, and we now find him shelving the whole question, and saying that he is powerless to do anything in regard to ib. I hold that he has been guilty of humbugging the country. </para>

                        <para>- But the leader of the Opposition has not submitted to this House a programme bearing upon it the one word &#34; population &#34; ; he has not been peregrinating all over the country and speaking on this subject from a hundred different platforms in a way that suggests that he is absolutely master of the problem. I have hesitated to identify myself with this movement, because I wanted some practical direction, although I am as anxious as is any one to get population here. The Government, however, have placed this most vital plank of their platform behind measures which are trumpery in comparison with it. Referring to the Capital Site question, I think that the Government have not treated us fairly in keeping from us their decision in regard to it, seeing the menacing attitude adopted by the Parliament of New South Wales. </para>

They say that this Parliament is bound by the Seat of Government Act, in the passing of which, as I pointed out at the time, a mistaken course was followed. But, although it is more than twelve months since that Act was passed, nothing has been done under it. </para>

                    <para>- I did not know of the intention of the deputy leader of the Opposition to move that the Chairman leave the chair until the motion was moved. That motion was necessary to enable the honorable member to place his views before the Committee in regard to the manner in which the business of the country was being dealt with. His remarks occupied only ten or twelve minutes, and had it not been for the Attorney-General&#39;s attack on him, I should not have spoken to the motion. But when the Attorney-General tried to make political capital by his charges against the deputy leader of the Opposition those on this side of the Chamber were bound to support their leader. Later on in the evening, the Opposition made the reasonable offer to the Government fo pass fifty-seven clauses before adjourning. The Attorney-General, however, wished to pass seventy-eight clauses. I venture to say that the bulk of his colleagues were favorable to the acceptance of a fair and honorable proposal. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable and learned member made so many proposals. The honorable and learned member for Corinella informed the Government that, not being aware that the Trade Marks Bill was to be proceeded with, he had left his notes at home, and other honorable members were in the same position. I thought it an extraordinary proceeding, in view of the order of business on Friday, that we should be asked to proceed with the Trade Marks Bill. </para>

                            Although many honorable members had travelled 500 or 600 miles to attend this meeting, of Parliament, they were ready to pass fifty-seven clauses in the Trade Marks Bill, including one or two affecting Court proceedings, on which the discussion might well have occupied a day or two. The Opposition wish to assist in despatching business, so that honorable members may return to their homes before Christmas time.

                        <para>- We have a duty- to perform, and are prepared to perform it even at the sacrifice of our own interests. One of the important measures we have to consider is the Electoral Bill, which was originally the first item placed on the business-paper for to-day. Honorable members fully expected that some progress would have been made with that urgently-needed Bill, and they have every right to complain of its having been displaced from its position of priority by the Bill now before us. The honorable member for Gwydir recently directed attention to some very serious defects in the electoral roll for his constituency. He pointed out that a large number of electors who had been long resident in the district had been left off the roll, that the work of compilation had been carried out in a scandalous manner, and that the question was one which seriously affected every honorable member. The honorable member&#39;s statement pointed to serious defects in the law, and to the urgency of the Electoral Bill. Valuable information was obtained by the Electoral Committee bearing upon the collection of the rolls, and a number 0? recommendations were made in the direction of improving the system of compilation, and also the provisions for voting by post and the use of Q forms. A general election must take place next year, in the ordinary course, and it is essential that amending legislation should be passed without delay. We have no guarantee that the Electoral Bill will be disposed of during this session, and as we shall probably not meet again until about the middle of next year, we may be fooled as we were on a former occasion in regard to electoral matters. I think that we have every reason to complain of the action of the Government in regard to the Electoral Bill. Then again the Immigration Restriction Amendment Bill and the Contract Immigrants Bill are important measures regarding which the sincerity of the Government is open to the strongest doubt. We are entitled to know whether it is intended to proceed with those Bills, or whether they were brought forward merely for display. We have been told that the Sunshine Harvester Company and other manufacturers have suggested that an Anti-trust Bill should be introduced, or that the Tariff should be amended in order to afford protection to the agricultural implement industry. The Prime Minister has induced us to believe that the Government intend to take some action in this direction, but his. announcement on this point was quite inconsistent with the action of the Government in discharging from the business-paper the Or,ders of the Day relating to the Committees of Ways and Means and Supply. It will be necessary to restore both these Orders of. the Day if any measures affecting the finances are to be dealt with. We are entitled to know what the Government really intend to do in the matter. They have interfered in a most unwarrantable manner with the Tariff Commission, with a view to inducing them to present reports which will enable action to be taken for the amendment of the Tariff before the session is brought to an end, and the intentions of the Government in this connexion should be frankly declared. We have been called upon to partly consider the Sugar Bounties Bill and: the Sugar Excise Bill, both of which are measures of urgency. Although I do not agree with all the Government proposals, I admit the reasonableness of the claim put forward by the representatives of Queensland that they should be dealt with as early as possible, in order that the sugar-growers of that State may learn their fate without unnecessary delay. Apparently, however, the Government are not in earnest in the matter. I suppose that we are all anxious to bring the session to a close as early as possible, but, in view of the congested business-paper, we cannot hope to pass all the Bills now before us, and close the session before Christmas. If the Government intend to sit on after Christmas, they should announce the fact so that honorable members, may know where they stand, and make their arrangements accordingly. We shall be glad to proceed with the business if the . Government will frankly tell us what measures they really wish to pass into law. Another matter of importance which should be dealt with is the question as to the respective positions which are occupied bv the High Court and the Supreme Courts of the States, </para>

If the Prime Minister had frankly told honorable members what business the Government intended to proceed with during the remainder of the session, no difficulty would have been experienced in bringing our labours, to a speedy termination.

                    <para>- The Attorney-General must be less than human if he persists in his present course of conduct after the very able speeches which have been delivered by the deputy leader of the Opposition and the honorable member for Macquarie. My first objection to the attitude of the Attorney-General in refusing to accede to the reasonable request of the Opposition is that such conduct does not facilitate the transaction of business in this Chamber. Can any body of legislators devote their best intelligence to the discussion of a question of far-reaching importance after they have been in attendance here for about seventeen hours? </para>

                        <para>- Because of the extraordinary want of tact exhibited by the Attorney-General. He should recognise that honorable members are sent here to perform certain work, and that we have a duty to discharge to our constituents. But, instead of doing so, he wishes to ride &#34; the high horse.&#34; If we desired to delay the passing of this Bill, what better excuse could we have than that afforded by the action of the Attorney-General in gratuitously insulting the Opposition ? In a few hours&#39; time, other members of the Opposition will enter this Chamber, and will naturally inquire whether the Attorney-General intends to allow a reasonable amount of business to be transacted, or whether he insists upon dictating to them. </para>

                        <para>- In view of the disclaimer of the Attorney-General, I take it that the Postmaster-General spoke without authority. What are the Bills which the Postmaster-General is so anxious to rush through the House before the session closes? They include the Electoral Bill, the two measures relating to the sugar industry, the Immigration Restriction Amendment Bill, and the Census and Statistics Bill. I think it would interest the taxpayers to know how much discussion in this House results from the tactless methods of the Attorney-General. Whenever he opens his mouth he provokes debate. </para>

                        <para>- Not exactly. The honorable gentleman seems to come here for the express purpose of stirring up trouble. No doubt that is. a very valuable quality for a member of the Opposition to possess. If we had an Opposition of the calibre and attainments of the Attorney-General it would be quite impossible for any Government to transact public business. If you, sir, would leave the chair, another Bill which might be proceeded with is the Copyright Bill. That measure contains a number of provisions which are regarded bv members of the Labour Party with almost as much anxiety as are the union label proposals. We all know that they are very anxious to get telegrams for their labour newspapers free of cost. </para>

                        <para>- Having been prevented sir, from discussing some of the reasons why I wish you to leave the chair, I shall now deal with the question of the urgency of the Trade Marks Bill. Yesterday evening I quoted from the official journal of the federated labour of the United States statements proving conclusively the state of boycott which exists there as the result of the union label law. An attempt was made to make capital out of the fact that the issue from which I read extracts was dated 1902. I have now before me the issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Coast Seamen&#39;s Journal</inline> of San Francisco for 5th April of this year. This is the official paper of the Seamen&#39;s Union of the United States, and it gives indications of the way in which the union label law operates there. I shall read a few of the advertisements which appear on one page of this issue - </para>

                    <para>Union Label of the United Hatters of N.A.( When you are buying a fur hat, either soft or stiff, see to it that the Genuine Union Label is sewed in it. The Genuine Union Label is perforated on the four edges exactly the same as a postage stamp. If a retailer has loose labels in his possession, and offers to put one in a hat for you, do not patronize him. Loose labels in retail stores are counterfeits. Unprincipled manufacturers are using them in order to get rid of their scab-made hats. The John B. Stetson Company, of Philadelphia, Pa., is a non-union concern. </para>

                        <para>- The Attorney-General has taken the view that in certain States which have no factory legislation tenement labour must be in a different position from union labour. That does not apply to the State of which I am a representative. If it did, I am not at all sure that I should not be prepared to advocate dealing with the trouble by means of a straight-out </para>

                <para class="block">Factories Act. By means of this Bill, according to the Attorney-General, we shall influence and control the industrial affairs of the States. If that be so, we shall infringe the right of the States to the complete management of industrial matters within their own borders. We have also to remember that the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act provides for the creation of a Court that will determine all questions of labour and wages. Surely a measure of this kind, which may, perhaps, be necessary in the United States in order to protect the consumer against the products of sweated labour is not necessary in Australia, and is, therefore, only a proposal to double-bank legislation, in these circumstances, it must be obvious, that the real desire of the Labour Party is to secure the passing of this Bill id order that new unions, having political objects, and subscribing &#39; to the party war-chest, may be formed. Union labels will be registered by these bodies, and an effort will be made to force men to join the unions. The outcome of the passing of this legislation must necessarily be the complete disorganization of existing trade. If the attempt to create a prejudice by means of a union label be successful, all goods must necessarily be made by union labour. Some time must elapse before the union labour available locally is sufficient to cope with the demands of consumers, and in the interval there must be a complete disorganization of trade. That is not a matter to be lightly faced. Another phase of the question is whether or not the position of The Labour Party will be affected by the passing of this Bill. I. think that, as. the result of its coming into operation, their political gains must be enormous. At the last Labour Conference In New South Wales, a proposal was made to levy 6d. per annum per member from each of the affiliated unions in that State. </para>

                        <para>- Then, what is the use of it? We know the means which have been adopted in San Francisco and elsewhere to prevent persons from patronizing shops where the union label is not recognised. Men have been posted outside such shops to keep customers away, , and there are walking delegates in receipt of large sums of money from those who employ them, as all true servants of labour should be, who travel from place to place to see that the clothes of all unionists and of their wives and children are stamped with the union label. Surely we have enough persons battening on labour in the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- I hope that my rulings have not been misunderstood. It would be out of order for any honorable member speaking on this motion to discuss the Bill clause by clause. Such a course of action would be ait evident attempt to obstruct and to waste time, which I would not permit. But an honorable member is in order in referring to any particular portion of the Bill to which he objects - such as Part VII. Honorable members must not discuss it in detail. </para>

                        <para>- Before it was proposed that the Chairman should leave the chair, the Opposition made an offer to go on with business, which the Attorney-General, for some inexplicable reason, would not accept. Therefore, the motion was moved that the Chairman do now leave the chair, to allow a wider range of discussion, and to prevent the passing, by sheer brute force or force of numbers, of clauses to which they honestly object, and wish to properly debate. One reason why the Chairman should leave the chair is that there is a limit to human endurance, and the fatigue of occupying the chair for many hours must be very great. Another -reason is that many honorable members in the chamber are physically unfit to transact business. I would direct attention to the fact that the members of the Labour Party are conniving at, if they have not actually instigated, the introduction of a system of sweating in connexion with the officers of the House. The advocates of short hours of labour have insisted upon keeping honorable members and the officers of the House, and the newspaper reporters, in attendance here in order to permit of the discussion of matters which it certainly cannot with truth be contended are of pressing urgency on any ground of public necessity or even expediency. If honorable members had been kept sitting, continuously for twenty hours for the purpose of carrying some- useful measures, I could have understood the anxiety of the Government to proceed with public business. If, for instance, any of the other items on the business-paper had been, dealt with instead of this Bill, there might perhaps have been some warrant for this great display of devotion to public duty. I was under the impression that we should have been called upon to deal with the Electoral Bill, which is a measure of the first importance, and should be dealt with at the earliest possible moment j and I enter my strongest protest against the constant manipulation to which the business-paper is subjected bv Ministers. Then there is the Sugar Bounty Bill, and its companion measure, the Sugar Excise Bill. These Bills deal with matters which, whether we are in agreement with them or not, may fairly be admitted to be more or less urgent, and so entitled to receive our careful attention at the first opportunity. </para>

                        <para>- Amongst other measures which I consider of very much greater importance than the Trade Marks Bill is the Electoral Bill, which the electors require to be enacted at the earliest possible opportunity. The electoral officers have held an inquiry and furnished a report as to the state of the rolls, and the conditions generally under which elections are held. The proper representation of the people in this House lies at the very foundation of our system of parliamentary government. Unless the existing anomalies in the electoral law and the representation of the people are adjusted, we shall have to face another general election under the provisions of a very much out-of-date electoral law. The Electoral Bill should engage our attention&#39; at the earliest possible moment. I am sorry to find that the Ministry have interrupted the passage of that Bill by pressing forward a measure for which no possible urgency can be alleged, especially when they knew that it was regarded by the Opposition as being of a most contentious character, and that widely divergent opinions existed among honorable members on each side as to its provisions. I have no objection to a Trade Marks Bill pure and simple, but I strongly object to extraneous provisions being engrafted upon the measure. The members of the Opposition were perfectly willing to agree to the enactment of provisions for the protection of legitimate trade marks, but they strongly objected to such an excrescence as a provision for a union label being incorporated in the Bill. This attempt to legalize boycotting and coercion with a view to prevent a large number of working men and women from earning a living has no right to be made in .connexion with the Trade Marks Bill. The matter should have been reserved for consideration in a separate Bill. I am sure that had Part VII. been eliminated the Government would have had no difficulty in passing, the Trade Marks Bill. We are entitled to know what reasons have induced Ministers to .put aside other measures of a more useful character and to thrust this Bill into the forefront of their programme at the tail end of the session, knowing full well that the Opposition intended to make the fullest use of their powers to criticise its provisions, in the interests of fair play and public rights.

                        <para>- There is further justification for our action in the almost universal condemnation of the Bill outside this House. In dealking with a measure of this kind we should have regard to the opinions of our electors, and I am satisfied that if this Bill were submitted to a vote in my constituency to-morrow nine-tenths of the electors would show themselves as strongly opposed to the principle underlying Part VII. as is even the right honorable member for Swan. The proposal is made, not to effect any improvement in the quality of manufactured goods, but to exclude from sale all goods that are not made by a particular class of labour. The primary object aimed at is not to set one class against another, but members of one class against other members of the same , class. An attempt is being made by the introduction of this principle to reverse the decision of a Parliament that in dealing with the Arbitration Bill was so strongly opposed to the preferential clauses introduced into that measure as to take action, which was followed by disastrous results to at least one Ministry. That should be a sufficient reason to justify strenuous opposition to the legislation now proposed. An attempt is here being made to use the forms of the law to institute a system which I say advisedly is absolutely immoral in character. Such a measure would interfere with the free rights of citizens to work for whom they chose, and to purchase their goods from whom they chose. It would put power into the hands of a certain section of the community to use the forces of tyranny, persecution, and intimidation in order to make the will of the minority prevail over that of the majority. That must be evident, because we know that the majority of the workers of Australia do not belong to unions. Honorable members occupying the Ministerial cross benches cannot be sincere in their professions of belief in the right of the majority to &#39;rule, when they insist on introducing clauses in this Bill to provide for the enforcement of the will of the minority on the majority. We have had protests from bodies of manufacturers and from individuals, not against the legitimate purposes of the Bill, but against the introduction of the pernicious principles embodied in Part VII., which have nothing in common with the legitimate purposes of a Trade Marks Bill. There are other measures of far greater importance than the Trade Marks Bill, and these ought to receive the attention of the Commonwealth Parliament. In addition to the Electoral Bill, there is business which private members desire to introduce, including a Bill by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, in conjunction with myself, in reference to military canteens, but I suppose the latter must be sacrificed unless, as seems not unlikely, the session is to last the life of this Parliament. There might have been some excuse for the Government pushing on with the measure relating to sugar bounties, which is regarded as of such vital importance in Queensland that, I believe, the question of secession has been raised in connexion with it. Then, again, the Excise Bill is one regarded by a great many people as of urgent importance; and, in view of the pressing need of population, the Immigration Restriction Act Amendment Bill ought to receive prompt consideration. The measure dealing with immigrants, who come here under contract, is. no doubt, of a contentious character, but, even at this late period of the session, there would have been every justification for the Government submitting it in preference to the Bill now before the Committee. The Census and Statistics Bill, involving, as it does, the representation of the people in this House, must be regarded as of pressing urgency. Every honorable member will admit, I think, that the Copyright Bill should be proceeded with. Even in a Bill with such an innocent title as it bears, there may lurk socialistic debatable provisions, but otherwise it is a measure which I think honorable members on both sides would be will-&#34; ing to consider at the earliest possible moment. According to the statements of certain supporters of the Government, the Manufactures Encouragement Bill is one of paramount importance to the welfare of this country. If they really hold that belief, I marvel at their sitting tamely behind a Government which is setting aside that measure in order to proceed with a Bill which even they have admitted is not of so urgent a character. Another question of urgent public importance is the selection of the Federal Capital site. Recognising that this important question is of great moment to the State of New South Wales, the Government might very well have asked honorable members to consider their measure on the subject in&#39; preference to this Trade Marks Bill. It would be a sufficient justification for our submitting; this motion if it resulted in providing an opportunity to enable that important question to be considered by honorable members. If, however, the Trade Marks Bill be proceeded with the Easter holidays may be reached before it is passed, because it is only fair to assume that so far as its objectionable matter is concerned, it will be discussed clause by clause. Another subject which the House might very well have been asked to discuss is the defence policy of the Government. Another reason why you, sir, should leave the chair is to enable the Government to redeem their promise to make a statement of defence policy. The state of our defences is not a minor question. It is really of a more urgent character than any other question, even more urgent, I think, than the amendment of the electoral law. Owing to our peculiar position, we are so greatly exposed to the possibilities of hostile attack that in the interests of our safety and of our industrial and commercial life, it is necessary to arrive at a definite policy.

                    <para>- A motion that the Chairman do leave the chair is an attempt to take from the Government the conduct of the business of the House, and they are therefore justified in looking upon such a motion as one of vital importance. For the same reason, those who support such a motion should be seised with a .proper sense of the responsibility they assume. I have been as little inclined as has any other member of theCommittee to waste time. I have often assisted the present Government, in whom I have no confidence whatever, to carry on the business of the House merely because it has. also been the business of the country. But occasions do arise when one feels that it is necessary to emphasize a protest against a measure being carried, and* against- the want of sincerity displayed by a Government in introducing such a measure. There must be something rotten in the &#34; state of Denmark &#34; when practical business men, such as the honorable members for North Sydney, Kooyong, Grampians, and myself, are induced to consent to an all-night sitting. The honorable and learned member for Corinella cannot be looked upon, even by his most bitter political opponents, as one who would voluntarily submit a motion merely in order to delay business. No member of this House has been more desirous than I have been to see the session produce some useful legislation. Prom the initiation of Federation I have desired that honorable members sent to this Parliament should justify the choice of the country by carrying out the great scheme of Federation and the large measures, many of which still await our consideration, necessary to complete the work, to secure the economical government of Australia, to perfect the union of the States, and to develop their resources. The Government, in persisting with this measure and the obnoxious clauses inserted since its introduction, are neglecting other matters of paramount importance. They are occupying the time of Parliament with a side issue at the dictation of a minority. There are many Government supporters in this House, and in the Ministry itself there are some, who in their heart of hearts are opposed to the proposed legislation. In such circumstances it is a comparatively easy task to justify the motion before the Committee as a protest against the way in which the Government is conducting the business of the country. More than one Ministry have had something to do with this measure, which, when first introduced, did not contain the provisions, which are so obnoxious to a section in this House. Whilst only a section in the House is opposed to these provisions, I challenge the Government to deny that a majority of the electors are opposed to this legislation. Honorable members generally are in favour of giving complete effect to the principles of this, Bill, as introduced. At the dictation of a section in this Parliament, a certain set of clauses have been introduced, and have, with certain modifications to preserve their consistency, since been stepfathered by the present Government. The Bill is submitted for our consideration now with so many proposed amendments that it would have been well if the Government had had the measure printed as they desire to see it passed, in order that honorable members might be enabled to understand the effect of the amendments proposed. This is not the time to go into the details of the wording of some of the clauses, but I can assure the Committee that there are clauses which are positively unworkable, while there are others which have been introduced for merely fiscal purposes. I support this motion in order to emphasize objections, which, while they are those of only a certain number of the members of the Committee, represent, I believe, the opinion of the great majority of the people of the country. From the commercial business, and moneyed classes of the country, on whom we must depend for our advancement and prosperity, and the employment of labour, petitions and other expressions of opinion have come, which have afforded overwhelming evidence of a belief that the measure is wrong in principle,, and will work <inline font-style="italic">evil to</inline> the whole of the people, more particularly, in the last instance, to the wage-earning classes. It is believed that the measure will restrict production and retard business in all directions, with the ultimate effect of &#34;killing the goose that laid the golden egg.&#34; On the ether hand, there has been no such general expressions of opinion from the working classes, unionist or non-unionist, as show any widespread desire for legislation of the kind. It may be said that that argument proves nothing; but we have not found the working classes miss opportunities in regard to other legislation in which they have felt deeply interested. </para>

The great impetus to this legislation comes from the many politicians amongst the working, classes - politicians who desire measures of &#34;the kind, because their whole aim is to increase and consolidate the power of the political labouring classes, in order that they may satisfy their ambition, laudable in itself, of obtaining seats in the Legislature which governs the Commonwealth. The aim of the Labour Party from the first has been to pass such legislation as will assist to increase the number of their representatives. </para>

All through legislation of the kind the effort has been to consolidate the labour organizations, so that the whole machine may be pulled by means of two or three wires. </para>

                        <para>- I am endeavouring to answer the question of the honorable member for Melbourne Ports. I regard the Trade Marks Bill as an ordinary measure, which is being used for party political purposes. The Arbitration Bill obtained the support of, at any rate, some manufacturers, while the White Australia policy was favoured by others of the same class; indeed, its ultimate success was due to the support received from capitalists, because it could not have been carried by the other side unaided. I was a warm supporter of the broad features of the Arbitration and Conciliation Bill, urging, as labour representatives urged, that it was intended to get rid of the very causes which had produced disputes in the past, and create a tribunal which would decide what, under ail the circumstances, were fair wages and conditions of labour in any particular trade. </para>

                        <para>- I am a manufacturer, and I supported it. I use the Arbitration Bill as an illustration, in order to show that I have some ground for my opposition to the Bill before us, which I regard as an endeavour to pass legislation of which we refused to make the Arbitration Bill a vehicle. The Labour Party, when that Bill was before us, argued that if they gave up their power to strike, they should receive something in return; and there was created the tribunal to which I have referred. As time went on, an effort was made to carry that principle further - to carry it as far as is proposed in the Bill now under consideration. An endeavour was made to give preference to unionists. I argued that there should be no preference to unionists or any one else, when a Court was created to fix rates of wages, and the hours and conditions of employment. Actuated by sound democratic principles, I objected to creating class distinctions. Amongst others who assisted to knock the principle of preference to unionists out of the Arbitration Bill was the present Prime Minister, who, in a most eloquent speech, laid bare the secret underlying the efforts of the Political Labour Party. The enactment of the union label provisions is desired by them, in order to bring about precisely the same result as was endeavoured to be brought about by the enactment of preference to unionists. The Committee would stultify itself if, in view of that decision, it were- to agree to Part VII. of this Bill. We find Ministers who vehemently opposed the enactment of the principle in the Arbitration Bill endeavouring, in order to achieve the object of the Political Labour Party, to sneak into this Bill some, clauses to which we believe the great majority of the electors are strongly opposed, and which we contend will be inimical to the producing and manufacturing interests of the country. We desire to draw attention to the fact that the Government is not sincerely desirous of seeing this principle embodied in the Trade Marks Bill, but is simply acting from reasons of political expediency, in order to placate a large number of followers without whose support they could not possibly exist. Outside Parliament the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, and the Vice-President of the Executive Council were in deadly earnest in opposing the machinations of the Political Labour Party in seeking to secure the enactment of preference to unionists. </para>

                        <para>- It is worthy of me to expect to find consistency in three men who have played a prominent part in public life. If they have advocated certain principles when sitting on this side of the House it is worthy of me to expect them to be still consistent to those principles, and, if they had the privilege of voting in secret, to vote against their enactment. There are honorable members sitting behind the Government who, if a secret vote could be taken, would vote in a similar way. These clauses are fathered by the Government merely to secure the support of a section of the House; and, according to the moral maxims which are associated with our system of party government, their supporters feel constrained to support objectionable provisions lest, if defeated, Ministers should have to resign office. If I were sitting on the other side, I, too, should feel constrained to give a loyal support to a Government in similar circumstances. I do not say that I would swallow everything, as some Ministers are swallowing principles which they enunciated when sitting on this side of the House. But I should feel somewhat constrained to support a Government that brought in measures to which it pinned its faith. The present Government, however, cannot be considered to have pinned its honest faith to the trade union marks proposal. We ought not any longer to allow a system to continue under which the fate of a measure depends, not upon the principles actuating honorable members, but upon the exigencies of party warfare. If we could get rid of the particularly obnoxious clauses of this Bill with the undertaking that they shall be introduced in a separate measure next session, after mature consideration, I, for one, would assist the Government to pass the other Bills that have been brought forward as speedily as possible, so that Parliament might get into recess, and Ministers might obtain what they require more than anything else - rest and the opportunity to frame other measures, for which this nation is waiting. Throughout Australia we are face to face with the fact that the great wave of faith which swept us into Federation is spending its force, as the Commonwealth, as such, is beginning to stink in the nostrils of the people. When I was in Queensland a little while ago, it was almost a constant occurrence that whenever I was introduced to&#34; a man as a member of the Federal Parliament, he would say, &#34;Let him go and hang himself then.&#34; That feeling is growing in the other States. Little Tasmania is finding that the hopes entertained of this great union are being sadly delayed. The people are coming to the conclusion that the members of this Parliament have not brains enough to give them the measures that were expected as a result of Federation. We can find time to stick into a Trade Marks Bill clauses which embody an obnoxious principle, but we have neither time nor ability to solve the States&#39; debts question, or to deal effectively with the conservation of the Murray waters. </para>

                    <para>- The Temporary Chairman of Committees has again reported to me that his attention has been drawn to the state of the House. About a minute age I informed the House that I was certain that there was a quorum present, and that there was no necessity to count the House- Only a few minutes before I had done. so. I, therefore, declined to count the House again. I followed a precedent laid down in the House of Commons, where, in the opinion of the Speaker, it was not necessary that the House should be counted and re-counted so frequently. A little while ago I made a suggestion that honorable members should not use one of the forms of the House in the manner in which, I feared, it was being used. I feel that I am bound to do all in roy power to have the business of the House conducted in an orderly fashion. Under these circumstances, I am called upon to take u),on myself, for the first time, a grave responsibility, but one which is strictly in accord with practice, and also with our first standing order, which provides that where ou rules are silent the practice of the House of Commons shall govern our proceedings, </para>

But I again ask honorable members to exercise some restraint with regard to impeding the business with which the House is engaged- </para>

It is true that Parliament has power to alter that number, but it has wisely been considered that it is not too much to ask that at least twenty-five members of a legislative body shall keep their places when business is being done. Standing order 33 is as follows : - </para>

                <para class="block">For several minutes after attention has been called to the want of a quorum, there has been an absolute disregard of standing order 33, and under that standing order the House should now be adjourned until the next sitting day. Your ruling, sir, must have been given without reference to the standing order, otherwise I cannot conceive why you should have made the statement that where our Standing Orders are silent, reference is made to the Standing Orders of the House of Commons. In the House of Commons, owing to the number of its members, it is practically impossible that there should ever be a want of a quorum. It is true that some honorable members may find it a nuisance that twenty-five of them should be compelled to wait in the House, but surely it is not a very irksome regulation. </para>

                        <para>- I think that perhaps the matter can be better settled in another way. I am satisfied as to the power to be exercised by the occupant of the chair. I indicated that to honorable members a little time ago in a way which I thought would be taken advantage of. I recognise that the business in which we are at present engaged can hardly be called important business, so far as the actual motion before honorable members is concerned. I also feel that perhaps in my position as temporary occupant of the chair, I should not have taken such a serious step. My desire was to assist in the despatch of public business, and to bring honorable members to a sense of the serious position into which we were drifting through what at the time I believed to be an abuse of one of the forms of the House. In the circumstances, I feel that perhaps I should best consult the progress of public business if, for the present, I were to allow the matter to remain in abeyance, and to leave it to the good sense of honorable members to exercise the power they believe they have, but which I believe they have only so long as they do not abuse it in a reasonable way. If honorable members are prepared to accept my suggestion, we can go on in the ordinary way. I ask the honorable member for Werriwa to now allow the debate to proceed. </para>

                    <para>- I wish only to complete my case by a reference to some other matters of supreme importance, which should have engaged the attention of the Government. Next in importance to the great question of Inter state irrigation scheme, to which attention was directed by the honorable member for Echuca, and the question of the consolidation of State debts, I should say that the question of defence is one which should receive the attention of the Government. I accuse the Government of having abnegated the principles laid down by their leader in an interview with a representative of the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> shortly before his accession to office, and again enunciated by him after taking office. He declared that it was absolutely essential that the Federal Government should work out some scheme of defence which could be understood, and under which we might get value for our money. This is a much more important matter than the consideration of trade union labels. We are now at the end of a long session, and there has been no hint of a system of defence. We have become demoralized. We are doing no good, and it is better that we should go to the country, that Ministers may be given an opportunity to initiate some policy on these grave questions, and that they should drop the twopenny-halfpenny questions that are thrust upon them by outsiders. The Labour Party were charged with&#39; cutting down the cost of the defence of the country. I glory in the fact that I helped the Labour Party to do that. If it had not been done we should have wasted more money than we have, in my opinion, already, wasted. The only way in which to secure some attention to the necessity for a proper system of defence was to check the spending of the Defence Department. Prior to Federation, the confiding people of the various States were informed that if they consented to the proposed union they would be enabled to save from ,&#163;500,000 to &#163;750,000 a year by the consolidation of States debts, and that they would be provided with a perfect system of defence within their means. The people have been misled in this, as in almost every other direction. Nothing has been done to secure what was promised, whilst the attention of Parliament has been devoted to unimportant questions submitted in order to gratify certain political parties otto secure certain political support. AVe had better consider whether it would not be in the best interests of this Commonwealth to abolish the party system of government. How would a measure like this be dealt with if we had not the present system of Executive, but one in which each individual member of the Executive was responsible to members of the House? Under such a system, when a Minister or any private member introduced a Bill of this class, there would be no unnecessary discussion, and there would be nothing to be gained by submitting a motion of the kind now under discussion. Such a Minister would gravely and seriously introduce the measure, in all probability believing in its principles, or, if he did not, he could honestly say so; and after he had explained that he had endeavoured, to the best of. his ability, to give effect to the will of the House, a decision could be rapidly arrived at. Under the present system, however, if a Minister does not believe in a Bill introduced by his Government, the utmost honesty we can expect from him is that he will not open his mouth. This measure is one in which, probably, not one-half of the Ministry believe; and many honorable members simply support it out of a feeling of loyalty. The system results in much fruitless labour, and that waste of time will continue so long as there is a party system, and more than two parties. Indeed, the chances are that as time goes on there may be as many as five parties, with all the resultant secret understandings between section and section. It would be far better to abolish the party system in favour of one which would probably condense the labours of the session into three months, and produce more practical results than have any of the four long sessions we have already experienced. </para>

                    <para>- The seriousness of the position must be realized when we find a sedate and studious gentleman like the honorable member for South Sydney displaying so much excitement on a question of the kind now before the Committee. At times the motion that the Chairman leave the chair may be abused, but, having regard to the spirit in which the honorable member dealt with the matter, it cannot be even suggested that he was , displaying obstructive tactics. When that honorable member, and an honorable member of the character of the representative of North Sydney, address themselves seriously to the question, it may be presumed that the occasion is of an unprecedented character. Is it worth our while as sane men to proceed as we have been doing? I am sure that the Prime Minister would have willingly accepted the compromise which was offered last night by the Opposition. The honorable and learned member for Corinella, who is answerable for the motion now under discussion, cannot be described as an obstructionist. </para>

                        <para>- We have no desire that&#39; this Parliament should be presented as occupying any lower status than that of the States&#39; Parliaments. We do not wish to devise obstructive schemes, of which the electors could not approve. The British Constitution provides that the Opposition shall have every facility to assist Ministers in carrying on the government of the country. I do not wish any honorable member to depart from that great ideal. Bv this time, the Prime Minister must be aware of the temper of the Committee. He must realize that it would not require much engineering to enable the Opposition to spend a whole week upon the Bill rather than proceed with its consideration under existing circumstances. It was an open secret in the early part of yesterday afternoon that the Government had determined at all hazards to get up to clause 72 of the Bill, and when we offered to proceed as far as clause 57, our reasonable compromise was rejected by the Attorney-General, who, in my opinion, has shown great want of tact. A Minister needs to possess, not only backbone, but tact and discretion. The Attorney-General is one of the keenest lawyers in the community, but, as a political leader, he is a great failure. If he thinks he can make any progress with this Bill against the intentions of the Opposition, he is sadly mistaken, To show the disturbed nature of the Committee, let me draw attention to the fact that for hours honorable members have been searching <inline font-style="italic">May</inline> and the Standing Orders for an authority with which to prevent the Opposition from proceeding with this motion. Nothing would please me better, sir, than to see you removed from the chair by the vote of a powerful majority, not as a reflection upon your action, but as a reflection upon the Government. I have to take the <inline font-style="italic">role</inline> of a passive resister. It is a peculiar thing, sir, that this action was moved, not by what the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> calls a degenerate from New South Wales, but by one of its own pet children. I am almost choked with emotion, sir, when I recall the fact that the Chairman invited the honorable and learned member for Corinella to move him out of the chair, and then refused to accept the motion when it was moved. Every one will remember how that breezy writer, Chesterton, of the <inline font-style="italic">Daily News,</inline> deals with Napoleon on Notting Hill. By his attitude last night, the Attorney-General  has earned for himself the appellation of &#34;the Napoleon of William-street.&#34; He may drive, bully, and cuff in the Law Courts, But in this Chamber he cannot drive, or bully, or coax  His  Majesty&#39;s Opposition. It is quite true that the smaller a man is physically, the more tyrannical he will become if he is, given the opportunity. We are asked to sit night and day merely in order that this political martinet shall get to clause 72 of this Bill. My great consideration is to keep sweet with the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> the bosom friend of the Attorney-General, which, in a leading article, says that it is impertinent and obstructive on our part to ask you, sir, to leave the chair, when, as a matter of fact, the motion was moved, not by a degenerate from New South Wales, &#39;but by the honorable and learned member for Corinella, and then only on an invitation given by the Chairman. Why have we been kept here all night, to the injury of our health? Simply because the Napoleon of William-street, the Attorney-General, who has the reputation of being an iron man, sought to compel the Committee to pass a certain number of clauses. </para>
