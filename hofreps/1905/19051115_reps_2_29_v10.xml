                <para>I hope that the arguments which I presented on a similar motion this morning will have some weight with Ministers and honorable members generally, though my anticipation is that Ministers will study only their own interests, and will hot concern themselves with those of Parliament or of honorable members. Since we met this afternoon, after an adjournment of an hour and a half, we have been given notice of the intention to move a new standing order to prevent the moving of motions such as that which I am now discussing, which gives me encouragement to more thoroughly debate this question, in order to place before the public the true position of affairs. </para>

                        <para>- The Government, after a sitting of twenty hours, have accomplished nothing, and had ultimately, of their own accord, to more the Chairman but of the chair. As I understand, however, that it is now the desire of the Committee to proceed with the discussion of the Bill clause by clause, I shall not proceed further. The Opposition are now anxious to proceed with business and trust that the experience of the last twenty hours will convince the Attorney -General that they are not to be dragooned or cajoled into submission. </para>

                    <para>- I think this is a convenient stage at which to raise a general debate upon the very important departure made by this Bill from the ordinary trade mark legislation of the Empire. The union label is practically American in its origin, and was first proposed, before the Alien Immigration Restriction Act came into operation there, as a means of inducing the public to buy goods made by white labour. It was subsequently diverted from that object to build up and strengthen trade unions at the expense of the other sections of the community, and as far as possible to force employers and manufacturers to comply with the demands of trade unions, irrespective of whether those demands were legitimate or otherwise. A most exhaustive inquiry has been made into the whole question. The Department of Labour of the United States, presided over by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carroll</inline> D. Wright, in one of the bi-monthly bulletins published a few years ago, gave a most exhaustive statement of the reasons urged in favour of and in opposition to the union label. He also reproduced samples of the label. </para>

                    <para>- I think that the Attorney-General should have moved at the outset the postponement of this clause, because the Bill has been recast since it came from the Senate, and even the amendments foreshadowed by the Attorney-General have been reframed. That being so, this clause, in the ordinary course of events, should be postponed until we see what will be the terminology of Part VII. The Attorney-General has for a third time recast the proposals of the Government, and' in the circumstances we do not know what will be the effect of passing this clause. The </para>

                        <para>- The honorable and learned gentleman merely said that he was willing to postpone the clause. That is not leadership. When amendments necessitate the postponement of a clause the Minister in charge of the Bill should ask for that postponement.

Each individual cigar manufacturer in America has a contract with the trade unions. Some of the conditions of that contract are decidedly interesting. One of them is that no union shall be allowed to furnish a label for cigars made in whole or in part by machinery. There we have a revival of the ancient, ignorant prejudice against machinery.

                <para class="block">Australia, there is a Labour Government in power, and in Queensland a semi-Labour Ministry hold office. Therefore, the argument in favour of the wage-elevating tendency of these labels cannot be urged in Australia, because Here conditions are insisted upon which apply alike to unionists and non-unionists. Last year, we passed an Act which was intended to regulate wages and generally to improve the conditions of labour, to employ the language of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brooks.</inline> It is sometimes claimed that the label stands for good work.

                    <para>The aim is moreover to make the label in this instance stand for excellence of workmanship, restoring something of the ideal of the craft guilds in their better days. That this has not been done more generally with the label is clearly a weakness, especially if appeal is to be made to a larger purchasing public. . . A sort of minimum quality is, however, set, as will be seen in the following extract from their constitution. which states that a label shall not be applied to cigars sold for less -than $20 a thousand, or about id. each. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brooks</inline> goes on to say : - </para>
                    <para>In the case or the hatters, it is even more difficult to trace any relation whatever between .the label and quality or improved conditions.

                <para class="block">Therefore, the use of the union label is no guarantee of excellence, of quality, or of good workmanship.

In Australia, tHe guarantee, as regards pay and labour conditions, is conferred under various Acts passed. by this Parliament, or by the States Legislatures. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brooks</inline> then proceeds to discuss the real reason for the use of these labels.

No printed matter upon this subject is so wholly frank as to the primary objects to be sought through the label. It is, of course, assumed that the mere fact of labour organization implies of itself higher wages anil better surroundings ; otherwise there is singularly little pretence that quality of work, for example, or sanitation, enters into their calculation. </para>

                <para class="block">When we recollect that some of the unions have been and are political associations, and that a bitter resistance was offered to the attempt made to divest the unions of their political character, we shall recognise the advantage of a provision which enables the union officials to enforce the payment of contributions to the party war chest. The label as used not only as an instrument of warfare, such as the strike or boycott, but also as a means by which the party funds can be kept up. It is also availed of with the object of increasing the membership of the unions and of ousting from employment men who decline to become unionists. The union label system of boycott is used directly and indirectly. ' In the first place, an agitation is set up by which it is sought to secure the sole use of goods bearing the union label, and men are urged to boycott articles which are not made by unionists. Another method employed is to insure that the label shall be used only by those manufacturers who have entered into contracts with the unions. Such contracts invariably contain a clause providing that every man employed in the factory shall be a unionist, of that the manufacturer shall dismiss any man who is not a unionist at the. request of the union officials. I would direct attention to a case which was tried before the Supreme Court Bench of Massachusetts, which the Attorney-General will agree with me is a high tribunal. </para>

A contract between Hazen B. Goodrich and Co. and said Union was executed on the tenth day of January, 1902 - a copy of which contract is on pages 20 and 21 of the bill of exceptions. This contract provided, among other things, that the firm of Hazen B. Goodrich and Co. "agrees to hire as shoe workers only members of the Boot and Shoe Workers' Union, in good standing, and further agrees not to retain any shoe worker in his (their) employment after receiving notice from the Union that such shoe worker is objectionable to the Union, either on account of his being in arrears for dues, or disobedience of the Union Rules or Laws, or from any other cause." </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I am prepared to show that it is absolutely connected, because it relates to a contract affecting the use of the union label which was entered into between the firm of boot manufacturers referred to and the secretary of the Bootworkers' Union. The clause to which I have referred contains one of the conditions with which the manufacturer had to comply in return for the right to use the union label. The consideration he was required to give for the right to use the label was an undertaking to dispense with any man that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Donovan</inline> did not like. The report proceeds - </para>

                    <para>Between the time of the execution of said contract between Hazen B.

Goodrich and Co. on several occasions, and demanded that they discharge the plaintiff from their employment because he would not join the union. </para>

                    the working boot maker, who had to earn his living by the sweat of his brow, declined, for reasons best known to himself, to become a member of the Bootworkers' Union. It is further stated -
                </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>The plaintiff's employers were satisfied with the plaintiff as a workman and as a man, and, notwithstanding the terms of the contract which they had entered into with the union, would have retained him in their employment but for the aforesaid demand of the defendant. Both the plaintiff and his employers were able and desirous of continuing the relation of employer and employe' that existed between them, but because of the defendant's demands, the said firm, on the twenty-fourth day of January,1902, discharged the plaintiff from his employment by them. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>It is further stated that at the time of his discharge <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Berry's</inline> actual earnings amounted to $17, or about£3 10s. a week. That fact in itself is sufficient to show that he was not being sweated, and that he was giving satisfaction to his employers. But the terms of the contract with the bootmakers' union were of such a character that the manufacturer could not use the union label unless he discharged any man who was not a member of the union, or whom the secretary or officials of the union did not like. That is to say, the union had every control over the employes in the factory, and could wreak their vengeance upon any workman who might incur their resentment. That is one method by which the use of the union label has been sought to be extended in the United States. </para>

                        <para>- That is my statement. I have particulars of a similar case in Hartford, Connecticut. So far as I know, this is not a reported case, but I have had forwarded to me a copy of the writ issued at the Circuit Court of Hartford, under the authority of the Chief Justice of the United States of America. This was a case in which Martin Lawlor and other members of the Bootmakers' Union were called upon to comply with the judgment which was entered against them in an action arising out of a boycott, conducted by means of the union label, against Dietrich E. Loewe and Martin Fuchs. A. verdict was given against the union as a whole, and against the members of the union, for a very large sum of money; and the plaintiffs have been endeavouring ever since to recover it. </para>

After several conferences, and in April,1901, the plaintiffs replied to the said demand of the defendants as follows : - " Firmly believing that we are acting for the best interests of our firm, for the best interests of those whom we employ, and for the best interests of Danbury, by operating an independent or open factory, we hereby notify you that we decline to have our shop unionized, and, if attacked, shall use all lawful means to protect our business interests." </para>

H. Roelofs and Co. which resulted in the surrender of Roelofs and Co., on July 15th, 1902, except that the defendants, their confederates and agents in November, 1901, caused the said American Federation of Labour to declare a boycott against any dealer or dealers who should handle the product of the plaintiffs. </para>

                <para class="block">It will thus be seen that in the first place the San Francisco Labour Council issued a circular pointing out that different firms had acted unfairly, and should not be patronised. They then published a list, setting out that the persons named therein did not work under the union labour conditions, and that, if retailers wished to secure the patronage of union men, they should sell only goods produced by union labour. The plaintiffs issued a writ, furnished security to the extent of $150, and secured a verdict, and proceedings have been going on since to collect the amount of the judgment. </para>

                        <para>- I have shown the means adopted by trade unionists in America to enforce union labour conditions. It is distinctly stipulated that an employer must dismiss a man who is a non-unionist, or is otherwise objectionable to a union. That is the direct method adopted. Then there is the indirect method of urging all sympathizers and members of unions to buy only goods bearing union labels, and of issuing a black list of firms who handle goods that are not made by unionists. If, for instance, a, well-known honorable member who carries on business not many hundred yards from this House, offered for sale any goods that were made by non-unionists an attempt would be made by means of the union label to boycott him. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Graham Brooks, the author of the excellent article to which I have referred, has absolutely proved his statement. </para>

                    <para>The growth of the union label is steady and sure. It is the backbone of some of our unions, and a great aid to* them all. Label leagues are being instituted in many places, both on local and State lines, and are doing good work. There are many more industries which can adopt union labels, and which, no doubt, will in the course of time. From reports made to headquarters during the year from the various unions, continued and increasing interest is being taken in their welfare. That all unions should boom the union label of each other is important, for to build up and strengthen any one union strengthens all others. While we may be working at different callings, our interests tire intertwined. Upon the growth and activity of unionism generally in any city depends the stability and power of the particular union in which any one of use may hold a card. Hence the importance of furthering union labels of sister unions. By helping them we help ourselves, and all help each other. </para>

                        <para>- I am referring to resolutions passed by the American Federation of Labour, which were designed to force unionists and their families to buy only union goods, and to deal with those who handle union goods alone. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brooks</inline> shows, further, that in one year over $3,000 were spent by a branch of the Cigar-makers' Union in Boston to push the union goods and to boycott those of non-union manufacture. The demand made for a union label for Australia cannot be due to a desire to improve wage conditions, because the industries to which the union label provisions of the Bill would apply in the first instance are under the control of Wages Boards or Conciliation and Arbitration Courts. The label is desired merely as a means to boycott, and to build up unions by forcing men into their ranks. It is sought as a means to drive out of employment those who will not join the unions-. The object of Part VII . is somewhat similar to that of the preference to unionists provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act; but in some respects there is a difference. With the assistance of several members of the present Government, including the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Postmaster-General, and the Vice-President of the Executive Council, honorable members now in Opposition succeeded in surrounding the provision for preference to unionists with so many safeguards that the Labour Party declared that for all practical purposes it would be a dead letter. The proposal now before us is one to secure preference to unionists by a more insidious method. It is a proposal to legalize boycotting, to put it into everyday use as an ordinary means of industrial warfare; to allow organized bodies to decry those who desire to manage their own business in a way that seems best to themselves. It is a proposal to enable the unions not only to boycott manufacturers and retailers, but to force men into their ranks whether they desire to join them or not. There are many trades in Australia which are subject to Wages Boards and Conciliation and Arbitration Courts, and it is therefore evident that the union label is to be used chiefly as an instrument of oppression. I can give local illustrations showing that the chief object of the unions is to force men into organizations of a political or semi political character. Their primary object is not to better the labour conditions of Australia, but to strengthen their fighting political bodies. I propose to refer to the position of two trades out of forty that are subject to the Victorian Factories Act. </para>

This union wrote to employers, all of whom were paying the wages fixed by the Wages Board, saying, in effect, "We intend to publish a list of those who employ only unionists, and to recommend our people to deal solely with them. If you desire our custom, you must let us include your name on the list as employers of unionists only." The inference is that, if they did not employ unionists only, their names would not appear upon the list, and the influence of the unions would be used to boycott their goods. The secretary of the Master Butchers' Association wrote a very short letter to the press in regard to this matter, in which he says - </para>

                    <para>The circular letter addressed by the Amalgamated Butchers' Union to various master butchers will explain the way in which the Trades Hall authorities are tricking shopkeepers into establishing themselves as union shops. The conditions of labour in the trade are regulated by law, and no other authority is recognised. If in any case unfair or illegal conditions are imposed there is ample remedy under the Shops and Factories Act. Further comment is unnecessary. </para>

The baking industry was one of the first brought under the operation of the Factories Act in 1896. On the 5th May last, at the Trades Hall Council, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Large,</inline> the bakers' representative, intimated that a large number of copies of a " white list," showing the bakers who adhered to union rates, had been printed, and he asked all unionists to deal only with those on the list. We can best judge of the probable effect of the legislation proposed by observing what has been its result in other countries. In the United States we know the purposes to which the union label has been put. There it has been used as a means of intimidation and boycott, to oppress people and to drive men from their employment. In the case of <inline font-style="italic">Berry</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Donovan,</inline> in which a demand was made by unionists for the dismissal of a non-unionist named Berry - a demand to which the employer yielded - judgment was given for the plaintiff, on 21st June, 1905.

                    Evidently that meets with the Attorney- General 's approval. I repeat that we can only judge of the probable effect of this legislation by its results in America. Though an attempt might not be made in Australia to deliberately force a man out of his employment, yet an indirect boycott could be produced by an effort to patronize goods made by union labour only. Unionists could abstain from dealing with those manufacturers who did not employ union labour solely. That form of boycott could, and would be, established here. It is the only method by which the use of the union label could be made general. Not even the Attorney-General will contend that the use of that label affords any guarantee of the quality of the goods. The quality of an article is determined by the material supplied by the employer.

                        <para>- No. The Factories Act affords that guarantee. The only guarantee afforded by the label is that persons who purchase goods to which it is attached will assist to build up a particular union, and to force out of employment men who may not be unionists. It is purely a coercive measure, and one which is intended for the purposes, of boycott only. That being so, I contend that it should not meet with favorable consideration at the hands of honorable members. I do not intend to discuss the constitutional aspect of" this question. I have read with great care the opinion expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. L.</inline> F. Cussen, to which I referred yesterday, to the effect that the union label proposals, are <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> of the Federal Constitution, and I think that it is a great pity that the Government should be prepared to put our manufacturers to the expense of testing the constitutionality of our legislation upon this question, instead of having the matter threshed out beforehand. The weight of constitutional testimony is against the union label provisions of the Bill, so far as the Federal authority is concerned, but there can be no doubt that the States Governments have the power to legislate in this regard if they so desire. I do not agree with many of the claims of the manufacturers of Victoria, but if they have any fighting capacity, as I believe they have, they will take early steps to test the validity of the provisions of the Bill, and I trust that they will be successful in upsetting them. I hope that every honorable member will debate this question on its merits, and that those who favour the union label clauses will endeavour to show us why we should legalize a means of boycotting manufacturers, producers, and retailers, and also why we should practically reverse the decision at which we arrived in connexion with the preference clause of the Arbitration Act. We know very well that if a change of Government had not taken place, the Treasurer, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, and probably the Postmaster-General would have been found voting against the provisions referred to, but under present conditions they have to do as they are told. </para>

They fully realize the disastrous possibilities of their action, and they wish to keep the public in ignorance. The honorable and learned member for Wannon demonstrated that a universal system of boycott had been adopted by the militant trade unions of the United States, and I should like to know for what purpose the proposed legislation is designed unless it is to extend the operation of a similar boycott to Australia. If there are any other reasons I shall be glad to hear them. Honorable members of the Labour Party sit silent and do nothing but pull the strings which 'operate Mie marionette who is working for them at the table. </para>

I commend him to follow the example which has been set him by s.o many labour men, and become a labour lawyer, to appear for his union in the Arbitration Court, and so deplete the funds of the unions. In that way he will get fat, and the unions will get thin. The honorable member for Grey says that he desires uniformity of industrial conditions, but, under the Commonwealth, the States preserve the right to deal with their own industrial conditions. He admits that we cannot, under the Constitution, pass factory laws applying to the States, but he proposes to achieve the result which he has in view by means which I can only characterize as surreptitious and dishonest. If honorable members think that the Commonwealth should interfere in the management of the internal concerns of the States, let them approach the subject openly and straightforwardly, and ask the people of Australia to alter the Constitution, so that that may be done. Until the Constitution is altered, we are bound by oath to uphold it. None of the conditions which led to the adoption of the union label in the United States of America exist in the Commonwealth to-day. We have no sweated labour which there are not properly constituted Courts to relieve, and no insanitary conditions which cannot be remedied by our factory laws.

                        <para>- I do not uphold that sort of thing. I hold that practice in such contempt that I am extremely anxious that we shall not endeavour to commit two wrongs to make a right. By way of interjection, the honorable member for Bland intimated recently that black lists at the present time are being circulated by some labour journals in Australia, so that the system to which the honorable member for Canobolas refers is not confined to the one party. But why should we legalize such a practice? Why encourage it by special legislation ? </para>

                        <para>- -I hope that the honorable member for Maranoa will show what excuse can be advanced for the action of the Government in endeavouring to legalize this unfair and hurtful procedure. The honorable and .'earned member for Corio has told us that the union label will be applied in a prominent way to all goods manufactured under union conditions. I do not think that is likely to occur. With the exception', perhaps, of some of the members of the present Government, no one would think of walking down Bourke-street with a union label printed on the back of his coat or on his waistcoat. Would the Treasurer walk one of our public thoroughfares with such a label plastered on his waistcoat? I should be glad to wear union made goods, but what honorable member would care to wear clothes to which a label was affixed in a prominent way? The idea is absurd. I do not think that the union label will be displayed in the way that some honorable members imagine. I believe that it will be just as easy to evade these provisions as, I am informed, it has been to evade the branding laws properly applied to furniture manufactured by Chinese. </para>

I shall pr»test against the passing of a surreptitious proposal. I should not haw dealt so fully with this question but for the notice given to-day of the intention of the Government to secure the passing of a standing order which will apply the gag, and render it impossible for us to adequately discuss it. The Prime Minister has but to thank himself for this. Like the Attorney-General, who refused last night to accept our offer to agree to the passing of fifty-seven clauses, with the result that he has 'gained nothing, the honorable and learned gentleman is determined that we shall not discuss this Bill, and has given notice of another proposal which will offer ample opportunity for debate. </para>

                        <para>- I suppose the honorable member is not aware that under its rules the Australian Workers' Union can exact is. per annum from each of its members - who total number from 20,000 to 22,000 - for political purposes. Upon that basis the members of the organization in question would contribute ,£1,000 every year. A further proposal, if adopted by all affiliated unions, would yield an additional £1,500 per annum, which is equivalent to a very large fighting fund for any political party. I do not know any political party in Australia which possesses funds totalling anything like that amount. Yet this Labour Party, which receives thousands of pounds annually for political purposes, has the temerity to call itself poor.

                <para>It is almost a pity for the sturdiness of the Australian union 1 abel that honorable members should seek to hedge it about with all the safeguards which are conferred by a legislative enactment. In America the thing stood upon its merits and prospered, because there was no reason why it should not do so. Here, where there is no reason why it should prosper, the Government propose to make it prosper by Act of Parliament. In America, 1 need scarcely remind honorable members, labour is very well organized. All over the country there are paid delegates, who furnish their official newspaper with the results of their labours. I propose to read a few extracts from their reports, with a view to showing that the union label is a live thing in the United States, and that it is being used to foster the system of boycott.

Under these respective headings the names of the various firms are grouped. The offence for which their goods are boycotted throughout the United States is that they do not employ unionist 1'abour exclusively. </para>

                        <para>- Does the honorable member think that I hold a brief for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walpole</inline> ? The moment that one objects to one set of extremists, he is accused of belonging to the opposite camp. Persons of ordinary balance of mind, who do not take an extreme view upon one side or the other, surely have a place in the Universe. I think that we have too much extreme opinion in Australia, and I do not stand here as the advocate of the extremists of one party or the other. I am independent. At the last general election I told the Employers' Federation! that I would no more accept their nomination than I would accept that of the Labour Party. Coming back to the black list, I find that hotels are included. </para>

                        <para>- Proof of my statement can be obtained by reference to the labour newspapers in the Library, and I challenge the honorable member to bring one into the Chamber. I find that the list to which I have referred also includes printing-houses, publications, bookbinders, and newspapers'. The boycott of certain newspapers suggests to my mind the question whether the Australian labour journals would, if they had the power, boycott all other newspapers. We know that when the Labour Party 'hold their conventions the representatives of the great daily newspapers are denied admittance. The proceedings are carried on upon Star Chamber lines, and the delegates deny the right of any newspaper, except their own official organ, to report their discussions. Would they, under a complete system of boycott such as could be introduced under the union label provisions, deny their members the right to buy any daily newspapers of which the unions did ' not approve? The honorable member for Newcastle has just handed me a newspaper, and has asked me whether I have ever seen one containing so many drink advertisements. The publication referred to is the <inline font-style="italic">Australasian Traveller,</inline> the journal of the Commercial Travellers' Association. It is perfectly natural that hotelkeepers should advertise in such a newspaper, for the reason that they largely depend on commercial travellers for their incomes. </para>

                        <para>- No, but it is almost as bad, and1 I wish the honorable member had handed me a labour paper so that I could read its liquor advertisements. I had a copy of the journal issued by the operatives employed in the Australian printing trade. Unfortunately, I cannot lay my hand upon it at the moment, and. I shall not be able to quote from it; but I may mention that the hope was expressed that no half measures would be adopted in regard to the application of the union label provisions. I shall take care that the article is referred to by some other honorable member. The black list from which I have quoted also contains the names of a number of hardware and machinery firms, which have no doubt had the temerity to give non-unionists an opportunity to earn a living. The <inline font-style="italic">American F Federationist</inline> contains a long list of firms dealing with hardware and machinery, wood, leather, and rubber, watches and jewellery, and miscellaneous goods, which have been boycotted by the aid of the union label. We do not know what offences they had committed, but they might have done anything, from employing one non-unionist amongst 10,000 hands, to sweating their employes. Then there is what is called a " fair notice," the general clearance which an employer gets after he has been whipped by the boycott. Here is one dated Washington, D.C., 2'5th June, 1902 - </para>

                    <para>- It is obvious from the statements I have read that the only crime in one case was the employment of a certain number of non-unionists, though how many is not stated. It was only when those men were driven out of employment or into unionism that the employer was declared "fair." The unionists play on the selfishness of the employers, and compel them to sacrifice the undoubted rights of the employes. I cannot congratulate them on their methods. In addition to the boycott list, there is a "fair list" in this newspaper, with which I do not propose to deal. I have here another official labour newspaper, the <inline font-style="italic">Coast Seamen's Journal -</inline> the organ of the International Seamen's Union of America. This copy is dated 5th April, 1905. It is "A journal of seamen bv seamen for seamen.". Its aim is "The brotherhood of the sea," while its motto is " Justice by organization." It has a black-list, headed, " We don't patronize " - a thoroughly understood heading, which appears above every black-list published iti the American labour papers. It means that no unionist is permitted to buy goods which are supplied by the firms named. In this newspaper the black-list fills up an entire column, and deals with every class of business, supplying every known article of human consumption or wear. On the other side of the page is a list of what are described as "fair" offices. Throughout the paper are references to the union label, and advertisers recommend nothing that does not bear that label. Buyer9 are warned to insist on getting goods marked with the label, and to take no others. It is clear from the information which I have placed before the Committee that organized boycotting is taking place in the United States, and that the main instrument of the boycott is the union label. If we pass these proposals the same system will inevitably be adopted here, and I ask honorable members to consider what that will mean to the Common- wealth. The average country storekeeper, who makes his purchases from the great business houses of the cities, does; not know, and hardly cares, whether the goods which he. stocks are made by union or non-union labour. He buys them because he thinks that they will sell well, and he tries to give the best value he can, consistent with fair profit. What would such a man do if a strong league were formed in his neighbourhood, and it were decided that only goods branded with the union label should be purchased by unionists, their wives, and children? Eventually, the storekeepers would find that if they had two articles for sale, into the composition of one of which there entered 100 per cent, of union labour, and into the composition of the other only 99 J per cent., the latter would be refused by all unionists. As the boycott spread, the political bosses would decree that no unionist must buy of any storekeeper whose store contained any article not made wholly by union labour. In Australia we use a large quantity of imported goods, and not even so energetic a prohibitionist as the Attorney-General!) would assert that all the requirements of Australia could be made locally. But under the boycott they would have to be made locally, not by our manhood and womanhood, but by that small section which belongs to unions. The union label could not be applied to goods which are not made in Australia. Thus prejudice would be created against those goods, and they would be shut out from this market. It means that we shall have, within a brief period, to endeavour to make in Australia all the goods that we now import, and import because it pays us to do so. I am not dealing with this phase of the question from the fiscal stand-point. All parties must recognise that if we are suddenly to completely stop our import trade, the cost to the consumer must be enormously increased. In many cases, it would be equivalent to an import duty of from 80 per cent, to 90 per cent. As far as clothing is concerned, fit would be tantamount to the imposition of an additional tax of from 10 per cent, to 15 per cent, om the people of Australia. The passing of the union label provisions of the Bill must inevitably have the effect of immensely' increasing to' the consumer the cost of food and clothing, and that being so, I think it is extraordinary that the Attorney-General cannot see his way to at once withdraw them. The matter is one which should be very seriously considered before it is persisted in, and the Attorney-General might well allow it to remain in abeyance until next session. I wish to ask the honorable and learned gentleman whether it would be legal to embody the trade union label provisions of the Bill in a separate measure? </para>

                        <para>- I hold that it is wrong to include union label provisions in a Bill relating to trade marks. If the Minister were to separate the two proposals, we should be able to address ourselves shortly and sharply to the questions at issue ; we should have a chance to differentiate between that which we desire to fight and that which we do not wish to oppose. The delay that has taken place in the consideration of this measure has been due as much to the fact that it deals with two different questions as to the want of tact displayed bv the Attorney-General. Another point to which I desire to refer is that, on glancing at the amendments which have been circulated, one cannot help being struck by the fact that some of them are similar to amendments circulated in connexion with the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. That necessarily brings the controversial characteristics of the two propositions into something like harmony. In my opinion, there is a similarity between the two measures. It is because certain provisions were inserted in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act that the proposals in reference to the union label have been submitted to this House. As honorable members are aware, 'certain safeguards were included in that measure with the object of preventing members of trades unions, whose funds were devoted to political purposes, from enjoying a preference over non. unionists. It was only after those provisions had been carried that these union label proposals were first heard of. The Trade Marks Bill was introduced by the Watson Government. Its members did not think it necessary to include in that Bill ' any proposals in reference to the use of union labels. But as soon as it became clear that the political organizations of the Labour Party would not benefit one iota from the passing of the Arbitration Act, owing to the insertion of the safeguards just referred to, one of its members proposed that the ' union label principle should be embodied in this Bill. Tt was inserted in the measure only a day before the Watson Government resigned from office. To me, it is quite evident that the insertion of certain political safeguards in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill is very closely connected with the sudden appearance of the union label provisions. That is a point which I hope will "be made abundantly clear before this discussion is concluded. I can quite understand the Government suggesting the use of the " gag " to prevent us from discussing such a miserable conspiracy. </para>

I hope that on the present occasion the same determination will be exhibited by the Opposition to make the meaning of this legislation perfectly clear.

The Government consists of gentlemen who entertain different views upon this question. For instance, there is the Attorney-General, who is always in his element in preparing political bridges for his friends. Although he has built a bridge to office, I do not envy him his position. At the present time, there are three members of the Government in the Chamber who voted in favour of the Labour Party's conspiracy upon the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. </para>

                        <para>- In these union label proposals a principle is involved which, in my opinion, constitutes an additional reason why "the Government should abandon them. The Bill contains a clause which sets out that a registrable trade mark shall not contain certain things. The use of the word " Royal," or of the Royal Arms is prohibited. </para>

                        <para>- Perhaps I was not discreet in mentioning any particular clause. I should have referred to the principle embodied in one part of the Bill, and not in the other. The matter to which I have referred is well worthy of the attention of the Attorney-General, who would do well if he gave his consideration to it, instead of lecturing honorable members. In conclusion, I desire to point out that the people of Australia are looking forward anxiously to the decision of the Committee. Protests against the union label provisions have been received from persons engaged in all branches of trade in all parts of the Commonwealth. There has been no call for such legislation. Upon the one hand we have had emphatic protests against the proposal, and upon the other hand absolute silence. No honorable member can say that he was sent here to support the union label provisions. Even the Labour Party have never included in its platform any such proposals. The Attorney-General has received no mandate from his constituents in favour of the legislation now proposed. This is one of the most controversial measures that has yet been presented to Parliament, and I can only once more express the hope that the Government will refrain from any attempt to gag the Committee or to prevent honorable members from expressing, in the most complete way. the reasons for their objections to provisions which should never have been included in this Bill. </para>

                        <para>- It is- not worthy of the Attorney-General - or it is worthy of him, according to the way in which his conduct is viewed - to attempt to deceive the public as to the true nature of the provisions made for' the use of trade union labels. He knows full Swell that the articles to which trade union labels are to be affixed will not be the property of the unions, whereas those who register trade marks must have a proprietary interest in the goods to which they are to be attached. It has been urged that we are refusing to extend to unionists the same rights that we would! grant to corporations or individual traders ; but we are not doing anything of the kind. If union workmen care to work upon co-operative lines and manufacture goods for themselves, they will be entitled, to register any trade mark that will comply with the conditions of the Bill. The union label provisions of Part VI L are altogether foreign to a Trade Marks Bill. This measure which, without the trade union label clauses, might be of great use to the community, is being employed merely as a means for giving effect to those provisions. I join issue with those who say that the application of a union label' to goods is a guarantee of their quality. It is no guarantee, and the labels are not intended to be used1 to insure good quality. Honorable members who belong to unions, or who believe strongly in unionism, contend that the statement that an article has been made by unionists is equivalent to the statement that it has been made by good workmen. But outside of unions, there are workmen as good as any unionists, and I am not sure that, man for man, the workmen outside unions will not be found better than the unionists. </para>

                        <para>- How can I discuss the amendment, if I am to be precluded from dealing with the object of providing in the Bill for trade union labels? I say that such labels will not guarantee the quality of the goods to which they are attached. If that remark is not in order, I should like to know how I can discuss the amendment? There are good men outside unions, and often men who are not unionists are better than those who are. If we are going to adopt the trade union label principle, we should provide for it by a separate Bill. It has been suggested that the unions occupy the place which, was formerly occupied by the trade guilds; but in olden days, before a man could become a member of a guild, he had to prove himself a good workman, and hence the fact that work had been done by a member of a guild, was a guarantee of its excellence. The object of the trade union label, however, is, not to guarantee the quality of the goods to which it is attached, but to provide a means of forcing men into unions against their will. Whilst this may be necessary in America, though I doubt if it is, it is unnecessary in Australia. In New South Wales and Western Australia we have Arbitration Courts, and in Victoria, Wages Boards, to provide fair conditions of labour and just rates of wages, with the Commonwealth Arbitration Court as an additional safeguard. Therefore, the union label1 is altogether unnecessary. The real object of the label is to provide a means of establishing a boycott which will force non-unionists into unions, which I look upon as un-British. It is extraordinary that, whilst in Russia the working classes are striving to escape from bureaucratic tyranny, in Australia, the Labour Party, and those whom they are supporting, are seeking to deprive the workers of their freedom, and to compel them to do what they do not wish to do. I shall resist such attempts with all the strength I possess. When the Arbitration Bill was before us, "honorable members on this side inserted in it provisions to protect non-unionists from injury by it. No legislation should be passed by this Parliament injuring any section of the community, and, certainly, the majority should not be made to suffer for the good of the minority. We, who object to the trade union labels, are charged with desiring to see goods sold under fraudulent descriptions ; but that is not our desire. We hold that goods should be placed on the market under true descriptions, and there can be no better guarantee of the quality of an article than the name of the maker on its label, because if its quality is not good, he will be the first to suffer. But certain men, belonging to unions, are doing all they can to increase the membership of these bodies, perhaps in the interests of the workers at large, though, I think, chiefly in their own interests, in order to gain larger support. If a man refuses to become a member of a union why should he, or the goods which he produces, be boycotted? Why should the public be prevented in this way from purchasing his goods? On what ground should we be justified in passing legislation that would make it difficult for men to secure employment? I feel strongly upon this question, and will do my best to prevent the passing of such legislation. But for the union label provisions this measure would have been passed before now. Sheafs of amendments have, been circulated by the Attorney-General, and these serve to indicate that he is not satisfied in his own mind as to the possible effect of the union label proposal. The statements made in Committee this afternoon, in regard to the effect of the union label in the United States, have been challenged. It is easy for one to challenge a statement with which he does not agree, but we know that by means of the union label great injury has been done to many people in the United States. After a perusal of the <inline font-style="italic">Journal of the Federation of Labour</inline> - the largest labour federation, I believe, in the world - one is forced to the conclusion that the boycott effected by means of the union label in the United States is very severe. We read of men having been ruined because of their refusal to employ unionists, or to place a union label upon their goods. The improvements which have been made during the last fifty years in the conditions of labour halve been secured, not by the passing of restrictive measures, but by the development of freedom in every direction. </para>

The Labour Party do not intend that these provisions, if passed, shall remain a dead letter. They will counsel the unionists to take advantage of them to increase the membership of their organizations.

                        <para>- I should not. The interjection of the honorable member shows that if there were only a few unionists in the electorates represented by the members of the Labour Party, they would not desire these clauses to be passed. Their anxiety in regard to these provisions is due to the fact that there is a large number of unionists among their constituents. </para>

                </continue><para>That is why they are prepared to accept proposals which they themselves believe to be wrong. I have had' the courage to tell the unionists what I believe is best for them ; I have not advised them that such proposals as these will be of any service to them. I have said, and still say, that we find in the unions men who are as good as are those outside their ranks; but I will not admit that unionists are better than non-unionists. I object to coercive measures. I wish to give every man the fullest liberty. Let every man have the right to put a trade mark upon his own goods, but do not let us pass a law which, by means of outside pressure, will force men to place labels on their goods which they do not desire to use. We believe that it would be wrong to compel men by law to use such labels, and yet it is proposed to place in- the hands of one section of the community an instrument that will enable them to force manufacturers anti others to follow a course which they would not otherwise pursue. I am against trade union labels in even' shape and form. </para></speech>

                    <para>- In view of what has gone before, I do not feel that I should unduly prolong my remarks, but I should like to make a few observations at this stage regarding the proposals now before the Committee. My first observation is that it is strange to find that the Labour Party now consider this question one of urgency. One looks in vain for any mention of union label proposals in their political programme. They certainly find no place in their State or Federal platforms. When those programmes were framed, the question was either one of which they had not the slightest knowledge, or for which they bad the most supreme contempt. They did not take the trouble to place it on their programme or to discuss it at any of their conferences. </para>

                        <para>- I am quite aware of that. Only those which are considered to be of a more urgent and important character are incorporated in that programme. At that time, therefore, the party regarded the proposed union label. as one of the flotsam and jetsam- of their political doings. They did not consider it entitled to a place in their programme of legislative action. It is well known that the party divide their programme into two parts. They have what is known as their fighting platform, and their general platform, but in neither of these did the union label find a place. I am glad to see you, sir, again in the chair. During the past twenty-four hours we have scarcely known who has been our Chairman. The occupants of that office have glided in and out of the chair, after giving the most diverse and contradictory rulings, and we have seen their faces no more. I am glad indeed to get back to our old authority and our old Chairman. Coming to a later period, we all remember that some time ago a Commonwealth Labour Government came into power. During the tenure of their office, did anybody hear of a proposal such as this? Did anybody hear any mention of trade union labels? </para>

                        <para>- Was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> a member of the Government? I am speaking of the Watson Administration, and I say that they did not include in their programme any proposal in reference to the use of the union label. They took no action to give legislative effect to it. Evidently at that time they regarded other matters as of greater importance. This question has now become suddenly urgent. Why ? Certainly it is not because of any popular demand for it. No petitions have been presented to the House claiming that the use of the union label should be sanctioned either as a right or as a privilege. Consequently, we have to look underneath these proposals to ascertain their true inwardness, and to realize why they have so suddenly become urgent. They were not included in the programme of trie Labour Government some months ago; neither did they find a place in the programme of the Deakin Government. The honorable and learned member for Ballarat had no time for this subject at the last general election, when he announced so confidently, and with so much brilliancy, his urgent measures of practical reform, including his preferential trade * proposals, most of which have suddenly been relegated1 to the parliamentary dust-heap. Immediately he came into office, and was afforded an opportunity to give legislative effect to his pre-sessional programme, he found every excuse for relegating the measures he had outlined to the lumber room where Ministers heap up their musty tomes. But at the elections preferential trade was his great rallying-cry, and it altogether precluded the possibility of considering such matters as trade union labels. One looks in vain for the slightest pretence of authority or of justification for these proposals, particularly when an urgent and practical programme is awaiting attention at tha hands of this House. The honorable member for Bland has reiterated a remark which I venture to say is as specious an observation as has ever been made by him or by any other honorable member. He claims that the innocent function of these proposals is to prevent fraud, and he characterizes as pirates and the friends of fraud all and sundry who oppose this ' Bill. </para>

I am referring not merely to the remarks made by the honorable member for Bland in this House, but to numberless utterances of his outside - to criticisms of myself, for example. He declares that the object of these provisions is to prevent fraud - to prevent the pirating of something which presumably belongs to the trade unions. Before there can be any piracy, I maintain that there must be some kind of ownership. Does the honorable member surest that the same kind of ownership attaches to a trade union label as exists in connexion with a trade mark? </para>

                        <para>- To my mind, the distinction is very clear. Provision is made in the Copyright Bill that when an artist has painted a picture and is paid for his work, his ownership in that picture absolutely ceases. The work becomes the property of the individual who has purchased it. Clearly that is what happens in respect of the employment of union labour. When that labour has been paid for, it becomes absolutely the property of the employer. The employe has no longer any interest in the goods which he has produced. How, then, can it be urged that there is any fraud or piracy in respect of goods which a man does not own ? I refer to this matter merely to brush aside the cobweb which the honorable member for Bland is seeking to wrap around these proposals. May I suggest to him that he and his party occupy a very peculiar position in regard to this Bill ? A number of new clauses have been brought down by the Attorney-General, and we have the assurance of the honorable member for Bland that he has had nothing whatever to do with them. Is it accidental that they are so favorable to the honorable member and the whole of his party that they can be given an unqualified and silent support? </para>

                        <para>- Does the honorable member suggest that we can discuss this matter as freely upon a single clause as can be done in the course of a general debate? The Attorney-General has submitted thirty-three new clauses, and about sixty-two sub-clauses. He has tacked them on to another Bill, to the purposes of which they are absolutely foreign. </para>

                        <para>- Asa matter of personal explanation, I wish to say that this afternoon I distinctly stated that I desired to postpone this portion of the Bill, so that when the other clauses were reached we might have a general debate upon them. When the honorable and learned member for Wannon was speaking, I pointed out that it would be very inconvenient to discuss this question upon my amendment for the excision of two words, and that I should not attempt to debate it until we reached Part VII. of the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- By way of personal explanation, I wish also to sav it is quite true that the Attorney-General intimated his desire that honorable members should discuss this question upon Part VII. of the Bill. But he omitted to inform the Committee of the reason why I refused to follow that course, namely, that if the new standing order framed by the Government were boought into operation before we reached Part VII. of the Bill, honorable members upon this side of the House would ha.ve no opportunity of discussing the union label provisions. The standing order in question is intended to suppress debate. </para>

                        <para>- I regret to halve to speak so strongly but I must say that the action of the Attorney-General in bluffing, and twisting and contorting everything he touches is enough to provoke stronger language still. It was distinctly understood last night that we were to discuss the union label proposals generally, when clause 3 was under consideration. The Attorney-General himself distinctly stated across the table that he desired to postpone the clause, so that we might have a general debate upon it.. </para>

                        <para>- I shall urge, before I sit down, that the proposed amendment in this clause should not be agreed to, for the simple reason that the proposals to which it relates ought not to receive the sanction of the Committee. I wish to take a cursory glance at some of the amendments brought before us by the Attorney-General, as to which it was arranged last night that there should be a general debate at this stage. My position with regard to the union label provisions is simply this: I have all my life had a deep sympathy with trades organizatons. I would not willingly do anything that I thought would be detrimental to them. I would not weaken their natural and legitimate force, prestige, or, influence one iota. But the more I study these proposals, the more I am convinced that they would aim a blow at the genuine trade unionism of Australia, and therefore I oppose them. </para>

                        <para>- I know nothing about the Employers' Federation. I should think the Employers' Federation, as well as the Employes Federation, might very well oppose proposals of this kind, seeing that they can produce no good to either of them, but will inevitably create external friction in the ranks of both parties. They must create strife. They are intended to be used for the purpose of coercing men into joining the labour organization. I do not think any honorable member can dispute that. The union; labels will be used for the purpose of increasing the membership of the unions. The moment such political means are employed to bolster up the unions, a blow will be struck ' at the <inline font-style="italic">rationale</inline> of trade unionism, as we have understood it for years past. Honorable members who profess to know exactly how the union label provisions will operate will not help us with even so much as a sentence. </para>

                        <para>- This is the point at which the honorable member should give us the benefit of his wise counsels. He has always been a good, loyal trade unionist, and I shall be very glad to hear how he expects the union label provisions to operate in favour of unionism. I admit frankly that the trade organizations are for the most part in favour of the provisions for trade union labels, but I back my judgment against theirs. I may be wrong, but until it can be shown that I am wrong I prefer to exercise my own discretion. As far as I can see, these provisions can result only in the development of class hatred, of which we have already had enough in Australia. Strangely, enough, the keenest class hatred has 'been developed in -those countries where union labels have been used. If any one desires to see this feeling developed to perfection, he will find it in the United States, and, in proportion as union labels are used for coercive purposes by trade organizations, so bitterness and class hatred will be engendered. I think that that is an incontestable fact, and. I challenge proof to the contrary. Good feeling cannot exist between employers and employes so long as tyranny is exercised by either side. I have fought many battles against capitalistic tyranny, but I have not the slightest intension to escape from that tyranny by setting up another kind of class tyranny. </para>

It is intended to confer ownership upon those who register a union trade mark. But there can be no ownership in the results of labour which has been paid for, which pass out of the control and possession of the labourer into the control and possession of the employer. Therefore there can be no fraud, such as has been alluded to by the honorable member for Bland. These trade union marks are so radically different from trade marks that the provisions dealing with them ought not to find a place in the Bill. The Attorney-General also provides for the registration of two Government brands, which, I think, can be termed trade union labels only by a stretch of the imagination. These are a brand which the Government may put on the goods of a corporation which they have examined, tested, and standardized, and a Commonwealth brand which is to indicate that the goods, to which it is applied have been manufactured in accordance with the social conditions of the Commonwealth as a whole. </para><continue>

Part VII., to which it relates, deals with the union label, and the amendment now before the Chair has been moved so that that division may correctly describe the clauses coming within it. I am pointing out that the proposed new clauses contain something totally foreign to, the Bill, and that they should not find a place in it. </para>

                        <para>- I merely wish to refer to the amendments which have been circulated in order to give point to my argument that that now before the Chair should not be made. The Attorney-General's proposals are entirely new. They provide for at least two Government brands and three trade union labels. Then there is to be a Commonwealth trade mark. The provision in regard to the latter gives a very important indication of something which should be fatal to the union label proposals. Sub-clause 2 of proposed new clause 78? provides that before the Commonwealth trade mark can be applied to goods, a resolution shall be passed by both Houses - </para>

                </quote><para class="block">I venture to say that that clause shows the absolute non-necessity for a trade union label in Australia. A trade union label cannot be affixed to goods until there has been placed upon them a Government brand as to wages, conditions, and everything else that indicates the social status of the work, in accordance with the decision of the industrial Courts of the country. Whatever excuse there may be for trade , union labels in the United States, there clearly can be none in Australia, since we are already doing this work, and doing it in an infinitely better way, by means of the various industrial Courts that have been set up. In Victoria there are Wages Boards; in New South Wales and in Western Australia, compulsory arbitration prevails; whilst in South Australia a Conciliation Court has been set up, although I believe that, for some reason or other, it has never been availed of. We have thus a. chain of industrial Courts extending over Australia, and the Commonwealth trade mark cannot be affixed to goods unless those tribunals have previously declared what the social status of the work associated with them is to be. Why do we need to duplicate this machinery ? Whatever excuse there may be for a . union label in the United States, where fierce individualism is the order of the day - where the people do not believe in compulsory arbitration - there is no necessity for it here, where the conditions of the workers are arbitrarilyy v fixed by governmental machinery. That is another reason why the union label provisions of the Bill should not be passed. I do not find much trace of brotherhood in these proposals. The proposed new clause78e provides that unions, as distinct from each other, may own these labels. Notwithstanding that the labour conditions in relation to two unions and the social status of the workers in those unions may be similar, only one of those unions, and that the one which happens to get in first, may possess a trade union label. </para><interjection>

One may assign his trade mark to the other; but a union cannot assign its union label to another organization, notwithstanding that the labour con-' ditions and the social status of the workers in both unions may be the same. </para>

                        <para>- Our Standing Orders provide that honorable members shall not be guilty of tedious repetition, and those who transgress that rule must suffer the penalty. I think that honorable members would assist me by refraining from interjections, which probably lead the honorable member to deal with matters which he would not otherwise discuss. I must ask the honorable member once more not to discuss amendments that are not before the Chair. </para>

                        <para>- I have no desire, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> but to deal with the matter fairly, and keep within the scope of your ruling. I shall make only one other remark as to the schedule of amendments that has been circulated by the Attorney-General. Two of the proposed new clauses appear to have a , distinct fiscal bearing, although, in my judgment, they should have no such colouring. For instance, it is provided that goods bearing a label which is anything like a colourable imitation of any Australian label shall not be imported from abroad. What is more natural than for a trade organization in Canada - a place within the Empire, and one with which we are seeking to cultivate closer relations - to have a label of its own, which may contain some of the colours that are employed in labels in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member will find many instances in which it has been held that trade marks have been infringed, even because of the colours which they contained. In that case, there could be no free intercourse between one part of the Empire and another, so far as the products of labour are concerned. I have now! said nearly all that I wished to say, but not with that detail which I anticipated in the light of_ the clear understanding with the Attorney-General, which was arrived at last night. The honorable and learned gentleman has receded from his attitude of last evening. He asserts that since then things have altered in his favour. He declares that he has spiked our guns, turned our flank, and done all sorts' of things. Seeing that he is so strong, surely he might, at least, be merciful. However, he is exacting his pound of flesh. I hope that it will do him good, but I do not think that! it will. My experience is that a Minister in charge of a Bill never gains anything by the adoption of the course which is being followed by the Attorney-General. This Chamber is not a law court, as the honorable and learned gentleman will find before this Bill is passed. I suggest that he should' not import into this House the practices of a 'cute police-court lawyer. I do not suggest that he is merely that - he is something very much more. At the same time, he possesses that 'cuteness which" would make him an equally good police court lawyer, and it is of the .exercise of those qualities in this House that I complain. He has deliberately gone back upon the understanding that he arrived at with me last night, and by so doing has prevented me from discussing this question in detail. </para>

                    <para>- I cannot understand the anxiety of two or three members of the Opposition. They pretend that in connexion with this proposal there has been something approaching a conspiracy of silence on the part of honorable members upon this side of the House. Under the circumstances, it is perhaps well to recall the stages through which this measure has passed. Upon the second reading of the Bill, I spoke at some length, and in the course of my remarks I dealt with quite a number of the arguments which the deputy leader of the Opposition has seen fit to reproduce this evening. Since that time what has occurred? The consideration of the Bill was not resumed until yesterday, and the only stage at which it was possible to debate this general question was upon the motion, that the Chairman should leave the chair. Those of us who are not concerned in retarding legislation - who are anxious that some work should be performed by the Parliament - would have been in the highest degree foolish if we had joined in the discussion of the " stone-walling " motion which was submitted' yesterday. As members of the Opposition are aware, there will be an opportunity to discuss the union label provisions of the Bill when the clauses embodying them are reached. When we come fo Part VII. of the measure, the whole policy and the details contained in the proposal for the registration and protection of trade union marks can be discussed upon the first clause. Consequently, it is mere; pretence of the shallowest character for honorable members opposite to declare that if the present debate had not taken place, they, would have been precluded from considering the general principle involved. </para>

At that gathering a proposal in favour of the adoption of the union label was carried. At a conference of the Political Labour Party which was held some three years asp a similar proposition was carried. </para>

                        <para>- I was under the impression that it was not necessary ro enact special legislation, because the protection of the State would be extended to the body which possessed a trade union label, or a trade union mark, equally with the owner of a trade mark as we ordinarily understand the term. It was only recently that I found there was a large volume of opinion as to the improbability, under existing laws, of successful registration, and consequent protection, being secured for union labels. The deputy leader of the Opposition failed to see the benefit that would accrue to any union from the recognition of a trade mark. I do not know that that is the only aspect of the question that we should regard. </para>

                        <para>- With all deference to the honorable member's opinion, [ do not agree with him. We have a right to follow the lines of justice and equity irrespective of who is likely to benefit by our action. But, assuming that the honorable member's contention is correct, I say that, to a trade union whose members are determined to give the public good workmanship, and who are at the same time willing to be guided by reason and justice in the exercise of the right to use a union label, nothing but good can result. As soon as the public have an opportunity to identify the products with which the union is associated, so soon will they begin to inquire for such goods, in the knowledge that they are made under fair conditions, that they are produced by good workmen, and that they can therefore be safely purchased. </para>

                        <para>- I am not going to make any wild assertions to the effect that in every case benefit will accrue to the union. There will be found amongst trade unionists, as amongst other classes of the community, certain men who are inclined to overstep proper bounds, and who will possibly alienate public sympathy in connexion with the label with which they are associated. But in the great majority of cases - where a reasonable degree of judgment and discretion are exercised as to the conditions and terms of employment - the products put forward by members of unions in conjunction with their employers will meet with public appreciation, and the existence of the label cannot fail to be of immense advantage. </para>

                        <para>- On the other hand, good cloth badly made up may be of little value. The honorable member knows very well that, as a rule, the best men get the best work to do. In fact, there is a kind of natural affinity between the skilled1 workman and high quality goods. I do not ground my support of the trade union label proposal upon the benefit that is likely to accrue to the unionists concerned. With me it is not' a matter, so far as the action of the State is concerned', as to whether individuals or unionists are to receive any particular benefit from the operation of the law. What justification would there be for our passing a Trade Marks Bill at all, if the only object were to benefit those who registered trade marks? The very existence of a Trade Marks Bill is a recognition of the fact that something of the kind is necessary to protect the public against fraud. The community realize the advantage to be gained by recognising property in signs, symbols, and brands known as trade marks. My support of the trade union labels is based upon my belief that general benefit must result if the public are enabled to readily identify goods manufactured by any particular individual," whether a® an employer or employe". </para>

                        <para>- I "do not think that is likely to happen very often. The attachment of a trade mark does not afford any guarantee as to the value of a commodity, but it assists the public to recognise the products of manufacturers who put a fair quality of goods upon the market. That is the theoretic principle underlying the provision for the registration of trade marks. I wish to emphasize the point that it is essential that we should render the same treatment to those members of the community who happen to be trade unionists that we extend to those who are not unionists. </para>

                        <para>- At present, the man who counterfeits a bank-note is punished. The forger is put in gaol. 'If a man counterfeits a trade mark or label of an individual employer he is properly liable to punishment for pretending to the public that that which he puts on the market is something other than it really is. He is perhaps not liable to be sent to gaol, but is open to be mulcted in heavy damages. Now, those who oppose us on this question advance the extraordinary argument that if a man counterfeit a label belonging to a trade union - something which is in existence as the result of their own skill ; something which they have designed, and which has become their property by right of user -not a finger should be stirred to punish the fraud. </para>

                        <para>- That is what has been said by . honorable members who claim to be opposing class legislation. That is what honorable members have referred to when they have said : " We are not a class Legislature. We believe in treating every member of the community in a like manner and putting all on an equal footing." The honorable member for Parramatta, with his usual ingenuity, attempted to drag a red herring across the trail. He said that I had tried to put cobwebs round this particular question. Let us examine the case which he put to honorable members a few minutes ago. He said that a man who painted a picture and sold it to a customer ceased to have any proprietary interest in it; and that, similarly, if an ordinary trade unionist sold his labour to his employer he would have no further interest in the product of his work. That is one of those truisms from which no one can dissent. But how can it be held to meet the position which I take up? I did not say that a man should continue to have a proprietary interest in the" product of his labour after he has been paid for his work. My contention was something quite distinct from that. I said that if workmen, as individuals, or associated in unions, created something apart from their labour by the adoption of a sign, symbol, brand, or special design, they should be protected. At present, the common law permits of the adoption and use of a design, but so far as I know it affords no remedy against those who may infringe it. </para>

                <para>Mr.WATSON.- That is another point. I contend that the honorable member for Parramatta is deliberately evading the question at issue, when he says that a man having sold his labour has no further interest, or part in it, and, therefore, cannot appear before the public as the owner, and register a trade mark. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member has been such a short time in life, and such a much shorter time in Australia, that he has not that practical' acquaintance with affairs which other honorable members possess, and consequently frequently amuses us with displays of economic ignorance. If honorable members are prepared to protect the owner of a union trade mark or label, they should indicate how they are prepared to do so. If, as the honorable and learned member for Wannon says, redress for the infringement of such a label is obtainable at present, what is the cause of the agitation against the Bill ? What does the measure propose to do? It proposes to allow the registration of union trade marks. The mere registration is in itself of no advantage. It cannot be that to which objection is taken. But the effect of registration will be to provide an economical and speedy means of redress against, not the infringement of the right of a union to put goods on the market, or of an employer to put goods on the market, but the use of a colorable imitation of a registered label. </para>

                        <para>- Under the circumstances, I take a pride in making the statement. The members of the union to which I belonged found it necessary <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> boycott certain persons who were sweating their employes, and competing unjustly against fair employers. I was not at the time working for any of those affected. I was in a newspaper office, and it was only in jobbing offices that sweating occurred. What other weapon had the members of the union against the sweating and improper employment of children which was then taking place in such offices? There was no Arbitration Court in existence no wages board, and no legal means of remedying the evils to which I have alluded. The only method of obtaining compliance with a fair standard of living and' wages, and of seeing that justice was done to fair employers, was to compel those who patronized these establishments to insist on compliance with fair conditions. In England a vast Anglican Church organization is at the present time engaged in a boycott of goods made by sweated labour. </para>

                        <para>- I am replying to the argument of the honorable member for Corangamite. I honour those in the church and in society, who feel it their duty to inquire as to the conditions under which are produced the goods which they buy. The principle of boycotting is already approved by the good sense of the community, where sufficient reason is shown. During the last month or two, while the Bill has been laid aside, awaiting the public discussion of the clauses, it has been subjected to a tirade of abuse throughout Australia, because of the motives which are said to underlie these provisions, and because of what has been, said to be the effect of the union label in America. In the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> some little time ago appeared a collection of decisions by some of the State Courts of the United States of America, and at least one letter, and probably a number, appeared over the signature of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walpole,</inline> the secretary of the Employers' Federation. </para>

                        <para>- In the communications to which I refer, a number of American decisions were quoted in regard to the use of the union label for boycotting. I should like to say, however, that there is no necessary connexion between the use of the union label and boycotting. If unionists are suffering an injustice, and are strong enough, they will use the weapon of the boycott, whether they have the union label or not. That is only human nature, </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member evidently wishes me to pretend that the trade unionists of America are akin to an archangel, and never do anything wrong. We know that every class of the community acts unjustly occasionally. When the coal miners, of Lithgow returned the honorable member to Parliament, they showed a strange mental aberration. Such exceptions, however, only prove the general rule. The honorable member for Wentworth last night showed his disingenuousness by reading a number of reports from union organizers, in -which the trade union label and the need for popularizing it, and the boycotts of the <inline font-style="italic">American Federationst,</inline> were dealt -with. By artfully joining "together those portions of the reports in which the two subjects were referred to, the honorable member strove to create the idea in the public mind that it was admitted in them that the union label is being used as an instrument for boycotting. I defy him, however, to cite a. passage in any of the reports which would justify any such assumption to any fair-minded man. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that one has a . certain freedom of action when in Opposition which is rather congenial ; but we cannot all live the ideal life. In regard to the statements made by the Employers' Federation, and the articles which have appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus,</inline> a number of decisions of the States Courts of the United States - tribunals which are not to be confused with the Federal Courts - were quoted, ostensibly as bearing upon the legality of the trade union label. But, viewing them as a layman, it seems to me that in ..nearly every instance those decisions have nothing whatever to do with the union label <inline font-style="italic">-per se.</inline> In nearly every case the question for decision was whether or not a municipal council was entitled under the law to insist, as a condition antecedent to the acceptance of certain supplies, that they should bear the union label. That is -quite a different question from that of whether or not a union label is in itself legal. A union label might be amply justified, and yet it might be illegal for a municipal council to say that it should be applied to all goods supplied for its various services. In these circumstances, it will be recognised that an importance has been attached to that aspect of the question that it does not deserve. An effort has been made to produce in the minds of casual readers the impression that these decisions against the application of the union label in the way I have described affected the validity of the label itself, and consequently vitiated any suggestion for its legal adoption. The honorable and learned member for Wannon, by way of interjection, said a little while ago that, in his opinion - and as he is a member of the legal profession- 1 pay some' deference to his opinion on points of this kind - not only was there a proprietary right in a trade union label existing in common law, quite apart from any specific legislation on the subject, but that a remedy would lie at common law against any infringement of that right. As a layman, I am inclined to believe from what <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> have read of the law and history of trade marks, that that is quite possible. But, after all, it is only a question of which road should be taken in order to approach a certain goal, and the honorable and learned member may very well consider in that contingency the advisableness of affording those who have designed, or are about to design, trade marks, a speedy and economical means of redress, in the shape of the provision relating to workers' trade marks. </para>

                        <para>- I have read a good many of the decisions bearing upon this Question. I have not been able to find any decision of the Federal Court ; but there seems to be a difference of opinion on the part of the various States Courts of the United States upon the question of whether or not a trade union label is properly a trade mark. Speaking with the diffidence of a layman, it seems to me that the term "trade mark," in its ancient significance, must be held to include any sign, symbol, or brand attached to goods the subject of trade. I fail to see how any mark which is used in trade can be held to be other than a trade mark within the meaning of the Constitution. Coming to an objection raised by the honorable member for Parramatta to the Government proposition, I propose to quote a decision given by the State Court of New York in 1888. As I have said, I can find no Federal decision. </para>

I propose to make one other quotation, as. it seems to me to be necessary to place it on record, in view of what has been said in opposition to this proposal. In the case of <inline font-style="italic">Hetterman Bros, and Co. versus Powers</inline> dealt with in the State Court of Kentucky in 1897, Justice Hazelrigg said: - </para>

                    <para>Moreover, it is urged that the plaintiffs do not come into court with clean hands. . . that the label (of the Cigar-makers' International Union) itself cannot be approved either in law or morals as it denounces cigars other than union-made ones as inferior and unwholesome, and the product of filthy tenement houses, or made by coolies and convicts. And first we may admit that the label is not used as a trade-mark in the ordinary sense of that word. </para>

                    <para>It is not a brand put on the goods of the owner to separate or distinguish them from the goods of others, but we cannot agree on that account that it does not represent a valuable right which may be the subject of legal protection. Why may not those engaged in skilful employment so designate the result of their labour as to entitle them to the fruits of their skill, where it is admittedly a source of pecuniary profit to them? And this though they may not own the property itself? They are not, it is true, "in business" for themselves in the ordinary sense, but they have property rights nevertheless. They may not select a label and be protected in its use apart from its connexion with some commodity, but they not only select it in this instance - they apply it to the property, and it does not at all matter that the tangible property is that of another. . . . The man who is employed for wages is as much a business man as his employer in that larger sense in which the word " business" has come to be used by statesmen and legislators. . . .

                <para>I may say, by the way, that this, was an appeal case - in an exhaustive opinion, reviewing all the authorities, among other things said, and we can say it no more clearly: - "Hence it is indisputable that the employe, whose skilled labour in the production of a particular commodity creates a demand for the same that secures for him higher remunerative wages, has as definite a property right to the exclusive use of a particular label, sign, symbol, brand, or device adopted by him to distinguish and characterize said commodity as the product of his skilled labour, as the merchant or owner has to the exclusive use of his adopted trade-mark on his goods." </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Lang must recollect that there is no Judge who' can be relied upon by the other side, who does not occupy his office under similar conditions. Personally, I do not approve of elected Judges. That, however, is another question. The complaint has been made that not one word has been uttered by members of' the Labour Party in regard to the amendments suggested by the Attorney-General. I should like to remind members of the Opposition that we had not much opportunity of referring, to those amendments. Yesterday, the honorable member for Parramatta and his friends exercised their right of speech to the exclusion practically of every other honorable member. </para>

I do not wish to detain the Committee further than to reply to the statement of the honorable member for Parramatta, that our present industrial legislation is sufficient for all practical purposes. He declared that the machinery we have already set up insures that reasonable conditions of labour shall prevail throughout the Commonwealth. I say that his statement argues a very insufficient knowledge of the actual condition of affairs in Australia. Is not the honorable member aware that in several of the States there is no industrial legislation of this character? </para>

If a constitutional doubt exists as to our powers, surely that is an argument why we should endeavour to accomplish something for those who stand in need of our assistance. The condition of things industrially throughout. Australia requires considerable amendment. I trust that honorable members will not be led away by the suggestion of the deputy leader of the Opposition, that the industrial legislation already in force is sufficient to cope with this evil. There is still room for improvement in the social conditions of the people; there is still room for the community to exercise a steady and insistent pressure upon its members concerning their responsibility one to the other. In the interests of simple justice, I trust that this Committee will render those who are associated together in trade unions the same treatment that it is proposed to apply under this Bill to employers and other individuals, who may register ordinary trade marks. </para>

                        <para>- lt has been brought about by the want of tact and judgment of the Attorney-General in not accepting the very fair offer made by the deputy leader of the Opposition last evening. As the Attorney-General does not seem disposed to consent to an adjournment at this stage, I. shall be compelled to proceed with my speech. I have a great amount of material I to draw upon, and shall probably occupy a considerable time. If any evidence were wanting to show how completely the Government are under the control of an irresponsible section of honorable members, it has been afforded by the action of Ministers in bringing forward proposals of this character, which members of the Ministry have expressed themselves hostile to, and which they must know cannot fail to be hurtful to the community. The speech of the leader of the Labour Party, although it occupied a considerable time, and was certainly informative in some respects, was not convincing. Towards the conclusion, of hrs speech the honorable member referred to made a quotation from a judgment given by a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States in Kentuckv. lt is notorious that many of the elected Judges of America are corrupt, and the importance of their decisions must be discounted by the knowledge of that fact. </para>

                        <para>- I was not speaking of that particular court. I was referring to the United States Judges generally, who are elected by popular favour - a system which must necessarily lead to corruption, and to practices which would not be countenanced in this community. Therefore, any decisions given by them for or against proposals such as those now before us must lose a large amount of the weight that under ordinary circumstances would attach to them. It is proposed to extend the provisions of the Bill now before us to workers for wages who are in no sense the proprietors of the particular goods produced by their work. It seems to me that this exceeds all reasonable bounds. The labour organizations are not trading corporations in any sense of the term. The members work for wages, and the result of their labour becomes the property of their employers. Although an employer may be entitled to register a trademark for the purpose of enabling his goods to be distinguished from those manufactured by his trade rivals, the same principle cannot be extended to his employes. If a trade union were to manufacture goods, and trade upon its own account, it would have a legitimate claim to the use of a distinctive label or trade mark, because ownership would <inline font-style="italic">be</inline> established, together with the accompanying right to secure protection against other manufacturers with whom the union might be brought into competition. Under existing conditions, however, it cannot be claimed that the employes of any manufacturer have a proprietary interest in the goods produced. The right of ownership might be established to a certain extent if the employes were allowed to share, even to a small extent, in the profits of the enterprise ; but so long as they occupy the position of mere employes, they can have no interest in the concern beyond such as may attach to the performance of their work, and the receipt of their wages. The primary purpose of trade marks is to enable certain goods to <inline font-style="italic">be</inline> distinguished from others, and to protect the manufacturers against fraud on, the part of their rivals. It must be remembered, however, that a trade mark in no sense affords any guarantee as to quality. The honorable member for Bland supported the trade union label provisions on the ground that if such labels were applied to goods, they would guarantee the public against the purchase of inferior articles. I would point out, however, that a trade mark does not necessarily protect the public in that regard. The person who receives protection from a trade mark is the owner, manufacturer, or seller of the goods to which it applies, but it gives no guarantee of quality. Thus, the union label or trade mark may be applied to goods of the most inferior and shoddiest description. How, then can it be claimed that the public will benefit by distinguishing articles made by union or organized labour from articles made bv other labour? If the union trade mark guaranteed the quality of the goods to which it was applied; there might be some reason for agreeing to the provisions of Part VII., though I do not say that there would be a justification for doing so. Part VII., however, is a mockery, a delusion, and a snare, if it is contended that the union label will protect the public, and no one knows it better than does the honorable member for Bland. The real purpose of those provisions is to legalize coercion by means of the boycott, and to prevent the public from exercising freedom of choice in the purchase of goods. They aim, too, at preventing employers from employing those whom they think it to their interest to employ, and at giving the unions power to interfere in the management of the business of manufacturers. We know, from reading, what has occurred in the United States and in Canada in connexion with, the use of the union label. Even although its use has not been legalized in those countries, we know to what extent it has been found possible to make it available for purposes of intimidation. The trade and labour journals of America teem with instances in which boycotts have been established, and employers harassed and worried by means of the union label. We are asked to legalize the use of these labels. But if they have proved so disastrous to the commercial and industrial life of America, and such an engine of tyranny and oppression where they have not been legalized, is it not reasonable to assume that if legalized they will be used with even greater severity, and with more oppressive results and consequences? In my speech on the second reading of the Bill, I mentioned in detail some of the cases which have occurred in America, and I refer honorable members who wish to refresh their minds on the subject to the official report of it. The leader of the Labour Party told us that the union label is not necessarily connected with boycotting. I do not think that any one has claimed that it is. But will he say that it cannot, and will not, be used to make boycotting more effective? As a matter of fact, he practically admitted that it will be so used. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member will, in time, get too close to the arms of the windmill, and will be injured by their revolution. The honorable member for Bland contended that a man who is a unionist should receive the same treatment that is given to a non-unionist, and in reply to an interjection had to agree to the converse case. The members of the Opposition have been contending all along that all men have the same rights, and should be given equal opportunities. The purpose of Part VII., however, is to give exclusive privileges to a section of the workers. The provisions of this part of the Bill are more far-reaching, and give greater coercive powers to members of unions, than were proposed to be given under the Arbitration Bill. The powers then proposed to be given were refused by honorable members, and an attempt is now being made to get behind the decision then arrived at. The Bill is. a denial of what the honorable member for Bland says should be a principle of legislation, namely, that non-unionists and unionists shall be allowed the same rights. I do not intend to deal with the amendments of which notice has been given, because I understand that it is not competent for us to discuss them at this stage. I should like to point out, however, that trade unionists will not be allowed to use the union label. They will have no right of proprietorship in it. That will be vested in employers. The use of a trade mark implies ownership of it, and the right to assign, sell, or otherwise dispose of it. I submit, however, that a trade union may not deal in that way with a union mark. </para>

                        <para>- A trade union might purchase it, but it may not use it. Furthermore, a trade union label can never be properly prescribed as a trade mark unless it can be shown that the goods to which it is attached are owned, prepared, manufactured, or sold solely by the union as an organization, and that they areas such separate and distinct in essential particulars from other goods sold elsewhere. Is it claimed that those conditions can possibly apply to a union label under the provisions of this Bill? I submit that they cannot, and that therefore the very essence of a trade mark is absent from the proposed union label. I hope that even at this late hour, if the Ministry are not absolutely under the thumb of the Labour Party, they will see their way clear to eliminate the union label provisions from the Bill, and that, if they are really anxious to. proceed with them, they will embody them in a separate measure. The deputy leader of the Opposition has shown very clearly that Part VII. of the Bill contains so many provisions, apart altogether from the amendments which have been circulated, that it might well be embodied in a separate measure. The honorable member showed that, if that were done, the way would be cleared for the discussion of the' remaining parts of the Bill, and that it would facilitate the passing of a, useful and workable Trade Marks Bill this session. It is the desire of every honorable member of the Opposition to assist in the passing of a useful measure of that character, and the prolonged discussion of this measure has been due to the action of the Government in grafting upon it extraneous provisions having no bearing whatever on trade marks in the ordinary acceptation of the term. </para>

                        <para>- I sympathize with the honorable member and other honorable members opposite in the position in which they find themselves. I know that many of the supporters of the Government, in other cir circumstances, would be as strongly opposed as I am to the union label provisions of the Bill. We know what are the opinions of certain members of the Ministry in regard to proposals of this kind, and I am surprised to find the Vice-President of the Executive Council giving them his support. Under other conditions the honorable member has been heard to inveigh most loudly against such propositions, and we should have some explanation for this sudden <inline font-style="italic">volte face.</inline> Some influence must have been at work to induce the honorable gentleman to suddenly become a convert to principles which he has time after time denounced in this House. My references to his attitude are made in the most friendly spirit, but I fear that his constituents may not be satisfied with his sudden change of front. In language less graceful, but more forcible, than that employed by him, the Treasurer has also spoken against proposals of this kind. So far we have been left quite in the dark as to the opinions of many honorable members opposite. There has been a conspiracy of silence. </para>

                        <para>- At any rate, what had all the external appearance of a conspiracy of silence was broken partly by the honorable member for Bland ; but he did not adduce any argument that would appeal to the intelligence of the Opposition, and induce them to change their opinion. Their close study of the question has led to their opposing the provisions of Part VII. The question of whether or nob we have power under the Constitution to enforce provisions relating to a union label has also to be considered, and in this connexion I propose to read a short extract from a well -recognised authority on trade marks. In dealing with the definition of a trade mark, Kerly defines it as - </para>

                <para class="block">It will be seen that this definition of a trade mark cannot possibly be applied to a trade union label. The conditions governing the use of a union mark do not fit in with any of the conditions laid down by this authority as governing the use and application of trade marks. A claim to the proprietorship of a union label cannot be established by a union; there can be no claim that the union, in using the label, is the owner, manufacturer, or seller of the goods, or is interested in those goods except in respect to the wages which its members earn in their production.

                <para class="block">That is One of the distinguishing characteristics laid down by <inline font-style="italic">Kerly</inline> in his definition.

The real object of a trade mark is to protect the manufacturer, or the distributor, or the seller of goods.

                    <para>The primary right of the plaintiff to have the benefit of his contract, and to remain undisturbed in the performance of it, is universally recognised. The right to dispose of one's labour as he will, and nave the benefit of his lawful contracts, is incident to the freedom of the individual, which lies at the foundation of government in all countries that maintain the principles of civil liberty. Such a right can lawfully be interfered with only by one who is acting in the exercise of an equal or superior right, which comes in conflict with the other. An intentional interference with such a right, without lawful justification, is malicious in law, even if it is from good motives, and without express malice. </para>

I trust that the arguments which I have adduced will furnish honorable members with food for reflection. I hope that they have not made up their minds to adopt a certain course, irrespective of whether it is wise or just, or in the best interests of the country. I am satisfied that members of the Opposition, in resisting the provisions of this Bill, are rendering the best possible service to the country.

The honorable and learned1 member for Wannon also made a very valuable contribution, to the debate, although his views , may not have accorded with those entertained by some honorable members opposite. Consequently there seems to be not only an error, but an intentional misapprehension of the facts. The Attorney-General earlier in the evening made some reference to thirty hours- </para>

                <para class="block">Bill. The motion, " That the Chairman do now leave the chair," was moved last night as a protest against honorable members being called upon to transact public business for an unreasonable length of time, and against the refusal of the Government to accept the very generous offer made by members of the Opposition. I do not wish to again adopt that course, so long as we are called upon to transact a reasonable amount of business within reasonable hours. It is proposed in a series of clauses now in the Bill, and in a further series of provisions which it is proposed to substitute for some of those now embodied in the measure, to give power to register under a Trade Marks Bill what are to be called union trade marks. I have several objections to urge to these provisions. In the first place, after further consideration, I have still graver doubts than I entertained on a previous occasion as to ..the constitutionality of the union trade mark proposals. Under the Constitution, which regulates and limits the powers of this Parliament, we are authorized - in section 51, sub-section 18 - to legislate with regard to " copyrights, patents of inventions and designs, and trade marks." That provision at once raises the question as to what is the meaning of the two words "trade marks." I admit at once that we are not to be bound for all time by the meaning of the words " trade marks " at the time the Constitution was passed. If that were the case, the Constitution would become an impossible and inelastic instrument, instead of a reasonable and elastic one, as it ought to be. The furthest we can go - and I think that we shall then be going further than the authorities would allow us - is to say that these -words must be interpreted according to the conditions of the time at which they are being applied. That is to say, that in proposing to-day to pass a Trade Marks Bill, we should interpret these words according to their current meaning. We are not entitled to assume that in the future they will bear' a more extended meaning, nor are we entitled to assign an arbitrary meaning in order to pretend to give ourselves competence to legislate on matters that would otherwise be beyond the scope of our authority. We cannot by calling a thing a trade mark make it a trade mark, and the most elastic and generous standard I can suggest is that we should recognise the present meaning of the words " trade mark." With regard to that, we have two sets of authorities at our disposal. In the first place, there is the long course of judicial' decisions in the English and Australian Courts upon Acts and common law rules - all similar, though not necessarily of an identical character. In the second place, we have a considerable series of decisions in various State Courts of the United States, upon what is popularly known as the union label, in which special consideration has been given to the question whether union labels are trade marks according to the common acceptation of the term. First of all, as regards the current English and Australian decisions, I think I shall have the concurrence of the Attorney-General when I say that in all cases the Judges, many of them eminent men, who have found it necessary to discuss the essential qualities of trade marks, have held that a trade mark implies ownership. In every text-book, both recent and otherwise, that I have had an opportunity to consult, and in every case to which I have had an opportunity to refer, it has been laid down that ownership of the goods, when they reach the point of being available for sale, accompanies the ownership of trade mark. We find that both in the cases decided at common law and upon the statutory provisions in, this respect - even in the Bill itself - trade marks are not to be assignable except in company with the goods to which they are attached, or with the good-will of the business with which they are associated. Trade mark is one of the attributes of ownership that go along with the business or goods. If that be the essential point in a trade mark, surely it cannot be contended that these union trade marks, as they are called, are trade marks within the ordinary legal acceptation of the term - within the ordinary interpretation that the words receive at the hands of pur Courts. More than that, I would go so far as to say that there is no case in the English or Australian Courts which suggests that union trade marks would be judicially determined to be trade marks, as known to the commercial or legal world. </para>

                        <para>- Not with union trade marks. I have already pointed that out. I say that in none of the cases in which we have a definition of trade mark occurring is there such a definition as would include union labels. Of course, it i* capable of being argued in a Court of Law that that point has not been submitted for specific consideration, and that if it had been, the definition of trade mark might have been extended to include union labels. But, after all, that is the argument of desperation. When we find continually, not the same words, but varying words, all containing the same idea, we are bound to say that no definition of trade marks would include union labels. We are entitled at least to contend that there is no reasonable probability that the definition would be extended to include them. On the other hand we have a series of decisions given in American State Courts. The honorable member for Bland read two or three very interesting extracts from reports of those cases, but the extracts which the honorable gentleman read as supporting his view of the propriety of passing this legislation were as cogent an answer to the suggestion that these union labels are trade marks as anything I have heard. They all said that it was not necessary to say that they were trade marks in order to give the legal protection asked for, In a number of cases the Judges have gone further, and have said that they are not trade marks. In some cases the Judges have said that they could not give them the full protection which a trade mark would give. One of the decisions quoted by the honorable member for Bland was to this effect : " We can protect trade union labels in exactly the same way that we can protect good-will." I remind the Attorney-General in that connexion of the fact that, under English and Australian law, a man's trade description may be protected although it is not a trade mark at all. One must not imitate a man's trade description, whether it is a registered trade mark or not, in such a manner as to deceive people into believing they are buying his goods when they are buying the imitator's goods. But that does not make a trade description a trade mark. From the American cases it would appear that, while the counsel for the imitator has argued every time that the trade union label is not a trade mark, and therefore cannot be protected, the Court has answered the argument by' saying, "Although it is not .a trade mark, still we can protect it." Neither the Attorney-General nor those who think with him can find any course of authorities to support their contention that this is a trade mark. It would be far from sufficient to quote a single case, in which a casual expression might enable one to draw, as a workable conclusion, the inference that it was supposed to be a trade mark, against a whole series of decisions. This is a matter in which, if there be a divergence between English and American decisions, the English decisions, and not the American decisions, will guide our Courts. This is not a matter in which, because of some analogy between our Constitution and the American Constitution American cases can be used as a guide, as for example in the great series of important cases recently so much quoted before the High Court, and of which the Attorney-General has some professional, as well as some political, knowledge. In this matter the whole current of English decisions will have the same weight in Australia as the current of English decisions upon the construction of wills, or upon Questions of tort - as to which, especially in connexion with some branches of the law of negligence, as the Attorney-General knows, and some matters connected with the law of trespass, the current of American decisions has set in a different direction from that of English decisions. </para>

                        <para>- I say that the English cases by necessary inference exclude this being called a trade mark, because, wherever a trade mark is defined, their definition prevents this, being included within it. I challenge the Attorney-General to quote any single authoritative definition of a trade mark, either in the text-books or in cases in English or Australian Courts which would include a union label. If the honorable and learned gentleman will name one case, I shall look it up in the library as soon as I have concluded mv remarks. If there were such a case the Attorney-General would let me hear of it quickly enough. </para>

                        <para>- The Attorney-General might have named one case, and that would not be considered an irrelevant or ' disorderly interjection. The point of my remarks is that if a union label is not within the competence of the Federal Legislature under sub-section 18 of section 51 as a trade mark, it is not, in the form proposed by the Government applying to trade within a State as well as to trade between a State and foreign countries, within the competence of the Federal Legislature either. I think the Attorney-General will admit that. </para>

                        <para>- It is clear that the English and Australian cases exclude these labels from the 1905 definition of a trade mark, and even from the definition of 1900. We are, in my opinion, engaged in an unconstitutional task in this matter. We are proposing to make laws which we have not the power to make. I remember that a very similar question arose some eighteen months ago in connexion with the proposal to include State servants under the Arbitration Bill. </para>

                        <para>- That is so, because I had before then announced that I intended to support the measure, whether that provision were included in it or not, just as I announced my intention to support it, whether there was, or was not, a certain amendment made in what was known as clause 48. I referred to the amendment proposed in connexion -with- the Arbitration Bill as an illustration to show that it is not desirable that this Parliament should pass laws ob the chance of their being constitutional. Amongst our deliberate duties as a Federal Parliament is the duty of keeping as far as we can within the bounds, of the Constitution. Especially in the early years of the Federation, whilst State watchfulness of our proceedings is marked, we have a deliberate duty not to transgress the bounds of the Constitution. I do not mean by that to say that we should refrain from passing laws, because they may possibly be beyond the Constitution. We may approach reasonably near to the limits of our powers in a case of genuine doubt, which can only be decided, as the Judge of a State Court said the other day, " by the man who has the last say," and should not hesitate to exercise our power because, after full argument in a Court of Law, our legislation may be held to be unconstitutional. At least, the burden is on those who support the measure, to satisfy us that there is reasonable likelihood of its being held to be constitutional. We have not had that proof ; we did .not get it from the Attorney-General in his second1- reading speech, and I have read twice every word he then uttered. I noticed the singular fact that he practically confined his remarks in this connexion to pointing out that there was something somewhere which was something like what is proposed to be done now. But he did not use any argument which would justify us in supposing that " trade mark " will suddenly be found to have a meaning which it has never been given in the English Courts - a meaning that it will, require to have to bring this proposal within our legislative power. The Constitution was framed intentionally with limited Federal authority, and was so accepted by the people. </para>

                        <para>- I have endeavoured to address myself absolutely to the points at issue. I have spoken briefly, but I think I have said sufficient to make clear my views, without going into detailed argument in support of them. I have laid down the general line of my argument in support of the view that this proposal is unconstitutional. The next point - and it is one equally pertinent to the question - is as to the necessity for a union trade mark. In the United States of America, rightly or wrongly - and I am not prepared to say wrongly - the great majority of the States have adopted union label Acts. The history of the struggle for better conditions on the part of wage-earners in the United States has developed on very different lines, and in very different ways, from the similar movement in Australia. There is nothing more gratifying in the history of the last century or half-century than the rapid, though certainly not too rapid - indeed in some cases too slow - development of the power of the wage-earning classes, and the results that have been attained in the securing of better and fairer conditions. When one looks back, even only half a century, to the condition of the wage-earners then, and compares it with their condition to-day, one cannot but recognise that it has improved enormously, largely, though I will not say entirely, nor almost entirely, owing to the energetic and well-directed efforts of the wage-earners themselves. In their struggle to develop their own opportunities, and secure to themselves the proper reward of their own efforts, they are deserving of all commendation and support. Any man who sets himself up in opposition to all wise efforts in that behalf, sets himself in opposition not only to a tide which will quickly overwhelm him, but to justice. It does not follow, however, that every means proposed by those either personally interested, or, as it were, interested from the outside, is the right means. No one would admit more quickly than honorable members who claim to specially represent those who are struggling upward, that sometimes their proposals have effects which are not expected, and that sometimes they find themselves in a blind alley, from which they have to retrace their steps in order to seek another road. </para>

                        <para>- I admit that in very many cases, which do not redound to the credit of those who were the cause, the men who have been in the van in great and just industrial movements, have personally suffered. I object to honorable members assuming that they, and they alone, have these honorable aims in view,. I remind them that where I differ from them - and I speak only for myself - I in no way differ as to the aim they have to secure equality of opportunity and justice of treatment for all human beings. Where I differ from them is as to whether the methods they propose will produce the desired effect. However wrong honorable members may think my views, that is a position- which may be taken up by any man without exposing him to a charge of injustice or unfairness ; his intellectual view may be questioned, but not his heart or sense of justice. The verv classes who confessedly have the same object in view have pursued1 very different methods in dif.ferent countries. It may be that those differing methods will all conduce .to the desired result, but, on the other hand, they may not. In the United States of America the movement of the working classes, or those who, perhaps, may be fairly called the wage-earning classes as a whole, has been kept as far as possible from the Courts. The wage-earners have said, " We desire to, and we can, work out our own salvation!" They have said very plainly in many cases, " We do not trust the Courts ; we do not trust the purity of the source from which justice is drawn." I do not say whether such an attitude is correct or incorrect. .1 believe that, as a general rule, Judges selected by. popular votes for short periods are not as likely to be as efficient Judges and as good lawyers as are those who are appointed during 'good behaviour by careful selection. I think that the British and Australian system of choosing Judges is incomparably superior to that which has been pursued for many years in many of the United States of America - a method which, as its application has been diminished from year to year, with consequent improvements, has shown the unwisdom of that system as compared with ours. And I should be very sorry to see the principles of democracy so distorted as to be applied to the popular selection of our Judges, however wise it may be - as I admit that it is wise - that those principles should be applied to the selection of ourselves as deliberative legislators. I want to point out the essential difference between the conditions in the United States and the conditions in Australia, in order to show that any argument as to the desirability or the necessity of this legislation in Australia drawn from the United States analogy, is an utterly false argument; and, therefore, I am compelled to show the essential difference in conditions between the two countries. In the United States of America there are no Courts settling hours of labour, rates of wages, and conditions, of employment. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member's intellect is quick, and he sees ahead to the point at which a slow tongue cannot arrive as quickly as his thoughts can. I am coming to that a little. 'later, but I cannot say what I wish to say all at once. In the United States, I repeat, there are no courts determining hours of labour, rates of pay, and conditions of employment. As a consequence, the all powerful influence of the State - the organized community - cannot be used for securing by that particular method satisfactory conditions for wage-earners ; and they have adopted, therefore, what they believe will to a large extent achieve the same result by a different method. They have adopted as a method of securing these results the union label, because, they say, ~ " our unions will lay down in their bargains with employers conditions as to satisfactory hours, satisfactory rates of remuneration, satisfactory conditions of employment. Consequently, with our union label on the goods that are made by us, the buyer can be assured that he is buying an- article which has been- made under satisfactory conditions." I say at once, as any fair-minded buyer would do, especially one who is not tied down to thinking whether he can afford to pay another sixpence or another shilling for an article, that one should take that much trouble in the interests of his fellow creatures. And we do, I think. All of us, so far as we can, do that. The wage-earners of the United States say - I think with a good deal of reason - " Give us our union label, and it will "assure the buyer, without his having to make personal inquiries, that he is getting an article that is being made under satisfactory conditions." If it stopped there, and there was nothing else to differentiate the American case from the Australian case, it might be acknowledged that a very strong, if not exactly a conclusive argument, might be drawn from the experience of the United States. But as a matter of fact - and I say this deliberately - the union label, besides being used for what we might call quite legitimate purposes in the United States, is used for other purposes which are not as legitimate or as proper. So that the first thing we learn from the United States experience, without considering the conditions prevailing there, without considering the difference between those conditions and the conditions prevailing here, is that while the union label maybe valuable weapon, it is also a weapon of a dangerous character; and that while we may be able to get useful lessons and useful experience from the United States laws, we also get warnings.. But those warnings are apparently to be entirely disregarded. </para>

As far as I could, in view of the fact that I must not break the thread of my speech, I have run over the names of all the main opponents of the union label in this House, and I find that more than half of those - I think nearly two-thirds - who are opposed to the union label were not opposed to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and are members whose careers in the States Parliaments prove that they were not opposed to Wages Boards or Factories Acts, or anything of the kind. If the honorable members who have interjected will take the trouble to obtain a copy of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and look at the names of the members on the back page, and if they will tick off those names of members who are known to be opposed to the union label proposals of the Government, they will find that not one-third of them were opposed to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. </para>

                        <para>- The people whom we represent, and we who represent them, are to be regarded rather than persons who may possibly take a less broad and more one-sided view than we who have had an opportunity of hearing both sides of the question. I think the honorable member will admit that reasonable opportunities have been afforded to him and others to hear the other side. I now come to the point from which I was diverted by some interjections, though only to a kindred matter. In Australia, the wage-earning class - and I use that phrase as a conveniently brief one to indicate all sections of the community - have set themselves to work to secure direct State control of wages and conditions of labour, and for two-thirds of their number they have succeeded. In Victoria, we have a system of Wages Boards which is very excellent, as far1 as it goes. I do not think it has been extended to cases to which it might reasonably be made applicable. But we have Wages Boards in a large number of trades-, with very valuable results. Speaking in general terms, each Wages Board prescribes the wages and conditions for all employes in the trade, . unionists and non-unionists alike. In their case, not only would the use of a union label by the union whose members form part of the employes in a trade be unnecessary, but it would be absolutely misleading. It would be an attempt to tell the public that, while the places in which the union label was exclusively employed were working under fair conditions', by implication the other places were not so working under fair conditions, and it would be stating that which would not be the truth, because under the Wages Boards unionists and non-unionists alike are getting the benefit of their decisions. Take the case of two factories which were producing the same article, and working under the decisions of a Wages Board. Suppose that in one factory union labour was employed, and that in the other non-union labour was employed. If the factory in which union labour was employed, did use the union label, and its goods went out to the world bearing the union label, there would be a false inference drawn that the other factory, in which the wages, conditions, and hours of employment were exactly the same, was a sweating factory. In other words, the label would be a means of telling lies about the non-unionists working under the Wages Board. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, I am sorry to say. I do not think that the use of the union label would cure the sweating in the trades in which it is still practised. In New South Wales there is a Conciliation and Arbitration Act, which provides in effect that the Court may determine what are proper wages and conditions of labour in practically any trade whose differences of opinion are brought before it. Under the Act the wage-earners in any industry may go to the Court, and have fair wages and conditions of labour prescribed. Frequently - I think I might say usually - &lt;{?he Court will say :that the wages and conditions of labour shall apply not merely to the persons, or even to the members of the organizations making the application, but to all persons employed in the industry, at any rate, within the competitive area, because, after all, it has always appeared to me that the competitive area, is the proper test for the application of the common rule. Consequently, in New South W'ales there is a Court which has the power of prescribing that, for unionists and non-unionists alike in an industry, certain rates of pay and certain conditions of labour shall be observed. Very often the Court has also directed that to unionists shall' be given preference ; sometimes it has not. There we have the fact that, whether it be a unionist or a non-unionist, who is employed, he is to get the rates of pay and the conditions of labour prescribed, and the union label going out from a shop or factory where union labour was employed as a suggestion that there, and there alone, were proper wages being paid and1 proper conditions of work being observed would be another falsehood. Again, the inference, which may or may not be true in the United States - "and I have no doubt that in many cases it is not true - would be false in New South Wales in exactly the same way. In Western Australia, the application of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to an industry will affect unionists and non-unionists alike, and will, consequently, cause it to be untrue to suggest by the use of the union label that, while the goods so marked are being produced under proper conditions of labour, the goods not <inline font-style="italic">so</inline> marked are not being produced under exactly the same conditions. </para>

                        <para>- The laws in operation in Victoria, New South Wales, and Western Australia show that unionists and non-unionists alike are under the same conditions of labour, and are being paid the same rates of wages. Consequently if there is in the United States some reason for the use of the non-union label, there is no such reason in those three States in Australia. It is not fair to assume that any honorable member can address himself closely to so important a question at this hour, and expect that reasonable attention will be given to his remarks. If I am given an opportunity to conclude my remarks under ordinary conditions, I shall undertake not to discuss the general question again, but to confine myself strictly to a discussion of each of the clauses to which I am opposed. This question of the union label is the biggest question which has been before Parliament this session. It is of greater importance than the fate of a Government. The country will recover more quickly from the effects of a change of Government' than from the institution of the union label. It was referred to shortly during the second reading debate in connexion with other matters, and it has been Under the consideration of the House in Committee during one sitting. However the Attorney-General is in an obstinate mood, and be will not. say what he is prepared to do. </para>

                        <para>- I am quite prepared to do that. I have made my last appeal to the honorable and learned gentleman, and it was purely a personal appeal I must continue what I had to say. In Queensland there is no Conciliation and Arbitration Act in force, although there is practically a Labour Government, and the Labour Party are in power. Why have they mot passed such a measure, if it is necessary in the interests of the wage-earners of that State? It is presumably because they believe that they are able to secure proper wages and conditions without the aid of such legislation. I now pass to a consideration of the condition of affairs in South Australia. Am I to understand that the Attorney -General is willing to report progress ? </para>

                    <para>- I regret to hear that expression of opinion from the Attorney-General. If the honorable and learned member had last night pursued a more pacific course, and had accepted the recommendations pf his colleagues, fifty seven clauses of the Bill would have been disposed of, and, with the exception of three, that number would have been raised to seventy-two to-day. However, at this hour, I do not propose to argue those points. </para>

                    <para>- In reply to the extraordinary statement of the Attorney-General, I may say that on Tuesday evening the honorable and' learned member was made an offer which would have resulted in a magnificent day's work, but declined to accept it. To-night I offered that if the Attorney-General would consent to report progress on the Committee agreeing to strike certain words out, the omission of which he had moved, I would sit down, and, thereupon, the debate would have come to an end When the Government deliberately refuse to accept the very thing it declares it is fighting for, it is political audacity of the most astounding kind for the Attorney-General to rum round and assert that the business of the country cannot be carried on. </para>
