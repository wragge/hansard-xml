                    <para>- I wish to call attention to a matter which was not discussed last night, because of the lateness of the hour at which the Attorney-General&#39;s Estimates were dealt with - the need for making some arrangement in connexion with the High Court, which will meet the present urgent position of affairs. The work of that Court is increasing so fast that the present number of Justices is not sufficient to properly cope with it, and if it continues to increase, we shall soon have here the notorious delays which occur in America, where an appeal is at least two years, and sometimes as much as four years, before it is dealt with. Of course, such a congestion of business will not occur immediately. </para>

                        <para>- Because the matter calls for immediate attention. It is far better that the Justices should be idle half their time than that suitors should not be able to get immediate justice. It is the delay involved in the settlement of cases that is largely responsible for the tremendous expense involved in law suits. Honorable members, knowing that it is unpopular to advocate the appointment of more Justices, wish to shirk this problem. I pointed out, when the Judiciary Bill was before the House, that if the High Court were given all the powers proposed to be conferred on it, not three, but ten Justices would be necessary ; but, fortunately, owing to the representations made by me and a few other honorable members conversant with judicial business, the original jurisdiction proposed to be conferred on the Court was cut down, and consequently the business of the Court is not now as great as if would otherwise have been. The Court, however, has still too much original jurisdiction. We should have confined its work entirely to appellate jurisdiction. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; but I am speaking of the original jurisdiction which it possesses over and above that required to be given to it by the Constitution. The Court, as at present constituted, cannot satisfactorily carry on its work. I am not now entering into the question whether five Justices would make a better appellate Court than three, though when the matter was before Parliament, I held that if we were going to institute the High Court then, five would be a reasonable number of Justices to appoint. </para>

                        <para>- As I have said, if the original jurisdiction proposed to be conferred on the Court had not been cut down, ten Justices would hardly have been sufficient. I think that the honorable member was one of those who supported an amendment which I moved to cut down the original jurisdiction proposed. At the present time there are not enough Justices to deal with the business of the Court, and it devolves upon Parliament to determine whether the number of Justices shall be increased or the original jurisdiction of the Court reduced. </para>

                        <para>- Undoubtedly, as matters stand at present. If we adopted the alternative of cutting down the original jurisdiction of the Court it would be quite possible for us to get along with only three Justices; but it is not practicable to continue the Judiciary Act in its present form with such a limited Bench. I should have thought that honorable members or the Labour Party would be the first to favour an increase in the number of Justices. No greater injury could be inflicted upon the community! than to increase the already heavy expenses of litigation. This matter is &#39;clearly one calling for immediate attention. If we pass legislation, we must see that it is properly administered, and we shall fail in our duty if we refrain from applying the remedy merely because it is unpopular to suggest new appointments, or to increase the expenses of the Court. By permitting the present state of affairs to continue, we shall increase the cost to the general community in a hundred ways, and deny to the poorest classes that ready justice to which they are entitled. The law&#39;s delays fall most heavily upon, the poorer classes of the community. We know that if, owing to the lack of a magistrate in a country town, a working man is compelled to wait for three or four weeks in order to obtain a. decision upon his claim, he is put to great loss, and is practically denied justice. As we ascend the scale in connexion with litigation exactly the same difficulty arises. If people find that they cannot readily obtain judicial decisions, they suffer wrong rather than seek a legal remedy. Any mention of &#34;a clearly necessary alteration in the High Court is brushed aside as something unpleasant, and it seems to me that the Government are shirking their dutv because they are afraid of the trouble that would be involved in explaining to the great mass of the people the necessity for strengthening the Bench. I admit that the present situation does not arise from any fault of the Prime Minister, because from the outset he has urged the appointment of five Justices. Experience has shown that it is necessary, apart altogether from the question of strengthening the Court for the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction to have a stronger Bench. The Court will have to carry some of the current year&#39;s business over to next year, and in view of the increasing number of cases demanding its attention, serious delays are bound to ensue. Every honorable member is, I think, conscious that the attitude of honorable members generally towards the Federal Capital Site question is not worthy of the House. The majority have no wish to see the question settled. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to be clearly understood. When I say that the majority of honorable members desire to block the settlement of the Capital Site question, I naturally except the representatives of New South Wales, most of whom are very anxious to see the Capital established at the earliest possible date. I submit that the Dalgety site would never have been selected if it had not been felt by many honorable members that, its choice would have the effect of delaying a settlement. Not only is the site some distance from any existing railway line, but it has several drawbacks, apart altogether from the rigours of the climate. </para>

                        <para>- I told the honorable member that he should vote for Dalgety in preference to Tooma, because the selection of the latter site would have involved a violation of the spirit of the agreement embodied in the Constitution. I have always argued that the Federal Capital should be situated at some point upon the main railway line between Sydney and Melbourne. It appears to me to be ridiculous to select a site some distance off the trunk line of communication between the two great capitals, and to delay the mails of the whole Commonwealth for half-a-day each way. </para>

                        <para>- The Constitution provides that the Capital shall be situated within the State of New South Wales, and, in the view of some persons, it also provides that the territory shall be selected by the Parliament of that State. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton was one of those who, in the initial stages, called upon the Premier of New South Wales to select a territory, and the present Parliament of New South Wales has offered not only one territory, but half-a-dozen, and has thus given us a very fair choice. All those who really desire to bring about a settlement of this question should be prepared to negotiate upon an amicable basis. The delay in settling this question, combined with the neglect to grant to New South Wales adequate representation, has imposed a perilous strain upon the Federal Union, and if honorable members are not careful they will soon find their business gone. </para>

                        <para>- A great portion of my time here has been occupied in exposing, the foolish character of our Federal legislation. The Government deserve to be criticised. The majority of its members were members of a previous Administration, and consequently they are to some extent responsible for the Estimates under consideration. We know very well that every occasion upon which the State and Commonwealth, authorities fail to work harmonious! v together, increases the friction which already exists, and consequently adds to our expenditure. That is a truism amongst educated persons, but it is not so amongst the great majority of Ministerial supporters. They are unaware that there are such things as social science and social economy. </para>

                        <para>- Then I understand that I am&#34; not at liberty to discuss matters connected with economics at all. If a knowledge of the science of economics should not enter into a consideration of these Estimates I do not know what should. As a matter of fact, I know that it does not. I recognise that we are fast getting back to the system of corvee by which in times past men were compelled to work three or four weeks each year for the King or for the Government. Under our present system of government the taxation imposed upon the people is becoming so great that each year men are called upon to devote to the Government not three or four weeks, but six or seven weeks of labour. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to do so, in order that the expenses of litigation may be diminished, which would be a very good thing. I do not blame the honorable member for failing to understand my point - I sympathize with him. When the Judiciary Bill was under consideration, I pointed out that we ought to invest the High Court with appellate jurisdiction only. Of course, I did not expect the majority of honorable members at that time to see beyond their noses. But now that a case has arisen, I do expect them to recognise, facts. I cannot discuss with the honorable member for Bass the question of the wisdom or otherwise of investing the High Court with more than appellate jurisdiction, because it is entirely beyond him. I might just as reasonably expect him to under stand me when I say that a. knowledge of quaternions is of use in promoting a research in physics, or that the differential calculus is of assistance in, discovering the laws relating to astronomy. As far as he is concerned, he would never be able to grasp the situation. </para>

                        <para>- We are perpetually being called upon to take from the pockets of the people further sums for carrying on that central agency, which is called the Government. The working expenses of this so-called Government are steadily increasing year by year, so that very soon we shall have to take from every man, perhaps, the equivalent of a couple of months&#39; forced labour each year. Whether a man is forced&#39; to work two months for a Government,, or for a slave-master, is quite immaterial, because to the individual the result is the same. I say that a halt should now be called, and that the Estimates should receive that scathing criticism which they deserve. Day after day we are allowing matters which should be within the control of the House to pass under the domination of the Government. Year after year our expenditure is piling up, simply because Parliament is not afforded an opportunity to exercise complete supervision over it. We frequently hear honorable members urging that it ought to be the policy of the Government to impose taxation upon large numbers of our citizens, whose only offence is that they . are too industrious, and that this should be done simply for the benefit of one or two individuals who have invested their capital in certain enterprises, and who wish to make large profits out of them. </para>

                        <para>- The Ministry doubtless would be pleased if there were no discussion on the Estimates, but their satisfaction would arise from motives which, I am sure, would not influence the public. The people desire to know exactly how we are dealing with the financial affairs of the Commonwealth, and if we wish to- exercise any control over the Estimates, it is absolutely necessary that we should have an opportunity to deal with them earlier in the session. The votes for which provision has been made have practically been expended, so that the matters to which they refer have passed beyond our control. And yet we would lead the public to believe that the Parliament is exercising some supervision over the expenditure of the Commonwealth ! I should welcome the return to power of any party which would introduce a sound system of administration. The keeping of a close check upon our expenditure is vitally associated with the progress of the country. The bulk of the workers do not recognise that unless we secure an effectual return for the money we expend they are just as much bondsmen as if they were working for slave masters. I am satisfied that the people are not securing a full return for their money, and that the present Ministry are largely responsible for the steady growth of Federal expenditure. It seems that when men complain of hard times, the only cure is to make those times still harder ! Taxation is steadily increasing, and yet when we rise to object to this increase honorable members opposite endeavour to silence us. Had the members of the Labour Party done their duty they would have insisted upon the Estimates being introduced early in the session, in order that the Parliament might exercise proper control over the expenditure. They do not appear to realize the intimate connexion between the prosperity of the people and the lightening of the load of taxation. </para>

The great bulk of them are as absolutely ignorant of these matters as they are of the origin of the Greek Kalends. The injury inflicted upon the community by the return to Parliament of a body of men who have not fitted themselves by study to deal with the questions that must come before them is so great that a monetary estimate of it cannot he formed. </para>

                        <para>- I have never cast a shadow of blame upon the honorable member. He has recognised that the less the taxation on the mass of the people the better it is for their general prosperity, but he must admit that his position ds different from that of many of those with whom he is associated. The sooner we revert to a sound position of affairs and exercise proper control over the expenditure the sooner will there be a return of prosperity. I am not going to say that the people of Australia cannot bear reasonable taxation. We know that they can, but there is no justification for increasing taxation until it becomes absolutely burdensome. To the extent that we increase taxation, so must the prosperity of the workers be decreased. They are the people with whom we are most directly concerned. Unless they are prosperous the general community cannot hope for prosperity. An improvement in the condition of the great mass of the workers tends to bring about a more contented spirit in the community. Is it reasonable that the Estimates should be submitted to the House so late in the session; that we cannot exercise effective control over the expenditure? Year after year we hear the cry, &#34; We are approaching the end of the session ; most of the amounts provided on the Estimates have been expended, and why should we bother about them now? Next year we will make a better start.&#34; Next session the Estimates are submitted at a still later period. I feel it my duty to criticise the present Government, in respect of both their acts of omission and commission. They have introduced Bill after Bill which must tend to increase the cost of administration. The Commerce Bill, the Trade Marks Bill, and the Copyright Bill, unless they are to be dead letters, must involve a considerable outlay. One measure calls forth another, and in this way the original estimates of the cost of Federation are gradually being outstripped. Take, for instance, the Sugar Bounty Act. The Estimates do not convey an adequate idea of the loss which the people have sustained from the passing of that measure. When it was under consideration nearly four years ago the honorable and learned member- for Angas and myself pointed out the loss that it would entail upon the people of several States. So far as the people of South Australia, Victoria, Western Australia, and Tasmania are concerned, that measure has imposed a heavy burden upon them. If their load of taxation in this regard were lightened, the result would be beneficial. We have come to this ridiculous position, that, at enormous expense to the people, we are paying farmers to Keep some of the richest farm lands in Australia under cultivation. </para>

                <para class="block">Treasury, there would be less occasion to complain of this state of things, because we should know exactly the load which the community is bearing ; but, as a matter of fact, the public is heavily taxed without the Treasury getting the full benefit of the taxation. That the expenditure of the Commonwealth is increasing no one who has studied trie history of Federation can doubt. The estimated cost of the sugar bounty is &#163;200,000, but the real cost is to-day much nearer ,&#163;700,000. I do not blame the Government for wilful wrong-doing, but for ignorance, which is much more harmful to the community, because wilfulness arouses opposition, while allowance is made for ignorance on the part of those who have not time to study the true condition of affairs. The members of a Government are often maleficent, though seldom malevolent. I think that the present Government show great want of knowledge of the affairs of *. country. Certainly, under their administration, the expenditure of the Commonwealth is increasing by leaps and bounds, and while that is so there can be no true prosperity. Of course, the limits of taxation have not yet been reached, but it would be unwise to attempt to tax the community up to anything like exhaustion point. The best insurance fund the Government can have is the amount left to its people to spend in productive works. We depart from sound administration when we fail to recognise the fundamental principle underlying all government, and when, by our taxation, we make the people work harder than is necessary to provide effectively for the maintenance of peace and security. </para>

I do not intend to speak at length, because I feel that the members of the Opposition are quite capable of continuing this debate; but I wish to refer to one or two matters raised by the honorable and learned gentleman. In the first place, I differ from him respecting the suggested appointment of additional Justices to the High Court. I think that it is inadvisable that it should be publicly stated that the work of the High Court is so great that it cannot be coped with, &#34;because, according to a return which has been laid on the table, judicial work has never been done more expeditiously than by the Court. I trust that it will be a long time before it will be necessary to appoint more Justices, and that the Court will not be increased until the States have seen fit. to reduce the number of their Judges. As a layman, I cannot see why litigants should commence in the lowest Court, and proceed through every other Court to the highest tribunal, if they can go direct to the High Court. </para>

                        <para>- It is not the case that the Bill referred to was suggested by the Commonwealth Government. In mv view, this Parliament, in passing the Seat of Government Act, exercised powers conferred upon it by the Constitution. The New South Wales Government and Parliament then took action which was certainly antagonistic to the action taken bv this Parliament. Subsequently, negotiations were held, and the representative of the New South Wales Government then suggested that a technical offence might be committed, and the question referred to the High Court. The introduction of a Bill and other procedure referred to was to carry out that suggestion. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to see the Federal Capital established in New South Wales, and I am ready to do anything within reasonable bounds to bring about a settlement of the question. But I am not at all satisfied with the action of the New South Wales Parliament in this matter, and I am not prepared to allow the matter to be blocked by that body. If this Parliament is not paramount, we must, of course, humbly submit to what the New South Wales Parliament, and people are prepared to propose. If that be the situation, it will be the duty of the representatives of all the other States to refer the matter to the people of Australia, and ascertain if they are agreeable to submit to the decision of New South Wales. Personally, I decline to accept any such dictation. </para>

                    <para>- I think that, before we adopt the resolutions of the Committee of Supply, we should have some assurance from Ministers that the &#34;suggestions made by honorable members during the discussion of the Estimates will receive proper consideration. Referring first to the Defence Department, I would point out that several honorable members have made important suggestions. For example, the view has been strongly expressed that one arm of our defences has been developed to some extent at the expense of that which must be regarded as by far the more important. So far we have had no assurance from the Minister that the question of strengthening our coast and harbor defences will receive the serious attention of the Government. I regard the matter as of paramount importance. I do not go so far as to advocate that we should establish a local navy, because I am quite satisfied that, for trie protection of our commerce on the seas, we shall have to rely upon the Imperial Navy. It is necessary, however, to look to the protection of our coast from invasion and hostile raids, and for that reason I urge that special attention should Le paid to the question of coast and harbor defence. It has been admitted that our vessels of war are absolutely useless, and that in, other respects our coast defences are deficient, and I trust that the Vice-President of the Executive Council will be able to assure us that this matter will receive the fullest attention at an early date. With regard to the arming of the Fremantle forts, a suggestion was recently made in the press - I do not know whether it was officially inspired - that the Government should consider the advisability of substituting 9.2 guns for the 7.5 weapons that were originally proposed. Upon this point we have had no clear expression of the intentions of the Government, and, in view of the general understanding that 7.5 guns should be emp laced, we are entitled to an assurance that the Government will not substitute ordnance of higher calibre, which, though it would cost twice as much money, would probably prove less effective owing to the peculiar situation of Fremantle harbor.. </para>

Moreover, he has acted quite within his province, because he was asked to report upon the best means of promoting settlement, consistent with the preservation of the interests of the natives. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hunt</inline> sets out the different policies that have at various times been suggested in connexion with the administration of the Possession.

                <para>He is perfectly right in making that statement. There is a danger that the handing over of large areas to private syndicates may lead to the wholesale monopolization of the natural resources of the country. We must guard against any such evil. In Australia we have had experience of what can be done in that direction, with the result that at the present time we complain of the wholesale destitution which prevails, and of the tendency of population to flock to our cities. We ought to prevent the development of similar evils in this new Territory, and in administering its affairs to guard against the abuses of the land system with which we are familiar in the Commonwealth.

                        <para>- I do not think that any negotiations of a serious character were entered upon by the Commonwealth Parliament until recently. What it did was to select a site before the necessary territory had been secured. I admit that there is a great divergence of opinion as to the construction to be placed upon section 125 of the Constitution ; but my reading of it is that we should have first acquired the territory. To my mind, no other reasonable interpretation can be placed upon it. It provides that - </para>

                <para class="block">It seems to me that, had it been intended that the selection of the site of the Capital should be made prior to the acquisition of the territory, the words &#34; which shall be hereafter granted,&#34; instead of &#34;which shall have been granted,&#34; would have been used. We should have entered first of all into an arrangement with New South Wales for the acquisition of territory, by grant or otherwise. That having been done, we could then have proceeded to select the particular site within the territory which we desired. That was solely the province of the Commonwealth Parliament. Had we reported to that proceeding we should have avoided the complications that have arisen. It must be remembered that this Parliament was not unanimous as to the eligibility of the site selected. </para>

At the last elections there was a consensus of opinion in favour of Lyndhurst as against Tooma and Dalgety, the only other sites then under consideration. I do not say that the people of New South Wales would prefer Lyndhurst to any other selection that might be made; but having regard to the circumstances in which the ballot was taken in this House, and particularly to the fact that our choice was limited to three sites, I and a number of other honorable members had in the last resort to vote for Dalgety, although we did not approve of its selection. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. New South Wales, by reason of the fact that she will have to give up the necessary territory, is more directly interested in the question than any of the other States. For that reason I think the Government of New South Wales are justified in endeavouring to safeguard the interests of the State. Indeed they would have been false to their trust had they not taken action. A perusal of the correspondence satisfies me that the Premier of New South Wales has taken up a perfectly fair attitude. I know, of course, that the Postmaster-General has a personal interest in this matter, inasmuch as Dalgety is within his electorate. He should remember, however, that other honorable members may view the question from a different standpoint. </para>

Our desire should be to deal with the question in a conciliatory spirit. </para>

                        <para>- How can our decision possibly affect Sydney, having regard to the constitutional provision that the Federal Capital shall not be within 100 miles of that city ? I represent a metropolitan constituency, but no one has heard me advocate that Sydney should be made the Federal Capital. It is recognised by the New South Wales Government that Dalgety is one of the most inaccessible sites that could have been chosen ; it is not even easy of access from Victoria, the most contiguous State. It is at least thirty miles from a railway line, and the difficulties in the way of connecting it with the port its advocates desire to secure at Twofold Bay are almost insurmountable. </para>

Apparently some honorable members, and especially the representatives of Western Australia, voted for the Dalgety site, in the belief that they would be able to come to Twofold Bay by sea, and thence take the train to Dalgety. They could not do that now, and they would not be able to do it for many years to come. </para>

                        <para>- That statement, so far as it goes, is true, but it does not convey the whole truth. Had the representatives of New South Wales stood shoulder to shoulder in support of the site which the people of that State as a whole desired, the position to-day would be different. Had they regarded the wishes of the people of New South Wales when Lyndhurst, Tooma, and Dalgety were before the House, they would have selected Lyndhurst, and there would have been no difficulty about the granting of the territory, even though we may have put the cart before the horse in making our selection before the territory has been granted to us. </para>

                        <para>- That is a matter between the honorable member and his constituents. The honorable member for Fremantle suggested an alteration of the Constitution to allow of the selection of a Capital Site in a State other than New South Wales; but, seeing that New South Wales entered the Federation on the condition that the Federal Capital should be located within her territory, if an attempt is made to alter that condition, the days of the Commonwealth will be numbered, because I think that neither New South Wales nor Queensland will be desirous of remaining in the Federation. If the Constitution is re-opened for amendment in one direction, efforts will be made to amend it in other directions, and possibly there will be an attempt to destroy Federation altogether. </para>

                        <para>- No. While I opposed the acceptance of the draft Constitution Bill, I am prepared to give Federation a fair trial. I wish now to refer to the administration of the Customs Department, and I am sorry that the Minister of Trade and Customs is prevented by illness from being present. It seems to me that the Department <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> being administered in a way which does not make the outlook encouraging. The will of Parliament has been flouted, and the decision of Parliament in regard to the imposition of taxation has been set aside, by the action of officials, taken, with the sanction, if not at the direction, of the Minister. The statements which have appeared in the &#39;daily &#34;newspapers seem to indicate the likelihood of a continuance of this kind of administration, and therefore I think that, before the prorogation, we should have an assurance from the Minister, or from the Government as a whole, that this policy will not be followed in recess, and that the powers conferred on the Department for the safeguarding of the revenue will not be used to inflict hardships on traders and importers. It is, of course, the duty of the officials of the Customs Department to prevent frauds upon the revenue and evasions of the Act. but tyrannical action, hurtful to and almost paralyzing trade and commercial enterprise, must not be allowed by Parliament to be taken. As on a previous occasion I referred at length&#34; to the action of the Department in regard to the importation of harvesters. I would not refer to it again now but for the evidence which we have, from the statements appearing in the newspapers from day to day, that an agitation is being worked up with the object of bringing pressure to bear on the Minister to use his powers to increase the taxation of the community. </para>

                        <para>- I connect my remarks with the item of salaries to be paid to those over-zealous official heads, and if the system is continued, and these officers misuse their powers for purposes of persecution and needlessly harassing interference with legitimate traders, I, shall take further action. If the Minister and his officers continue to take advantage of the powers conferred on them by the Customs Act to override the determinations of Parliament, in regard to Customs taxation, action must be taken by honorable members. I shall carefully watch the administration of this Department, and if I see a determination to override the authority of Parliament, I shall take action with a view- to reducing the salaries of the officials responsible for overriding the law. What I most object to in this connexion is the fact that the Department seems to be overriding the law in compliance &#34;with pressure from outside. Instead of the Minister directing and controlling the affairs of the Department, with the co-operation of the Comptroller-General, we find that a system is being inaugurated under which an outside firm is practically assuming the position of a dictator. I think I may reasonably ask whether honorable members are going to stand idly by and submit to such a state of affairs. </para>

If the Customs officers take their instructions from local manufacturers, who may be in competition with certain importers, they have no proper conception of their duty, and we should bring them to their senses when dealing with their salaries.

I had intended to refer to a number of matters relating to the Post and Telegraph Department, but I have spoken at greater length than I intended, and under the circumstances I shall take an opportunity to discuss them with the Postmaster-General.

                    <para>- I deeply regret that it should be necessary at this stage to enter upon a general discussion of the Federal Capital Site question. This occasion would not have arisen but for the attitude of an honorable member of the Labour Party in raising the whole issue as to the rights of New South Wales under the Constitution. Honorable members are aware that for some time past correspondence has been going on between the Commonwealth Government and the State Government as to the relative constitutional rights of the two authorities. The New South Wales Government claim that as the Constitution requires that the Commonwealth shall select a site within territory which shall have been granted by New South Wales, the grant of territory by the State is a condition precedent to the selection of the site. The Commonwealth Government hold an opposite view. It must be recognised at the outset that there are two parties to the bargain regarding the site of the Federal Capital, Honorable members do not need to be reminded that it was only on condition that provision should be made for the establishment of the Federal Capital in New South Wales that the State entered the Federation. When the Constitution was first referred to the people, New South Wales declined to accept it, and, as the result of a conference subsequently held in Melbourne, the provision now in the Constitution was inserted. The people in New South Wales naturally thought that this provision would confer upon them an advantage which would compensate them to some extent for the sacrifices they were called upon to make, and that, in dealing with their kinsmen across the border they would receive open and fair treatment. They looked to the spirit of, rather than to the actual letter of the compact, and expected that their rights would be fully recognised. In this matter two parties have to be considered ; first the State of New South Wales, which required that provision should be made for the establishment the Capital within its territory, and, secondly, the whole of the people of the Commonwealth, who are vitally concerned in the expenditure that may be incurred in the establishment of the Capital. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">If the people of New South Wales showed any disposition to claim that an enormous amount of money should be spent upon the Capital I should expect the Commonwealth Government to vigorously defend the undoubted rights of the citizens of the rest of the Commonwealth, but, as honorable members know, all that New South Wales asks is that the Capital shall be located in such a position that the spirit of the com pact entered into shall be fully expressed. The site advocated in this House by the majority of the representatives in New South Wales was easily accessible, and possessed the further advantages of picturesqueness, a good climate and fruitful soil. Furthermore, the fact that railway communication had already been provided would have rendered it possible to establish the capital at a minimum of cost. The sites which found favour with the representatives of other States were near the Victorian border. One of them was so close, and was so shut off from New South Wales by a mountain range that if it had been selected the residents of the Federal Capital would have been dependent for their supplies upon Victoria. Surely those who advocated the selection of such a locality must have had curious views as to what was required of them in regard to ho no ring a bond which was supposed to confer such advantage upon New South Wales. The Attorney-General was a strong advocate of the Tooma site. He urged that if the Federal Capital were established at any considerable distance from the border of New South Wales it would be possible for the State authorities to deny the citizens of the Commonwealth access to their territory. That strikes me as being a most fanciful idea. The honorable and learned gentleman afterwards advocated Dalgety, on the ground that provision could be made there for uninterrupted access from the sea. I am afraid that too much study of legal technicalities has rather distorted the honorable member&#39;s mental vision, since he suggested that New South Wales might prevent access to a properly located capital. What would be easier than for any State, if it were so disposed, to hinder Commonwealth servants in the performance of their duties? For instance, if New South Wales chose she could shut her markets to the manufactures of other States, or prevent the Customs officials from collecting any duties. The view put forward on behalf of New South Wales is that in common justice she has the right to decide where the Federal Capital shall be located, provided that such decision does not involve any interference with the obvious rights of the Commonwealth in regard to expenditure or providing means of access. Regarding the course of action suggested by the honorable member for Fremantle, I do not know why it is that such suggestions always emanate from the Labour Party. In New South Wales the people are beginning to be suspicious of that party. </para>

                <para>But this, after all, was not the most audacious and unscrupulous part of the tactics resorted to by these virulent Tories. Wilson sought a pair for Reid, and was offered Kingston. The offer was perfectly fair, both members being away in their respective States. Wilson refused, and with amazing effrontery actually persuaded Deakin to stand out of the division for Reid. Of course, the arrangement was repudiated as soon as Deakin became acquainted with the facts. Wilson&#39;s next move was to induce Spence, then present in the House, to give a pair to Conroy, absent in Sydney. This little plot also miscarried, when Spence learned that Wilson had refused pairs to several absent Home Rulers, and that Conroy, though favourable to Reid&#39;s amendment, intended voting eventually for the motion. . . A similar little scheme was tried in reference to Willis and McLean, of whose intentions respecting Home Rule, Wilson held at the time no authentic knowledge whatever. It subsequently transpired that McLean does not intend to vote at all, and that Willis will probably follow suit. Wilson&#39;s impudence reached its zenith, however, when he sought to get a &#34; live &#34; pair for McColl, absent in America, whose opinion respecting the motion nobody had been authorized to interpret. It speaks well for the virility of the Home Rule motion when opponents find it necessary to resort to such dishonest manipulations of votes in order to compass its defeat.

When you find the enemy knows as much, if not more, than your so-called friends&#39; intentions than you do, the position calls for careful review. For instance, Kelly said : &#34; I warn all who may be ready to take advantage of the facilities offered by our ill-used bathrooms to hide themselves when the division bells begin to ring - because they have not the courage to record their votes on this question - that by so doing they will not give satisfaction to either party in this country to whom this motion is of peculiar interest. He had hardly finished when one &#34; friend &#34; of Home Rule, a division seeming imminent, fled to the bathroom. Two others suddenly cleared out for Sydney without arranging for effective pairs; while another division dodger was hiding in a Victorian up-country town, and could not be drawn even by urgent telegram. </para>

                        <para>- From the information which that article contained, I say that it must have been either written or inspired by a member of this House. The only persons who could have written or inspired it were the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, and the honorable member for Coolgardie. It contains the gist of conversations which took place between myself and those honorable members when we were arranging for pairs. With the exception of the honorable member for Wentworth, who was cognisant of what was going on, nobody, save the two honorable members to whom I have referred, could have supplied the information which is contained in the article which I have quoted. I repeat that they must either have written or inspired it. </para>

                        <para>- As the honorable member for Northern Melbourne has said, it is too good for him. I feel that it is. He was recently magnanimous enough to make a certain donation for the purpose of founding scholarships in Victoria for the writing of poetry. I do not call this article &#34; poetry.&#34; Certainly it is not the class of poetry with which I should expect the honorable and learned member to sympathize. Therefore, the only conclusion which I can draw is that there is some connexion - some sort of an underground sewer leading from this House to certain centres in Sydney, through which information in reference to honorable members is conveyed. I look upon this article, not merely as an insult to myself, and the honorable member for Wentworth, but as an insult to the whole House, and I feel that I am perfectly justified in calling attention to these low-down dirty methods of the gutter press. </para>

What he was about to say, when he was interrupted by the honorable member, I do not know. Had he attributed to the honorable member for Coolgardie an action which he had disclaimed, he would have been out of order, but, as I understood him, the honorable member was simply expressing the impression that he had formed in his own mind. </para>

                    <para>- It is seldom that I trouble the House with a personal explanation, but I feel that the remarks made by the honorable member for Corangamite - and I believe that the usages of Parliament compel me to refer to him as the &#34;honorable&#34; member - in reference to myself, call for a reply. I have already denied the authorship of the article, and as the honorable member has chosen on a. previous occasion to doubt my word, I shall not repeat that denial. If it will please him, however, I will say at once that I accept the responsibility for every statement which appears in the article in reference to himself ; and that I am prepared to accept that responsibility here, or in any other place that he may choose. The honorable member, during the course of the last twenty-four hours, has sent me several impertinent messages, and I wish to inform him that I am not a dog to be whistled to heel by any cad that calls- </para>

                        <para>- Having decided to bring this question, which relates to many matters that are by no means pleasant, before the House, I felt, it desirable, in accordance with a well-established custom, to acquaint the honorable members concerned of my intention, in order that they might be present. I therefore asked the honorable member for Yarra - not impertinently, I think - if he would inform the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, and the honorable member for Coolgardie, that I should be glad if they would arrange to be present when the House met this morning. I appeal to the honorable member for Yarra to support my statement. The honorable member acquiesces by nodding his head. As the honorable member for Coolgardie was not present when the House met this morning, I sent him a further message, inquiring whether he would be present in the Chamber immediately after the luncheon adjournment. I think that the honorable member for Kalgoorlie will admit that the message was not an impertinent one. </para>

                <para class="block">My object in submitting this motion is to provide against the contingency, which I do not anticipate, that at 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday next there may not be a quorum present, although a quorum may be in attendance later ?n the afternoon.&#39; The proposal is therefore simply made by way of precaution. As honorable members are aware, Tuesday next will be a public holiday in this city, and some honorable members have expressed a desire that it should be recognised by the adjournment of the House. That is a proposal which, for two reasons, does not commend itself to me - first, because I hesitate to believe that this or any similar occasion would justify the adjournment of the Commonwealth Parliament; and second, because, at this stage of the&#34; session&#34;, with the large volume of work before us, the casting away of even an afternoon is not to be lightly undertaken. It mav be anticipated that complaint will soon be made that&#39; there is not sufficient time for the discussion of questions submitted to the House. In the event of our agreeing to an adjournment over Tuesday, we should be reproached, and properly reproached, with having gone out df our way to deprive honorable members of a legitimate opportunity for work. On the other hand, it would be idle to affect to ignore that a number of honorable members may, for one reason or another, desire to be elsewhere on Tuesday afternoon. That being so, it appears to me perfectly legitimate to examine the business-paper, to ascertain whether, with the quorum which I have no doubt we shall obtain, we shall not be able to proceed with the consideration of non-contentious but necessary business, without requiring the attendance of all who would desire to be present if any questions were pushed to a division. Bv a readjustment of the business of the Parliament we can meet the. convenience of honorable members so far as we are entitled so to do, and at the same time make some real advance with the work of the session. </para>

Tuesday will be a public holiday, and the chief event of the afternoon will be the great race meeting ; but there are gatherings of other kinds at which some of my honorable friends may desire to be present. It has been the custom for Ministers to endeavour to study the wishes of honorable members, as long as the public business does not suffer. </para>

                        <para>- No; but an excellent precedent can now be established. What I shall ask the House to do on Tuesday next is to listen to an exposition of the provisions of the Electoral Bill, on the motion for the second reading. This measure which has been sent down from the Senate, is based on the report of a Select Committee. It has been amended in some particulars by the Senate, and will require to be carefully explained before its consideration can be proceeded with. Honorable members will probably desire to see the explanation in print before being called on to deal with the Bill. The Copyright Bill, which is next on the business-paper, is in the same position. As honorable members are aware, it is an extremely technical measure, dealing with a branch of the law which is in itself complex, and with Imperial law, as well as with existing State copyrights, that also call for full explanation. </para>

                        <para>- - It will, unless any honorable member is prepared to continue the discussion. No attempt will be made to take those second readings during the afternoon. Then we have the Amendments Incorporation Bill, which is in no sense a party measure. It is designed to enable amendments made by the Parliament to be incorporated in the principal Acts, in order that the difficulty sometimes experienced in ascertaining in what respect an Act has been altered may be avoided. In addition to these, we have the Representation Bill, which has been returned with amendments by the Senate, the exposition of which will not occupy much time. Even if the whole afternoon be occupied by Ministers in moving the second reading of these measures, our time will be profitably employed, because we shall be dealing with business that would otherwise have to be taken at other sittings. I feel that no apology is necessary for asking honorable members to meet at 2.30 p.m. as usual, but do feel a good deal of diffidence in making this proposal, because of the duties that it will entail upon the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff and the officers of the House generally,, at a time when they would otherwise be free. I would venture to bespeak from you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> such a re-adjustment of their duties as will enable as many as possible who desire to take advantage of the holiday to be absent, and to make arrangements for those who remain to have a it equal amount of leisure at some other time during the sittings of &#34;the House. If this be done, we shall be imposing practically no&#39; burden upon those to whom we are so much indebted in connexion with the transaction of our business. </para>

                        <para>- But, I have no doubt that there has been pressure from other quarters. I do not quarrel with the proposal to meet on Tuesday, but I object to the manner in which the honorable and learned gentleman proposes to -gain his end. If we are to meet on Tuesday, let us do so as usual, without any qualification, and let the Government take full responsibility for1 what is done. The Prime Minister says that he does not think that the National Parliament should adjourn for a race meeting. That statement is published in both the Melbourne newspapers this morning. But he proposes to bend the National Parliament to the ends of the race meeting - to make it wait until- the Cup has been run. That is what the motion means. &#34;What is proposed is that if there is not a quorum! present at half-past 2 p.m., the Speaker shall wait until there is a quorum, and then take the chair. If that is not making the National Parliament wait on <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> race meeting, I should like to know what proposal could be interpreted in that way? </para>

                        <para>- That appears to me the whole trouble. He has asked us not to take advantage of the absence of honorable members should there not be a quorum present. That, surely, is making our arrangements to suit the race meeting. In my opinion, the Prime Minister, if he asks the House to meet on Tuesday should take the responsibility of obtaining a quorum at the usual hour, and should arrange the business in the ordinary way, making no exception because of the race meeting. I do not think that he is consistent in declaring that he will not take notice of the race meeting by adjourning over Tuesday, and then proposing to recognise it in the fixing of the hour of meeting and the disposition of business for that clay. As a matter of fact, he has arranged a special race programme for Tuesday next. He is going to take T do not know how many matters of a non-contentious character early in the afternoon. </para>

When he declined to recognise the race meeting a healthy puritanical moral blast pervaded the Chamber, but subsequently he proposed to bend this Parliament and its business to suit the convenience of members attending the races. I desire that the House shall take no cognizance of the races, either in regard to the hour of its meeting or in regard to the arrangement of its business, and I hope that honorable members will agree to meet at half-past 2 to proceed with business in the usual way. </para>

                    <para>- I am not satisfied with the proposal of the Prime Minister. We cannot lose sight of the fact that Tuesday next is a public holiday, and if we meet then we shall deprive the officials of the House and a large number of those employed in the Government Printing Office of a holiday, and of the opportunity to meet their friends at various gatherings. Of course, every one in Melbourne does not go to the races on Cup Day. Last year, according to the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, between 5,000 and 6,000 persons were down the Bay at a Sunday-school picnic. Unquestionably a number of honorable members wish to see the Cup run for, and will be there no matter what arrangements be come to in regard to the hour of meeting. Although I shall not be present myself, I would be the last to try to prevent others from going ; but I wish to point out that each week-end many honorable members go to their homes in Sydney or Adelaide, and if the House meets, according to the arrangement of the Prime Minister, on Tuesday, we shall have to travel back oyer distances of more than 500 miles, at a time when the railway trains will be crowded and the service disorganized, to sit here perhaps for only a couple of hours. The Prime Minister recognises by his proposal that a large number of his supporters desire to go to the Cup, or to take advantage of the holiday. There should be no hypocrisy about this matter. If race-going is wicked, we should not countenance it in any way ; but as none of us holds that opinion, why should we embarrass those w&#39;ho wish to go, and prevent our officials from going. by pretending to work, although we know that practically nothing will, be done ? </para>

                        <para>- I have never bought a ticket in Tattersall&#39;s sweep, nor do I bet, because it is mathematically certain that the odds are always against the backer of horses. But that is no reason why I should interfere with another who is wasting his money in that way. It is because other people&#39;s money is so frequently taken for the purpose that I object to the opportunities afforded for gambling. There is no doubt that the large assemblages upon our racecourses tend to keep the sport in a healthy state. The criticisms directed to the methods adopted by owners and riders must have a tendency to check improper practices, and on the whole the influence exerted is a good one. I think that we should do well to adjourn until Wednesday next, and avoid bringing honorable members from other States to do half a day&#39;swork. I think that we sit a great deal too often as it is. We have only to look round the Chamber and notice the small number of honorable members present, in order to find a basis for this conclusion. The Prime Minister so far recognises the position in regard to next Tuesday&#39;s sitting that he has expressed the hope that no honorable member will, on that occasion, call attention to the state of the House. It seems to me that he is unreasonable in expecting that honorable members who have been called from their homes under such conditions as he proposes will be in such air amiable frame of mind that they will comply with his wishes. If I thought that the Prime Minister would not regard an amendment to adjourn until Wednesday next at half-past 2 as equivalent to a want of confidence motion, I should move in that direction. I would urge Him to treat the whole matter as a non-party question, relating merely to the advisability, or otherwise, of asking honorable members to&#62; assemble to perform half a day&#39;s work. The motion now before us, if it means anything, is intended to result in our adjourning over Cup Day, and meeting in the evening, and I urge that even if we came here under such circumstances many of us would be too tired, after having attended some holiday celebration, to devote our attention to useful legislative work. I think that the Prime Minister might very well yield to the wishes expressed by a large number of honorable members, because he must see that no good purpose could be served by our meeting on Tuesday. 1 would direct attention to another point <inline font-style="italic">i:t</inline> connexion with honorable members who come from other States, and who have te* put up at hotels. At present the accommodation afforded is strained to the utmost, and in some cases double rates are being charged. Therefore, under the most favorable, conditions, visitors will have to put up with serious inconvenience. I cannot say too much in condemnation of this attempt to throw dust in the eyes of the public - to pretend that honorable members will meet on Tuesday to transact the business of the country. As a matter of fact, the chances are that nothing practical will be done. A Chad band is tic attempt is being made to blind the public, but I warn the Prime Minister that there will be no cant or humbug on the part of honorable members on this side of the House. I would point out, further, that not a single Government office will be open upon Cup Day. All the State Departments with which we are connected will be closed, and we shall not be in a position to obtain from them such information as we may require. And yet it is pretended that we can assemble here, and carry on the public business as usual. The position only needs to be stated to show its absurdity, and how hypocritical is the attitude of the Government. I warn the Prime Minister that if his motion be carried I shall be here next Tuesday, and that I shall want to know where every Minister is, and where every honorable member is, and I shall have something to say with regard to those who are absent. All honorable members who support the Government proposal will, if they are not in their places on Tuesday have to be brought to account. We have been told by the Prime Minister that the programme of business to be submitted will be of a non-contentious character; in other words, that we may stay away if we like. One of the most extraordinary features about this House is that many honorable members appear to consider that by coming here and getting their names placed on the attendance roll they are discharging their full duty as Members of Parliament. If the Prime Minister read the Scriptures, he would know what happens to hypocrites, and of the place that is reserved for them. </para>

Upon that assumption, I performed some work of my own, and on coming to the House later discovered that it had been sitting for two or three hours. Honorable members who come early on Tuesday will have to wait for some time until others turn up. If it be desired that we should sit on Tuesday, we should meet at the usual hour. But it is not fair to ask honorable members to attend upon the chance of a quorum being present, or to compel them to wait till a quorum puts in an appearance. In addition, if the motion be carried in its present form, special arrangements will have to be made in the Government Printing Office. </para>

If the Prime Minister will say definitely that he intends the House to meet at the ordinary hour on Tuesday, no doubt there will be a quorum present. I am certain that there will not be more than two-thirds of the House absent at the gathering to which reference has been made. I understand that it is a race meeting of some kind. Of course, some honorable members may attend here to assist in forming a quorum, and then feel that they have discharged their duty for the afternoon. But I object to being called upon to wait about the House until a quorum of members is in attendance. The Government should either say that they intend to meet on Tuesday at the ordinary hour, or that they propose to meet at a later hour. The present proposal is neither fish, flesh, fowl, nor good red herring. I do not consider that the arrangement which it contemplates is fair to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> although I do not know whether he wishes to be elsewhere on that day. : But, in any case, it is not fair that either he or honorable members generally should be asked to wait - possibly to no purpose - about the parliamentary buildings until a quorum arrives. I object to the uncertainty to which the motion will give rise, lt has been said that suspense is the worst of all conditions, and therefore I say we ought to know the best or the worst at once.- </para>

                        <para>- The members &#39;of the other branch of the Legislature will be free, and it seems to me a pity to bring back all the officials of Parliament upon that day. I certainly think that the honorable member for Parramatta and the honorable and learned member for Werriwa were somewhat unjust in their remarks. If they wish to suppress racing let them do so openly, but by submitting a straight-out motion upon the matter they would be passing censure upon the Lieutenant-Governor of Victoria, and upon almost every high official in the State. Personally, if I wished to see the Melbourne Cup run I should do so. The day upon which that event is decided is a public holiday - a day upon which there will be hundreds of picnics. It is a day which is set apart for meeting old friends, and which is usually spent out of town. I should like the Prime Minister to follow the usual custom, and to consent to an adjournment of the House over Tuesday. But after the speech of the deputy leader of the Opposition I suppose that it is hopeless to ask for any concession. If the honorable member for Parramatta were less! bitter on every occasion, I feel certain that he would earn the good feeling of the House more than he does. </para>

                        <para>- I am not referring to what the honorable member says, but to the way in which he says it. I can quite understand the feelings of honorable members who represent distant States. I am sure that a journey of 500 miles at the beginning and end of each week must have a bad effect upon the nerves. If honorable members wish parliamentary business to proceed next week, let us sit later than, usual upon Wednesday and Thursday. I do trust that upon this occasion the Prime Minister, with his well-known courtesy, will see his way clear to propose an adjournment until Wednesday. By so doing, I think he would meet the desire of a majority of the House - at all events, he would comply with the wishes of a majority of the Victorian representatives. </para>

                        <para>- If I were in the position of the honorable member probably I would. I hope, for more reasons than one, that the Government will proceed with business on Tuesday. We have done practically little business this session, and it is about time that the House settled down to work. There has been a good deal of <inline font-style="italic">unnecessary</inline> talk. If the Government do not intend to meet at the ordinary hour on Tuesday, I think that the House should adjourn until Wednesday. But in view of the lateness of the session- I ask the Prime Minister whether the Government intend to sit on Friday evenings, instead of adjourning shortly after 4 o&#39;clock upon that day? I think that it is absolutely es&#39;sential to do so if we are to close the session at an early date. I protest against the form of this motion. If the proposal of the Prime Minister be carried, every official of the House, besides the employes in the Government Printing Office, will be called upon to attend here at half -past 2 o&#39;clock awaiting the pleasure of honorable members. That is scarcely fair. We should fix some definite time at which these officers should be at their posts. </para>

The honorable member for Parramatta immediately explained that he was not conscious of having exhibited any bitterness. Similarly, I entertain no bitter feeling upon this question. I only regret that upon a paltry proposal relating to the time of meeting of this .House, the Prime Minister has not sufficient backbone to stake his own opinion. He is absolutely afraid to do what he believes to be right, lest he may offend the susceptibilities of some honorable members in the Labour corner. </para>

                        <para>- How is the Prime Minister consulting, my convenience? If it suits me to attend the Melbourne Cup meeting, I shall do so; if it does not, I shall stay away. If the Prime Minister had the slightest sense of the dignity and responsibility of his position, he would refuse to be dictated to by honorable members in the Labour corner. He would decline to leave it to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> to take the chair whenever a quorum put in an appearance. He would say either that the House shall meet at half-past 2 o&#39;clock on Tuesday, or that it shall not meet until the following day. It is perfectly ridiculous for the honorable and learned gentleman to talk about consulting my convenience. Any one would imagine that I was a &#34;regular race-goer.&#34; I regret that the Prime Minister has not seen fit to submit a motion definitely fixing the hour at which the House shall meet on Tuesday. It has been properly pointed out that the proposal is one that affects not only the officers of the House, but pressmen and others whose duties require their attendance here while the Parliament is sitting. The amendment indicated by the  deputy  leader of the Opposition meets with my entire approval. I certainly think that the House should meet at 2.30 p.m. </para>

                        <para>- The Government proposal is one that will allow those who wish to go to the Cup meeting to come here when it suits them. It is a proposal, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> that you should be here throughout the afternoon, and that after the race for the Cup is over you shall make inquiries, and, on learning that there is a quorum in attendance, call the House together. It is a piece of political hypocrisy. It is an attempt to curry favour with a section of the citizens, and also with a certain section in this House. The Prime Minister should rise to the dignity of his position and say that this House shall meet either on Tuesday or Wednesday next at a definite hour. Although I favour the meeting of the House on Tuesday, I would point out that the Senate has decided to adjourn until Wednesday next, it having initiated Tuesday sittings only this week. The Prime Minister has stated that this decision is due to the fact that the Senate business-paper has been cleared. It appears to me, however, that that explanation is a poor one, inasmuch as another place has yet to deal with the Estimates. We have now been discussing this matter for nearly an hour and a half.

                        <para>- The remark made by the honorable member for Bourke can have no personal application, so far as I am concerned, because, although I was in the Chamber throughout the morning, I took no part in the debate. Such an accusation comes with ill grace from the Government whip, considering that he has been canvassing honorable members on all sides of the House in regard to the Government proposal. He did not ask me whether I was in favour of the House meeting on Tuesday, but he certainly interrogated the honorable member for Macquarie and the honorable member for New England with reference to the matter. It is singular that it should be necessary for the Government whip to canvass honorable members with regard to such a paltry matter as the adjournment of the House for an hour or two. The Government proposal is one that is degrading to the Parliament. The House ought to meet at 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, and the Government should be prepared to take the responsibility of calling on honorable members to meet at that hour. </para>

                        <para>- I said, in a jocular way, that I should have to make a strong protest against such an adjournment. If we are not to meet at the usual hour on Tuesday let us adjourn over the day. There should not be recourse to tactics of this kind. I do not attend race meetings, but if we decide to adjourn until Wednesday I shall be able to spend Tuesday in my own home. The proposal made by the Government does not redound to their credit. It means that even if the House does not meet at the usual hour the officers will have to be in attendance. If a large number of honorable members desire to see the Cup race I do not wish to prevent their doing so ; but I hold that the proposition made by the Government is a piece of political cant and hypocrisy. &#39; I shall vote for the House meeting at the usual, hour, .but if others desire an adjournment until Wednesday, by all means let us have it. </para>

                    <para>- Reference has been made to the action of the Government whip in canvassing the Opposition in regard to this proposal. To my mind, however, no exception can be taken to his conduct, because honorable members of the Opposition have not been slow to canvass some of the Government supporters. I promised to vote for an adjournment over Tuesday, because of its being a public holiday, and also because I thought that we should have some consideration for the officers of the House. We are dealing so slowly with the business set down for consideration that we might well consider the advisableness of increasing the number of the days of meeting. I mentioned this matter nearly a month ago. Some honorable members are constantly speaking of the inconvenience suffered by those who have to travel many miles by rail every Tuesday in order to attend here, but they have little regard for those who cannot return to their homes at the week-end, and1 have to remain in Melbourne month after month while Parliament is in session.. I have come to the conclusion that we should meet not only at the usual hour on Tuesday, but on Wednesday and Thursday mornings, or else extend the Friday sittings. If we do not take action in this direction Christmas will be upon us before we have dealt with half the business still awaiting our consideration. - </para>

I take the opportunity to say that the honorable member has not materially assisted the business of the House by the series of ill-con1- sidered lectures which he has delivered from time to time. The question before us, however, is not whether the business of the Parliament should be expedited nor whether the honorable member should endeavour to make himself better fitted to deal with it. I have risen more with the object of showing the Prime Minister how he can adapt his proposals to suit the convenience of honorable members. It is evident from what has occurred this afternoon that the honorable gentleman has been led to submit this motion by the fact that he recognises that it will be difficult to form a quorum at the usual hour. </para>

                        <para>- That being so, honorable members, having assisted to form a quorum, will be able to avail themselves of the first chance to return to the races, and the Prime Minister will be able to do what he pleases. Why should we not meet at 10.30 a.m. ? I am sure that honorable members would cheerfully assemble at that hour. In that event, as soon as a quorum had been formed and the pretence made that the number of members present was sufficient to allow of the proper consideration of the business of the country, nearly the whole House would be able to slip away to the races, and allow the measures submitted to pass without proper consideration. Why should it be necessary, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> to place you in the invidious position of being the only representative of the people prepared to attend here from 2.30 p.m. onwards? Why should not other honorable members be placed in the same position ? The Government do not care whether honorable members attend or not. As long as there is a quorum at the outset of the proceedings they will be satisfied. I earnestly suggest to the Prime Minister the advisableness of calling the House together at 10.30 a.m. We should then be able to leave the Prime Minister to do what he pleased. The business which the Government bring forward is seldom considered by the Cabinet, and why should it be necessary for the House in its corporate capacity to carefully consider that which the Ministry have not thought fit to consider. It will be easy for some of us to attend the House at 2.30 p.m., and leave in time to see the race for the Cup. There is, for instance, the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, who has the free run of the fire brigade station, and will be able to charter a fast team to cover the distance between the House and Flemington in time to enable him to see the great race. But how are we all going to get from the Chamber to the race-course in half-an-hour ? </para>

The motion was submitted to secure the transaction of public business, while studying the convenience of honorable members. I am indifferent whether it be carried or whether we meet at the usual hour without qualification. In the latter event the programme which I outlined need not be adhered to; but business will be proceeded with in its ordinary course. The special arrangements I spoke of were suggested to meet the convenience of honorable members, without interfering with the transaction of public affairs. The matter, however, is entirely in the hands of the House. </para>

                    <para>- I have a few words to say about the Federal Capital question, but I wish to address myself to it in no provincial spirit. It is provided in the Constitution that the Federal Capital shall be located in New South Wales, and the constitutional right of that State should be recognised. Questions were asked this morning which indicated a desire on the part of some honorable members that the Constitution should be amended, in order to admit of the establishment of the Federal Capital in some other portion of the Commonwealth. The Prime Minister did not make his position clear; but I would point out that any attempt to deprive New South Wales of the right conferred upon her by the Constitution would be viewed by the people of that State with such intense indignation that the Federal Union would probably be dissolved. I hope that the Government will entirely ignore the narrow view of the question which has recently been put forward, and that a more generous view will be taken of what is due to New South Wales. The honorable member for Fremantle is one of those who believes that Western Australia is entitled to have the Transcontinental Railway constructed, but I would point out that no compact was entered into so far as that matter was concerned. New South Wales has an absolutely clear constitutional claim to the Capital, because the condition that it should be established within her territory was embodied in the Constitution. I am sorry that this matter has not been approached in a broader and more liberal spirit. The question should not have been discussed from the stand-point of Victoria or New South Wales only, but with consideration for the interests of the people of all the States. I did not approve of the choice of Dalgety. The honorable member for Maranoa has attempted to fix upon a number of the representatives of New South Wales the responsibility &#34;for having joined in the selection of that site; but it must be pointed out that they voted in favour of Dalgety merely because it was the less objectionable of the two sites to which the choice of honorable members was narrowed down in the final ballot. Although the position is not clearly expressed in the Constitution, there is no doubt that the intention was that the Federal Capital should be situated at some point as near as possible to the 100 miles limit, and this fact should be held clearly in view. Some honorable members have expressed themselves as willing that the Constitution should be amended to permit of the establishment of the Federal Capital in Sydney. Apart from the question, whether or not that would be a wise proceeding, it seems extraordinary that honorable members who are now favouring Sydney should have previously voted in favour of a site as far away as possible from that metropolis. It has been urged that the New South Wales Parliament are throwing obstacles In the way of a settlement of the question, but the Premier of New South Wales, in his last letter, suggests that some amicable arrangement should be arrived at, and I think that his suggestion should be acted upon. I do not know that very much good can result from the consideration by this Parliament of the resolution passed by the State Legislature, but we shall not lose dignity by complying with the request made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers.</inline> On the other hand, we shall evince a desire to meet the State authorities in every possible way. Possibly a mistake was made by the New South Wales Parliament in omitting the Dalgety site from their resolution, but there is no reason why we should show resentment upon that score. Our efforts should be directed to avoiding friction. I am sorry to say that considerable feeling has been evinced by some honorable members against the mother State, and I trust that this will not be accentuated. We should receive the advances of the New South Wales Government with courtesy and consideration. </para>

                        <para>- My feaT is that we shall have to go on trying for many months longer, but that is no reason why we should relax our efforts. The difficulty which now presents itself arises out of the doubt which exists as to the powers of this Parliament in regard to the selection of a site. There are those who hold that the selection rests entirely with this Parliament. On the other hand, there are those who contend that our powers are limited to the selection of a site within territory which has been granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth as the result of negotiation with the Government of New South Wales. To my mind, there is a considerable amount of weight in that argument. I base mv view upon the fact that when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton was Prime Minister - and it will be admitted that he was well qualified to express an opinion upon this subject - he refused to take any action until the New South Wales Government had taken certain preliminary steps. </para>

                        <para>- I know that when I urged his Government to deal with the question more expeditiously, one of the reasons advanced for the delay was his inability to get the New South Wales Government to take certain action which he deemed to be necessary. What was the nature of that action? The Government of New South Wales were asked to indicate to the Commonwealth the territory within which they were prepared to grant a suitable site. Unfortunately, the then Premier of New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> See, did not take the State Parliament into his confidence. That, however, is not a matter with which we have to deal. But the fact remains that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton did not take action until he was handed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver&#39;s</inline> report. We were then invited to consider the respective merits of the different sites upon which that officer had reported. The present Government take up the position that under the Constitution this Parliament has a right to determine the territory within which the Capital shall be located. That is the point in dispute, and the only way in which it can be settled is by referring it to the High Court, which is the custodian of the Constitution. Instead of raising side issues, it seems to me that we ought at as early a date as possible to secure an authoritative decision as to the powers of the Commonwealth and the State in respect of the selection of the Federal territory. I sympathize with the stand which is being taken by the New South Wales Parliament in regard to the selection of Dalgety. I do not think that site is a suitable one in many respects. Before the Seat of Government could be transferred to Dalgety an enormous expenditure would require to be incurred. The initial cost in this direction has been estimated at ,&#163;3,000,000, whereas the Commonwealth Departments could be transferred to other eligible sites at a cost of less than ,&#163;500,000. But, even if the New South Wales authorities could be reconciled to our selection of Dalgety, other difficult problems would then have to be faced. For instance, before anything could be done in the way of transferring the Seat of Government from Melbourne the question would arise: &#34;Who should bear the expense of providing the necessary means of communication?&#34; Whilst the Commonwealth should incur the cost of railway construction within Federal territory, it certainly should not be asked to defray the cost of railway construction through New South Wales or Victorian territory. Further, it does not appear that we can compel the States to provide necessary facilities for transport to the Seat of Government. If this Parliament seriously desires to comply with the provisions of the Constitution, it will reconsider its decision and select a site which is more accessible than is Dalgety. As far as I am personally concerned, I should prefer to see Albury chosen rather than Dalgety, because the selection of the former would ultimately cater to the Victorian interests no more than would the selection of the latter, whilst the expenditure involved in transferring the Seat of Government there would be very much less. I say that the interests of New South Wales should be given some consideration. </para>

                        <para>- That is merely the honorable member&#39;s opinion. I believe that the Parliament of New South Wales honestly desire to secure a settlement of this matter. It has very substantial reason for objecting to the selection of the Dalgety site. There is another matter in these Estimates to which I desire to allude. Unfor tunately owing to the lateness of the sitting - a suitable opportunity did not present itself to deal with it last night. I refer to the attitude taken up by the late Attorney-General with respect to the High Court. From the papers submitted to us, we find that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> laid it down as a principle that, as Melbourne is the Seat of Government for the time being, the sittings of the Court should centre here, and that he took certain steps to prevent it from sitting in the different States Capitals. As I understand that an opportunity will be given us at a later stage to deal with this matter, I shall not further discuss it. I trust that the Prime Minister will recognise the advisableness of promptly dealing with the constitutional question relating to the Capital Site, and of determining the respective powers of the Commonwealth and the State of New South Wales in regard to the selection not only of the territory, but of the site itself. </para>
