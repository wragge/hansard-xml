                        <para>- I wish to know from the Prime Minister if he thinks it fair, at this stage of the. session, to place the consideration of three other measures before that of the Seat of Government Bill ; in other words, does he consider it right' to defer the consideration of the measure until the last moment of the session? I should like to hear from him some reason for this extraordinary, step. </para>

                        <para>- I thought that the honorable member knew that this was to be done. On Saturday at least half-a-dozen members of one party and another spoke to me on the subject, and were in favour of the course which is now being proposed, since they were leaving Melbourne that evening, and would not return until late to-day, or because they wished to have time to read and consider the report of the Minister's speech on the motion for the second reading. </para>

                            <para>- The Government were urged not to proceed with the measure immediately, and I said that it would suit us to postpone its further consideration until after the three measures to which the honorable member has referred have been dealt with. Two of them should occupy practically no time, while the third - the Copyright Bill - should not keep us very long, because it is proposed to omit the contentious provisions which it contains. We can resume the consideration of the Seat of Government Bill this afternoon, when other honorable members have returned if we finish the business to which I have alluded. </para>

                        <para>- In this morning's newspapers, there is an account of the bursting of another cartridge at Castlemaine. It seems to me that the ammunition is not entirely at fault in these cases, and I ask the Vice-President of the Executive Council if he will' request the Minister of Defence to see that in any further inquiry that is made, the condition of the rifles, as well as the composition of the ammunition, is looked into. In my opinion, the bursting may be due partly to want of care of the rifles. If rifles are neglected after cordite has been fired in them, and nickel-plated bullets are used, they are far more apt to choke, and thus cause an explosion, than was the case with the old rifles, in which the twist of the bore was not so great, and which were not corroded by the black powder used in them, while the missile was a soft leaden bullet. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister of Defence made ah inquiry into this matter, a month or two ago, on the first occasion of the bursting of a rifle, and it was confidently hoped that there would not be a recurrence of these accidents. The Department view this matter very seriously. </para>

                    THOMSON (North Sydney). ' - I wish to make a personal explanation in connexion with a paragraph appearing in this morning's newspapers about the payment of expenses to two senators, one of whom, in the last recess, visited New Guinea, and the other Northern Queensland. My name is mentioned in the paragraph, and the implication is, made by one newspaper, at any rate, that the Cabinet minute which guided us in sanctioning the expenditure had been strained to some extent. Both the late Treasurer and myself were against the system of the payment of these expenses, and would have declined to authorize it, had we seen our way to do so; but the Cabinet minute on the subject states that members travelling on Commonwealth business shall receive such expenses, and we found that the two gentlemen whose cases have been specially singled out for remark were entitled by all precedents to be paid their expenses. A number of honorable members visited Queensland, and another party visited Western Australia., and had their expenses paid.

                            <para>- The members to whom I have referred could not have made the whole of their journeys by railways. One went to Northern Queensland to make inquiries relating to the sugar industry, which was the object of the parliamentary party which went there, while the other visited' New Guinea, to inquire into matters of Commonwealth concern, and furnished a valuable report on his return. But, although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Staniforth'</inline> Smith went to New Guinea <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> the South Sea Islands, and incurred an expenditure of between £200 and ^300, he asked the reimbursement of his expenses only from Samarai to the gold-fields, and back to Australia, and received only between <inline font-style="italic">£20</inline> and ^30. In my opinion, there should be a definite understanding, in this matter, because, in the present position of affairs, questions arise which it is very difficult to satisfactorily settle. The late Treasurer and myself, however, felt that, following precedents and the Cabinet minute on the subject, we were bound to sanction these payments, and I take the fullest responsibility for what was done. </para>

                            <para>- May I, at the commencement of this sitting, call the attention of honorable members to the fact that it is grossly unfair to the honorable member addressing the House to carry on conversations in a loud tone of voice. I would ask those who wish to converse either to go outside for that purpose, or else to do so in such low tones that honorable members who desire to follow the debate will not be prevented from doing so. </para>

                            <para>- In this Bill an attempt is being made to amalgamate the laws of six States into something like a harmonious whole. The fact that the measure has been discussed at some length in another Chamber is not sufficient in itself to enable me to form any conclusion with regard to it. So far as I have been able to gather from a glance at the Bill, the laws of the States have been partly embodied and partly discarded, whilst new provisions have been adopted, which are at variance with international law. I see great difficulty in dealing with this very complicated question at the close of the session, and I had hoped that the Minister would consent to allow the Bill to remain over until next session. The public now know where they are under the States laws, but it is proposed to hurriedly bring into operation 3 measure which will alter the whole of the conditions affecting copyright in Australia. It is urged that we shall be able under the Bill to take advantage of international copyright law, but any benefit that may accrue in that direction will not compensate for the injury that may be inflicted upon individuals by passing a measure without full discussion. If this Bill had been introduced at the beginning of the session, its consideration would have occupied at least a month, and I fail to see why we should be asked to pass it without subjecting it to criticism, which, when not carried to extremes, is always in the interests of the public, and" affords one of the best safeguards against slovenly law-making. The Bill appears tome to foe framed upon two conflicting principles. When the Electoral Act was before us, I pointed out that it had been framed upon two conflicting principles, but I was laughed at for my pains. What has been the result? We have had to devote our attention during this session to no less than three Bills relating to matters which should have been effectively dealt with in the original measure. I refer to the Electoral Act Amendment Bill, the Representation Bill, and the Census and Statistics Bill. If the original measure had been properly considered, these Bills would not have been necessary. I have no hesitation in saying that if we pass the measure now before us with undue haste, it will lead us into trouble. I would point out that, whereas in the case of the Electoral Act, our action resulted merely in depriving persons of rights, which, in many cases,. they had no special desire to exercise, we shall, by passing a faulty copyright law, deprive a number of people of their bread and butter. I understand that it is intended to strike out the provisions in the Bill relating to newspaper copyright. </para>

                            <para>- I very much doubt whether it is right. To begin with, the law in every other country has been framed with a strict regard to the liberties of individuals. Photography is now so much in vogue that the ordinary touring amateur can produce very good work, and I think we should take care that we do not inflict injustice by adopting too wide an interpretation under this clause. Take, for instance, the case of the photograph of a famous picture. Would no one else have the right to photograph the picture? We have had no discussion or explanation, to make that clear, and we cannot foresee the difficulties that may arise. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable and learned member for Werriwa has directed attention to the question of photographs. He has argued that under the Bill if a photographer took a picture of a celebrated painting, he could copyright it so that no other person would be able to take similar photographs. Photography is practically a new art, and I fail to see why an able and skilful man, who may expose himself to considerable danger in securing a beautiful photograph, should not be allowed to copyright it. The photograph is his own just as much as a painting is the property of the artist who creates it. I know of a case in which a photographer went down a mine and obtained a brilliant picture. The State Government has pirated that particular photograph, and has declined to allow him any compensation whatever. Under such circumstances, I claim that we ought to protect a photographer equally with any other artist. </para>

Consequently, I say that the clause should not be amended.

                        <para>- I understand that a very extraordinary position exists in the United States in regard to Australian books. In my opinion, an Australian publisher has a hard enough row to hoe without additional disabilities being imposed upon him. In America the same advantages are not accorded to. Australian writers as we extend to American writers. If an Australian publisher has a book which is worth selling in the United States, in order to secure the protection against pirated publications which is bestowed by International copyright, he has to print a copy of it there. Messrs. Angus and Robertson and other Australian publishers deserve every credit for the way in which they are facing this difficult task. They have found that pirated editions of the best of Lawson's works have been published in America. Unless we are able to secure absolute reciprocity we should meet that position by providing that American works shall be treated in Australia just as Australian works are treated in that country. It is a most anomalous state of affairs, and if the Minister does not meet it by amending the definition clause, I hope that he will promise to deal with it in a subsequent provision. </para>

                            <para>- Unfortunately, Imperial Governments, for the most part, belong to the Manchester school, and they push their free-trade views to such an extent, that they are not prepared to defend British authors and publishers. They are opposed to a policy of retaliation, but the only way in which you can make a person act fairly towards you is by treating him exactly as he treats you. As soon as the American authors found that, as a result of a policy of retaliation on the part of the British and Commonwealth Governments, they were losing a large circle of readers, I think that our own authors would soon secure redress. We might, by means of this Bill, be able to do the English writing world a very substantial service. Unless the Minister brings forward a proposal to meet the situation, I shall endeavour myself to deal with it at a later stage. We should try to encourage our own authors and publishers. </para>

                            <para>- That was the point I was about to make. The American law, instead of being advantageous to local literary, scientific, or artistic men, is distinctly disadvantageous to them. They have not been able to secure any protection. It is true that Australian authors have been unable to secure copyright there in respect of books published elsewhere; but having regard to the relative population of the two countries, the number of writers- disadvantaged in this way in the United States is likely to be twenty times as great as it is in Australia, since the leisured class from which authors draw their readers is infinitely more numerous in America. I think it would be better to allow 'the position to remain unaltered, because we should not be able, by any action we might take, to make the United States alter their copyright laws. If we made any exception with regard to American publications, it would be necessary for us to pass an amending Bill as soon as the United States came under the international copyright law. Under the Bill as it stands the rights of the authors of that country will not be safeguarded here. The United States have granted no safeguard to our authors, and we propose to grant none to those of that country. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to know who is to determine whether a work is blasphemous, indecent, seditious, or libellous. This is a very important point. Is the determination to be by the officer administering the measure, or by a competent court? Take the word " libellous." It is very difficult to say what is a libel. A member on this side of the Chamber might regard a certain statement of the Opposition as grossly libellous, while others might treat it quite differently. No one desires that there should be copyright in works of the kind referred to in the clause, but I should like to know how and by whom it is to be determined what works fall under this category. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Wide Bay has done well to raise this question. There are several ways of looking at the matter. From one point of view, it would be a good thing if blasphemous, indecent, seditious, and libellous publications were copyrighted, to prevent them from being given an extended circulation. The object of the clause cannot be to permit the copying and republishing of works of this kind without let or hindrance, by preventing the copyrighting of them. What I understand is aimed at is to prevent rights of property from being acquired in such works. The more direct way of dealing with the matter would be to prevent works of this kind from being registered. </para>

                            <para>- He should have power to refuse copyright to blasphemous, indecent, seditious, and libellous publications. No doubt there are publications so flagrant that he would have no difficulty in determining that they should not be registered, and, where he had any doubt on the subject, he would be able to secure the advice of the law officers of the Crown. His own common sense (would lead him, in certain cases, to refuse copyright, but he should have statutory power conferred upon him to decline to register infamous publications. </para>

                            <para>- No. As the honorable and learned member knows perfectly well, copyright is purely the creation of statute law. If a book were obscene or immoral, no copyright would exist, and if the Registrar were of opinion that a book was not the subject of copyright, he would be entitled to reject it. It would afterwards rest with the Courts to say whether he had rightly or wrongly exercised his functions. Clause 74 provides that if the Registrar wrongly enters a publication on the register, the entry can be expunged. An action might arise out of the reprinting of a book which was immoral in its tendency, and it would then be for the Court to determine whether there was any property in it. </para>

                        (Wide Bay).- I am in some doubt as to the necessity for this provision. Would it not be as well to provide for the. registration of works of an objectionable character, so that the responsibility for their publication may be fastened on the right shoulders? It appears to me that the Registrar will occupy a position of greater importance than the High Court.

I consider that it is proposed to give the Registrar too much power, and that the scope of the provision is not defined with sufficient clearness. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the clause should be struck out. The Registrar is really being placed in the position of a public censor. We know that when Herbert Spencer published the chapter ira his work <inline font-style="italic">The Study of Sociology,</inline> relating to educational bias, he aroused the resentment of the clergy, because they regarded his writing as highly blasphemous. In the same way, many of the English clergy held that Darwin's <inline font-style="italic">Origin of Species</inline> was blasphemous.  If  we had a Registrar imbued with the same High Church notions as these clergymen, he would probably refuse to register either of - the works mentioned. </para>

                        <para>- As I understand' it, the position is that, when a book is published, the author has inherent rights in it. If he wishes to obtain the full advantages of copyright, he goes before the Registrar, who, under this clause, would be entitled to examine his work, with a view to ascertaining whether it contained anything indecent, blasphemous, seditious, or libellous. Now, the Registrar may not be a member of the legal profession. It is not necessary that he should" be a lawyer, but, judged by the provisions- of this clause, he would require to be both a lawyer and a parson. He might know what was indecent, blasphemous, and seditious, because we all have our own ideas upon those subjects, but he would need to be a clever lawyer to know what was libellous. I do not see why this Parliament should erect the Registrar of Copyright into a censor of literature. I would suggest to the Minister that a competent Court, and not a solitary individual, should pronounce judgment upon any work which was deemed to be indecent, blasphemous, seditious, or libellous. A tribunal of that kind would be far more likely to mete out justice than would any single officer. At the present moment we do not know who the Registrar will be. He may be a man who has a very narrow range of vision, and who will regard as libellous statements which, in his earlier years, he would have passed over as trifling or harmless. </para>

                        (East Sydney).- If the Minister had mentioned the provisions of clause 74 earlier in the discussion, he would have removed the objections which have been urged against this clause. Clause 74 gives ample protection to any person who is aggrieved by an erroneous decision of the Registrar. As the Minister has pointed out, an appeal can be made to the Judge in Chambers. There is nothing to prevent a person aggrieved by the refusal of the Registrar to copyright his work from bringing that officer before a Judge. Should the latter find that the book is not of an indecent, blasphemous, seditious, or libellous character, he can overrule the Registrar, and direct him to grant copyright. The object of the clause is to enable a test to be applied if such applications are made. It was necessary to impose a prohibition upon works of a certain description, so that the Registrar might be in a legal position to refuse to register them. Under this clause, he will be able to say to the author of any such work, " I have come to the conclusion that this is a blasphemous, indecent, or libellous work, and, inasmuch as the law lays it down that there is no copyright in such works, I refuse to register it. If the author felt that the decision of the Registrar was wrong, he would have a right to get the decision of the Registrar reviewed by a Judge. It is necessary to a copyright law that there should be some provision of this sort. It enables disputes to be brought" into a well ordered train. If seems to me that with] the safeguards contained in clause 74 there can be no objection urged against the clause.

                        <para>There is no treaty between Great Britain and the United States on the subject of copyright, and until recently British authors could not prevent their works being pirated in America. Some measure of protection is, however, now accorded to British authors by virtue of the Act known as the Chace Act 1891. The benefits of this Act are extended to a citizen of a foreign State when such foreign State permits to Americans the " benefit of copyright on substantially the same basis as its own citizens," or when such foreign State is a party to an international agreement which provides for reciprocity in the granting of copyright, by the terms of which agreement the United States may at its pleasure become a party thereto. The existence of either of these conditions is to be determined by the President by proclamation. </para>

A prominent firm of Australian publishers, Messrs. Angus and Robertson, who are doing a very great service to Australian authors, have shown me that Australian works - and particularly those of Henry Lawson - are now being pirated in the United States. The publishers and authors of these works are losing the profits arising from their sale there, because it was not at first considered that the demand for them would justify the expense of having a reprint made there. </para>

                    <para class="block">Asit stands, however, that provision maybe easily evaded by any American author who takes care to register in the United Kingdom. Reciprocity between the United Kingdom and the United States in regard to copyright has not been secured, because the United States refuses to enter into the International Copyright Convention, and if an American author registers first of all in England, he will thus secure his copyright throughout Australia. We have now an opportunity to do something for English writers. At every annual meeting of the Authors' Society of Great Britain vigorous protests are made against the American law of copyright, which is particularly unfair to writers of scientific works, which must necessarily have but a limited number of readers. We all know that for many years the question of whether Darwin's <inline font-style="italic">Origin of Species</inline> would be a success remained in doubt. Darwin had devoted perhaps the best years of his life to the study of the theory which he embodied in that work; and naturally his publishers did not feel justified in incurring the risk of reprinting it in the United States, so as to comply with the copyright law of that country. It is well known that he lost the whole of the profits from the sale of his work there. It is the same with all scientific works - their success is at first doubtful I hold that we ought to do as much as we can to protect the rights of such men. Apparently the British Parliament has no time to devote to questions of this kind, and I think it is well that in passing a Copyright Bill we should take care to do all that we can to safeguard the rights of Australian and British authors generally. The American writer knows that he is able to draw his readers, not only from the people of his own country, but from those of every part of the British Dominions, with the exception, perhaps, of Canada, which has afforded its authors some protection in this regard. </para>

It is pointed out by <inline font-style="italic">Copinger</inline> that in 1889 the Dominion Parliament, in order to remedy the grievance which arose from the fact that the Dominion was being swamped by publications from the United States, passed an Act to amend the Copyright Act of 1875 - </para>

                        <para>The passing of this Act - conceived in the interests rather of Canadian printers and publishers than of either authors or the reading public - led to a long and bitter controversy between Canada and the Mother Country, which was not terminated till the year 1900. It does not fall within the province of this work to enter into the merits of this controversy, but the Home Government resolutely refused to give its necessary assent to the Act, and the Act never became effective law. When in the year 1891, after the passing of the United States "Act, known as the Chace Act, British authors were enabled to obtain copyright in the United States, on condition that they printed and published there, the discontent of the Canadian publishers was greatly increased. Canada has always refused to recognise the arrangement between Great Britain and the United States as an " international copyright treaty," and does not permit United States authors to obtain Canadian copyright under her Copyright Act of 1886. </para>

                        <para>The objectionable feature of the 1889 Act, whereby an author practically would have lost his copyright in Canada, unless he acquired local copyright also, is removed. The Act does not touch Imperial copyright, and whether a British author takes advantage of the Act or not rests entirely with himself. If he desire to do so. he must make arrangements with a local publisher, and a special Canadian edition must be printed in Canada, though the type need not be set there. Thereupon the Canadian publisher will acquire local copyright for the Canadian edition, and the author or anybody else will be prohibited from importing copies of the work into Canada, but otherwise the author's Imperial copyright will not be affected. If, on" the other hand, the author does not desire to take advantage of the Act of 1900, that Act has no effect upon his rights whatsoever .... Canada is not a party to the British Copyright Treaty with Austria. </para>

                    <para>I hold that it is the duty of the Parliament to take such action as will insure to Australian authors a proper reward for their labours. If Lawson and other Australian writers find that their works are being pirated in America, but cannot afford to incur the expense of printing and publishing simultaneously in the two countries, we are doing a wrong to them in failing to properly safeguard their interests. I have no doubt that the Canadian Act of 1900 will go a long way towards inducing the Government of the United States to have more regard to the rights of British authors, and similar Australian action would greatly assist the English-speaking world. The decent publishing firms in America are prepared to give international copyright on fair terms, because they are opposed to piracy, and, even , before the present law was passed, some of them made payments to English authors whose works they were publishing, though those payments were not so large as the English authors would have received had there been a copyright law. I trust that the Committee will agree to my proposal. Under it, the people of other countries will enjoy the same terms as they give to our people, and we have a right to insist on fair treatment to our struggling authors and publishers. </para>

                        <para>. - I ask the honorable and learned member not to press the amendment. At the present time the United States is outside the Berne Convention, and will not make reciprocal arrangements on the subject of copyright with other countries under that agreement. Consequently, registration there does not give copyright throughout the various countries within the Berne Convention. If an American publisher wishes to obtain copyright in the United Kingdom, he must register under the English Act, which it would not be wise for us at this stage to attempt to override, because, under it, registration in any one part of the Empire gives a copyright throughout the whole Empire. This is a Bill purely to regulate the administration of the copyright law within our own boundaries, and to take advantage of the benefits of the Imperial Act, and the international agreement, and, while it is desirable that the copyright law. should be uniform throughout the civilized world, as the United States people have declined to enter the Berne Convention, we cannot force them in this matter. No American author, however, will be able to obtain copyright in Australia under our Bill unless he complies with our conditions, which are substantially the same as those of the United States. </para>

                        <para>- I do not agree with the Minister, that we should pass the clause as it stands. Australian authors under any circumstances must have a hard row to hoe, because of the comparatively small number of readers in the Commonwealth ; but their position is made still more difficult by reason of the large quantity of English and American books which are imported here without let or hindrance. It is true that an American author who is not registered under the Imperial Act cannot obtain copyright in Australia until he complies with the provisions of this clause, but registration under the Imperial Act is a merely nominal affair, and. gives copyright throughout the whole Empire. I think that we should take the matter into our own hands, and do what we can to secure reciprocity between Australia and America. An Australian author cannot register in America until he has gone to the heavy expense of getting his book printed in type set up in the United States, and I think that the American author should not be protected here until he has acted similarly. If we have the constitutional power to make an amendment on the lines suggested by the honorable and learned member for Corio, I think that it should be made; but the matter could be dealt with in another way, namely, by imposing a duty on American books, which would place on American authors a disability equivalent to that now placed on Australian authors who wish to register in America. </para>

                        <para>- I think there is a good' deal in the contention of the honorable and learned member for Corio. I should be very sorry to make any invidious distinction against the United States, but we cannot overlook the fact that although the law is not specially directed against us, American legislation places our publishers at a disadvantage. The United States Act requires that a book for which copyright is required shall be printed and published in America within a certain time after the application has been lodged. I understand that, owing to this condition, a number of large English publishing firms have set up branch offices in America, and have brought out numerous works in England" and America simultaneously. The smaller firms that are unable to resort to this method of publication are placed at a great disadvantage, and this would apply to all the Australian publishing houses. Therefore, whilst American publishers can come here and obtain copyright for their publications, our publishers are denied a like privilege. We desire to place our publishers on the same footing as those of other countries, and I think that the amendment is deserving of consideration. It makes no invidious distinction so far as the United States is concerned, but subjects its publishers <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the same conditions in Australia as are applied to foreign publishers in the United States. What is good enough for America ought to be good enough for Australia; and there can be no cause of complaint against us if we apply to the United States the methods which that country has adopted in dealing with others. The United States might be induced to recast its copyright legislation if it found that we were determined to assert our right in the direction indicated. </para>

I do not agree with the suggestion that we should impose a special duty upon imported publications. Any proposal of that . kind would at once raise the fiscal issue, and would have to be discussed upon party lines. The matter should be dealt with quite apart from any such considerations. </para>

                        <para>- I cannot support the amendment because it seems to me to go altogether too far. The United States does not grant copyright to foreigners, and does not ask from others any privileges which it denies to outsiders. If we do not ask for copyright from other nations we are entitled to refuse it to them. It is clear that the smaller nations must gain under any reciprocal arrangement for the registration of copyright, For instance, it would be of much more advantage to holders of copyright in Australia if they could obtain protection in other countries than to publishers in other countries to obtain copyright in Australia. Although the amendment is not specially directed against the United States, it will have the effect that has been indicated by the honorable member for Gippsland. The discussion so far has proceeded on the assumption that only literary works are the subject of copyright. I would point out, however, that musical and dramatic works are also brought within the scope of the copyright law. Music is a universal language, and the arrangement entered into at the Berne Convention, by which musical works copyrighted in,, say, France or Germany can be safeguarded in other parts of the world, is of the utmost advantage. At this late stage of the session I think it is undesirable that we should introduce into this Bill highly debatable provisions. We have been informed that next session a Bill will be submitted for the purpose of dealing with the question of newspaper copyright, and the honorable and learned member for Corio will then be afforded an opportunity of submitting his proposal. I scarcely think that he will be acting wisely in pressing it any further at the present juncture. If he insists upon effecting such amendments in the Bill as will provoke debate in the Senate, the probability is that the measure will be "hung up." </para>

                        (Canobolas). - I ask the honorable and learned member for Corio not to again submit his amendment. 1 recognise that this Bill can be made a fairly workable measure, but it is impossible, at this stage of the session, to deal' with contentious matters. Under the circumstances, I think that the honorable and learned member will be well advised if he does not persist in his proposal. He will have an opportunity to bring the matter forward next session, when we shall have more time to deal with it.

                        (East Sydney).- I confess that I think a Legislature occupies a very extraordinary position when it absolutely shirks giving proper study to the provisions of a Bill upon the ground of the late period at which it is being considered. I quite recognise that in view of my own attitude in the past, I must deal with a matter of this kind with exceeding tenderness. But in spite of my manifold iniquities, the suggestion that the Bill should be passed without proper consideration is really a reflection upon us for dealing with it at all. The observation of the honorable member for Canobolas proves that we are legislating under conditions which are not proper to parliamentary government. We have no right to pass measures without due consideration, upon the ground that we can subsequently improve them. That method of legislation is open to very serious objections. If there are debatable questions involved in this Bill, it would be infinitely better to defer its' consideration until next session. If we have not the time at our disposal, to scrutinize measures thoroughly, it is infinitely better that their consideration should be deferred.

The attitude of the United States with reference to copyright has been the source of unfavorable comment in every civilized country in the world. So far as I can, I am willing to assist any honorable member who desires to mark in an Australian Act our disapprobation of that policy. The only question to be considered is whether by so doing we should accomplish more harm than good. I do not think that the existence of such a provision would debar us from entering the Berne Convention. </para>

I should like to know whether the adoption of the amendment would impair our position in reference to the Convention. I do not think that it would, because it would apply only to the United States. </para>

                            <para>- I am strongly inclined to support the honorable and learned member for Corio. I think that we should place upon record our disapproval of the wretched policy of the United States in connexion with this matter. By so acting, our position in reference to the United Kingdom and the countries which' are parties to the agreement would not be affected, because those countries are not open to the criticism which has been levelled against the United States. Since the United States remains outside the Berne Convention for selfish reasons, we should not be aiming at any country represented in that Convention. I think that in this Bill we should embody an expression of opinion which ought to' have some good effect. "I 'fail to see why in legislating for the Commonwealth we should be compelled to slavishly follow the Imperial Statute, as long as we do nothing to create confusion. </para>

The only way in which we can show the United States that we think they should act fairly by authors in other parts of the world is by passing, so far as we can, a provision that will teach them their duty by the only lesson they are prone to accept- the lesson of self -necessity. </para>

We are passing an Australian copyright law, and we are absolutely free to frame that law in the most beneficial shape. My first consideration is whether or not the amendment proposed by the honorable and learned member for Corio would prejudice our position with reference to the Convention agreed to_ by Great Britain and many other countries. If i* would, that would be sufficient justification for my opposing it. I should be sorry to do anything that would interfere with the entrance of Australia into that Convention, but as the amendment is aimed only at a country which stands obstinately out of that Convention, I see no difficulty in supporting it. </para>

In the case of <inline font-style="italic">Black</inline> versus <inline font-style="italic">The Imperial Book Company,</inline> in 1903, the Court emphasized the opinion that Canada possessed no copyright' legislation which ousted the Statute of 1842. </para>

                            <para>- The Imperial Act enables Australian authors to secure the protection of their copyright throughout Great Britain, India, and other parts of the Empire. If the sale of an author's works were confined to the Commonwealth, he would reap no great profit from them. I should like to preserve for those Australian authors whose genius secures for their works a sale in other parts of the Empire, all the benefits of the Imperial Copyright Act, and we must be careful that we do not exclude ourselves from the advantages of that Statute. </para>

                            <para>- At the present moment I am not prepared to express a definite opinion on the point. I am inclined to think, however, that the proposal is to insert a provision which is inconsistent with the Imperial Act, and which might, therefore, jeopardize the whole Bill. If the Governor-General were advised that any provision in it was in conflict with the Imperial Act, he would be bound to reserve his assent to it. I confess that I do not anticipate that the amendment would give rise to all the dangers that have been suggested, but I must decline, without opportunity for full consideration, to support any amendment in such a highly technical Bill. I think that the Ministry are adopting a safe position ; but I should have been glad to see the Bill held over until next session. That would have given us an opportunity to thoroughly consider its provisions. But, even if the amendment be rejected, the honorable and learned member for Corio will have an opportunity, within the next six months, to bring forward his proposal in a way that will allow of its full consideration. If, at a later stage, it were shown that this measure needed to be amended in several important directions, and in such a way that it would not come in conflict' with the Imperial law, I should be ready to support such a proposal, feeling that the matters in question had been clearly overlooked when the Bill itself was being pushed through the House. </para>

I do not think that such a proceeding can fairly be termed a public representation. </para>

However, I see clearly that the Committee is not prepared to discuss these points as they should be discussed, and as they would be discussed had the Bill been brought before us earlier in the session. Under the circumstances, we must leave the matter to be dealt with by the Court. </para>

                            <para>- This is a much longer period, and altogether too long a period, considering the nature of a lecture. We are making it possible for actions for infringement to arise after the generation which first heard the lecture had passed away. I ask the Minister, even at this late stage, to consider the advisability of putting the Bill aside for the present, seeing that the Committee is not in a fit state to consider it. A lecturing right is absolutely different from a right in a book or in a dramatic work, and I assume that a protection of forty-two years was given only because the attention of the Senate was not drawn to the matter. </para>

                    <para>Mr.CONROY. - It is hardly right to ask us to make such sweeping changes as are involved in the clause. This provision affords another reason why we should postpone the consideration of the measure, because if we once granted this right we could not take it away: No such right exists in any other part of the world. </para>

Not one argument has been adduced to show that this change is necessary. The old law may have been a bad one, but we have heard of no complaints against it; and we have certainly heard nothing to show that the proposed change is a good one. We should not pass legislation of this kind without serious debate. </para>

                        (Werriwa). - I admit that there is some difficulty in this case. For instance, a man publishes a book, with a very good plot, and immediately three or four others set to work Bo dramatize it, and the author is shut out from the advantage which should accrue to him from the product of his own brain.

                            <para>- It appears that by clause 13, we have given to every author of a novel the sole right to convert it into a drama. An author may never dramatize his book, and no one else will be entitled to make any use of his plot for the purposes of a drama for forty-two years. Therefore, in view of the multiplicity of novels that are springing up, the dramatic writer will not know where he is. How are we to define what is a dramatic representation? We know that the English Courts have recently been engaged in dealing with the rights of dramatists in regard to the use of novels. We are now proposing to confer upon a novelist the right to go to a dramatist and tell him that he must not proceed with his work, because he has adopted a plot similar to that contained in the novel. Under this provision, he may be subjected to heavy penalties, because it may be urged that he has dramatized some work of which he has never heard. Ought we to impose such disabilities upon dramatic authors? Personally, I consider that the provisions of clause 13 are altogether too wide. In its present form, it is a distinct hindrance to dramatists. Of course, most of the plays produced in Australia, are written by the dramatists of older countries, and consequently, the cases which will arise under this provision, may not be numerous. I object to rendering dramatists liable to penalties, because it may be alleged that they have dramatized stories of the very existence of which they may have had no knowledge. </para>

                        <para>- There is a good deal of force in the argument of the honorable and learned member for Werriwa. We ought not to pass a clause of this kind without seriously considering its possible consequences. The delivery of a lecture on such a subject as " Shakespeare " ought not to preclude the delivery of another lecture upon the same subject. If there be any possibility of guarding against an abuse such as that indicated by the honorable and learned member for Werriwa, I think that the Minister should seriously consider it. </para>

                        <para>- We have not had an opportunity to give to this Bill the careful consideration that it deserves, and one cannot be expected at a moment's notice to determine what is really necessary in this regard. It seems to me, however, that this provision is unreasonable. I am one of those who believe that public lectures have done much to raise the people from the mire of ignorance to the higher altitudes of learning, and I fail to see why a lecturer should have power to prevent a newspaper from publishing his address. This clause means really that a lecturer- shall have the power to say that no one shall learn of the purport of his lecture, except by paying for admission to the hall in which it is delivered. The clause is not in keeping with modern ideas on educational .questions. The lecture may consist of a mere collection of historical facts from various sources, which are open to the whole community, but with which the people generally have not time to acquaint themselves, and the moment such a lecture is delivered from a public platform it should become the property of the public. The people should have the opportunity to learn the views of a lecturer, not merely by paying for admission to 'the hall in which he speaks, but by means of newspaper reports. I agree with the honorable and learned member for Werriwa that we may go too far, and that there is a point at which we must limit the right of a man to secure privileges to which he is really not entitled. I certainly think that we are asked to take a retrograde step. </para>

In like manner, I think that a lecturer should be protected in respect of the address which he has prepared on any given subject. The clause does not contain any element of danger, and I am inclined to think that the argument put forward by the honorable and learned member for Werriwa is rather a far-fetched one. </para>

                        <para>- I am inclined to the view that, instead of providing that newspapers shall not publish lectures for the benefit of the community, unless with the consent of those who deliver them, we should enact that any newspaper which fails to publish a lecture shall be heavily fined. A man of great genius, although practically unknown, might announce his intention of delivering a lecture in Melbourne, and might have an audience of only fifteen or twenty. But if a smart and clever reporter for one of the great Melbourne dailies attended that lecture, he would quickly appreciate its value, and so publish it to the world. It is perfectly ridiculous, to talk about preventing newspapers from publishing lectures. At the present time, the difficulty which lecturers, teachers, and other educationalists experience, is in (inducing the newspapers to publish anything that they say. </para>

                        <para>. - I am afraid that there is some little misconception of the effect of this provision, and of that which it is intended to protect. .1 think that we are all agreed that every man is entitled to the product of his labour. If a man treats a. subject in an original form, there are two ways in which he may put his work before the people. In the first place, he may publish a book, and in the second he may orally communicate his ideas. If he does so, he can copyright it. It is generally admitted that, in such circumstances, a man should have substantial protection for the result of his labour. Let us take the case of a man who desires to earn a livelihood, not by writing books, but by preparing and delivering lectures on certain subjects. The preparation of a lecture may involve a great deal of research, and a man may suffer great hardships in securing the information necessary for his work. Imagine, for instance, the case of one who goes on a voyage of discovery to the Antarctic. </para>

                    <para>That was the English law. The Committee which investigated the whole question in the United Kingdom recommended the very provision that the Government are to-day urging the Committee to adopt. The honorable member for Darling has pointed out very truly that the protection which it is proposed to afford a lecturer will be in respect only of the original treatment of the subject with which he deals. The late Reverend Charles Clarke earned his livelihood, and educated the public, by his beautiful lectures on Westminster Abbey, Dickens, Thackeray, and other subjects which any one is free to lecture upon, (but the origin'al treatment of which by any lecturer should be protected. </para>

                        <para>- I think that there is a great deal in the criticism which has been expended on this clause, and it is open to further objections. Who is to define what is a report ? My experience is that it. is unprecedented1 for a newspaper here to report <inline font-style="italic">verbatim</inline> the lectures of prominent men visiting Australia; but a paragraph of a. few lines, giving the briefest summary of a. lecture, might be a technical breach of this provision, which is a very clumsy one to administer. I sympathize with those who think that it is being proposed to carry the protection of- copyright too far. As a rule, the personality of a lecturer is a more valuable asset to him that the mere words of his lecture. If we read the report of a lecture delivered by a great preacher or orator, it stimulates us to hear him, instead of keeping us from doing so. So far as the mere words of a lecture are concerned, they can be copyrighted by making a book of them, and copyrighting it. The greatest service that can be done to a lecturer is to report his lectures in the press. Moreover, any member of his, audience may take down the words of his lecture, and make it his own property. Of course, it will be said that if it is of service to lecturers to have their lectures reported in the press, the clause will be inoperative, because lecturers, - with the exception of, perhaps, an occasional crank - will not prohibit the reporting of their lectures ; but how absurd it would be to pass legislation merely for the benefit of a crank who might think that the lecture he had produced was such a monument of wisdom that, unless his rights in it were protected, it would be repeated all over the world, and1 he would .lose thousands Such persons can protect their lectures by copyrighting them in book form. </para>

                        (Werriwa). - No country in, the world gives lecturing rights for so long a period as forty-two years. When a copyright is given to an author, he is bound to publish his work in order to take advantage of it, and when he does that, any one who wishes to do so can secure a copy of it. But, if a lecture is copyrighted, nobody can enjoy it except those who actually go to hear it.

                            <para>- No. While I do not value his criticism, I think very highly of the beautiful English of his writings, and the fine descriptions which they contain. I know something about political economy, and laugh at his criticisms on that subject ; and I am told that those who know something about art laugh at his art criticisms. Apparently those who know nothing about art, think his art criticisms very good, and those who know nothing about political economy, think his works on that subject very valuable. I think, however, that the man who enjoys the protection of the copyright law should not prevent the public from enjoying his works, and if a lecturer is to have his lecture rights protected for forty-two years, he should not be able to prevent the public from reading reports' of his lectures. </para>

He could get it printed in the form in which he delivered it at an expense of <inline font-style="italic">£2,</inline> and would then be absolutely safeguarded.

                            <para>- Exactly. We are being asked to give abnormal powers to a lecturer, and I think that it is proposed to go too far. Notice should be given in connexion with every lecture, instead of only at the beginning of a series of lectures. One lecture might be delivered to-day, and others at intervals of a month, and the notice might fade from the public recollection before the series was completed. I move - </para>

                            <para>- Surely the Government ought to have been able to make up their minds with regard to a. matter which has been fully debated in the Senate, and which has been before this Chamber for some time. The public are entitled to know of the attitude of the Government with regard to the clause. We are told that an opportunity will be afforded to deal with the matter. That opportunity must be given by means of a Bill rather than by a resolution, which would have no effect. Do the Government intend to introduce a Bill next session? </para>

                        <para>- I wish to point out to the Committee that in this clause we are asked to extend the term of artistic copyright to a period that is quite unknown in any other country. I contend that the provision should have practically embodied the law at present in force in the different States. In New South Wales, the period of artistic copyright is limited to fourteen years. As a matter of fact, that is the term during which a patent is protected. In Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia a similar law prevails. We are now asked, without rhyme or reason, to extend the term of artistic copyright to forty-two years. </para>

                            <para>- How can anybody reproduce an artistic work? Its sole value lies in the fact that it cannot be reproduced. Its very author cannot reproduce a work of exactly the same type and character. I defy anybody to make two paintings which are absolutely similar. One may possess a very high value, and the other mav be worthless from a purely artistic point of view. The term of copyright in paintings, drawings, &amp;c, is fourteen years. In this clause we are asked to deliberately increase that period to forty-two years. I say that we ought not to make such a serious departure from the laws of the States without very good reason being advanced for our action. In the matter of photographs, the term of copyright in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, and Western Australia is three years. In Queensland and Tasmania, where the Acts of the United Kingdom apply, it is for the life of the author, and an additional seven years. That is an entirely different state of affairs from that which will obtain under this Bill. In four States, representing five-sixths of the population of the Commonwealth, the term of artistic copyright is fourteen years. We are asked, without any reason being assigned for the change, to suddenly increase it to forty-two years. Under this Bill one man may have registered a copyright for fourteen 3'ears and one month before the Act will come into operation. He will receive no protection whatever, whereas the individual who registered thirteen years and eleven months before the commencement of the Act, will have his term extended to forty-two years. I am bound to say that I regard this matter as of so much importance that I should like to see a quorum present. <inline font-style="italic">\Quornm formed."]</inline> Considering that the proprietors of patents, which represent the highest efforts of mechanical genius, are protected for only fourteen years, surely that is a sufficiently long term to apply to artistic copyrights ! I contend that in this Bill we are going too far, because we are lessening the rights of individuals. What would be thought if forty-two years had to elapse before we could take advantage of any patent? We must fix a reasonable period at which the public shall secure a return for the exclusive rights which they have conferred upon particular individuals. We are asked to regard this Bill as <inline font-style="italic">A</inline> formal one, and to pass it without discussion. The more I look into it, the more I am satisfied that we ought not to have been invited to agree to it in this hurried fashion. However, I do not intend to labour the question. These matters ought to be as much the concern of every other member of the Committee as they are mine. I move- </para>

                        <para>. - I cannot accept the amendment. It is true that in some, parts of the world, the term of artistic copy-- right is only fourteen years; but I see no reason why an artist or a sculptor should not have the same protection conferred upon his inventive or artistic powers that is accorded the writer of a book. In the United Kingdom the term of artistic copyright is during the life of the author and seven years, which is practically an alternative to the period of forty-two years. In Canada, it is twenty-eight years., with conditional extension for fourteen years; and in Queensland, it is during the life of the author and seven years. In the circumstances, I think it is only fair that adequate protection should be given as proposed. </para>

                        (Werriwa). - I think that this is far too great a power to vest in a justice of the peace. Men have gone down to the gutter and, unfortunately, have been still allowed to remain on the roll. Such a justice of the peace who wrongfully issued one of these warrants could be punished only by the removal of his name from the roll. Justices of the peace for the Commonwealth may be selected with greater care than has been exercised by some of the States Governments. It may fairly be argued that this is a proposal to place in the hands of magistrates over whom we have no control the right to take a very serious action:. I ask the Minister to agree to confine this power to stipendiary magistrates.

                        (Werriwa).- This clause justified us in objecting to the extreme power conferred by clause 13. I ask the Committee to consider how this provision might be used by those interested in one dramatic organization to work injury to another which was playing in opposition to it. We know that it is no uncommon occurrence for the same idea
                        <inline font-style="italic">to</inline>
                        occur to two literary persons simultaneously. An author may prevent the dramatization of his works, but it might happen that the dramatist had written a play whose central idea was the same as that of a novel which he had never read. That play might have been secured bv a dramatic company, and those interested in another dramatic company, seeing that it would possibly be a great success, might buy the right of dramatizing the novel, and then proceed to take out an injunction restraining the performance of the play. Of course, they would wait until the last moment before doing this. That was done here only a few months back.

                            <para>- Yes ; but I do not think any one registering under the Bill need send a copy of his work to the States authorities. I do not argue whether that is desirable or otherwise. But the matter is one which should have received attention at the hands of honorable members. Some of the States may consider that they should still have copies of new works supplied to them. Of course, if that right were preserved, an author would have to supply three copies instead of two, and it is a matter for consideration whether the advantage gained by the State would compensate for the disadvantage to the individual. Some books are exceedingly valuable, and the author should not be exploited to any further extent than may be necessary to comply with reasonable requirements. If the existing rights of the States are preserved, they will be entitled to direct an author to send in, not one copy, but ten, or even to send copies to all the principal Mechanics' Institutes. I cannot conceive that any such power would rest with a State Parliament, and, therefore, it appears to me that the existing rights will be abrogated, and that all an author will be required to do will be to furnish two copies to the Federal Registrar. </para>

                        (Werriwa). - I wish to enter my protest against the manner ira which this Bill has been rushed through. Those" who have pointed out its defects have been unable to carry any of their amendments. The more I look at the measure the more I feel that its consideration should have been deferred until next session. In four of the States, representing five-sixths of the population of the Commonwealth, wc have extended the period of copyright from fourteen to forty two years, and we have provided no public safeguards. Need I remind honorable members that originally these rights were granted only because it was thought that the great mass of the people ought to enjoy all the advantages which were conferred by every new discovery. It was not until after the lapse of many years that it was thought that the growth of mechanical genius would be better stimulated by allowing an inventor to enjoy for a specified period the fruits of his own industry. Under this Bill, if a man has copyrighted a work fourteen years and one month prior to the commencement of the Act, he wilt enjoy no protection whatever; but the individual who has copyrighted a work thirteen years and eleven month's" prior to its commencement will be granted an extension of that period to forty-two years. I should like to know what is the reason for such an arbitrary proceeding on our part. There is no recognition of the rights of the public in this Bill. Under it we have granted to individuals rights which did not previously exist, and I say that the measure should have received more consideration than has been accorded to it. If it had not been dealt with at the fag-end of the session, the Committee would have declined to approve of it. Of course, it is impossible for me to foresee all the difficulties that will arise under it. I do not know, however, that the Bill has been ill-considered and ill-conceived. Like the Patents Act, which received some consideration, it will require amendment next year. Under that Act difficulties have arisen, despite the fact that the Bill was considered. How much more numerous are they likely to be under this measure, to which no serious attention has been given ?. I wish to place upon record my protest against the Bill being passed in its present form.

                        <para>- I suppose that we all recognise that the time has come when an attempt should be made by this House to arrive at a settlement of this very vexed question. In the first place, 1 desire to enter my protest against this Bill being brought forward at the fag-end of the session, when so many honorable members representing distant States have left for. their homes, and will not return. To ask us to proceed with it as if it were a formal matter is to travesty the proceedings of Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- At the present stage of the session we ought not to proceed with this Bill. It is perfectly dear that, in the absence of a large number of honorable members, it cannot receive that amount of consideration to which it is entitled. In my opinion, the warmth that has been engendered by some observations which have been made in another quarter will tend to preclude that full and serious discussion which would otherwise be bestowed upon it. I have no hesitation in saying that, when the selection of Dalgety was first proposed, at least half-a-dozen honorable members voted for it, not with a view to securing a final settlement of the question, but to allow of its further consideration. </para>

The Postmaster-General must be aware that a great many honorable members do not approve of the site that has been chosen. Even its warmest admirers cannot urge that it fulfils all the requirements of a Federal Capital Site. If they do, I am quite satisfied that a residence of a few months there will disabuse their minds of that illusion. </para>

                            <para>- I said that it was less objectionable than some of the other sites which were proposed. I am sure that another site would have been chosen if it had not been for the feeling which is entertained by honorable members that: they ought to support the Prime Minister, in any altercation that he mav have with' the Premier of New South Wales. If it were not for that fact, there would be a distinct majority against the selection of Dalgety. </para>

                            <para>- I am sure that the Postmaster-General is not. Considering the number of pairs that have been provided, it is impossible to get eighteen votes cast upon either side. The last division which took place confirms my statement. Upon that occasion we allowed pairs to four or five honorable members. It would be distinctly wrong to allow the House to decide a measure of this importance when less than a quarter of its members are present. </para>

                            <para>- The Postmaster-General cannot do so. I have been through the list very carefully, and the honorable member for Bland fully concurs in my opinion. I mention his name, because it has been stated that he was endeavouring, for purely electioneering purposes, to arrange a compromise in favour of the selection of Lake George. I decline to believe that. When I asked the honorable member for Bland three years ago to support that site, he was quite ready to do so. One of the reasons why he did not vote with me upon that occasion was that, like the right honorable member for East Sydney, he realized that there was no chance of that site being selected. The honorable and learned member for Illawarra and myself stood almost alone upon this question. What are the circumstances? I am satisfied that the selection of Dalgety does not truly represent the wish of the majority of the House. At the time that the choice was made, many honorable members voted for it only as a means of deferring the settlement of the question. I honestly believe that there is an absolute majority in this Parliament opposed to the site. </para>

                            <para>- The right honorable member for East Sydney was then speaking as the head of the Government of the day. Whilst occupying that position, he was bound to carry out the will of the Parliament. An Executive could not set up a law unto itself. His position was very similar to that of the honorable and learned member for Darling Downs, who, when the selection was under consideration, spoke strongly against Dalgety; but, as a Minister of the Crown to-day holds that he must respect the decision of the Parliament. As a member of the Executive, he has to support, not that of which he approves, but that which the Parliament has determined upon. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. At all events, when the present leader of the Opposition said he would resist any attempt to depart from the decision of the Parliament, New South Wales had not made any protest against the selection of Dalgety. As that State refuses to assent to the selection of Dalgety, the Prime Minister, even if he had previously supported the selection of that site, would now be justified in saying : " I am not! disposed to oppose the wishes of one-third of the people of the Commonwealth, and therefore I shall endeavour to secure another selection which will be more in accordance with their desire." New South Wales went out of its way, so to speak, to allow the Federal Parliament to choose a site, and, in so doing, yielded up what, in my opinion, was a right that it undoubtedly possessed. But since it will be called upon, to hand over a large area, surely it has a right to say to this Parliament : " We do not think the Commonwealth ought to ask us to grant this site." When it takes up that position, surely it should1 not be said that it is. adopting a highly unfederal attitude. We know that if the Capital becomes established at Dalgety. New South Wales will be called upon at once to construct about thirty-two miles of railway, which, at the present time, at all events, will be unpayable. In these circumstances, can it be reasonably contended that the wishes of that State should not be considered by us? We should be thankful to the State Parliament for having pointed out to us that the territory is not a very suitable one. Instead of that, many honorable members appear to consider that it has taken up a disagreeable stand, i and the question seems to have resolved itself into one of whether or not we should interfere with or resent the action taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers.</inline> That is not a reasonable position for this Parliament to assume. The agreement arrived at by the Premiers in conference was that the Federal Capital should be a reasonable distance from Sydney. It seems strange that, in previous discussion, that point has been almost waived. The honorable member for North Sydney was the only one who, during the debate on the Seat of Government Bill, impressed upon the House the full significance of that decision, but many honorable members - and I dare say that I was amongst them - were so busily engaged in lobbying and endeavouring to secure votes for certain sites that his arguments did not receive the recognition which they deserved. Can it be said that to establish the Capital on the borders of New South Wales and Victoria, would be to comply with the decision pf "the Premiers' Conference, that it should be a reasonable distance from Sydney? I am inclined  to believe that if honorable members had realized the full effect of that decision, they would not have attempted to select a site off the main railway line between Sydney and Melbourne. Apart from the unfavorable climate, the character of the country, and its lack of railway communication, there are many other reasons why Dalgety should not be finally selected. We know that it is improbable that many public servants will be stationed at the Capital,, and that it is unlikely that we shall erect a city. I am sure that there is no desire to centralize the Public Service in the Federal Capital at the expense of the Commonwealth. Another point is that if the Capital be established at Dalgety, a delay of half-a-day must occur in the receipt and transmission of our mails. That alone should be a sufficient ground for a reconsideration of the question now that party disputes have passed away. As a matter of fact, many honorable members were actually preparing to reconsider it when a certain action was taken last week. In New South Wales it is hard to say what site would have been selected as the result of that reconsideration, but I am satisfied that, but for a little warm feeling that has lately been engendered) the decision of the Parliament would have been altered. It would be most unwise, however, for the House to stand by its former decision. We have a clear intimation that the Parliament of New South Wales does not intend to agree fo the selection of Dalgety. It is determined by every means that lies in its power to resist the establishment of the Capital there. Tha* being so, is the question at issue of such vital importance to the other States of the Union that we should deliberately determine to disregard the wishes of a State representing one-third of the people of the Commonwealth rather than forsake the decision arrived at? In what way would the rights of the other States be infringed by a fresh selection being made'? I am satisfied that the bulk of the people of Victoria would have had no objection to the selection of" Sydney as the Federal Capital, but under the Constitution such a selection is now impossible. That being so, we should seriously consider whether we ought not to select a site which would be more agreeable to the people of New South Wales. If we adopted that course no one could say, that_ we had backed down. Surely there could be no objection to our saying to the Parliament of New South Wales, "Whilst fully recognising the responsibility of the Commonwealth in this matter, we should  like to know what site would be most acceptable to you." If a question were put to the State Legislature in that form, I believe the answer would be that the Capital should be somewhere on the main line between Melbourne and Sydney. Having regard to the importance of the question of the means of communication, I fail to see how any other decision can be arrived at. lt would be a serious matter, from the stand-point of Victoria, if the Capital were established at Dalgety, for practically all her leading public men would be precluded from entering this Legislature. In attending there, they would Be further away from their homes than they would be if the Capital were established in Sydney. </para>

                            <para>- Not very -much less. Surely we should not ask New South Wales to go to this large expenditure unnecessarily. Is it wise, or showing a Federal spirit, to insist upon Dalgety, when the population of New South Wales, which numbers one-third of the population of the Commonwealth, is opposed to the adoption of that site? It is well known that the State joined the Union only because the representatives of the other States agreed with her representatives that the Federal Capital should be within her boundaries. That arrangement was made five years ago, and the Parliament is still sitting in Melbourne. At the present rate of progress, no final ity will ever be reached, and in any case, it must be nearly ten years before the Federal City can be made fit for occupation. What injury would be done to the people of the other States if we were to meet the wishes of New South Wales in regard to this matter? </para>

                            <para>- He was referring to a fight as to where the Federal Capital should be, and is surely entitled to express his views strongly on the subject. If he thinks that Lake George or Yass would make a more acceptable site than Dalgety, why should we condemn him for saying so? If the honorable member for Melbourne wishes the question to be settled, he should "vote for one of the sites which have been offered to us by the Parliament of New South Wales. He must see that the Federal Capital should be near the trunk line of railway, so as. to be easily accessible from all the States. The expense of giving access to Dalgety by means of a railway would be very great. Even those who voted for Dalgety must feel that it is not a suitable place for the Federal Capital, because of its distance, its inaccessibility, its climate, and for other reasons. I trust thai this Parliament will show that it is a Federal. Parliament, and be willing to compromise with the State, instead of setting itself in opposition to it. If the matter comes to a vote, I shall oppose the retention of Dalgety; but, in view of the lateness of the session, and the fact that many members have left for their homes, I trust that the measure will, after some further discussion, be postponed until next year, when we can take a full vote, and when, I trust, we shall arrive at a satisfactory settlement. No doubt a great deal of heat has been engendered by the speeches in which the Premier of New South Wales has asserted the just rights of that State; and, unfortunately, the question, to some honorable members, seems to have resolved itself into this - Shall we support the Premier of New South Wales, or shall we follow the Prime Minister? Even if Dalgety were a suitable site, the fact that the people of New South Wales are opposed to its acceptance is a reason why this Parliament should reconsider its decision. I trust that honorable members will not allow themselves to be influenced by what I may call partizanship, but will recognise that the Premier of New South Wales has merely asserted the rights of that State, and that, if we are to show the true Federal spirit, we must select a site which will be acceptable to the great body of the people of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- I hope that honorable members, in approaching the re consideration of this question, will entirely disregard all the proceedings which have led to so much irritation. Whilst I recognise that the Premier of New South Wales is perfectly entitled to take up the attitude that he has adopted in asserting the rights of the State, it is rather unfortunate that he has. taken his action at a time when there seemed to be some prospect of arriving by consultation at a satisfactory settlement of the Capital Site question. I trust that any feeling which' may have been aroused by his somewhat precipitate action, taken, I feel sure, without knowledge of the consultative proceedings among Federal members for securing a satisfactory understanding, will be allowed to evaporate, and that honorable members will endeavour to arrive at a settlement fair to all the States and beneficial to the Commonwealth. I fear that in years to come the selection of the Dalgety site will be looked upon as a monument to the stupendous imbecility of this Parliament. If .some honorable members had been a little more familiar with the characteristics of the site as to soil and climate, and other conditions. they would1 have agreed that it was, perhaps, one of the most unsuitable that could have been selected. It may be a very good spot at which to raise polar bears, but is not to be recommended as a place of residence for persons who have been accustomed to a warm and genial climate. The country immediately surrounding Dalgety is of an utterly inhospitable character. lit is desolate, rock strewn, and practically bare of timber. Even the reports of the surveyors who originally reported on the site show that the vegetation is very stunted, and one passage in their report reads as follows : - </para>

                        the present time, but the cost of a railway would be considerable. Dalgety is distant from Melbourne about 240 miles, and from1 Sydney over 330 miles. A railway to connect the site with Melbourne would have to be constructed from Bairnsdale,
                        <inline font-style="italic">via</inline>
                        Bendoc, at an estimated cost of about £1,500,000. The Cooma to Dalgety railway would cost about £312,000 ; and in order to connect the Federal City with all the States capitals - except Hobart, which, of course, cannot be connected by rail - an outlay of £8,483,683 would be involved. In addition, the sum of £120,000 would have to be spent on the Cooma railway to make it a first class line. Then, supposing that the territory were acquired other than by grant from the Government of New South Wales, a large expenditure would be incurred. The greater part of the Dalgety area consists of undulating treeless country, with frequent outcrops, of granite, and any one who visits the site must be struck with its inhospitable appearance. The occasional tufts of grass are bare on the one side, and are banked up with sand on the other. This, circumstance, taken in conjunction with the fact that buildings are shored up on the lee side with huge pieces of timber, indicates that it is absolutely a very exposed part of the country. The average temperature in summer is between 70 and 80 degrees, and I have rarely heard1 of a temperature exceeding the higher of these registers. I have been at Dalgety in midsummer, when a heat-wave has been passing oyer the State, and the thermometer has registered 106 degrees in the shade at Sydney. And yet I have been absolutely frozen whilst travelling, in a coach at night, and glad to avail myself of the opportunity to sit alongside a big log fire and thaw myself out on New Year's morning. I can quite conceive that the climatic conditions in midwinter are anything but agreeable.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener</inline>
                        says, in the latest report now before us -
                    </para>
                    <para>The area of 100 square miles, as designed, embraces the land most suitable for city and suburban buildings, but within an area so small no serious attempt can be made to protect the water supply, neither can any source be embraced. It must be regarded merely as a city site. </para>
                    <para class="block">That, of course, relates only to an area of 100 square miles, and the argument of -course is used to urge the acquisition of a larger area of territory, but it is not reasonable to expect the Government of Vew South Wales to grant such a large tract of country as has been suggested. Coming back to the question of cost, I find that, if the Commonwealth were to obtain 900 square miles of country, which is the area they appear determined to secure, the purchase-money would amount to £1, 216,000, according tq <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener's</inline> estimate of value. Then, again, the approximate cost of building a breakwater at. Twofold Bay, which some honorable members hope to see included in the Federal territory, would amount to £1,500,000, probably more. The figures I have quoted as being required for railway construction, together with the amount necessary for the construction of the breakwater at Twofold Bay, and the amount that would have to be devoted to the purchase of the territory, represent a total of £11,949,683. Then, again, I am credibly informed that the cost of the railway to connect Dalgety with Twofold Bay would amount to at least £6,000 per mile, or a? total of £750.000. to which has to be added the sum of £120,000 new expenditure on the existing Cooma line. ' So that Over £12,000,000 would have to be expended before one shilling could be spent upon the work of erecting the Capital. Do honorable members think the State of" New South Wales will expend large sums of money in giving railway access to territory they do not wish to grant? I would" point out to honorable members who voted" for the Dalgety site because they considered that it was important to have access to the sea, that an opportunity presents itself to secure a port much more suitable and more easy of access. All the country at the back of Jervis Bay, extending to the railway line connecting Sydney and1 Melbourne, is sparsely populated, and I have no doubt whatever that a large portion of that territory would be readily granted by New South Wales. In fact, I have little doubt that a much larger area would be available there, and at .considerably less cost than at Dalgety. And Jervis Bay, as a port, is certainly infinitely preferable to Twofold Bay in every respect ; but I do not say I am prepared to advocate the surrender by New South Wales of" any port which may be used- to divert trade from the port of Sydney which must, from its facilities and geographical position, ever remain the principal port of Australia. It must be remembered that the people of New South Wales accepted the Constitution Bill because they expected that they would derive some substantial benefit from having the Federal Capital located within their borders. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, during the Federal campaign, went so far as to say that the Capital would be located in such a position as to confer on Sydney substantial benefits in the matter of trade. We have departed from the spirit of the bond so far as that element is concerned. Dalgety is not within a reasonable distance of Sydney. It is true that it is beyond the 100-mile limit, but it is also almost as far away from that limit as any site possibly could be. The erection of the Federal Capital at Dalgety would confer no benefit upon New South Wales. In this connexion I wish to direct attention to the resolution that was passed at the Premiers' Conference with reference to the Federal Capital Site question. It reads as follows: - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>It is considered that the fixing of the site of the Capital is a question which might well be left to the Parliament to decide ; but in view of the strong expression of opinion in relation to this matter in New South Wales, the Premiers have modified the clause, so that while the Capital cannot be fixed at Sydney or in its neighbourhood, provision is made in the Constitution for its establishment in New South Wales, at a reasonable distance from that city. </para>
                        <para class="block">I admit that a great difference of opinion may exist as to what would be a reasonable distance from Sydney; but, at the same time, the words of the resolution have <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> be read in conjunction with the provision that the Capital shall be situated not less than 100 miles from Sydney. It might be fairly concluded that the site would be selected as near as possible to Sydney, outside the 100-mile limit. I understand that that limit was imposed primarily, for the purpose of excluding the choice of another site, which was in much favour - I refer to Moss Vale. Having excluded that site, I do not think it ever occurred to those who were responsible for <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> insertion in the Constitution of the 100 miles limit that a site should be chosen which would be practically inaccessible from Sydney. And the right honorable member for East Sydney, who was, a party to the agreement, has assured us that it was intended that the site should be somewhere near the 100-mile limit. I am quite sure that had the people of New South Wales ever dreamed that such a step as going to the extreme confines of the State was contemplated they would not have voted for the acceptance of the Commonwealth Constitution. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton took special pains to impress upon the people of Sydney that they would derive a substantial benefit from communication with the Federal Capital. He led them to believe that the trade from that Capital would go to Sydney. They were misled by these representations into voting for a proposal which under other circumstances they would not have supported. </para>

                            <para>- Undoubtedly he did. That fact is upon record. I certainly heard <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton make a similar statement at a meeting which he addressed in Sydney. He assured his hearers that, although Sydney had been excluded for a variety of reasons, a site would be selected in a locality which would confer upon that city a substantial advantage in the way of trade. That advantage cannot be conferred by the selection of Dalgety. For all practical purposes the Seat of Government might just as well be at Timbuctoo. Dalgety appears less to conform to all those requirements which should be our first consideration than any other site save one that we have been asked to consider. In speaking upon this matter, the honorable member for Kalgoorlie cast some doubt upon the reliability of the printed copy of the memorandum to which the Premiers of the six States attached their signatures. He even went so far as to suggest that the copies which had been circulated in this Chamber, printed under authority of the New South Wales Government, contained substantial alterations from the original document. So far from that having been the case, I find upon comparing them that no alteration whatever has been made in their wording, and consequently his charge falls to the ground. The Minister of Home Affairs, in introducing this Bill, declared that the previous Premier of New South Wales had refused to take any part in the selection of the site, because he regarded that as a matter within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Parliament. Even admitting that that is so, it will be seen that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> See's remarks referred not to the acquisition of Federal territory, but to the selection of the site. I do not think that it has ever been contended that it is the province of New South Wales to determine the site. What I complain of is that the Government did not ask that State to grant us the necessary territory before this Parliament selected the site. I have always maintained that the proper method of procedure was first to negotiate with New South Wales for the grant or acquisition of territory, and then to choose the site. I would also point out that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> See did not speak with the authority. of Parliament upon this question. He did not consult the Legislature in any way. Subsequently the Government of which he was the head was defeated, and its successors have taken up a definite attitude upon this matter. The present Government of that State may be taken to more correctly represent the feeling of the people of New South Wales than did the See Government. </para>

                            <para>- I beg the honorable member's pardon. Whilst it was not an issue of the election, there was some interest exhibited in it. There were very few candidates who entertained the slightest idea that the Seat of Government was to be located at such a remote distance from any centre of civilization as is Dalgety. I am absolutely certain that if an appeal were made to the people of New South Wales to-morrow they would unanimously decide against the selection of that particular locality. </para>

                            <para>- I have admitted that. That there is a considerable amount of feeling upon this question in New South Wades is evidenced by the action which the State Legislature took only a few days ago. It was a most unfortunate circumstance that, owing to some reasons with which we are not familiar, the closure had to be applied in order to force the resolution submitted by Mr. Carruthers through the House. I particularly deplore the action of the New South Wales Parliament in that connexion, because just at that period there seemed to be a prospect of the Federal Parliament arriving at some satisfactory solution of the difficulty which had been created. I fear that the action of the Premier of that State, justified as I admit it was in the circumstances as he understood them, may prejudice the calm consideration of this matter, by reason of the irritation which it has engendered in some quarters. Some honorable members have gone so far as to say that they would have reversed their votes upon this question if it had not been for the language in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers,</inline> had indulged. Well, all I can say is that it savours of pettiness and childishness, and is not worthy of men dealing with large national questions. We ought always to consider, as far as we can, the feelings of the States in matters which peculiarly affect themselves. Of course, the selection of the Seat of Government is a question which is of interest to the whole Commonwealth, but it particularly affects New South Wales, because that State has to cede a portion of its territory to the Federation. The recognition of the right of New South Wales to have the Federal Capital within its borders really carried with it a recognition of the view that it was peculiarly interested in the question of its precise situation. Some of the representatives of New South' Wales therefore think that they are well within their rights in calling attention to the feeling that exists amongst a large section, if not the majority, of the people of New, South Wales. </para>

The Bill itself seems to recognise the right of New South Wales to be consulted in the matter of the territory. </para>

Why could we not have asked for a grant of territory prior to our selection, of the site? Had we done so, we should have avoided the complications that have since arisen.

                    <para>Schedule A shows that this is a reference to the Dalgety site. In view of the decision of the Parliament of New South Wales not to grant that site, why are we tto.w considering a Bill requesting them to cede it to 'us? It seems to me that we are only making the position worse, instead of better, for ourselves. Both Houses of the State Parliament have decided against a grant of this territory. If this Bill be passed, and the people of New South Wales still refuse to grant this territory, another dead-lock will arise unless we are going to take some assertive action on behalf of the Commonwealth. Is that the intention ? That is a point upon which the House ought to be enlightened'. In the event of the Parliament adhering to its decision to establish the Capital at Dalgety, is this Government going to send an armed force into New South' Wales to take possession of the territory? </para>

                            <para>- If the armed force went to Dalgety all that we should find of them would be their petrified bodies, and the incident "would be handed down to posterity as an example of the stupendous folly of this Parliament. It is to be regretted that negotiations for a peaceful settlement of the question - negotiations that might have been satisfactory to all parties - were broken off, and that we are now asked to consider a measure which may be taken by the Parliament and people of New South Wales as another attempt to flout their wishes. They would certainly be justified in taking that view, since they have definitely refused to grant' this territory to us'. To proceed with the consideration of a Bill to acquire that territory in spite of the objections of the people of New South Wales seems to be an act of intentional discourtesy to them. I can only hope that the word "' Dalgety " will be omitted from the Bill, and that a more suitable locality will be substituted - one which will be more in consonance with the spirit of the compact, and more agreeable to the desires of the people of New South Wales. When such a selection has been made, I trust that the Federal Parliament will be able to approach the people of New South Wales, through the State Legislature, in a more conciliatory spirit, so that some arrangement may be arrived at which will be mutually satisfactory. I earnestly hope that, whatever we do in the settlement of this question will be in the direction of promoting harmony and good feeling among the people of all the States. </para>

                            <para>- I have already pointed out that it is a most inhospitable bract of country ; that it is practically treeless ; that the surveyors, in their early reports, pointed out that, not eve a along the banks of the rivers was there much sign of vegetation; that all hope of cultivating, parks or gardens there would have to be abandoned; and that, from these .points of view, a less suitable site could scarcely be selected. I have also alluded to its inaccessibility, and I would add to the objections that I have urged on that score, that those who favour its selection, because they believe it" will have access to Eden as a Federal port, disregard the great engineering difficulties in the way of constructing a railway between the two points. There is a sheer descent of several thousand feet, and it is only by a most circuitous route that Twofold Bay can be reached from Dalgety. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that it would, although, even if they did, it seems to me that it would be of little service to Dalgety. On only one . side of the harbor is there anything like safe anchorage for vessels of fairly large tonnage, and even that is unsuitable for vessels of great draught. It is almost an open roadstead. When there is an easterly or south-easterly swell running into Twofold Bay, even vessels lying alongside the extreme end of the wharf which runs out from Eden on the protected side of the port roll to such an extent that many of their passengers often suffer from sea-sickness. The representatives of Western Australia, who urge that if Twofold Bay were a Federal port they would be able to travel by some of the fine inter-State steamers, and land almost directly at the door of the Capital, cannot know what sort of harbor exists there. If they did, they would dismiss such an idea from their minds. There is a limited area of harbor at Boyd Town, on the southern shore, which is sheltered from the south-easterly and southerly winds, but not from the north-easterly winds. ' On the other hand, the northern shore is more or less exposed to the full force of southeasterly gales blowing in from a stretch of ocean several thousands of miles in extent. To make the port a safe anchorage for vessels of fairly large tonnage, an immense breakwater would have to be run out from Boyd Point, and at the lowest estimate the cost of such a work would be £1,500,000. To those honorable members who think that the Federal Capital should have a port of its own, I would point out that Jervis Bay, which lies between Twofold Bay and Sydney, is a port much superior to Twofold Bay, while the country between it and the main line from Adelaide to Brisbane, passing through Melbourne and Sydney, contains several sites suitable for a Federal Capital. The geographical position of Sydney, however, is such that it must always be the great supplying and commercial centre of Australia. I hope that the Parliament will reconsider this matter, apart from all provincial considerations, and. in the interests of Australia as a whole, and that honorable members will put aside their personal prejudices, and remember that their determination will affect future generations. I hope that the Postmaster-General, who appears to be so enamoured of the Dalgety site, will forget that he is representing a constituency containing a Federal site-- </para>

I should like a site to be chosen adjacent to the main trunk line of railway, and, for that reason, voted for Lyndhurst, which, although not on the main line, is close <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> a line which, had the Federal Capital been located there, would have become the main line, connecting the Capitals of the States. But in voting for Lyndhurst, although 1 indicated my preference for that site before the other sites then offered, I did not indicate my preference for it above any other possible site. </para>

I hope that Parliament, in coming to its decision on this matter, will be actuated by a Federal spirit, and will disregard anything that has been said in the New South Wales Parliament which may have hurt their personal feelings. Negotiations for the settlement of 4he question were proceeding in quite a different way before the matter cropped up there, and had it not been for the action taken we might by this time have reached a friendly decision. I do not think that the Federal Parliament will suffer any loss of dignity if it gives way in such a manner as to soothe the irritation of the people of New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>- My view of the attempts made on both sides to bring this matter before the High Court is not by any means a complimentary one. I do not wish to say more than that. They have been singularly unfortunate. We are asked to deal with what is admittedly a vital measure in a House which is practically moribund. I understand that during the last two or three weeks the attendance in this Chamber has not been so numerous as it is at present. </para>

                            <para>- I have been told by some of my friends that the attendance here today has been similar to those of the past three or four weeks. What a miserable spectacle the Chamber presented this morning, with only eight or nine members present ! I do not complain of their absence, because I think that, considering the exhausting labours which they have been called upon to perform, it cannot be wondered at that they are reluctant to remain here, and I should be the last to criticise them, because I am so often absent myself. It is regrettable, however, that we should be dealing with this measure at this period of the session, and if the Government can relieve themselves from blame in connexion with the matter, so much the better for them. Early in the session I asked them to let us deal with the measure in good time, so that we could give to it the consideration which it deserves. The Bill says that a certain territory, which it is attempted to describe - is hereby determined to be the territory within which the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth shall be. </para>

Here is. a clause in a Bill which solemnly declares that the Capital shall be at some place where the Constitution declares that it cannot be, because the Seat of the Commonwealth Government can only be determined to be in territory which has been granted or acquired. It is only after the territory has been acquired! or granted that we can determine the Site. </para>

                    <para class="block">We have already passed an Act which intimates where we propose that the Capital shall be. The next stage was to get the territory, which would be necessary in order to fix the Capital where we had decided that it should be. This Bill does not help us one bit in that direction. It leaves matters absolutely where they were when the last Act was passed The third clause of the Bill contains a still more extraordinary provision. It reads as follows : - </para>

                    <para class="block">With great respect to Ministers, I would point out that this clause calls for serious attention. The Minister is empowered to obtain something, if he can, and the Governor-General is empowered to accept something if he can get it. And what is that? - a grant, something given by the State of New South Wales. In the light of the difficulties which exist between the Federal Government and the New South' Wales Government, such a provision borders upon comedy or burlesque. The attitude of the New South Wales Government and Parliament, whether right or wrong, is perfectly clear. They say: "We will not grant you a site at Dalgety, and we will not give you 900 square miles, whether it be at Dalgety or elsewhere." This Bill is our answer to that. It is proposed in clause 2 to declare that the Capital shall be in territory that we have not got, and having decided that the site shall be in that territory, we are, under the provisions of clause 3, going to ask New South Wales to grant it to us. If that be the position, we are not moving on very rapidly. In view of the facts, which are well known throughout Australia, the Bill is practically a piece of waste paper. We are now in a position - and it is very regrettable - practically of dead-lock between the Parliament of New South Wales and this Parliament, and some of the Members of the "Federal Parliament have descended to the use of language with reference to the Government and Parliament of New South' Wales, which is a disgrace to them. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that it is in the interests of a friendly settlement that such language can be used. We talk of asserting our dignity and our rights, and about resenting dictation. Surely men who take up that perfectly justifiable position might show some degree of respect and regard for others. </para>

                            <para>- I know that. I merely say that it is to be regretted that language has been used on both sides which has made the trouble not more easy, but more difficult, to settle. I should like to say, also, that me impatience and resentment which exists in New South Wales over this matter - I do not want to refer to matters which are not before the House - is intelligible. In the first place, the site selected was not popular in New South Wales. However good it may be iri itself, the selection was not received with any satisfaction in the State. </para>

                            <para>- I claim to know something about the feeling in New South Wales, just as my honorable friend claims to know the feeling that prevails in Western Australia. I should not for a moment venture to question his superior knowledge with regard to the sentiment of Western Australia. I simply give my opinion for what it is worth. I admit that the wave of indignation may not be quite so fierce or overwhelming as some people describe it, but I know that there' is a very strong feeling of dissatisfaction. At this stage of the session I do not wish to criticise the action of the Government very much, but I must express my regret that we got off the track of friendly negotiations, as we did when we declined to go into Committee to consider the expression of the wishes of the New South Wales Parliament in connexion with this question. That is the point at which the Government went off the track. We might have determined that any change in our selection was impossible ; we might have made up our minds that the sites offered by the New South Wales Parliament were inadmissible, and could not be considered; but, recognising the undoubted standing of New South Wales as the State in which the Capital is to be, and as the State whose territory is to be taken for the purpose of establishing the Capital, surely we ought to have gone into Committee, and to have paid New South Wales the common courtesy of considering her requests. </para>

                            <para>- The Prime Minister utterly misconceives, and for such a conciliatory public man, strangely misconceives, the situation, when he regards this as a courteous step. We have not considered the request of the New South Wales Parliament. We are going on as if it had never been made. This matter presents itself in two aspects. One is the choice by the Federal Parliament of a. site, and the other is the disinclination of the New South Wales Parliament to grant that site, followed by an offer of other sites. If the New South Wales Parliament had simply considered our choice, and had said "No," without taking any further step, our position would have been sound, but, instead of that, the State Parliament first said "No" to our choice-- </para>

                            <para>- We know that Parliaments cannot consider matters together. Governments can come together, but Parliaments cannot. By-and-by they may be able to; but at present they cannot, and, perhaps, it is just as well that they cannot. If the New South Wales Parliament had said " No " to our choice, and done nothing more, we should have had no duty such as I refer to, but when they followed up their rejection of our choice with an offer of three other sites, the position was different. Surely New South Wales had a right to submit three other sites for the consideration of this Parliament? </para>

                            <para>- Whether that be so or not, I put it plainly and fairly that, since New South Wales, in expressing disagreement from our choice, took the trouble to offer other sites, it was our duty to take their suggestions into consideration. The late Government considered the matter, and their intention was to have taken the resolutions of the New South Wales Parliament into consideration in Committee of the Whole, so that the House might have had an opportunity to pay New South Wales. - I will not say the compliment, but the duty and proper respect of considering its proposals - with the perfect liberty to say "No" to them. We should have been at perfect liberty to reply, " We have considered your proposals, and regret that we cannot accept any one of them." It is said that we can do that in connexion with this Bill, but I submit that this is a very unhappy way of dealing with the matter. If in the ordinary affairs of life, two individuals had interests in common, and one expressed an intention of which the other disapproved, and made an alternative suggestion, what would be said if the person who made the first suggestion took no notice and pursued his own course? I contend that the people of New South Wales have absolute justification for the irritation they feel owing to the contemptuous way in which their wishes have been treated. We go into Committee to consider the most trifling amendments made by the other Chamber in a Bill. Our measures are matters of mutual concern between the Chambers, and when any amendments are made in a Bill sent by us to the Senate, we go into Committee to consider them. We pay them that courtesy without the slightest prejudice to our right to reject the amendments. </para>

                    <para>The Parliament of New South Wales practically forwarded us a reply which this House has never taken into consideration. It was not a reply from the Premier of New South Wales to the Government of the Commonwealth. It was in the nature of a communication addressed by the New South Wales Legislature to the Parliament of the Commonwealth, and it was the duty of the Government to have submitted those resolutions in Committee of the Whole, so that we might at least have paid New South Wales the common civility of taking her wishes into consideration. </para>

                            <para>- That would have led to nothing. Nobody can deny that the Parliament of New South. Wales has a right to express a wish upon this subject. That goes without saying. It did express a wish by resolution, not by way of saying, " Take this site, or we will grant you no other," but by offering us three sites. I say that that suggestion ought to have been taken into consideration in Committee, irrespective of whether or not we intended to pay it the slightest consideration. But, instead of doing that, the Parliament of New South Wales was treated as we should treat an officious letter-writer. Its communication has been thrown into the waste-paper basket. Of course, it may be urged that the Government of the Commonwealth have bestowed a good deal of time upon this question. That, however, is no answer to my statement. The matter is one between Parliament and Parliament, and it is not sufficient for an UnderSecretary to reply to a State Minister. It must be a matter of equal authority, of Government dealing with Governemnt, and Parliament with Parliament. The Commonwealth Parliament, through no fault of its own, has not taken the wishes of the New South Wales Parliament into consideration. Now, I pass away from that aspect of the question, because we have to deal with the situation which has since arisen. I sa.y that there will be no justice rendered to New </para>

                    <para>South Wales by professing to reconsider this matter at a time like the present, when half of the members have left for their homes. We are here at a time when only honorable members like myself, who have not been doing their duty, can possibly be fit to consider this matter. Honorable members have been working under a very great strain for weeks past, and their own sensations must tell them that they are not fit to grapple with this question as it ought to be grappled with. At the present stage of the session, I do not consider that the House will improve the situation at all by proceeding with this Bill. I think I may speak for my colleagues from New South Wales pretty generally, and I consider we ought to be as much interested in the matter as is any other honorable member. </para>

Just as I deprecate very strongly the use of objectionable language in this Chamber, I deplore the use of such expressions as that to which the honorable member has referred. They are the last expressions in the world that should be used when there is any prospect of friendly negotiations. My position in reference to the Capital </para>

                    <para class="block">Site has always been a very clear one. Originally I was in favour of the selection of Lake George. But the representatives of New South Wales realized that if we were to split ourselves up into sections, and to support three or four sites, we would simply come in nowhere. Consequently we met and considered the matter. We came to a certain conclusion. </para>

I should like to say a word or two in reference to the caucus, hut this is not the time to do so. The New South Wales representatives held several meetings, and came to the conclusion that, instead of frittering away our energies over four or five sites, we should support the selection of Lyndhurst. </para>

We decided to support Lyndhurst, and that fact accounts for the prominent position that it occupied at the ballot. Not one of the New South Wales representatives voted for Dalgety. Not one member of this House supported the selection of that site when it stood by itself , and had to rely upon its own merits. Not one vote was then registered in its favour - not even the vote of the Postmaster-General. </para>

                            <para>- I do not. If that be so, it simply shows what a bad choice they had. Personally I had to vote for Dalgety as a choice between two evils. If Tooma were the greatest paradise in the world, it had the disadvantage of being in a cemetery. We do not wish to bury ourselves when we go to the Seat of Government. I ruled Tooma out of consideration, not because a most successful picnic had been celebrated there, but on account of its geographical position. </para>

There is not one of the representatives of New South Wales who supported1 Lyndhurst, who cast a vote in favour of Dalgety upon its merits. Not one of them registered a vote, indicating that they honestly thought it the best site for the Capital. </para>

                            <para>- I hope that the right honorable gentleman paid for the revision of that speech, because I think that that work would cost more than did the actual setting up of the speech itself. To come back to a matter more important than is even the Treasurer's Budget speech, I should like to point out that the position I have taken up all through has been a very simple one. I tried hard to secure the selection of the site of which I approved, and failing that, I tried to obtain the selection of the least objectionable site. That led me to vote for Dalgety, and I say again that, unless there is a reasonable prospect of the selection of a site more in the direction of my old choice, I am going always to stand by that site. </para>

I have fought with the honorable gentleman - just as he has fought with other people - while it suited me, and when it does not suit me, I shall fight with someone else. It suited me to support the honorable gentleman in the selection of Dalgety, in order to avoid a worse evil ; but when I have a chance of obtaining a better site - one of which I was originally in favour - I am going every time to try to assist in promoting that prospect. I have put my views very plainly. In September last. I stated very clearly why I voted for Dalgety: - </para>

My own impression, as against that of others in New South Wales, who so much assail this selection, is that it is absolutely the best that New South Wales is ever likely to get - that any change would absolutely be for the worse. </para>

I have every reason to believe, however, that a very great change has come over the feelings of some honorable members in connexion with this subject. I have grounds for the belief that if this question be re-opened, there is a, reasonable prospect of the selection of a site more in the direction of that which I originally favoured, and one which is more likely than is Dalgety to give satisfaction to the people of New South Wales. The Minister of Home Affairs will see that my position is a perfectly fair one. </para>

                            <para>- Of course; although I do not suppose we shall get credit for that consideration. With reference to the stipulation that the Capital should be in New South Wales, I may say that I had two good reasons for urging it, and I think that those reasons still remain good. The first was that I did not believe that the Bill would be passed in the absence of such a stipulation. That was the reason which guided the five other Premiers, meeting in conference with me, in agreeing to my suggestion. They knew that it was really a point among others upon which the movement depended. They did not agree to it out of any courtesy to me or to New South Wales ; they agreed to it because they believed that without that concession, the prospect of a Federal Union was remote. They may have been wrong ; I think that they were right. My own impression is that without that stipulation, the Federal Union would not have been consummated. </para>

                            <para>- That is a most unhappy expression to use. The five Premiers sitting in conference with me were business men assembled at a business conference, and they had to choose between Federation without New South Wales or with it. The honorable member must not say that the granting of the concession was a bribe. If language may be abused in that way, every favorable clause in a treaty must be a bribe. If the honorable member's contention be correct, every clause in a treaty which is drawn up between ambassadors at a council table must be a bribe, since one concedes something to the other. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly. But the expression was an unhappy one; it was decidedly ill-chosen. The Premiers who attended the Conference were men of independence, and could just as easily have said to me, " No, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid,</inline> we will not do what you wish." But they decided upon broad considerations to accede to the suggestion I made. There is something more than that to be considered. I wish to put the national reason upon which I made the stipulation - a reason which I shall justify, and which, I think, posterity will justify, as being far from a parochial or selfish consideration. I may be wrong, but in my judgment then, and it is the same now, the great bulk of the population of Australia in the future would be on the eastern rather than on the western seaboard. I hope to see all our sea boards under the Commonwealth develop grand populations ; but I do submit now, as I did then, that if one views the great elements which make for population -the elements, of manufactures and commerce - one must see that they lie more directly upon the eastern than upon the western seaboard. </para>

Looking to the future development of Australia, I came to the honest view that the eastern seaboard would be the centre of the Federation in point of humanity, and that it ought to be so in point of government. That was my principal reason for insisting upon the provision in question. I also knew well, as honorable members know, that if I had not made that stipulation, the Capital would not have been in New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable and learned gentleman practically contends that the words were put in to add to the 100 miles' restriction a further restriction of a vague and ambiguous character. That may be the view of the honorable and learned gentleman, but it is not the view of the six Premiers who were parties to the agreement, and knew what it meant.. It is easy for persons who want to get away from the spirit of the bargain to put on it constructions of their own. This is not a compact for lawyers to construe, but for Premiers and populations to act honorably by. The Capital could be placed at Wilcannia under the words " not less than 100 miles," as construed by some honorable members. </para>

                            <para>- If the Attorney-General is right, the words "and be distant not less than 100 miles from Sydney" mean that what the Conference intended was that it should1 be as far as possible from Sydney. Surely the words " at a reasonable distance from that city " were added in order to point out that, while the Capital should not be within 100 miles of Sydney, the Premiers thought that it should be within a reasonable distance of that city. I appeal to the Treasurer if that was not so. </para>

I do not think I shall be breaking confidence now when I say, years after the Conference - I am sure that the right honorable member for Balaclava will forgive me for the statement - that the Victorian delegates met before the Conference was held, and wished him to stipulate for a limit of 200 miles. When I tried to reduce the limit from 100 miles to seventy-five miles, the right honorable gentleman explained to me that he had already yielded, as far as he could, in consenting to a limit of 100 miles. </para>

                            <para>- I had had experience of the other Premiers during the five years that I was in office in New South Wales, and was quite willing to accept their words without their signatures. The construction that " a reasonable distance from Sydney " means an unreasonable distance does not appeal to me, although I was one of those who drew up the compact. In a Court of law, the lawyers make a contract for their clients, but men transacting their own business are guided by what they meant by their contracts, and not a member of the Premiers' Conference would give to the compact the legal construction which has been placed upon by the honorable and learned member for Indi. </para>

                            <para>- The arrangement entered into was, as the report shows, that, while the Capital should be at least 100 miles from Sydney, it should be built with a reasonable regard to its position in reference <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> that city. That was the spirit and meaning of the agreement, as every one of the parties to it will attest. I wish to know how we stand in this Parliament, and what sort of men we are doing business with. Do they wish to place a legal construction on an honorable bargain which the parties to that bargain repudiate? I think that the arguments which have been used are vicious and unsound. The question is, what the agreement meant to the Premiers and to the peoples of the States, not what it means to those who have an interest in reading it upside down. I hope that this already painful controversy will not be envenomed by treatment of this kind. </para>

                                O'Connor and several other learned counsel gave the same opinion as to what was meant with reference to New South Wales, and I believe that I expressed my opinion on the subject in an interview ; but I have no recollection of any controversy with the right honorable member for Balaclava on the subject. I should be surprised to have a controversy with him on the point upon which I am now speaking. I think it will be found that he is of the opinion that it was not intended that a further disability should be added to the 100 miles limit, because, if that is what is intended, the -limit' might have been regarded as 200. or 300, or 400 miles. We were not prepared for a limit of 100 miles, and a legal construction which would compel the Capital to be placed somewhere down on the Murray, near the constituency of Indi. When the Attorney-General can get one of the parties of the bargain to read it in his way-

That is a question of serious importance, which I hope will never have to be considered. I hope that those who have this matter at heart, will rest satisfied that the Government will loyally regard the decision of this Parliament, unless it is rescinded, and, so far as I am concerned, any attempt to rescind it will meet with my strongest opposition. </para>

There, was a fight between Tooma and Dalgety, and it was such a near thing that but for a marvellous achievement on the part of the Postmaster-General, Tooma would have been selected. The Minister of Trade and Customs was led into a division when he thought that he was quite safe, but everything was wrong. That secured Dalgety for us, and I knew that it stood upon such a frail footing that unless I clung to it with all my power, we should be buried down at Tooma. I told the Postmaster-General that if Tooma were selected I should counsel the people of New South Wales to absolutely refuse to consider it. I did not tell him that about Dalgety. </para>

                            <para>- I felt some delicacy in mentioning the matter even this evening, lest I might be considered to 'have broken a bond by repeating a private conversation. However, the incident occurred so many years ago that I feel that I may be forgiven for mentioning it now. But be that as it may, I have taken up an absolutely clear position. I would stand by Dalgety to the last when there was any danger of a worse site being chosen. Dalgety was never my choice, and any one looking through the debates will find that I did not use one single expression of satisfaction with regard to it. It was forced upon me as the least of the evils that threatened New South Wales. </para>

I disliked No. 3 because I thought it utterly bad, and I supported No. 2 site, which was not so bad. I now believe that I can get my original selection, and when I elect to take it, I am called a political contortionist. That is a matter of common sense that cannot be appreciated by some members of the Labour Party. I am shifting from Dalgety because I think I can get something better.

                            <para>- Yes; but if that were meant the expression "can be granted" would not be used. In a territorial sense, every inch of the land, whether owned privately or otherwise, could be granted. That is to say, the relation of the State towards it could be transferred to the Commonwealth. My point, however, is that, instead of doing anything, this clause is supremely ridiculous, in that it empowers a Minister to apply to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers,</inline> the Premier of New South Wales, for this 900 square miles. In view of the attitude of the Government of New South Wales, that is silly in the extreme. If this were a conciliatory move, there might be something in it, whether it was sensible or not. It is declared, however, that the Seat of Government shall be at Dalgety, and1 there is no move in the direction of conciliation. Then clause 3 empowers the Minister not to acquire the territory, but to present his compliments to the Premier of New South Wales., and ask him to grant it. That is ridiculous, because that has been done already. </para>

                            <para>- No; but when we passed an Act determining that Dalgety should be the site of the Federal Capital, the very step here provided for was taken. The Government, as was their duty, immediately sent to the New South Wales Premier a copy of the Act containing the determination of the Federal Parliament, and asked him to take the steps necessary to carry out their choice. This Bill is simply repeating, as a dismal farce; that which was already provided for by this Parliament months and months ago. The Minister is empowered to obtain, and the Governor-General is empowered to accept, a grant by the State of New South Wales of the territory described in Schedule A to the Act. The expression " grant " implies the giving of something. It does not imply the forcible taking of anything. It suggests ah approach to the Premier of New South Wales for a grant, but action has been taken already in that direction. The moment this Parliament chose Dalgety, we asked the New South Wales Government to take the steps that were necessary to give effect to the Seat of Government Act. Now we are going to solemnly pass a measure empowering the Minister to ask the Premier of New South Wales to grant us something that he has already declared he will not grant. This is surely a wondrous Bill, and this House will fairly crown its recent labours if it passes it. Now clause 3 provides that - </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para>From the day when the grant and acceptance take effect - </para>
                    <para class="block">Everything hangs on that. The Minister is to repeat that letter that we sent to New South Wales a year ago. He is to say : " I am empowered to obtain from you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers,</inline> a grant of the Dalgety site." A letter' would1 have answered the same purpose. The clause goes on - all estates and interests held by any person from the State of New South Wales within the territory so granted and accepted shall continue to be held from the Commonwealth on the same terms and conditions as they are on that day held from the State. </para>
                    <para class="block">No doubt the term " grant " is used in the sense of territorial grant, without reference to the tenure of the land. It all comes back to this : That the Premier of New South Wales can only be asked to grant the territory. A request is to be made, and1 we are solemnly passing an Act of Parliament embodying a request that was conveyed by correspondence months ago If this Bill provided that if the Parliament of New South Wales would1 not grant us the territory which we ask, such and such a thing should happen, it might effect some good. But what is to happen, in the contingency which I have suggested ? The entire Bill is conditioned upon the grant being made by New South Wales. That grant must take place before the Bill can achieve anything. What is to happen subsequently? The State laws are to continue in operation " until Parliament otherwise provides." Provision is also made for the territory having access from the sea. The whole Bill hangs upon its first portion - upon the Government of New South Wales doing a thing which they have absolutely said they will not do, namely, facilitate our acquisition of the Dalgety site. They have made their position perfectly clear, and it does not seem to me that in this Bill we are taking up either a diplomatic or a strong position. There are two things which might be done - one is to take up a strong position, and assert whatever rights we may have in the matter ; and the other is to adopt a conciliatory attitude, and endeavour to arrive at an amicable arrangement in that way. This Bill does neither. It asserts that the Seat of Government shall be at Dalgety. That is not conciliation. Then it says, in effect, " Will you kindly grant us this particular site, embracing an . area of 900 square miles?" The measure will raise another inflammable subject in New South Wales. The Bill not only asks that State to grant us a territory at Dalgety, but it actually says., " There is the territory that we want ; there are its boundaries ; we have mapped out 900 square miles, and there is a legal description- of it, similar to that which usually appears at the end of a conveyance. All that you have to do is to give us that site." </para>

                        REID. - Is that any reason why another boodler should come along and claim 900 square miles of her territory? The fact is that the party to which the honorable member belongs wishes to obtain a large slice of New South Wales territory in order that it may indulge in a socialistic experiment. New South Wales is not prepared to give land for that purpose.

But other people naturally expect us to keep our hands out of their pockets. This Bill is, a perfectly idle and childish one. If it were something better than that, this is not the time of the session to do it justice. There are too many members absent. It is useless to talk about our powers having been exercised, because we do not know what modifications may arise- </para>

It seems to me idle to expect that we can settle this matter in a satisfactory way at the present late period of the session, and, so far as I am personally concerned, I am strongly in favour of its consideration being deferred. Although I am a representative of New South Wales, and may seem to be taking a course which is contrary to the wishes of her people, I am prepared to accept the responsibility for my action, feeling that results, will justify the adoption of the course that I suggest. </para>

                        <para>.. - It is a little unfortunate for the right honorable member for East Sydney that nearly the whole of his speech has been an apology for his own previous action. I submit that the position of this question of the Federal Capital is clear beyond dispute. In August, 1904, the Commonwealth Parliament, after three years of urging by the representatives of New South Wales/ and' indirectly by the Parliament and Government of that State, took it upon itself redetermine the future Seat of Government. It did so at a great expenditure of time and trouble. The Act which was then passed, partly at the request of the right honorable member for East Sydney himself, did not proceed to determine finally and precisely certain matters which might well have been decided, and which we wish to have determined now. It was urged that the Bill should not be couched in mandatory terms, but that the word " should " should be substituted for " shall " in section 3. Section 2 says that the Seat of Government " shall " be within seventeen miles of Dalgety, and the following section declared that the territory to be granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth "should" contain an area of not less than 900 square miles, and have access to the sea. Honorable members will, therefore, see that there was nothing precisely determined in that Act, except that Dalgety must be the locality, and that it was the wish of this Parliament that the Federal territory should contain an area of 900 square miles, and have access to the sea. At that time there was no talk whatever of this newly- found argument in reference to the Premiers' Conference. </para>

Is it to be suggested that a matter which is so vital to the spirit of the compact arrived at by the Premiers' Conference that, according to his view, it should override the legal interpretation of the Constitution, was forgotten by him? That suggestion is absolutely contrary to what was stated, and done by the Premiers themselves, by New South Wales itself, by this Parliament itself, and by members of the Opposition. I will accept the challenge of the right honorable member, and deal with this matter, not from a legal stand-point, but from the stand-point of common sense. I will invite honorable members to recollect the progress of the negotiations which led up to the final shaping of section 125 of the Constitution.

The Legislative Assembly of that State adopted the resolution which I am about to read, but the Legislative Council, by a majority of one, affirmed that the Seat of Government should be in Sydney.

When the right honorable member for East Sydney submitted his proposal at the Premiers' Conference the right honorable member for Balaclava said " No. We will not agree to that. We wish to exclude from that portion of New South Wales within which the Seat of Government will be located an area of 100 miles from Sydney." What I wish to ask is whether that excision of the area of100 miles from Sydney in any way altered the provision with regard to the rest of New South Wales? </para>

But for that bargain having been made, the Federal Parliament could have fixed the Capital anywhere in New South Wales, but because the right honorable member for Balaclava obtained the excision of the area of 100 miles from Sydney, it is argued that that makes an alteration in regard to the rest of the area. With all respect to the right honorable member for East Sydney, I would say that such an argument is nonsensical. </para>

I think that his observations are worth reading. At pages 28 and 29 of the volume of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> from which I have just quoted, the right honorable gentleman is reported to have given utterance to his own view of the position. I shall be permitted, perhaps, to quote, first of all, a sentence at the end of the passage that I wish to read, because it sums up the position.

                    <para>It was a very strong desire on the part of many of my fellow citizens - a desire which I did not share, but to which I felt it right to give way - that it should be placed in black and white in the Bill that the Capital should be somewhere in New South Wales ; and to get that concession, which is a concession, it became necessary for the right honorable member at the head of the Government to give a concession in return, and to grant that the Capital should not be placed within 100 miles of Sydney. </para>
                    <para class="block">What does that mean? Clearly that the Capital should be established anywhere in New South Wales, except within 100 miles of Sydney. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton continued - </para>
                    <para>Let us consider this matter, and see whether it is quite so serious as they suggest. I would rather that it had been the other way, but let us see whether it is quite so serious as some persons outside, notably sundry writers of numerous letters to the newspapers, would seem to make out. If the Capital is a little more, than 100 miles from Sydney, it would still be within a three hours' rail journey, and I take it that it will be the endeavour - however Federal, and however patriotic minded they may be - of a large number of the representatives of New South Wales, and most of them, so long as considerations of position and climate are faithfully observed, to see that that Capital is not placed too remotely from either Sydney or Melbourne. If considerations of climate are observed, it will not be very near Melbourne if it is in New South Wales. </para>

                    <para>I am not going to point out any place as a suitable site for the Federal Capital. But if we once recognise this position, that it will be a probable necessity agreed upon throughout Australia that the Federal Capital should be placed in some position which has distinct climatic advantages, it will be easy for honorable members to see that the choice to that extent will be narrowed down, and that this distance of 100 miles from Sydney does not work so much against Sydney as it works against Melbourne, for the distance from Melbourne to Albury is 186 miles. </para>
                    <para class="block">I should mention that, in a few lines which I did not think it necessary to read, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Barton</inline> pointed out that the Federal Parliament would probably sit in summer, because there would be six legislatures sitting in the winter, and that, therefore, they would require to select some place with a moderate summer climate. He went on - </para>
                    <para>Let us recollect that the decision that the Capital shall not be within 100 miles of Sydney is at the same time a decision that if it is placed on that line of railway at all, it shall not be within 186 miles of Melbourne. And when we see that Sydney is giving up a great deal in this matter, we must also recollect that Victoria is giving up a little more, because her distance limit is nearly twice that which you impose upon New South Wales. I think these are considerations which are worth recollecting. They are worth taking into consideration impartially ; and while we may have our regrets on a subject of this kind, it is only fair to recollect that we are placing other people under a much more severe handicap than we are placing the city of Sydney. </para>
                    <para class="block">Under what more severe handicap is it desired to place Melbourne ? This is a very distinct piece of evidence, that the construction placed by the leader of the Opposition upon the report of the Premiers' Conference is not borne out by the facts. Let us see what is the next point. On the 9th August, 1904, the right honorable member for East Sydney, after the vote had taken place on the Seat of Government Bill, and after the Bombala, or South-Eastern district, had been accepted-- </para>

I think that I can prove that the Parliament of New South Wales has given an answer to this allegation,, because in December, 1904, it passed the following resolution, which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> forwarded to the late Government on the nth April last:- </para>

                        <para>I understand that the Government of New South Wales submitted to the Legislative Assembly of that State a list containing the names of foul places which might be offered by the Parliament of New South Wales to the Federal Parliament. The Parliament of New South Wales would be absolutely within its rights in any offer that they might make to us. The proposal submitted to the Legislative Assembly of that State was that one of four sites should be offered, and that body, I understand, decided to omit from the list of sites the name of Dalgety. In other words, it determined not to offer Dalgety as a- site for the Federal Capital. If that has happened, it does not in the slightest degree alter the decision arrived at by us, and embodied in an Act of Parliament' It may amount to an expression of a desire to ask this Parliament to reconsider the decision at which, it has arrived, but the omission of the name from a proposed offer does not alter the decision of thi* Parliament. If it should turn out thai, a majority of the members of this Parliament a-re prepared to repeal the Act which we passed, and choose some site other than Dalgety, the object which I suppose the Legislative Assembly of New South; Wales had in view in omitting the name of that place from its list might be secured. So far as <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> am concerned - and I think that T may speak for my colleagues - we are satisfied to act upon the choice which has been arrived at by this Parliament. If it be impossible to arrange any voluntary understanding between the State and the Commonwealth, another situation may arise, but it will be time enough to deal with that situation when it arises. </para>

I have tried to make my meaning clear, and if the honorable member cannot follow me I cannot hold myself responsible for that. It seems to me that the leader of the Opposition has misconceived the object of the Bill. The Seat of Government Act of 1904 puts no compulsion on New South Wales, and was not intended to do so. What it provides is that the Seat of Government shall be in the vicinity or locality of Dalgety. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable and learned member must not put words into my mouth. The Act does not delimit the actual territory. It does not declare it to be marked out by certain metes and bounds. All we could do under the circumstances was to provide that the Federal Capital should be within seventeen miles of Dalgety. The superficial area in acres or in miles to be chosen was left an open question, and at the present moment no one can say exactly what area will be taken, or on what site the Capital will be built. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. It is plain that there is no enactment in the Act as to the area of the Federal territory. I should like to point out that we have first to mark out the territory. After we have done that, and the territory has been granted or acquired, the Federal Government, acting under the powers conferred by the Constitution, may establish the Capital. The first step to be taken, however, is to mark out the territory, and the next step is to acquire it. </para>

                    <para>The question is : How are we to get that territory ? The contention of my honorable friends opposite, and of the New South Wales Government, is that the State authorities must come to us. first, and say : " We shall grant you a piece of land," or that we must first acquire the land from private owners, or partly from private owners and partly, from the Crown, as the case may be. They argue, further, that, having done that, we must go to the New South Wales Parliament and ask them if they are willing that the area we have selected shall be the Federal territory. Can that position be sustained? If the Constitution had remained as it was when it was passed by the Convention, and had provided that the Commonwealth Parliament could establish the Federal Capital anywhere in Australia, it would, according to the argument of my honorable friends, be necessary for the Commonwealth Government first to obtain a grant from each of the States, and then determine which of them should be selected as the Federal territory. Is not that nonsense? The argument is that New South Wales must come to us and dictate what territory it is to give; and if it is not willing to give us any particular territory, we cannot obtain it. </para>

The Crown may grant a tenancy in fee-simple, or under lease, to any one else. That has been done in regard to some of the land, but the Crown has retained its whole right as to other land. We ask that we may be empowered to obtain from New South Wales the full amount that they have to give - it may be the ownership, undiminished by any tenancy, or it may be ultimate ownership, subject to tenancy in fee-simple, or otherwise, granted to some one else. As a Commonwealth, we ask to be placed in the same position with regard to that territory as the State of New South Wales occupies to-day. </para>

But I take it that once this Parliament has determined upon the territory, the duty will rest on New South Wales to make the grant.

                            <para>- That is a matter for this Parliament to determine. It may be decided by the High Court that we have gone beyond our power. One of the objects of the Bill is to satisfy the desire previously expressed by the Government of New South Wales that we should put the matter in such a form that it could be tested. As the law stands, it never could be tested. We could not go to the High Court, and say, "Have we taken too much?" We cannot drive a peg in any part of the land. But if we pass this Bill, we shall have delimited the territory, and we can say to New South Wales, 1 ' We ask you to make that grant in compliance with your duty under the Constitution." If New South Wales refuses, and the High Court decides that New_ South Wales is bound to make the grant, the State will no doubt comply. I have no doubt in my own mind - whether I am right or wrong - that New South Wales cannot for ever stand in the way, and prevent this Parliament from obtaining a site for the Capital. I am sure that if the rights of the matter were determined by the High Court, no State would -be more ready than New South Wales to make the grant. </para>

                    <para class="block">We also make other provisions, which are not material to the present discussion. The Bill is not so futile as the right honorable gentleman has represented. It is in strict accordance with the Constitution as we understand it, and with all honorable understandings as we have understood them, and as they have been understood and acted upon by New South Wales. It provides for a necessary step - a step taken practically at the invitation of the Government of New South Wales, in order that we may ask for' the territory, and that the New South Wales Government maybe in a position to go to the High Court and raise the question as to our powers in the matter. If we are wrong in the view we take, we shall be beaten when the matter is referred to the High Court. The contention of New South Wales is that we cannot legally determine the site of the Federal Capital and the Federal territory until we have a grant from the State. If that argument is good, nothing we can do can have any effect. New South Wales will always have it in its power to defy the Commonwealth. We do not think it has that power, but we intend to afford the New South Wales Government an opportunity to submit that question to the High Court. As to the statement of the right honorable member for East Sydney, that New South Wales has been flouted because we did not go into Committee to consider the resolutions passed by the New South Wales Parliament, I take it that we are paying the highest compliment ' to New South Wales by going into Committee, not upon a futile proposal, but to consider a Bill under which effect can be given to the wishes of that State. It is perfectly within the power of this House, and the Senate, if the numbers are forthcoming, to alter our selection of the Capital Site. I do not think that the right honorable member can get the numbers. I think that we should stand loyally by the decision at which we arrived. </para>

                            <para>- I do not doubt a,t this stage that it would be established in Sydney. I will undertake to say that- the interjection of the honorable member for Herbert is correct, and that the Seat of Government would have been established in. Sydney if "the area within which the choice of the Capital could be made had been New South Wales, as it was by the Assembly's resolution. I have not the remotest doubt about that. The first Parliament would have met in Sydney, and if it is difficult to get the Seat of Government removed from Melbourne, it would have been far more difficult to get it removed from Sydney. The Conference of Premiers followed, and, in deference to the feeling of New South Wales, as the oldest and most populous State, an arrangement was made that she should be assured of the possession of the Capital. Out of consideration for Victoria, however, a clause was inserted in the Constitution, providing that it should not be within 100 miles of Sydney. I now propose to allude to one of the Attorney-General's misstatements. He declared that the resolution arrived at by the Premiers had not been brought before this Parliament until now. </para>

                            <para>- The Attorney-General distinctly said so. He said, in effect : " Why is this matter unearthed now ; why was it not raised when the selection of the Federal Capital was being considered by this Parliament?" Surely the honorable and learned gentleman must have spoken in ignorance, because I would not accuse him of indulging in absolute misrepresentation. I distinctly brought t01ward the resolution in question before the Dalgety site was selected.

                        <para>I have also noticed that in certain quarters attempts have been made to have the Federal Capital located as far away from Sydney as possible"; to place it on the borders of New South Wales, and If possible nearer to some other capital than the capital of that State. I think that such action is reasonably regarded by the people of New South Wales as unfair, and in support of that belief, I will quote some of the statements which were made when the matter was being discussed in New South Wales prior to the acceptance of the draft Constitution by the people of that STate. This is a statement as to the resolution which was passed by the Conference of Premiers in 1809 - </para>

                        <para>There is no doubt that an effort is now being made to do something which is quite opposed to the understanding then arrived at. The effort to which I refer has for its object the location of the capital not " at a reasonable "distance from Sydney," burst a place as far away from Sydney as is possible. It is being made one of the conditions of eligibility of a site that it shall be as distant from the capital of New South Wales as it can be. When the question was raised in New South Wales by those who opposed the acceptance of the draft Constitution by the people of that State, certain prominent men in Victoria -replied to the objections of the leaders of the movement against the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- I will not argue with the Attorney-General if he makes that statement. In my hearing the honorable and learned gentleman said that quite a different complexion could be put upon the words " reasonable distance from Sydney," and he promised to show that they meant "reasonably far from Sydney." I do not pretend that I have quoted his exact words, but I do claim that I have expressed their meaning. He said that, instead of the people of New South Wales being entitled to have the Seat of Government reasonably near to Sydney, the words " within a reasonable distance of Sydney," in addition to the 100 miles limit, were inserted1 to keep it distant from Sydney. </para>

                            <para>- Such an argument, if seriously put forward, would do more to disgust the people of New South Wales with the whole arrangement than would anything else. To urge that the agreement by the Premiers that, whilst the Federal Capital should not be within 100 miles of Sydney, provision should be made for its location within a reasonable distance of that city, meant that' it was not to be established near to the 100 miles limit,, but a great way beyond it, is absurd. Such an argument, if sound, would be considered as an indication that trickery had been resorted to at the Conference. </para>

                            <para>- f shall deal presently with that point. I am not defending the Parliament or the" Ministry of New South Wales ; I shall have reason to admit that they have not acted always in the best interests of that State. The Attorney-General actually quoted a speech made by the right honorable member for East Sydney, after the Conference of Premiers, with the object of showing that it afforded good ground for the argument that :he words " a reasonable distance from Sydney " do not convey the meaning which they clearly express. In this speech, the right honorable member for East Sydney said he had no doubt that the Federal Parliament would fix the Capital near the 100mile limit. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member endeavoured to show, by quoting; from a speech made by' the right honorable member for East Sydney, that it was the desire df the late Ministry to flout the Parliament of New South Wales. That speech certainly did not bear the construction which' the Attorney-General placed upon it. The honorable and learned gentleman failed entirely to remember what has been stated quite recently in this House, that, as Minister of Home Affairs in the late Government, I had absolutely announced to the press, on behalf of the Ministry, that the resolutions passed by the Parliament of New South' Wales were not to be flouted, but, on the contrary, were to be taken into consideration by this Legislature. This same point was raised in October last. I was absent at the time, but I telegraphed to the deputy leader of the Opposition that an announcement had been made by the late Ministry that the resolutions of the New South Wales Parliament were to be brought before this Parliament for consideration. I referred him to a paper which, among others, gave my statement in that connexion as the decision of the Ministry. On the roth June last, the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> as well as other newspapers, published a paragraph based on the information supplied by  myself  that - </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member is assuming an innocence which suits him better than it does the Attorney-General. The honorable and learned gentleman, with singular audacity, has quoted a speech by the right honorable member for East Sydney, in which he said that the resolution passed by the Parliament of New South Wales had not in the slightest degree altered the decision of this Parliament. That is perfectly correct. But the right honorable member added, as the Attorney-General himself admitted - and this is where the audacity comes in - that if a majority of the Parliament were prepared to alter that decision, that, of course, was a different matter. As Prime Minister, however, he did not ' propose to depart from an Act which Parliament itself had passed. Is not such a position entirely understandable? If it is not, is it possible to understand the position of some of the Attorney-General's colleagues? The Minister of Home Affairs supported the selection of another site, and yet he is now standing by the decision of the Parliament to select Dalgety. I am not blaming him for his present action. I think that he is acting legitimately. But why should exception be taken to members of the late Ministry adopting a similar attitude? Were we not the Executive of Parliament? Is a Ministry to say that it will enforce those portions of an Act of Parliament with which it agrees, and that it will not enforce those with which' it disagrees? That would be an. absurdity. I think that it redounds to the credit of the late Ministry that, although the right honorable member for East Sydney said that he would have preferred another selection, he would not allow his personal predilections to interfere with the instructions he had received from Parliament. That is the position which I took up. We would not allow our personal predilections to interfere with the carrying out of the decision of Parliament, and we both did our best to have the question settled upon the basis fixed by this Legislature. We used our best endeavours to that end just as if we agreed with every line of the Seat of Government Act. </para>

I do not accuse the honorable and learned gentleman of having intentionally misquoted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers'</inline> statement in any way, but the assertion that the right honorable member for East Sydney and I declared that the Act was mandatory on New South Wales is wrong.

                            <para>- That may be the view of the present Government, but the late Government did not go so far. W&lt; said that anything except the Capital being within seventeen miles of Dalgety was a question for negotiation. The Attorney-General also made a statement which is calculated to do a great deal of harm, and to breed . between the Commonwealth and one of the States that bad feeling which he professes a desire to see avoided. He said that the Commonwealth was going to get what it wanted in regard to Dalgety, and that New South Wales was not going to stop it. That is not the way to speak on occasions such as this. </para>

It is a small and paltry thing to allow little irritations to cloud great matters. If other men have said what they ought not to have said - as I admit they have ; if they have done what we cannot approve of - and such things have been done by some of the Governments of New South Wales, we should be larger minded than to take notice of the fact, and should do our best to put an end to the friction which has been caused by the harsh and hasty words which have been used by one side or the other. </para>

They were not wise words, especially in view of the fact that the Bill asks for 900 square miles of New South Wales territory, while the Constitution . says that the territory shall consist of not less than 100 square miles. That sort of threat cannot do anything to assist a settlement of the question. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable and learned gentleman cannot deny that he said that the Commonwealth was going to get that territory, and that New South Wales would not stop her. I am amused at his suggestion that it is a compliment to the New South Wales Parliament to have this Bill brought in, and to allow its resolutions to be discussed in this connexion.

                    <para class="block">Wales is interested by law in the settlement of the Federal Capital question, and has passed certain resolutions. Whether it was desirable to pass those resolutions is another question. But it is a strange thing to say that the ignoring of them, and the bringing in of a Bill which takes no account of them, is a compliment to that Parliament. Still I do not wish to raise any angry feeling in this matter. I have deprecated certain remarks of the Attorney - General as likely to create such feeling; and I wish to have the matter considered calmly and quietly, to discover if there is any good reason for the feeling which exists in New South Wales, and which has driven the Premier of the State from his first stand, and made him entirely opposed to the selection of Dalgety. We wish to ascertain if there is any reason for that feeling, and if so, what means there is of allaying it, and securing a settlement which will be just to both the State and the Commonwealth. As a private member, I am in a position different from that of Ministers, or that which I occupied when a Minister, and I have a perfect right, under the present circumstances, to consider whether we should stand by our first determination, viewing the matter with the desire to do justice to the State, and to select the best site obtainable in the interests of the Commonwealth. I admit that New South Wales Ministers have been to blame in some of. their proceedings. In one case a State Ministry, when asked by the Commonwealth Government to take the responsibility of suggesting a site, refused to do so, possibly because they were afraid of creating discord in the ranks of their supporters. Then I do not think that the New South Wales Parliament should have left Dalgety out of its list of suggested sites. It should rather have asked for a reconsideration of the position. This Parliament, too, has made mistakes. I do not wish' to go into those matters. This is not a question between Ministry and Ministry. What we have to remember is that dissatisfaction exists in one of the States for which there is some justification, and that is all we need consider. We need not pay regard to the fact that certain Ministers have said this or that. We may admit, if necessary, that some of them have been mistaken. Possibly the Reid- </para>
                    <para class="block">McLean Administration was mistaken in some of its acts, though I do not admit it as regards this question. That is not the issue now. What we have to consider is the best course to take to secure the selection of a site most suitable for the Commonwealth and satisfactory to the State of New South Wales. I admit that Dalgety has some recommendation, although I never voted for it as my own choice. </para>

                            <para>- I said nothing at those interviews which could be construed in the way that the Minister suggests. All that I said is contained in the correspondence on that head which can be referred to. The greatest recommendation that Dalgety possesses is the river which flows through it. I contend that, in the interests of Australia and of New South Wales - but more particularly in those of Australia - Dalgety is not the best site for the Federal Capital. It is away in a corner of New South Wales, and, more than that, is in a loop of the mountains. In order to reach some places40 or 50 miles distant, long detours have to be made. There is no railway at present connecting the site with Sydney, and it will be many years before there is a railway connecting it with Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">via</inline> Bairnsdale. That railway will have to pass through very rough country, and the speed of trains will always be slow. I wonder that honorable members from other States do not see that they will place themselves at a great disadvantage by making such a selection. </para>

                            <para>- So it must. I stated that owing to the rough nature of the railway which would connect it with Victoria, it must always remain a New South Wales town. Dalgety is not the best situation for the Federal Capital, because it is not easy of access from the various Capitals. The Departments will have to be located at the Federal Capital, and there will be constant inter communications between those Departments and the various States. The Capital should be placed in a portion easily accessible, and offering facilities for rapid transit. I have already pointed out that New South Wales has been led by the action of this Parliament to believe that only a site far distant from Sydney will have any chance of selection. This has created feeling. The people have lately been confirmed in their original impression that the Federal Parliament wishes to, fix the Capital Site as far as possible from Sydney, and are still more angered because it appears to wish to evade the explicit statement in the Premier's manifesto that the site should be within a reasonable distance of Sydney. I say that there are many other sites that would be better in the interests of the Commonwealth, and infinitely fairer to New South Wales. If one of these were chosen, it would do away with the present complaint, and certainly render it unnecessary for us to pass a measure that is designed, as the Attorney-General has said, so that the Federal Government may obtain from New South Wales the territory required, whether that State likes it or not. The exact words of the Attorney-General were that the Commonwealth was "going to get the territory," and that " New South Wales is not going to stop it.'" </para>

                            <para>- If there is any liability of selecting the wrong site, why should we not pause? Our final decision will commit the Commonwealth for all time to a particular site, and if there are doubts amongst honorable members - and I am sure there are amongst half the members of this House - as to the wisdom of our previous decision, why not consider before we go further? The remarks! made by myself and others in regard to the memorandum of the Premiers' Conference received very little attention when they were made. The House was then engaged in a scramble, groups of honorable members endeavouring to get votes for particular sites. Each individual member was endeavouring to get support for the site which he favoured, and efforts were being made, both within the Chamber and out side, to push the claims of certain localities. The consideration that should have been given to various arguments was not given, as is shown when it is denied that this resolution of the Premiers' Conference was brought forward at an earlier stage. There is no doubt that the resolution was quoted, but, as I have said, there was then a battle as of particular sites, and considerations which should have guided us in the choice were neglected. We are in a different position to-day, seeing that we have selected a site to which the State most concerned very strongly objects. The State has not objected altogether, because of the distance from Sydney, although there was reason to .do so, ih view of ,the revival of the memorandum of the Premiers. The objection of the State is, that nothing like the best site has been selected, and, if we find that a number of usually fair-minded people and strong Federalists are roused on this matter, and talk about secession - although I do not agree with that language - I think we ought to pause in order to inquire whether there is any reason. If there is merely a colour of injustice, I think we ought to take time for consideration. Of course, my suggestion may mean a little delay, which will, perhaps, not be altogether in the interests of New South Wales, bearing in view the desirability of having a Capital within the borders of the State at the earliest possible date. However, I urge that we should carefully reconsider the matter before we proceed further. The question may be deferred- until the following session. We are really considering this Bill with an invitation to the prorogation in our pockets. </para>

                            <para>- Well,, what does that mean ? It can only mean that the prorogation is so near, that if the printing of the invitations were delayed, it would be too late to print them. In national affairs of this kind, particularly when there is inflamed feeling on one side or the other, or on both, and more particularly when the feeling is between fellow citizens of the Commonwealth, it is desirable to allow time for calm consideration. Surely it is better to allow a little time to elapse until the friction and the memory of hard' words have passed away. We shall then be in a cooler and calmer atmosphere, with fuller knowledge of all the facts and circumstances. Such delay, as I have suggested, would be in the interests, not of one State, but of all the States, and, at all events, will tend to do justice to that State which more directly than any other is concerned in this question. </para>
