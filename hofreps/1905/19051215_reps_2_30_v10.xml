The Treasurer's advance is given to enable him to make advances to public officers, and to meet expenditure, particulars of which will afterwards be included in a Parliamentary appropriation. For some reason this appropriation was not asked for in respect to the expenditure from Treasurer's advance incurred during the year ended June, 1904. </para>

                        <para>- .£7,258. The Deakin Government was then in office, and it was succeeded by the Watson Government, and afterwards by the Reid Government. The expenditure from Treasurer's advance for the year 1904-5 amounted to ,£136,941. A Bill to appropriate that amount could not have been submitted much earlier than the present moment, but a Bill to provide for the amount expended in 1903-4 could have been presented last session. As the money has been spent, I think that it is well that we should pass these items. They have been allotted to the proper heads, the accounts are all in order, being legally covered by the appropriations made by this House. The only thing we can now do is to appropriate these moneys, of course at the same time criticising any amounts which may have been expended' out of the advance by the authority of the Treasurer. </para>

                    <para>- I have to thank the Minister for the way in which he has introduced this clause, but my feeling is that counsel should not be employed, except with the consent of both parties to the cause. It should not be competent for the man with the longest purse to obtain the permission of the Court to employ counsel, and to practically compel his opponent to do the same thing. Section 199 of the Act requires that the Court shall be guided by the substantial merits and good conscience of each case without regard to legal forms and technicalities, but I am sure that the honorable member for Riverina will agree with me that the spirit of that provision was broken on the very first occasion that the Court was appealed to. </para>

                        <para>- But does the honorable and learned member suggest that candidates have gone to the poll for the purpose of blackmailing another candidate? The abolition of the <inline font-style="italic">£25</inline> deposit which is at present required by the law would not have the effect of increasing the expenditure incurred by the Commonwealth. The machinery which has to be called into operation is exactly the same, irrespective of whether there are only two candidates engaged in a contest, or whether there are a hundred. In my judgment, the <inline font-style="italic">£2$</inline> deposit which the law now insists upon is tantamount to a wager with the returning officer that a candidate will poll sp many votes. </para>

                    (Melbourne).- -It may interest honorable members to know that the deposit required under the principal Act is a mere bagatelle compared with the expenditure- which candidates have to incur in Great Britain. There, if a man has ai walk -over, a Government .official has to bepaid

If there are two or three candidates for a particular division, they must be prepared to pay from ^500 to ^700 to provide conveniences which the Commonwealth provides free of cost. In my opinion, no&gt; candidate who, from conscientious motives, refuses to borrow from his friends, should be prevented from contesting an electorate. At the same time, it is necessary, to guard against frivolous opposition. Perhaps that object could be attained by declaring that 500 or 600 electors - whose names should not be disclosed to the public - shall be required, to indorse the nomination paper of any candidate.

                    <para>- Upon the last occasion that this question was discussed.. I supported the abolition of the deposit system, and I see no reason whatever to change the attitude which I then assumed. The honorable member for New England has declared that the existing law prevents unnecessary expense. How? All the expenses contingent upon an election have to be incurred irrespective of whether there is a contest or not. All the electoral machinery has to be called into operation. Consequently the deposit system does not diminish the cost to which the Commonwealth is subjected. The honorable member for Melbourne has urged that it would be wise to insist upon all candidates securing the indorsement of their nomination papers by 500 or 600 electors, as a guarantee against frivolous opposition. Need I remind him that candidates themselves are the best judges of when there is frivolous opposition, and in such circumstances they will limit their expenditure accordingly. I fail to see any virtue in the argument that the deposit system secures economy both to the Commonwealth and to the candidate. We all know that to-day elections are conducted upon what is known as the ticket system, and I fail to see that any good purpose is to be served by the continuance of the deposit. If the object be to keep down the number of candidates. I am certain that it is not achieved. The mere fact that he had to provide a deposit of <inline font-style="italic">£2$</inline> would not be a barrier to the nomination of the average man who thought he had any chance of being returned. </para>

                    <para>- I regret that I cannot see my way to support the amendment moved by the honorable member for Herbert. At one time, under the electoral law of New South Wales, it was , necessary to lodge £40 with a nomination paper, and, under that system, a defeated candidate rarely lost his deposit. After a time, the State Parliament, in its wisdom, decided to repeal the provision requiring a deposit to be lodged, and the result was that in almost every electorate a contest took place. Men who had not the slightest chance of being returned frequently offered themselves for election, and the country was thus put to much unnecessary expense. </para>

" <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. CHANTER.-</inline> I disagree with the honorable member. On one occasion, nominations were invited for the State electorate of which I was the representative, and it was generally believed that I was not to be opposed. But at the last moment a gentleman, nearly eighty years of age, who was somewhat deficient mentally, was nominated against me, with the result that the Crown was put to the expense of conducting an election, at which he polled seventeen out of a total of between 1,000 and 2,000 votes. In another case, a candidate's nomination was signed by seven electors', but he polled only five votes. </para>

Frivolous nominations followed upon the abolition of the deposit system, but as soon as the practice of requiring a deposit to be lodged with every nomination was reverted to, frivolous contests were avoided.

                    <para>- Unlike the honorable member for Riverina, I think the amendment should be accepted. It embodies a principle of which I have approved for some time; as the result of my experience as a member of the State Parliament of New South Wales. Originally, under the electoral law of that State, a deposit was not required; but, because it was said that a contest at a by-election was due to the influence of publicans, who felt that it would lead to the distribution of money, the Parliament decided to require a deposit of <inline font-style="italic">£40</inline> with each nomination. That provision inflicted a hardship, not only upon many would-be candidates, but upon their friends. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so; but abuses of the kind are not so numerous as to require the remedy embodied in the principal Act. If the purpose to be served is that of splitting votes, a deposit will always be found ; whilst I do not think that the deposit system deters those who wish a contest to take place, for the sake of the expenditure which it entails, from, putting up a candidate. It is true that the existing law may prevent nominations being lodged by political cranks of the class to whom the honorable member for Riverina has referred; but they are few and far between, and I hold that there is no justification for providing* a penalty <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> meet such cases. As the result of my experience as a member of the State Parliament, I am strongly opposed to the provision in the existing Act, and hope that the amendment will be carried. </para>

He must be aware that there are many publicans, who, although decent fellows, naturally wish to see a contest because of the expenditure of money that it involves, and are therefore prepared to put up opposition when a deposit is not required. </para>

                    <para>- I differ from those who think that the requirement that a deposit of <inline font-style="italic">£25</inline> shall accompany a nomination is not a barrier in the way of many aspirants to political honours. It was very inconvenient for me to find the money to make this deposit, although I had every chance of winning the seat, and I was prevented from using the money while fighting the election. Before resigning from the State Parliament to contest the Federal seat, I did not see how I could obtain the money necessary' to make a deposit of ^25, and to pay my expenses, but, fortunately, some of my constituents had some time previously opened a subscription list, with a view to making me a testimonial in appreciation of my services, and I went to the electorate to see if I could be allowed to use part of the money collected, to pay my deposit. If I "had been told that it was not their intention to collect money to enable me to leave the State Parliament, I could not have contested the Federal seat. We have no right to put any obstacle in the path of the aspirant to political honours. </para>

It is objected that, without a deposit, men of straw are frequently nominated, but it is not often that men allow themselves to be nominated unless they think that they have an opportunity to win a seat </para>

                    <para>. - I hope that the Committee will not accept the proposed new clause. The sum of ^25 is so small that it should not prevent any candidate likely to be chosen by a constituency from being nominated. VI do not think that any one possessing the political attainments likely to enable him to secure a seat in Parliament will find it impossible to obtain the money to make this deposit. It has to be remembered, however, that the expense of conducting a Commonwealth election is very much greater than the expense of conducting a State or municipal election, and nobody, except <inline font-style="italic">bond fide</inline> candidates, should be encouraged to go to the poll. Where no deposit is required, I have known men to allow themselves to be nominated merely for advertising purposes, having no hope of winning the seat. </para>

The fact that <inline font-style="italic">£25</inline> has to be "deposited has never debarred from nomination any man' who had a chance of winning a seat; but, even if it did, the inconvenience to an individual is nothing as compared with the expense caused to the Commonwealth when elections are made necessary bv the nomination of candidates who are not <inline font-style="italic">bond fide.</inline> Would the honorable member for Herbert agree to the proposal that the candidate who has thus- caused the time and' money of the country to be wasted should, if he failed to score one-tenth of the votes polled, be liable to imprisonment for from three to six months?Under the law, every candidate who polls 200 out of every 1,000 votes given has his money returned, and those who cannot estimate the feeling of the electors sufficiently well to know that they will be able to obtain that number of votes should not complain of being mulcted in this small sum. </para>

                    <para>. - The honorable member misunderstands the position. The deposit would be forfeited. This provision was .recommended by the Conference of Electoral Officers. At the present time any person may . nominate as a candidate up to the hour of 12 noon on the day of nomination, but once the nomination paper and the deposit are lodged - even though 'they may have been sent in weeks before the nomination day - they cannot be withdrawn. That opinion has been given by the Commonwealth officers. The honorable member for North Sydney proposes that before any expense has been incurred by the Commonwealth, a candidate shall be allowed to withdraw his nomination, but that he shall forfeit' his deposit. It is not desirable that we should afford opportunities to bogus candidates to levy blackmail. ; and, therefore, it is considered wise to provide for the forfeiture of the deposit. </para>

                        <para>- The prospect of being defeated. He would not have his deposit returned in any case unless he registered a certain proportion of votes. We should do all we can to prevent nominations on mere chance. ' The act of nomination should be regarded as a serious step. I can quite conceive, however, that after a man has, after due consideration, been nominated, the position may become so changed that he may not consider it worth while to go on. "Under such conditions, we propose to give him a chance to withdraw, but the deposit which safeguards the nomination must be forfeited. Take a scattered electorate like that of Coolgardie or Maranoa. A candidate for either of those divisions may desire to hold his first meetings in the populous centres, and subsequently to visit the remote portions of the electorate. Consequently, he may wish to lodge his nomination paper with the returning officer some weeks before the date of .nomination. Upon the whole, I think that the proposal of the honorable member for North Sydney is a fair one, and I am quite willing to assent to it. </para>

                    <para>- I need scarcely remind honorable members that under the Electoral Acts of some of the States a candidate is at liberty to withdraw his nomination up till a week after nomination day, and is entitled to have his deposit refunded. But under the Commonwealth Act when once a candidate has been nominated, he cannot withdraw from a contest. There is, however, nothing to prevent a bogus candidate from addressing meetings and canvassing an electorate right up till the last moment prior to the nomination. It seems to me that the proposal of the honorable member for North Sydney, if adopted, will not alter the present situation. I cannot see that very much good or very much harm will result from- its adoption. </para>

                    (Coolgardie).- The weakness of this clause is that a candidate who makes his deposit, and subsequently wishes to withdraw from a contest, has no inducement to do so, and consequently he puts the country to considerable expense. I think that we ought to offer a candidate some inducement 'to withdraw under such circumstances, but at the same time we should mulct him in a fine for his temerity in nominating when he knew that he had no chance of being elected. I would, therefore, suggest that after the word " and," line 15, the words "two-thirds of" be insorted

                    (Coolgardie).- I would point out to the honorable member for Boothby that if the words " not less than twenty-four hours" be omitted, it will be possible for a candidate, who may fear the result of a contest, to induce a dummy opponent to nominate so as to keep others out of the field. At the last moment the dummy could withdraw, and the other man would be elected. Under the clause, in its original form, if the withdrawal had to be made within twenty-four hours of the actual time of nomination, such a scheme could not be carried out, because the public would be aware of what was being done, and another candidate would be nominated. I do not wish to oppose the amendment, but it seems to me that the contingency mentioned has not been taken into account.

                    <para>- I think that the Committee ought to recollect that it is fundamentally necessary that the provisions of this Bill should be simple and unequivocal. There is no part of an Electoral Act over which more unpleasantness can occur than over doubtful phraseology with regard to the position of candidates. If any good could be derived from the amendment. I should heartily support it. But the Committee are evidently determined that although a candidate may retire, he shall not be refunded his .£25 deposit. That being the case, what inducement is there for him to subject himself to any trouble at all? If he knows that when once his money has been deposited he cannot secure its return, we may accept it as inevitable that he will not make his deposit until the last possible moment, when all doubt has been removed as to the wisdom of his entering the election. If, however, the deposit is to be returned, then, unless we can change some of the attributes of human ' nature giving us this guarantee, the introduction of this clause can do no good? </para>

                        <para>- In some cases a candidate must lodge his deposit some time before nomination day. When a man is seeking to be returned for a large electorate, and desires to have everything in order before he sets out upon his campaign, he often lodges his deposit some time before the day of nomination. Then, again, candidates for election to the Senate mav find it necessary to attend to that detail days before the last hour of nomination. Here is another case that is worthy of consideration. A party may nominate a candidate in the belief that a more desirable man cannot be induced to stand. Bull, if, at the last moment, the latter withdraws his objection, and the party desires to nominate him, the candidate first nominated cannot secure a withdrawal of his paper. The result of this system is that names are placed on the ballot-papers in a way that tend only to confuse the electors. Those who do not pay close attention to political matters cannot be expected to know that one of those on the ballot-paper is not really a candidate, and the outcome of the system is that votes are often wasted. Even the electoral officers have recognised its undesirableness, and an amendment has, therefore, been proposed to allow of withdrawal up to the last hour of the day of nomination. The clearer and simpler our ballot papers are the better.. It is- desirable that we should make it clear that up to the last moment prior to nomination there can be a Withdrawal, but, to meet certain dangers, I am perfectly willing to accept the proposal put forward by the honorable member for Coolgardie. </para>

                    <para>- Having given this proposal some consideration, I have arrived at the conclusion that it is wise to allow a candidate, who withdraws, to secure the repayment of the whole of his deposit money. It is useless to deny that when nomination involves some monetary consideration, a man is not likely to offer himself as a candidate for election unless he is fairly confident? that he will have a good run for his money. I recognise that the desire is to protect the Commonwealth from unnecessary expenditure, but although much has been said about bogus candidates. I do not think we are entitled to set ourselves up as judges in that regard. A man may have but a very small following, and yet be honestly convinced that he should offer his services to his country. If a candidate be permitted to withdraw his nomination, and his name does not appear upon the ballot-paper, why should not the whole of his deposit be returned? </para>

                        <para>- I take it that no honorable member would do such a thing,; if he did, he would be guilty of an act of bribery. I agree with the honorable and learned member for Parkes, that we should make the clause as clear as possible. A candidate who withdraws from, the field should either be returned the whole of his deposit money Or none at all. If a candidate becomes ill or arrives at the conclusion that he has made a mistake, why should he not be allowed to withdraw and to have his money returned ? During the debate a tendency has been shown on the part of many honorable members, to conserve the interests of a particular set of candidates. I think that the principle is a wrong one. Why should a man who is a popular candidate, and therefore likely to succeed, have any right to claim a special privilege or protection ? I strongly hold that if a candidate's nomination be withdrawn before the day of nomination, the whole of his deposit should be returned. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Four or five voting machines have already been submitted to the Department. They are all Australian inventions, and exceedingly ingenious, though I need not particularize their methods of working, because I think that honorable members have seen many of them. I confess that, to my mind, there are many difficulties in the way of using machines for the registration of votes. In the first place, they can be used only in large centres of population, because the Commonwealth could not afford to supply them to every outlying polling-place. This would have the effect of complicating our electoral arrangements by introducing different systems. Then, again, as has been recently shown in Victoria, machines can be manipulated, without the manipulation leaving any record by which the wrongdoer can be traced, or its being even discovered that any wrong has been done. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; but in that case detection of the offence is more probable. The Electoral Committee recommended that it was worth while investigating the working of voting machines. The evidence given to us on the subject was that they have been used satisfactorily in large centres in the United States, recording the votes polled accurately and expeditiously. But the Department is not yet in a position to confidently recommend the adoption of any machine here, even if the use of machines were sanctioned by Parliament. I fear tEa't the amendment is beyond the scope of the Bill, because the principal Act, which we are seeking to amend, provides for voting by means of ballot-papers, which is essentially different from the recording of votes by machines. </para>

                    <para>- I hope the Committee will not agree to the amendment. It will be time enough to provide for the use of voting machines when the Department is prepared to recommend some make of machine as satisfactory, and the Minister has admitted that the passing of resolutions to sanction the use of a machine - which is what is contemplated by the proposed new Clause- would be practically equivalent to the introduction and passing of an amending Bill. One course would be likely to provoke as much discussion as would the other. After the explanation made by the Minister, it would be unwise to proceed any further, and I think that we might defer the consideration of the matter until it has been established beyond all doubt that we should do better to adopt voting machines than adhere to our present system. </para>

                    <para>- I have had some doubts with regard to the admissibility of certain amendments, and I have given the matter some attention. Honorable members must recognise that the powers of the Committee are limited. We are bound by the instruction of the House, and by the scope of the measure submitted to us. But, putting those considerations on one side for the moment, I would point out that we have, during the last few days, adopted certain provisions which are directly at variance with that now submitted. Therefore, although I am averse to restricting the power of the Committee, I feel that it is not competent for it to insert the proposed new clause; it would have the effect of rendering nugatory much' of the work already done in connexion with the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and one honorable member stated that it would occupy him six months if he visited every part of his electorate. I recognise that under present circumstances it is not likely that honorable members will listen to this proposal, but I regard the matter as a very important one. We allow candidates for the Senate to spend ,£250 in a small State like Tasmania, whereas some of the electoral divisions which' are represented by honorable members in this House have six times the area of that State. </para>

                        <para>- Under my proposal the Chief Electoral Officer would take that circumstance into account, and would make a fair allowance. I do not think candidates should have to face the alternative of refraining from thoroughly canvassing their electorates, in order to keep their expenses within the prescribed limits, or largely exceeding the specified allowance. In large electorates where the centres of population are scattered, halls have to be hired at a great number of places, and posters have to be distributed and advertisements inserted in the newspapers announcing each meeting. The conditions, that have to be complied with in such cases are very different from those prevailing in city or suburban constituencies, where two or three thousand persons can be addressed at 'the one meeting. Some electorates are so large that it is, impossible for the candidate to reach all parts of them, and therefore many of the electors have to be communicated with by circular. Honorable members will agree with me that it is necessary that the views of the candidates should be made known to all the electors. I am not an advocate of large expenditure by candidates,, but I do not wish to place them under the necessity of leaving a number of the electors in ignorance as to their views, or of incurring expense in excess of the lawful sum, and which the unscrupulous will hide when the returns are sent in. </para>

                        <para>- If the candidates in Victoria were so ignorant of the provisions of the law as to endanger their seats if they were elected, I may tell the honorable member that the same indifference was not manifested by candidates in Western Australia. At the end of an election campaign all candidates are compelled to present to the Chief Electoral Officer a statement of the expenses which they have incurred. If irresponsible persons are to be allowed to publish advertisements on behalf of any candidate, who can vouch for the accuracy of that return ? The worst feature of the amendment is that under it any person might publish advertisements regarding a candidate without any authorization whatever. If it be adopted, there would be nothing to prevent any man from inserting in the Melbourne newspapers an advertisement intimating that the honorable member for Yarra would address the electors at Richmond to-morrow night, when, as a matter of fact, he intended to speak at Collingwood </para>

                    (Yarra).- I opposed this provision when it was inserted in the principal Act. The honorable member for Kalgoorlie has stated that the present law prevents any unauthorized person from advertising that I intended to address a meeting at Richmond, when, as a matter of fact, I intended to speak at Collingwood. May I point out to him that it does nothing of the kind. Any person can attach the name of my secretary to an advertisement, and secure its insertion in the newspapers. The man who receives the advertisement cannot identify the individual who hands it to him. The present law is a dead letter in Victoria. Only the other day I turned up the file of the
                    <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline>
                    for last December twelve months, when the last Federal elections took, place, and upon one day I counted twenty-two or twenty -three election advertisements, only three of which complied with the requirements of the law. Two out of these were my own, and the other had been inserted on behalf of
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Styles.</inline>
                    I regard the retention of the existing provision in "the principal Act as absurd. Unless the proposal of the honorable member for North Sydney be carried, Ave ought to insist upon every transgressor of the law being prosecuted. Personally I think that a copy of all electoral advertisements and all other advertising matter published om behalf of candidates should be sent to the Chief Electoral Officer, so that he might see whether they had infringed the law. That would form an additional safeguard in the matter of the limitation of expenses. In the interests of the big newspapers, it is not fair to compel candidates to attach to every advertisement which they insert the name of their secretary.

In that State all election advertisements are very carefully watched, and if a successful candidate infringed the law, prompt action would follow. In Adelaide the principal newspapers charge candidates <inline font-style="italic">£4</inline> per column for inserting their addresses to the electors. They allow them half a column gratis. </para>

                        <para>- So far as I am aware no such practice has obtained im any other part of the world. Under the old South Australian system it was by no means uncommon for a candidate to arrange with the proprietor of a newspaper to publish a page report of his speech without any indication to the public that it was an advertisement. TheSe reports often set forth that the candidate was enthusiastically received by an overflowing meeting, when, as a matter of fact, there were, perhaps, only a score of persons present, and in this way the public have been deceived. A labour candidate who could not afford to pay for a lengthy advertisement was thus severely handicapped. There also used to be an arrangement by which the daily newspapers gave every candidate for political honours a half-column report at the opening of the campaign-, but refrained from, publishing any further notice of his meetings unless it was paid for as an advertisement. Thus the candidate with means enjoyed a great advantage over his poorer opponent. I do not blame the newspaper proprietors for the adoption of this system, but the result of the law now in force in South Australia is that if a candidate makes special arrangements for the publication of the reports of his addresses those reports must be signed, and must be preceded by the word "Advertisement." Another point is that prior to the amendment of the South Australian electoral law a candidate could incur great expense in connexion with the publication of reports of his meetings without being called upon to account for it in his statement! of electoral expenses. These facts ought to satisfy honorable members of the necessity for the provision in the existing Act. Even at the present time it is by no means uncommon to see a four or five column report of an electioneering address in a South Australian newspaper; but, as the word ''advertisement " must appear at the head of such reports, the public are not misled. If candidates choose to pay for long reports of their speeches they may do so, as long as the public are not led to believe that they are ordinary newspaper reports. </para>

                    (Darling).' - I would point out to the honorable member for North Sydney "that there is a very strong reason why election advertisements and notices should be signed by the person authorizing them. There is nothing to prevent a man from inserting an advertisement in the name of his opponent calling a meeting for a certain date, and using against him his failure to attend that meeting. It is necessary that we should protect candidates against bogus advertisements and also electioneering squibs that are often sent out at the last moment. I have known a Victorian election to be turned by the issue, at the eleventh hour, of typewritten circulars bearing no signature, and reflecting on one of the candidates. The whole object of section 180 of the principal Act is to protect candidates from electioneering tricks.

                    <para>- I do not think that sufficient reasons have been given for the rejection of the proposed new clause. The honorable member for Hindmarsh appears to think that the section which it is designed to amend should remain as it stands, inasmuch as in some mysterious way it must assist to dispel an erroneous idea that seems to have grown up in the minds of many people in South' Australia that Labour candidates when on the hustings cannot state their views. At the last general election I did not comply with the provision of the Act, that at the foot of every electoral notice the name and address of the person authorizing it shall appear. My advertisements always contained the two words, "Crouch" and "Corio," and I considered that that was a sufficient indication of the name and address of the person authorizing them. I hope that the Committee will accept the proposed new clause. </para>

                    (Canobolas).- In my opinion, the general requirements of the Electoral Act in regard to the advertising of public meetings, and so forth, have proved valuable, so far as elections in New South Wales are concerned. I remember that once, when I was contesting
                    <inline font-style="italic">A</inline>
                    very hotly-fought election, a statement was circulated by special horsemen throughout the settled parts of my electorate, setting forth that I was a member of a single tax league in Sydney, which, in fact, did not exist, and that I had given a pledge to the league to support a direct land tax for Commonwealth purposes, which would bring in j£8, 000,000. That statement was published on a sheet which bore no imprint, and there was no means of tracing the author of it. It was issued to damage my chances, and looked authentic. Under the old law, such a statement could have been circulated as an advertisement, but the Commonwealth law would prevent that being done. I do not know that the signing of advertisements convening meetings is so necessary, because I do not think that many bogus meetings will be advertised but every newspaper proprietor should be required to see, as far as possible, that the advertisements accepted by him are authenticated, and the original copy should be sent to the Chief Electoral . Officer for examination. I suggest' that the amendment be made to read "other than an advertisement in a newspaper con.vening public or committee meetings only." We should stand by the principle of the original provision, and, if necessary, strengthen it. For that reason, I should like to see an amendment inserted requiring newspaper proprietors receiving electoral advertisements to see that they are properly authenticated, and copies of them made available to the Chief Electoral Officer, if necessary.

                    <para>- The provision in the South Australian law has worked well for a number of years, and has created no difficulty. It has been said that the South Australian newspapers have been unfair with regard to the space which they have given to the reports of candidates' meetings, but they are decidedly fairer than the Victorian newspapers, judging by what I have seen of the deliberate and wilful mutilation of speeches here. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. It was not until I came to Melbourne that I knew of this wilful cutting down of speeches delivered in election campaigns or in Parliament. During the Federal Convention campaign, the South Australian newspapers, however, took a course which caused a good deal of annoyance to politicians, by printing among the notes and news of the day what appeared to readers to be authentic reports of meetings, but were really concoctions of the paid secretaries of candidates. When', on one occasion, I complained of this to the leader of the staff of one of the newspapers, I was told that if I liked to do as the candidate to whose paragraphs I was referring was doing, and would pay 6s. an inch for such reports, I would be similarly treated. I believe that it was these practices which led to the present provision in the South Australian electoral law. I think that the name of the person authorizing the publication of any electoral circular, address, or manifesto should be printed, so that the people may know who is responsible for it. </para>

                    <para>- I think that we are at cross purposes in this matter, and that there is a deal of misapprehension as to what the effect of the amendment would be. It would not cure the evils of which the member for Hindmarsh complains, and I suggest that the Minister should make some radical amendment in paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of the section proposed to be amended. I cannot make out the meaning of the last phrase, " and on the face of the notice the name and address of the person authorizing the notice." The previous part of the section provides that the issue of an electoral notice without the name and address of the person authorizing the same shall be an illegal practice, and I cannot understand why the words I have quoted are added. There would be nothing to hinder a person from giving a false name. What we want to do is to provide that no notice relating to an electoral matter shall appear unless it is authorized by the candidate. Every newspaper proprietor, before inserting an advertisement, should be satisfied that it is authorized by the candidate. That could be done in a dozen ways. The Minister will not achieve his purpose by merely excepting newspaper advertisements. That would not cover the whole of the ground. The desire is to prevent the insertion of bogus advertisements, or the. issue of bogus pamphlets, and I think we should prescribe that any publication of an electoral advertisement, handbill, or pamphlet without the authority of the candidate should render the offender liable to a penalty. I do not move an amendment to that effect, because I feel that the Minister in charge of the Bill could best draft a provision of the kind. </para>

                        <para>- That would not overcome the difficulty, because a person might insert an advertisement calling a meeting, and at the same time enter into a long description of the qualifications of the candidate. I would urge the Committee to make the conditions as strict as possible, and not to permit the insertion of any notice unless it is authorized by the candidate or by his duly appointed agent. </para>

                    (Boothby). - I trust that the Minister will not accept the proposal either wholly or in part. We want to provide against bogus advertisements of whatever kind. We cannot prevent persons from signing false names upon election notices ; but, as a matter of fact, the newspapers take care not to accept such advertisements unless they are fully satisfied that they are properly authorized. I was the secretary of a political organization, when the Act first came into force, and as we had to run about fifty or sixty candidates, we had to be very care-' ful to see that every advertisement, circular, pamphlet, or poster, bore the name of the person authorizing it. No difficulty was experienced so far as that was concerned. I trust that everything in the shape of anonymous attacks or advertisements of a bogus character will be prohibited. The name of the person responsible for an advertisement should invariably appear. So far as the suggestion of the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne is concerned, I would point out that it would be difficult, in many cases, to obtain the direct authority of the candidate. Moreover, any elector. should be allowed to insert an advertisement, if he thought fit, so long as his name was attached. I would strongly advocate the extension of the provisions of the original Act, so that leading articles in the newspapers, which are very frequently advertisements for particular candidates, should have attached to them the name and address of the writer. If that course were adopted, the articles would, as a rule, have precious little influence. I hope that this provision in the Act, which has worked very well, will not be altered.

                    <para>- The South Australian Act has worked very well. I think that every man ought to attach his name to the advertisement inserted by him. The authority of the candidate should not be required, because any elector who may feel strongly in regard to a particular candidate, should be at liberty to insert an advertisement on his own account, so long as he attaches his name and address. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, but I do not see why we should prevent an elector from advertising the fact that he prefers a particular candidate. In England a law was passed a few years ago to prevent persons from defaming candidates upon the hustings. Under certain circumstances, that has abolished the right of pleading privilege in connexion with elections. </para>

                        <para>- No. The amendment has been suddenly sprung upon us, and I think it would be dangerous to agree without consideration to the omission of words which have been deliberately inserted in an Act of Parliament. I confess, however, that it is somewhat difficult to arrive at the meaning of these words. I ask the honorable and learned member not to press his amendment, and promise him that I shall look into the matter. 1 </para>

                    (Lang).- I trust that these words will be struck out since the Minister himself admits that they are inexplicable. The honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has shown that they are, practically a repetition of the preceding part of the provision, and that their retention is likely to lead to confusion. I, therefore, support the amendment.

                    THOMSON (North Sydney). - It is not my intention to proceed with my proposal to move the insertion in the Bill of a new clause providing that the seat of a member of either House, who directly or indirectly takes or agrees to take any fee or honorarium for doing work in connexion with the Parliament, or any Department of the Public Service, or for making representations to any Minister, Department, or officer of the Commonwealth, shall be declared vacant. Whilst I believe that it would be well to place such a provision on the statute-book, in order to let the public of Australia know that this Parliament sets its face against such practices, I recognise that it hardly comes within the scope of the present measure. I have consulted the Chairman, and find that he is of opinion that the clause is beyond the scope of the Bill, and that being so, I am reluctantly compelled to .refrain from moving its insertion. I think that the bulk of honorable members would favour the passing of such a provision, as indicating that we have set ourselves a certain standard, and that it is our desire that it shall be observed. It would certainly not cast a reflection on any honorable member, nor do I believe that such a reflection could be cast upon any member of the Parliament, but as, in the opinion of the Chairman, the proposed new clause is beyond the scope of this Bill, I shall have to await some other opportunity to embody it- in the electoral law of the Commonwealth.

                    that the proposed new clause which the honorable member for North Sydney has just withdrawn has been taken in preference to proposed new clause 48a and several others of which I have given notice, and which appear earlier in the list of amendments.

                <para class="block">During the proceedings before the Court of Disputed Returns, to which reference has already been made on several occasions, offences were alleged to have been committed by some of the candidates, and it was naturally thought that any breaches of the electoral law which had been proved before the Court would be punished by it by the infliction of the penalties provided for. But, to the surprise of even a great many of the members of the profession, the Court decided that it had no jurisdiction in such matters, and that some person, a candidate, or his agent, or any one else, would have to turn himself into a public prosecutor, and charge the offender before one of the minor Courts, with the possibility of appeals from Court to Court, until finally the High Court was reached again. Our Electoral Act was based on the </para>
                <para class="block">British Act, and on that of South Australia. The British Act provides for the appointment of a public prosecutor, whose duty it is to charge persons said to have committed offences. Undoubtedly Parliament, having said that certain things are wrong, and punishable, meant that they should be punished, and I now ask the Committee to provide that, when an offence has been discovered by the Court of Disputed Returns, it shall be reported to Parliament, and the Attorney -General shall then take steps to immediately prosecute the offender. </para>

                <para class="block">This proposal may seem somewhat strange to some honorable members ; but I understand that a similar provision has been in operation in Japan for some years. In that country, any man who is slandered by any newspaper has the right to demand that an explanation shall be published in the following issue of the newspaper, and in the same column as that in which the original statement appeared. Honorable members may say that the Courts are open to any one who may consider himself aggrieved, but I would point out that by the time that a newspaper can be proceeded against in the ordinary course the election is probably over, and all the injury is done. I know of one candidate who issued a writ against a newspaper after he had lost an election, and the newspaper paid the penalty and published an apology in its, columns next to those devoted to the European cables. The gentleman referred to devoted a portion of the sum recovered from the newspaper to defraying the cost of an advertisement in a prominent place in another newspaper. I am willing to support any proposal that will safeguard candidates against unjust treatment on the part of newspapers. I do not care one jot so far as I am concerned, because I have had to fight the newspapers all my life, and I shall continue to do so. If I go down, I shall not squeal. If a statement published by a newspaper is injurious, or libellous, or malign, a candidate should have the right to demand that his explanation shall be published in the following issue of the journal under the conditions I have described. If the proprietors of a newspaper will not comply with the requirements of the case, they, should be brought to book at once. </para>

                    (Darling Downs- Minister of Home Affairs). - I trust that the honorable member will not press his proposal. We have reached a very late stage in the consideration of this Bill, and honorable members have had no notice that this very important question would be raised. The honorable member may be justified in taking action to accomplish his object, but I do not think that it is altogether reasonable to expect us to insert the proposed new clause in an Electoral Bill - certainly not at this stage. The dealing with remarks published by the newspaper " with results injurious to any candidate " might be quite beyond the scope of an Electoral Act. I would point out that we are dealing merely with the machinery in connexion with the conduct of elections. The new clause which is to be proposed by the honorable member for Bourke will, to a very large extent, accomplish the purpose which the honorable member for Melbourne has in view.

                    (Coolgardie).- I am very much in sympathy with the honorable member for Melbourne, but I cannot support a proposal which is utterly impracticable. The honorable member will be well advised if he yields to the request of the Minister. It would be absurd to make a provision of the kind proposed without fixing upon some tribunal to determine whether the statements published were injurious. The candidate could not be a judge in his own cause. The editor of a newspaper would be as much entitled ti&gt; say that the statement was innocuous as the candidate would be to declare that it was injurious. Provision might, however, be made that a candidate who feels himself aggrieved by the action of a newspaper should have the privi-lege of applying to a Supreme Court or District Court Judge in Chambers. An application could be made upon twenty-four hours' notice - and if the Judge decided that the article was injurious to the candidate, he might order the offending newspaper to set apart certain space for the publication of a reply.

                        <para>- There would be no remedy in that case; but, as a rule, newspaper articles published under such circumstances have little effect, because the majority of electors make up their minds long before polling day. In city electorates, perhaps, opinions may change from day to day, but in country electorates such as that represented by the honorable member for Wilmot, the electors would probably take a long time to make up i their minds, and having once done so, would be very difficult to move. Articles | published on the morning of the election day do little harm to candidates, because the public recognise that it is unfair to attack a man when he is unable to make a reply. If it were thought desirable we might prevent candidates ot newspapers from discussing election matt'ers within twenty-four hours of ' the declaration of the poll. I understood the Minister to say that he wanted time to consider the matter. </para>

                        <para>- No. I "should read that as applying to me personally, and not as a candidate for Parliament. It would not relate to my political character or conduct. If the word "personal" were eliminated, I should say "Yes." The "personal conduct" of a candidate, I take it, is his conduct as a private individual, and not as a public man. Further, this proposal is confined to false statements, and I would point out that some of the most damaging statements which can be made in respect of persons are not necessarily false. They are frequently half-truths, which are much worse than absolute lies. </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. That is why I tHink that this proposal requires a good deal more consideration than the honorable member has bestowed upon it. I think a candidate should have a remedy in respect of any criticism based upon untruths, misrepresentation, or distortion which was injurious to him. But he should not have any remedy in respect of criticism which was based upon the truth or upon a fair statement of facts. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. I suppose that in many cases the upshot would be that the Judge would refuse to interfere. But if a candidate were given the right to which I have referred, no great harm would be done. The honorable member for North Sydney must admit that the Melbourne newspapers, for instance, are very unfair. </para>

I would point out that in New South Wales a number of the farmers are also graziers, and it is just as important to them that they should get the wool off the backs of their sheep at a certain period of the year as it is that they should gather in their ) crops at a certain season. To comply with their requirements, all the months from August in each year would require to be exempted. Moreover, if we, extend1 special consideration to one class, why should we not extend it to other sections of the community ?

                        <para>- In that case, Parliament might easily be dissolved a few weeks earlier. The greatest difficulty in the way of accepting the amendment has reference to the elections of the Senate. We must all recognise that in order to save the Commonwealth an expenditure of ,£50,000 the elections for the two Houses of the Legislature must be concurrent. If that difficulty could be overcome, there is no doubt that by adopting the proposal of the honorable member for Echuca we should be inconveniencing a very large section of the community without injuring; any other class. </para>

                    <para>- It seems to me that the amendment is somewhat impracticable under present circumstances. At tEe same time, I would urge upon the Government the wisdom of endeavouring to secure an amendment of the Constitution, with a view to deferring the elections of the Senate for two or three months, so that the elections in 1909 might be held in March or April. I would point out to the honorable member for Echuca that if his proposal were carried the general election would take place in October, and that whilst that would certainly be convenient from the point of view of those who would be engaged later on in harvesting, it would lead to the disfranchisement of a large number of shearers in New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>- It would certainly lead to the disfranchisement of a large number of people. The holding of a general election at any time between midwinter and the end of the year would not be convenient to all persons engaged in rural industries, and it would also be unsatisfactory from the point of view of the candidates. The first general election for the Federal Parliament was held, I think, on the 30th March, 1901, and if we could arrange for our ordinary general elections to take place about tha: time in the year, I believe that it would be found satisfactory to all classes of the community. About the fall of the year, shearers, farmers, fruit-growers, and, indeed, all persons engaged in rural industries., can usually spare the time to go to the polling booth. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. I do not know whether or not there is a serious constitutional difficulty in the way of the elections being held about the month of March, but it seems to me that, at any rate, the inference to be drawn from the Constitution is that the senatorial elections shall take place before the end of the year. If a proposal to amend the Constitution were submitted to the electors, with the recommendation that all parries could afford to give, I am satisfied that it would be carried without difficulty. I hope that the Government, during the recess, will consider my suggestion. </para>

                    <para>- I hope that the honorable member for Echuca will not press his amendment to a division. tit my opinion it would not be wise, in the first place, to insert such a provision in the Bill, whilst in the second it is reasonable to assume that if there be no constitutional difficulty in the way the Administration for the time being will take into consideration the desirableness of fixing a date that will best suit the convenience of the electors generally. No matter what, day be fixed for the holding of a general election, some one must be inconvenienced ; but it is highly undesirable that an election should take place during the shearing months or in December, inasmuch as it would be inconvenient for a large proportion of those engaged in rural industries. In view of our experience at the last general election, I think that if we decided that all future elections should be held a fortnight earlier in the year the convenience of all would be met. That might be arranged by executive act. If the suggestion made by the honorable member for Bland could be put into practice, I believe that it would be even more satisfactory ; but a glance at the records shows that there was very little difference between the votes polled in the farming districts at the first and second general elections. It cannot be denied, however,, that the last general election was held at the most inconvenient time of the year. </para>

It" we are in office when the time arrives to deal with this question, we shall consider, in the light of honorable members' experience, what is "the most suitable date on which' to hold the next general election, and' I undertake in the meantime to consider the very important suggestion made by the honorable member* for Bland. Even if the honorable member for Echuca could pass his amendment, I should still hold that it would not be wise to embody such a provision in the Bill.

                    (Boothby).- I think that this will be a convenient stage at which to discuss the question of whether claims should be witnessed. I invite honorable members to consider whether there is the slightest necessity for providing that an original claim to be placed on the roll should be witnessed. The advisability of requiring an application for a transfer from one polling place to another to be witnessed is apparent
                    <inline font-style="italic">j</inline>
                    but why should we enact that an ordinary claim for enrolment shall be wit.nessed, and that the witness shall be an elector? In some remote districts, where, perhaps, only half-a-dozen persons ate settled, not one of them would be able to get on the roll without travelling some distance to obtain the signature of an elector to his application form. It seems to me that such a system must tend to the disfranchisement of many people.

                    (Darling Downs - Minister of Home Affairs). - I think it only fair to point out to honorable members that in form O very important alterations have been made At the present time an elector is required, when voting, to place a cross at the end of the name of the candidate for whom he wishes his vote to be recorded j but we propose to alter the ballot-papers, so as to require the placing of this cross opposite and on the left side of the name of the candidate for whom the vote is to be recorded, because we think that that will lead to fewer informalities.
                </para>
                <para>
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. BATCHELOR</inline>
                    (Boothby).- I think that the proposed alteration is a mistake. The present arrangement has worked well in South Australia for nearly half a century, and it has also been a success in Western Australia, .where the percentage of informal votes recorded has been very small, and, having been adopted now in two Commonwealth elections, has become familiar to the voters throughout Australia. Most people are right-handed, and, in placing a cross before the name of a candidate printed on a ballot-paper, can hardly avoid, in using the short carpenter's pencils which are provided, covering up all the names with their hands, whereas, if the cross is placed on the right hand side of the paper, after any particular name, this is impossible. The honorable member for Riverina lost some votes through informalities caused by the clumsy ballot paper issued for the first election; but there were practically no informal votes cast on the second occasion, because I took care to have the ballot-paper properly revised.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Boothby,</inline>
                    the father of the Australian' ballot, who devoted a considerable part of his life to perfecting a system of balloting, has persistently assured the South Australian Department that fewer informalities occur when the voting-paper is marked on the right hand side, than take place when it is marked on the left hand side, and experience bear* out his statement. The specimen ballot-paper set forth in form 0 is faulty in several particulars. In the first place, it should provide for the placing of crosses on the right hand, and not on, the left hand side of the paper, and, in the second place, the squares opposite the candidates' names should not be separated by spaces of practically the same size, because that style of printing has caused electors to place their mark on the space between two squares, instead of in a square. In the third place, instead of printing trie Christian names and surnames of candidates in the one-sized type, the surnames should be printed in a larger and darker type than that used1 for -the Christian names.

                    (Darling).- I hope that the Committee will adopt the Government proposal. No difficulty is experienced when candidates have ordinary names, but some of them have Christian names which might easily be mistaken for surnames. Take my own name, for instance. Some persons might vote for me under the impression that they were voting for a person named Guthrie. The square on the left-hand side is closest to the surname of the candidate, and, therefore, is in the best position for the guidance of the elector.

I know that at the last election a number of informal votes were recorded, owing to the squares being on the right-hand side of the ballot-paper. The records of the High Court show that a number of votes were rejected, because the crosses were put, not in the squares, but in the space intervening between the end of the name and the squares.

The honorable member for Boothby is apparently wedded to the practice that has been followed in South Australia, but experience in other parts of the Commonwealth has shown that it is desirable to place the squares on the left-han'd side, close to the surnames of the candidates. I think that it would be advisable also to use a thick printer's rule for printing out the uneven spaces on the right-hand side of the paper. </para>

There is a good deal in the contention that confusion will arise if the squares are placed on the left hand side. It would be a. distinct improvement on the present system if the Christian names of candidates were made to precede their surnames, and the latter were brought out level, and as close as possible to the squares in which the voters had to mark their crosses. The surnames could be printed in heavy type to distinguish them from Christian names, so that the electors might not be misled by the resemblance of surnames to Christian names.

In the Electoral Act we adopted1 a specific form of ballot-paper to .which the electors in nearly all the States were unaccustomed. The proportion of informal votes at the last election could not be regarded as excessive, and, therefore, it may be assumed that the present system is satisfactory. Some of the States have followed the example of the Federal Parliament, in order to bring about uniformity, and if we adopt the Government proposal, we shall not only render it necessary to make a further explanation to the electors, but once more bring about want of uniformity. The present system has given universal satisfaction.

I would direct the attention of honorable members to the fact that at the Riverina election, which formed the subject of inquiry before the High Court, it was shown that the honorable member for Riverina lost no less than fifty votes at one polling place on account of the cross being placed in the space between the name of the candidate and the square, instead of in the square. If the squares had been placed on the left-hand side, next the surnames of the candidates, these mistakes would not have occurred.

                    (Yarra).- The percentage of informal votes recorded at the last Federal election was less than at previous elections, but of course that does not prove that a better method might not be adopted. I point out, however, that at the second Melbourne election there was a very much smaller percentage of informal votes recorded than at the first, and that was due to the fact that voters understood the method of voting much better at the second than they did at the first election. I acted as scrutineer for the honorable member for Melbourne at the Benevolent Asylum, where the greatest percentage of informal votes might have been expected. There were only four informal votes out of a total of about 400 recorded at the Asylum, and of the number who voted, not more than eighty or ninety had to be assisted by the returning officer in recording their votes. I point out also that the majority of candidates would not be placed at the same disadvantage as one of the gentlemen who stood for Melbourne at the last election, seeing that he had three long Christian names, all of which appeared on the ballot paper. I do not think it advisable to make the alteration proposed.

            <para class="block">I imagine that it is not the desire of honorable members, to place any hindrance in the way of electors being enrolled. The retention of these words will afford no possible protection. What particular advantage could it be to the community to require a person to witness a claim to get on the roll? It could not stop duplication of enrolment, but it could hinder a number of persons, from being enrolled. It is ridiculous enough to require this claim to be witnessed at all, but to require the witness to be an elector is really absurd. This provision, if carried, would tend to keep more names off the roll than could be collected from time to time by the policemen and postmasters. If the Minister could show that it would afford any protection to the public, I should be prepared to consider whether that advantage would outweigh the. disadvantage to which it would subject many persons. The witnessing of a claim has never been required in any other place in which this system of enrolment is in force. It cannot possibly prevent duplication, because if a person were determined to be enrolled twice, he could attain that object just as easily with the aid of a witness as otherwise. In any case, it would be of no advantage to a man to have his name on the roll twice. </para>

                    <para>- If , in the future, an elector were to witness a claim without making a proper inquiry, he would be liable to punishment. In Queensland the only persons who can attest a claim are justices of the peace. We wish to adopt the precautions which are taken in other parts of the world to prevent roll-stuffing. This provision is not intended to keep people off the rolls, and, in my opinion, it will not have that effect. In view of the fact that every adult in the community is an elector, what hardship can it impose upon any one? Unless the word "elector " were retained, great trouble would be caused, because it would then be possible for a roll-stuffer to get another man of that type to witness his claim. I do not think that the provision will have any of the evil effects which the honorable member for Boothby seems to fear. The returning officer or registrar is entitled to place names on the rolls in the absence of a claim, if he thinks that a person is entitled to the franchise. It is only right that there should be some safeguards in connexion with these wholesale collections of names. Under the circumstances, I ask the honorable member not to press his amendment. </para>

                    <para>- I support the amendment, because my experience is that the obligation to obtain a witness is an unnecessary obstacle in the way of securing the enrolment of electors. The Minister has not given any sufficient reason for objecting to the amendment. The case cited by him is exceptional, and affords no justification for penalizing electors throughout the Commonwealth. To provide that a claim must be witnessed by an elector means that the claimant must satisfy himself that the witness is an elector, and should it be found subsequently that the witness is not an elector, considerable trouble may be caused. The signature of the claimant ought to be sufficient. </para>

                <para class="block">This clause slipped through without an opportunity being afforded us to consider the desirability of the proposal to make the limit ten miles, instead of five, as provided in the principal Act. The amendment of the original Act seems to have been introduced because of fraudulent practices within the metropolitan areas, and, apparently, in the belief that these fraudulent practices would be prevented by extending the limit a few miles. Such a result is not very probable, but if the clause remains as drawn, much inconvenience will be caused in country places which are miles away from any polling booth - inconvenience which will more than outweigh any advantage to be gained by imposing the larger limit. It is quite easy to conceive the hardship which might be imposed on persons who, on the day of election, are occupied eight or nine miles distant from the polling booth. </para>

                    <para>- I have been asked by the honorable member for Hindmarsh to move an amendment. Just before an election takes place it is the practice for various organizations to make a canvass of the houses in the division for the purpose of ascertaining if the names of all those who are entitled to vote are upon the roll. The members of these bodies usually leave enrolment application forms with the householders, and after these forms have been filled in they collect them for the purpose of forwarding them to the Chief Electoral Officer. It has been found, however, that those employed in collecting these claims, instead of handing in the whole of them, destroy the applications of electors who are known to be political opponents. As a result, it frequently happens that an elector, upon visiting the polling booth for the purpose of recording his vote, finds that his name does not appear upon the roll. That is a very unfair way of cheating him out of his vote. Consequently I move - </para>

                <para class="block">I may tell honorable members that this sub-clause has been drafted for me by the Parliamentary Draftsman. It was suggested by the section contained in the English Act of 1895, under which a number of decisions have been given, and also by the Victorian Act of 1904 which contains similar provisions. In this proposal, however, I have followed the English Act more slavishly than the Victorian Statute, because it happened that the first case tried under the Victorian Act failed. That Act contains the words " false statement of fact," and the magistrate who determined the case declared that the words " of fact " had given him such trouble that he could) not decide in favour of the plaintiff. But on every count in connexion with the case he found for the plaintiff, and recommended him to appeal to the High Court. He was, however, a poor man, and did not care to proceed further. I have consulted! several of the legal members of this House,, who agree that these words will cover all the cases referred to by the honorable member for Coolgardieand the honorable member for Melbourne. The intention is to prevent any person from' making defamatory statement with respect to candidates for election. </para>

                    (Lang).- I trust that the clause will not be allowed to pass in its present form. I have special reason for taking up this attitude, since at the last general election statements of the most defamatory character were circulated in regard to me, and circulated, too, by well-meaning, but misguided, ladies in some cases, against whom one would be naturally loth to take legal proceedings, especially as the slanders had, in the first place, been manufactured by men who screened themselves behind the women in their dissemination. It was reported, for instance, that I was a most immoral, dissipated, and brutal individual, and that I had several children, whom I used to hang up in a wood-shed and flog almost to death. As a matter of fact, I have no young children.

During an election campaign, scandalous statements in regard to candidates are often circulated, and on hearing what has been said about me at such times, I have been inclined to think that I ought to be hanged. But I do not believe that we should trouble about these matters; I do not think it is necessary to provide against them in the Bill. If we are going to do so, however, let us take care that there shall be no escape for those who circulate these defamatory statements. I think that the proviso as to reasonable belief in the truth of the statements ought to be eliminated. </para>

                    <para>- I intend to oppose the proposed new clause, as I consider that it would be an undue interference with the liberty of the subject. A Member of Parliament or a candidate for parliamentary honours should be at liberty to give to any cause which he regards as worthy of his benevolence. If a man believes in a church, why should he not be allowed to subscribe to it ? If he be a devotee of the turf, why should he not be permitted to subscribe to the funds of a racing club? When a Member of Parliament is asked for a subscription, and does not feel disposed to grant it, it is open to him to refuse the request. I oppose this clause on principle, believing that a Member of Parliament should be at liberty to give to whatever association or institution he pleases. </para>

                    <para>- My attention has been drawn to the fact that portion of this clause is beyond the scope of the Bill, since it refers to the actions of Members of the Parliament. This Bill deals only with electoral questions, and it is, therefore, not competent to embody in it a matter which affects the actions of a member after he has been elected. I think that the clause will therefore need to be redrafted. </para>

I suggest that he should amend it in that direction, allowing candidates to give what gifts they like - provided that there is no corrupt intention - to churches, hospitals, and other charitable asylums, and for the relief of the sick and destitute.

                    (New England).- The Committee would have made itself ridiculous if it had agreed to the proposed new clause as originally moved by the honorable member, but I am opposed to that now before the Committee. The honorable member wishes to penalize men for being generous. These attempts to regulate human conduct by means of paper laws compel men to practise deception, and, instead of elevating human nature, do the reverse. Attempts to make men moral by Act of Parliament always fail. Let the man who cannot afford to make gifts have the courage to say to his electors, " I cannot give to this or that cause " ; but do not deprive a man who desires to be generous of the right to be so. I am in no better position financially than is the honorable member for Darwin who is always whining about the way in which he has to give to his electors, and asking that his salary be increased. I question whether he really gives very much. But why should a man be prevented by law from giving if he desires to do so?

No doubt it is thought that men of wealth will have an advantage over poor men by giving more liberally, but I have yet to learn that a man can buy his way into Parliament. All through this session we have been trying to put restraint on individual action, for which there is no justification. I have heard of candidates for this Parliament telling the electors that if they were returned they would put the mining laws right, so as to do away with "boodlers," and would amend the land laws, although they knew that this Parliament cannot pass such legislation. Is it not worse to make such statements to the electors than it would be to give to cricket clubs? It make one's blood boil when humbug of* this kind is proposed. </para>

I do not care, financially speaking, whether I am kicked' into or kicked out of Parliament. It is because I am financially independent that I can father these proposals. Members have come to me, and have cried like babies; about the £400 a year salary which they are receiving ; but they have not the pluck to announce themselves publicly in favour of" my proposal to raise the salary of Federal' members to £600 a year. I am not afraid to say that the present allowance is too little, and I do not wish to be in Parliament if my services are considered not worth£600 annually. The honorable member bellowed like a sick bull on the Rocky Mountains; but the proposal came from a member of the Opposition. Whenever they have anything to propose, which they think right, but which they are frightened to bring forward themselves. I shall be willing to father it, because I do not care if my electors kick me out when I am right. Even if they do, I shall still enjoy my two meals a day and my bed.

The clause merely provides that a candidate shall not attempt to bribe his prospective constituents ; it does not prevent him from giving11 to a church, or a charitable institution, or for the relief of the sick and destitute. They say that money talks, and it never talks louder than at election times.

A man frequently subscribes to a church in much the same way that he would contribute to the funds of a cricket club, not because he cares anything ab?"t "the institution, but merely for the idea pf winning votes. I do not think that a man should be excluded from contributing to charitable and other institutions during the whole of the time that he is sifting as a member of Parliament, but he should not be permitted to contribute even to the funds of a church during the two or three months that elapse from the time that he announces himself as a candidate until the election takes place. No man can devote his money to a better purpose than a hospital; but a candidate can advertise himself as well by contributing to such an institution as in almost any other way. I have no feeling against churches, because I am a member of a church myself, but if a candidate were rich, he could, by judiciously subscribing to the churches in the electorate, go a long way towards assisting himself into a place in Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- A man who has plenty of money can afford to comply with the demands that are made upon him, but others may be compelled to refuse, and may thus be placed at a disadvantage. I believe that every man should belong to some church or other, and contribute towards its maintenance, but I see no reason why he should also be called upon to subscribe to the funds of every other church in his electorate. A candidate may influence votes in his favour by subscribing to a church just as readily as bv contributing to the funds of a football club. Therefore I hope that the suggestion to the honorable member for Barrier will be adopted. </para>

                    (New England).- I have no objection to a candidate being debarred from subscribing to charitable and the other institutions referred to at election times. I have had to contest an election against a wealthy man who made liberal donations to various institutions, but I do not think that that helped him very much. I frequently receive a request for subscriptions, and am informed that my predecessor contributed so much - an amount which I could not attempt to give. I think that a man should be returned to Parliament on his merits, and I have taken up a firm stand all through the piece, so far as that is concerned. I do not think the proposal of the honorable member for Barrier is "of much practical value, but at the same time I have no objection to it.

I always understood that a candidate was debarred from contributing for the first time to charities, and I have acted under that belief. But at the same time, I do not think that a candidate who regularly contributes to charities should be debarred from following his usual practice even at election times. </para>

The difficulty might be overcome by postponing the contribution until after the election.

                    <para>-^ shall support the amendment, because I recognise that it will conduce to the purity of our public life. I have known poor candidates of small means to be handicapped in an election contest by the liberal contributions made by richer opponents to charities and other institutions. I remember one case in which a rich man, who was contesting an election in New South Wales,, made a number of exceptionally large donations just prior to an election. I do not mean to say that that, by reason of these contributions, he was successful, but he won the seat. Donations of the kind described very frequently influence weak people in favour of a candidate. In years gone by, seats have been practically bought by rich men who have made handsome bequests and gifts. I frankly confess that I cannot afford to make liberal donations to public institutions, and I have absolutely refused to comply with any of the requests that have reached me. I cannot afford1 to do so. The country does not expect it of me. It should be made plain that a man is not elected to Parliament in order that he may distribute his allowance amongst his constituents. His honorarium is intended to enable him to defray his expenses whilst he is serving the people. A man who subscribes to a hospital, so far from performing an act of charity, is discharging a plain duty. Moreover, I do&gt; not think that any great advantage is derived by candidates who devote their money to such purposes. But when they pander to the members of cricket clubs, race clubs, and similar institutions, they are guilty of a form of bribery. I do not think that contributions of this kind are necessary to establish a man in his position in Parliament. I was told by. old politicians in New South Wales that if I refused to follow the practice that had' been pursued in the past, my parliamentary, career would be a very short one; but I stated that if I had to choose between becoming impoverished, and holding my position, I should retire from public life. I put the question to the test, and I passed through the ordeal successfully. Wealthy candidates should not be placed in a position of undue advantage over their poorer opponents, and I shall therefore cordially support the amendment. </para>

                    (Lang).- Although it has been implied that I had some hand in the drafting of this provision, I can say that it bears no resemblance to any proposal that I have advocated. My idea was absolutely to prevent Members of Parliament making use of their positions as such to bribe electors by donations to institutions
                    <inline font-style="italic">to</inline>
                    which they would not subscribe as private individuals. This proposal does not touch that at all, and the previous proposal submitted dealt with that matter only to a limited extent. This will not overcome the abuses and evils that exist at the present time, and which tend to make the retention of some seats dependent not upon the merits or services of the member in a representative political capacity, but upon the length of his purse and its capacity to be drawn upon for various local purposes, private and otherwise. The difficulty is that it applies only to candidates, and while a candidate may mot give anything during his candidature, he may say to persons who make applications to him/ " Let this matter stand over until after I am elected." He might thus make an implied promise, at least, and -merely postpone carrying it out until after he is elected.

                        <para>- It is; and it is- one of the evils against which we should guard. The proposal now before the Committee does not guard against it, but, on the contrary, promotes it. A man may receive fifty notifications that he has been elected patron of this or that club, and very often, even when no request is made for it directly, the notification implies that a donation to the funds is expected. If we are going to legislate in this matter at all, what i's now proposed is farcical, and will absolutely fail to achieve the object desired. </para>

                        <para>- That is the experience of the majority of honorable members. It is a polite form of black-mail levied upon a man who happens to hold the position of a Member of Parliament. I do not see that the clause, as amended, referring only to candidates, would be very much better than the existing state of affairs. I think that such a provision is more necessary in the case of a Member of Parliament than in the case of a candidate. I do not object to an opponent of mine spending money in this way, because I do not believe that it influences many votes, but it is unfortunate, in the public interests, that a poor man getting into Parliament should be at the mercy of a large number of people, or run the risk of being dubbed mean and unwilling to contribute to any good cause. In my view, the provision should apply particularly to Members of Parliament. As you, sir, have ruled that the sub-clause embodying that proposition would be out of order, the balance of the clause, in my view, is not worth bothering about. </para>

                    (Darling Downs- Minister of Home/ Affairs). - The definition of a candidate in the principal Act, I find does not apply to this part of the Act, and it is therefore necessary to include in this clause the words contained in the definition of a candidate. I therefore ask the honorable member for Darwin to insert, after the word "who," the words "within three months before the day of election."

                        <para>- Of course, I was. not aware of that. Certain clauses have been recommitted, and it is my duty to. see that nothing is submitted to the Committee that is not in consonance with the direction of the House. That is the ground upon which I ruled that the amendment was out of order. But the Minister now tells me that clause 51, which is part, of the division of the Bill headed " Miscellaneous," was specially recommitted in order to allow certain new clauses to be moved, and that this is one of them. Under those circumstances it would not be right for me to rule the amendment out of order on the ground of irrelevancy. I shall,, therefore, allow the amendment to be moved. " ' </para>

                    <para>- If I understand the position rightly, the decision of the Chairman in the previous case was that it was not competent in an Electoral Bill to deal with the position of members of Parliament after they had been elected. But I submit that the amendment of the honorable member for Wide Bay does not in any way affect a man after he has been elected" to Parliament. We have already inserted' provisions in this Bill to prevent persons from doing certain things between the time when they become candidates and their election to Parliament. I contend that it is equally competent for the Committee to decide that a man shall not be libelled during the term of his candidature. If we pan defend a candidate against himself in respect of giving donations, we can defend' a candidate against the attack of others, , and provide a penalty in. the event of his being unfairly attacked. I submit, therefore, that the amendment should not be ruled out of order. </para>

                        <para>- With respect to the point of order raised by the honorable member for Bland, I must rule that there is a wide distinction between the present amendment and that upon which I previously gave a decision. The previous amendment affected only a member of Parliament. This amendment affects a candidate whether he is afterwards elected to Parliament or not. It relates to occurrences anterior to election. Therefore, I think it is well within the scope of the Bill. The only doubt that I expressed was whether the amendment was relevant to the clause recommitted. But as I am now assured that the clause was. recommitted for a special purpose, and as I am aware that it is the practice to recommit clauses for special purposes, I feel that it would be improper for me to rule the amendment out of order. </para>

                    (Darling Downs - Minister of Home Affairs). - Speaking to the merits of the amendment, I have to say that I find myself unable' to accept it. its object is to ' protect a candidate against unfair criticism. In the first place, I consider that it is an impracticable proposal. It provides that any person who feels aggrieved by any criticism may apply to the Court. It practically blocks all criticism of candidates for Parliament. I have already accepted an amendment under which false statements are punishable; but this amendment does more than restrain persons from making false statements. It is,, moreover, vague. We have tried to meet what is fair and reasonable, and I would ask the honorable member for Wide Bay not to press this amendment.

                    (Bland).- It does seem to me that some honorable members are attempting to carry the principle of the protection of candidates too far. For my own part, I have always felt that healthy criticism by newspapers did a. candidate for Parliament good. A piece of criticism may cause a man to make a len times better speech thant he would otherwise do.

                        <para>- But the 100,000 people are probably not influenced by the statements of the newspaper which they read. Newspaper attacks do  not always have much effect, or many of us would not be here now. Under this amendment, there would be the further difficulty of determining whether the grievance of a candidate was sufficiently serious to merit a reply, and whether the reply sent by him was of reasonable length. Suppose a newspaper comes out a day or two before an election with a wild attack upon a candidate, and that he proposes to' reply. He has first of all to go to the Court and obtain an in- junction, or some kind of order declaring that his grievance is sufficiently serious to demand redress. "After the order of the Court has been given, the editor of the newspaper may say that the pressure of his space for that particular day was so great that the unreasonable length of the' reply precluded its insertion. </para>

                    <para>- I did not altogether agree with the proposal of the honorable member for Melbourne when it was first moved ; and, at his request, I have given it another and less objectionable form. The Minister of Home Affairs raised the objection that it is vaguely worded, and said that any person might choose to feel himself aggrieved by moderate criticism. But he did not tell the Committee that the aggrieved person would have to convince a Judge or a magistrate that his grievance was a just one. Had he been quite frank he would have added that it was not the candidate's feelings which would determine the issue, but that the decision should be tested with the sober judgment ,of an independent arbitrator. I cannot understand the extreme censoriousness of the honorable member for Bland. He implied that the supporters of this amendment dislike criticism. I rather welcome criticism, because, in my opinion, it keeps public life healthy. The criticism with which this amendment deals is not exactly that based on lies, because it is only a clumsy writer who descends to falsehood concerning an opponent. This amendment is devised to meet suppression, distortion, or wilful misrepresentation. It is designed to protect candidates against newspapers which boil down speeches so as to conceal their full meaning, and then proceed from this foundation to raise their own superstructure. The honorable member for Bland remarked that the newspapers will publish any contribution which a man may send. But I know of one or two cases in which two leading newspapers in this city .refused to publish contributions in correction of their misstatements. In face,. that is rather the rule than the exception, for the newspapers publish only what suits their policy. The honorable member for Bland seemed to think that, under the amendment, it would be necessary for the aggrieved person to obtain a second order from the Judge before he could compel the offending newspaper to publish a correction. Possibly the clause does bear that interpretation, and, if it does, it can be easily amended; but that is no argument against 'the principle. I do not agree with the Minister of Home Affairs that the amendment is unworkable, but if it should be considered that an amendment' would make it more workable I feel sure that the honorable member for Melbourne will gladly accept any assistance in that direction. </para>

                    <para>- This amendment appears to me to have for its object the coddling of candidates for public life. Public men must not be hypersensitive, because if they are it? will be a great surprise to me if they are ever elected. It is going altogether too far to call upon a newspaper to publish a reply to its criticism. Take the two morning newspapers in Melbourne. When one newspaper has published a hostile criticism of a candidate, invariably the other newspaper will present the other side of the case. If newspapers overreach themselves they will fail to accomplish the object of their criticism, as they did here in the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Trenwith.</inline> He was most warmly assailed by all the (powerful organs, but, in spite of their criticisms, he was returned at the head of the poll by an enormous majority. Hostile criticism is . the best thing in the world for a candidate for public honours, or for a Member of Parliament. The trouble with most of the newspapers is that they do not know Gow to spell our names. Very often we wonder whether they have in their linotype machines any ot the characters which are required to represent our names. I really cannot understand any one asking the Committee to enact this coddling provision. When a public man has initiated an action for libel against a private individual, what has generally been the result! ? Time after time a jury has refused to award damages in a case of that kind. All this goes to show that jurymen consider that a public man is fair game for criticism. If, on the other hand, the criticism of a newspaper will not bear inspection, it will soon be dropped. If this amendment1 be carried, I shall expect to see a more hypersensitive member of the House proposing that no interjections shall be allowed to be made at a public meeting, and that henceforth candidates will have to. talk to " dead " audiences. I suppose that by-and-by it will be proposed that reports of public meetings shall only appear: in that most respectable organ, the <inline font-style="italic">War Cry.</inline> The honorable member for Coolgardie said that a newspaper appeals to an audience of 100,000 persons, but the average number of electors in a constituency is not more than 30,000. If his argument had any application at all, it could only apply to a Senate election, and, all the newspapers of a State fighting for or against a candidate it is not reasonable to believe that the proprietors and editors would combine in common criticism against him if it were not fairly justifiable. If I can pass through " yellow " journalism and get returned, surely every other honorable member can survive hostile criticism. </para>

                    (Indi - Attorney-General). - I wish to point out to the honorable member for Coolgardie that this amendment is really impracticable. Take the case of a candidate who was fighting his way through ?a huge constituency in the country, and who, a few days after its publication, received a copy of a metropolitan newspaper, containing certain statements, what would he have to do? He could not go near a Judge. He would have to bring before, a police magistrate, if one could be caught in a remote corner of the State, the publisher of the newspaper, and make him show cause why he should not print an explanation.

                        <para>- Does the honorable member expect the candidate to leave the constituency and go down to the metropolis and enter into the field of litigation for the purpose of getting an order, which might) be combated for a considerable time, perhaps until after the election was over. But, to put the matter on higher ground, newspapers have very high public functions to perform We cannot forget that when they are dealing with great public matters they Have just as important a duty to discharge as honorable members or candidates. The press has to advise and inform the public of what is going on. We have tonight, by means of another amendment, gone a long way in the direction of protecting candidates as to statements of fact by newspapers ; and in this we have followed English law. But if we say that no newspaper, however honest its criticism may be, is to perform a great public function, except under fear of being hailed before a Judge, or a magistrate, and compelled to publish some explanation, or so-called explanation, in the same columns under a penalty of .£25. I think it will be the public, and not the candidates, who will suffer. .To tell newspapers that they must not report public meetings at which some statements may be made reflecting on a candidate, would be to do a great in. justice to the people at large. </para>

                    (Gwydir).- I am inclined to the opinion that we may rest satisfied with what has already been done with a view to protecting candidates against unfair press criticism. Any newspaper, whether country or metropolitan, which deliberately makes false statements in regard to any candidate should be held answerable for its wrong-doing. My own opinion, however, is that the more . unreasonable the attack the better it is for the candidate. As a matter of fact, the representatives of the press, who occupy seats in the galleries of this House, publish columns of caricature and misrepresentation regarding honorable members. 'Praise, blame, and misrepresentation are used just as its suits the purposes of the press - with a view to curry favour, it may be, with certain honorable members, or with the public, or the newspaper proprietors. The honorable member for Dalley, who "has addressed us on this proposal, has had a bed of roses throughout his political career: He has ever been the " white-headed boy " of the metropolitan press, and I do not know that, under the circumstances, he may be taken as an authority on the question of what criticism should be regulated, and what criticism should be encouraged. Vigorous criticism is sometimes the lifeblood of a candidate for parliamentary honours. It has been my experience
                    <inline font-style="italic">to have</inline>
                    every newspaper in the district, not only criticising me, but refusing to report one word of my utterances. Indeed, the only way in which I could induce one newspaper, which was not quite so bitter as the rest, to publish one address which I delivered, was to purchase 500 copies at 2d. each. However, these antagonistic newspapers over-stepped the mark, and fortunately there was time enough for me to demonstrate to the public the unfair and un-'British conduct to which I was subjected. The result was that I was returned to this House. The same sort of conduct is pursued by the metropolitan press. I have known a metropolitan newspaper to reserve its criticism until the day before the election, when there was no chance for the candidate to reply, and then publish most libellous matter.

                        <para>- I do not think that any distinction can be made between newspapers. The honorable and learned member for Parkes is one of the fairest men in the House, and, as he always reads both sides of any question, and stands as an authority of what is the correct thing, I am afraid it would be impertinence on my part to indicate the newspaper. I am afraid the amendment is too cumbersome to attain the object of the mover; out the clause we have previously passed will give us some power over libel. </para>

                    (Wide Bay).- The honorable member for Melbourne has returned to the Chamber, and taken charge of the amendment; and I should now like to say that when I undertook to submit it, in order that it might be placed before the Committee, I intimated that I did not quite agree with the proposal it embodied. However, the fact that such a proposal is made is evidence that the press in some parts of Australia is grossly unfair. No honorable member, especially a fighting member like the representative of Melbourne, would submit such an amendment unless there had been some gross abuse of the privileges of the press. Weighing everything in the scales, however, I am of opinion that if we tried to protect ourselves by legislation, we should lose in the result. My experience is that the very best thing that can happen to a radical candidate is to have the whole of the conservative press against him. In Queensland we have always thought it a glorious privilege to

The wording of my amendment might not be such as to best attain the end in view ; but I point out to the Attorney-General that it would have placed a candidate in such a position that, if a newspaper wronged him, that newspaper would be compelled to publish his views in as prominent a place as was given to the attack. At present the only remedy is to send a letter to the editor, who may or may not publish it. If he does not throw it into the waste-paper basket, he inserts it in some obscure corner, unless the sender happens to be an important individual. Then, again, letters sent in this way are very often condensed to such an extent as to remove the true substance. Perhaps during the recess, the suggestion contained in the proposed amendment may receive consideration, with good results in the future. I ask leave to withdraw the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- I am pretty certain, however, that it will not be resorted to on the main lines between large towns, because the newspapers in those towns obtain the returns, and invariably exhibit them in some public place. My object is to enable residents in small centres who possess telegraphic facilities to have these returns transmitted to them for public information. The adoption of my proposal cannot involve" the Commonwealth in any great loss, inasmuch as it merely refers to the actual returns, and to the names of candidates, and the practice is to be allowed only upon the day of election, and until noon upon the day following. </para>

                    (Coolgardie).- I do not think that this amendment ought to be carried. There are very few country towns which do not possess a post-office, and where there is a post-office there is usually a telephone, so that the information which the honorable member for Bland desires to be transmitted to the people could easily be telephoned from town to town.

I think that the honorable member for Bland will find that the whole of the returns of a State will not be telegraphed to country towns upon polling-day, or even on the following day, before noon. The point mentioned by the honorable member for Parramatta was, I think, a good one. The proposal will undoubtedly result in congesting the wires upon polling-day, and will not benefit the revenue of the Postal Department. As that Department is now being carried on at a loss, I think that we ought to have a statement from the Postmaster-General in regard to the matter. </para>

In my judgment, every candidate is entitled to place his views before the electors whose suffrages he is seeking. At the present time, with the limitation which is imposed upon his expenses, it is absolutely impossible for him to come into contact with them. "The only .way in which he can make his ' views known is bv the adoption of some such means as I suggest.

The majority of candidates are poor men, and it seems to me that this proposal, if carried, will give an undue advantage to the wealthy combinations of Australia. At the first blush it seems to be an innocent proposition, but in the event of its being carried, I can well imagine the secret financial boodlieristic organizations of this country meeting, in dark corners or in great palaces to prepare documents for the annihilation of the Labour Party.

As a true protectionist, anxious to foster new industries, he ought to recognise that the passing of this clause would giVe a great impetus to the manufacture of waste-paper baskets for the homes of the unfortunate electors of Australia. We are told that packages of newspapers weighing 20 ozs. may be sent through the post for id. Not much labour is involved in the delivery of bulk parcels to one address; but surely it is not proposed to send bulk packages of electioneering circulars weighing 20 ozs. into every home. If this proposal be adopted, it will impose a heavy burden on the Postal Department, which might be called upon, for id., to deliver 400 or 500 packages of advertisements in as many different homes. I do not think that the Commonwealth, can afford that, and I shall therefore oppose the proposition.

                    (Fremantle). - I wish to say a word or two on the serious side of this question. I believe that the honorable member for Kooyong has the very best intentions in submitting this amendment, but I would point out that he is asking us to vote certain privileges that will be peculiar to ourselves. Honorable members know that "in connexion with the question of the taxation of Federal incomes there has been considerable unrest and criticism among the people. Surely we do not desire to add to their just cause of complaint by deliberately voting to ourselves privilege's which will not "be granted to the general public. It is not even proposed to extend the concession to -candidates for elections to the States Parliaments. Members of those Legislatures would have a perfect right to ask, " Why should' Federal members vote themselves privileges which are denied to us?" The same remark will apply to the position of candidates for election to municipal and district councils, as well as other public bodies. If the honorable member intends to be consistent, by proposing to extend this privilege to the general community, I shall be prepared to consider his proposition ; but if .we conferred these special privileges upon ourselves, we should subject ourselves to well-deserved criticism. I hope that the amendment will be rejected.

                    <para>- I do not think that the honorable member for Fremantle has dealt quite fairly with this proposed new clause. The matter does not concern me, since I so seldom change my views on any question that my constituents nave them in a stereotyped form; but I can quite understand that it is a matter of keen concern to some honorable members, who may change their views at every fresh election. I Have the greatest respect for the stability of the views of my honorable friend, the member for Kooyong ; but, as he represents a constituency which has a moving population, it becomes necessary for him, no doubt, from time to time, to let them know, by means of addresses, what his views are on current topics. There is a very serious side to this proposal, and I think that the honorable member for Fremantle has quite missed the point. The "honorable member for Kooyong does not -wish to give Members of Parliament an advantage over other people. He has pointed out that it is possible to send through the post 20 ozs. of newspapers in bulk for id. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; that is the point. One may take twenty newspapers to the post-office, weighing, an ounce each, and have them distributed over the country broadcast for id. The honorable member for Kooyong merely contends that, for educational purposes, the addresses of candidates for election to this Parliament are quite as valuable as newspapers, and should be distributed by the post-office at the same rates. I do not think that he is asking for a privilege; he merely desires that candidates shall be allowed to take advantage of the existing practice in regard to newspapers. Presumably, the ground upon which newspapers may be posted at such a cheap rate is that they contain at least a modicum of educational matter; and it is only fair to assume that the addresses of parliamentary candidates will do the same. I speak quite disinterestedly, because I am not likely to avail myself of the privilege, since my constituents do not need matter of this kind ! </para>

The Post and, Telegraph Rates Act provides that the postage of newspapers shall be id. for 20 ozs. aggregate weight, although each newspaper is in a separate wrapper. I do not look upon the proposal of the honorable member for"' Kooyong as anything very dreadful, but I would point out to the Committee that the object which he has in view could be achieved if he had his addresses printed in his local newspaper, and .then circulated.

                        <para>- There are several small newspapers in the Kooyong electorate, any one of which the honorable member could avail himself of for the publication of his addresses, and he could have copies of these newspapers posted at the rate of id. for 20 ozs. Still. I see no objection to the insertion of this provision in the Bill. It is a very fair one, and will operate as usefully for one party as for another. I db not share the rather pessimistic views of the honorable member for Darwin, and see nothing dangerous in the proposal. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member could address from an hotel balcony practically the whole of his electorate, and could go all over it in his motor car in a very short space of time; but it would take six months to visit all the small centres of population in my electorate. The honorable member for Darling, who represents a larger constituency, tells me that he has not yet seen half of his electors, and I question if I have seen half of mine. If the amendment be adopted it will facilitate the circulation of candidates' views through the electorates, and. I understand, the means proposed will be available to all candidates, and not only to retiring members. I think, too, that it should be extended to candidates for States Parliaments. </para>

                    (Melbourne). - If I understand that the privilege contemplated by the honorable member for Kooyong is to be conferred only upon candidates, I have no objection to it. I understand that 20 ozs. of newspapers can be sent through the post for one penny, and, although that seems to me to be a large weight of matter to forward at such a low rate, there is no reason why candidates should not derive some benefit from the regulation. I do&gt; not think that any political association should be able to make use of the name of a member, because the cost of sending circulars or manifestoes through the post would have to be included in such member's election expenses. The honorable and learned member for Parkes has made a playful allusion to an assumed change of opinion on the part of the honorable member for Kooyong. I have known the honorable member for many years, and I have found him to be a true friend and a good mate. I have no reason to quarrel with him except in regard to his political opinions. I should be pleased if he did change his views,, and bring himself more into line with those who are endeavouring, to lift up humanity. I shall support the proposal.

                    (Dalley). - I would warn honorable members of the probable consequences of adopting the proposed new clause. At the time of the Federal referendum, the leading newspapers in New South Wales forwarded copies of some of their special political issues to every elector in the State, and the mail services became so congested that the coaches were laden with mail matter to the exclusion of passengers.,, in some cases for many days. If every candidate is to be permitted to forward bulky parcels of manifestoes through the post under the conditions proposed, the mail services wilt not be able to meet the demands made upon them. It seems to me that there is a disposition on the part of honorable members to substitute the manifesto for the address from the platform, and I am astonished that members of a party who have for so long prided themselves upon their ability to appeal to the sympathies of the electors by addresses from the rostrum should now be found supporting the honorable member for Kooyong. Those who wish to issue manifestoes can do so at their own expense. I shall certainly not be any party to encouraging a practice which I feel sure will cause a breakdown in the postal service. The chances are that many honorable members of the Labour Party, instead of wooing the electors by means of addresses written by themselves will forward to them manifestoes drawn up by some skilful journalist in the pay of the party.

                    (Gwydir).- At present the poor man who happens to be a candidate for Parliament does not usually adopt the method of printing manifestoes and sending them to the electors ; but he may be encouraged by the facilities which it is proposed to offer to place himself upon an equality with a richer opponent, who makes liberal use of the printing press and' the post. If the mail services became blocked, as predicted by the honorable member for Dalley, the poor candidate would at least have the satisfaction of knowing that if his own manifesto could not reach the electors, his opponent would be at a similar disadvantage. Newspapers very frequently circulate special issues of their journals among the electors in any division in which they desire to give special support to a candidate. Under the proposal of the honorable member for Kooyong, the candidate against whose interests the newspapers are working will be able to counteract their influence to some extent by distributing countermanifestoes. I should like to hear what the Postmaster-General has to say as to the practicability of the proposal. I have some sympathy with the honorable gentleman when these demands are made upon his Department. The honorable member for Kooyong has not appreciated the responsibilities he is imposing upon the Postmaster-General, but I am prepared to vote for the amendment if the Minister is prepared to accept those responsibilities.

                    SMITH (Parkes).- I wish to guard against any suspicion that the remarks which I made in a spirit of persiflage, as a contribution to the humour which has permeated most of the discussions of to-day, were not made with reference to any particular member of the Committee. The honorable member for Kooyong is an old friend of thirty years' standing; and there is nothing I should regret more than to lead him to suppose that I made a joke at his expense. The honorable member's views are so much like my own that I might almost say they are identical with them. I am quite equal to more persiflage, if it is necessary ; but I wish now to treat the matter seriously, because I think that, possibly, the honorable member for Kooyong might consider that I was willing to make a joke and sacrifice my friend. I had no idea in making a joke to give it any point regarding the honorable member personally.

                    (Wentworth).- The Postmaster-General should seriously consider this proposition, because it will be possible under it for 500 of these manifestoes, if they are reasonably brief, to be sent through the post for one penny. In the circumstances, the matter is one which vitally affects the Post and Telegraph Department. The authorities of that Department will not know when they will be deluged with these manifestoes, and therefore, for some time before an election, they will require to employ a large number of temporary hands to be prepared to deal with them. It is extraordinary that the Minister in charge of the Department should be prepared to stand by without protest while another Minister accepts an amendment which will have a most serious effect upon his Department.

                    SMITH (Macquarie).I do not object to the suspension of the Standing Orders, but I desire to point out that a number of the concessions which have been granted under this Bill will involve serious inroads upon the revenue of the Post and Telegraph Department. I do not know the view of the Postmaster-General, but I can tell the House, that when this matter was discussed by the last Government, one of the points which I considered it to be my duty to bring before my colleagues was whether the revenue of the Department ought not to be increased by a contribution from the Electoral Branch of the Home Affairs Department. If the Post and Telegraph Department is made to bear more than its share of the electoral expenditure, it is evident that it will be a long time before we shall be able to afford to concede penny postage to the people of Australia. If the Postmaster-General will look through this Bill, he will find that a large number of concessions have "been granted, involving a considerable loss of revenue to his Department, not only in regard to the transmission of matter for parliamentary candidates, but also in respect of reductions in the cost of telegrams. These concessions must interfere seriously with the departmental business, as well as reduce the revenue. Has the Postmaster-General made a calculation as to their probable effect? It has been suggested that the whole of the administrative work under this measure should be undertaken by the Post and Telegraph Department. If that view is to be adopted, it will mean further serious burdens upon the Department. Many of us have at heart the desirableness of bringing about penny postage throughout Australia. We admit that at present the revenue cannot bear the strain. But every one of these concessions makes it more difficult to inaugurate that reform. What steps are to be taken to recompense the Department for the large amount of additional work that will be entailed upon it, and for the depletion of its revenue? These matters should receive the serious consideration of the Postmaster-General.

                    (New England).- I should like to learn from the Postmaster-General whether it is intended to make higher payments to the various mail contractors throughout the Commonwealth who will have to carry all the literature that will be transmitted under the provisions which have just been inserted in this Bill? Is it intended to sweat the contractors in the interests of candidates for Parliament? I think it is an outrage that this kind of thing should be done. If we, as members of this House, wish to increase our emoluments, let us increase them in a direct way, not by side winds, by means of which we think the public will not know what we are doing. We ought not to pass laws which mean increasing the burdens on the people in this fashion. For my own part, I think that what we have done will be of very little advantage to candidates, though it will seriously decrease the revenue. I regret to say that the Bill has been debated throughout with the idea of securing more advantages to ourselves rather than from the point of view of increasing the public advantage. Our object seems to have been not to. serve and help the public, but to assist those who stand as candidates for Parliament. I enter my strongest protest against what has been done.

I think that when the Government recognise how many propositions they have accepted, which cannot but have a result beneficial to Members of Parliament, whilst they are detrimental to the public interest, they will be anxious to show by their administration that they do not regard Members Of Parliament as in any way more deserving of consideration at the hands of the Commonwealth than ordinary citizens.

I do not wish to debate that question, but to suggest to the Government the propriety of following their action to its logical conclusion, however disastrous the consequences may be to the taxpayers. Are only candidates for seats in this Parliament to receive these extraordinary advantages? Should not all candidates at elections - municipal, State, and Commonwealth - get ,the same advantage under this Bill ? We are told that because honorable members' speeches and manifestoes are educational in their effect they are to get this exceptional treatment-. Are not all speeches delivered at municipal and State elections equally educational in their effect, and, if so, will not the Government carry out this project to its logical conclusion? Again, if the advertisements, of candidates for Federal honours are held to be educational in their effect, why should not the advertisements of any member of the community be also carried at the same extraordinarily cheap rates? I would suggest to the Government that if they do not wish to be held guilty by the people at large of feathering the nest of present or potential members of the House, they will be compelled to follow out their action to its logical conclusion, however extensive the consequences may be. </para>

I understood that any honorable member could move against the third reading of a Bill, and give his reasons for so doing. I desire to move an amendment which would not deal with the Bill itself, but which, if carried, might be accepted by the Ministry as an intimation of the views of a majority of honorable members. I understood that I should be perfectly in order in taking that course, and, perhaps, you will put me right if I am wrong in my impression. </para>

                            <para>- I desire that honorable members should have an opportunity of considering whether they have not made a mistake in agreeing to certain clauses of this Bill, and the only way in which I can give practical effect to that desire is by taking this course. At an earlier period of the sitting two honorable members who have had practical experience of the trial of election petitions by the High Court expressed their views on the subject. Although they were successful candidates, still they have expressed the strongest objection to election petitions being decided by that tribunal. My position is that of an unsuccessful petitioner. I propose to submit certain facts, and honorable members will then understand that not only successful, but unsuccessful, . candidates are equally opposed to. petitions being heard in the future by the High Court. Nineteen months ago a general election was held, and in my candidature for the Denison seat I was defeated by twenty-eight votes. Finding that, in a number of instances, bribery had been used, I decided to petition against the .return of the successful candidate. I lodged my deposit of ,£50, and filed a petition df ten clauses, seven of which dealt distinctly with bribery, the remainder simply asking for a recount of the votes. After a considerable time the Chief Justice appointed a certain day on which it was to be heard. A short time before that day my opponent, through his solicitors, applied to the Chief Justice, in Chambers, in Sydney, to have seven clauses struck out of the petition, and His Honour gave me seven days in which to show cause why that should not be done. As it takes some days for the mail to reach Hobart, the result was that, when my counsel had to show cause, he found that he could not get his objections lodged in time. As a matter of fact, the written objections which were posted immediately after we received the notice, reached Sydney twenty-four hours after the Judge had ordered the clauses to be struck out. We found that it was impossible to get bur objections there in time, and we had to have recourse to the telegraph wire ; but I need hardly point out that it is impossible for an advocate to be instructed as to His case as fully by wire as in writing. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith, who authorized the case to come before him in chambers, also heard the case. </para>

When the case was called, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lodge,</inline> my representative, rose to complain of the manner in which we had been treated, pointing out that sufficient time had not been afforded to prepare the case. To this <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith replied: "I do not know why those clauses were struck out; they ought not to have been." These were the words used by the very Judge who had himself ordered the clauses to be struck out. I can assure honorable members that every word I say is absolutely true. </para>

                            <para>- What could my counsel say, except that the clauses had been struck out against his will ? Then <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith added, as an afterthought, that our Sydney representative had consented to that course; and my counsel retorted that if that were so, our- representative had done so contrary to our express instructions, but that it could not be believed that he had so acted. Honorable members who paid some attention to the election petitions heard at that time may remember that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith said that he had no power to deal with cases of bribery. When our case was proceeding, he told my counsel and myself that, although he had no power to deal with a single case of bribery, if many cases of bribery occurred, and could be proved, he had power to deal with them, and would do so. What was my position? The Judge had struck out the seven clauses on which I relied to prove my case, and then he coolly turned round and said that he had no power to deal with bribery. When it was originally proposed that the High Court should be the tribunal to hear election petitions I supported the idea, and in this connexion I would like to remind honorable members of a certain provision in the original Electoral Act to the effect that any evidence, even if not strictly legal, which, was likely to lead to substantial justice being done, should be admitted. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith, being a man of legal mind, absolutely refused to allow us to take advantage of that section. Just before the luncheon hour arrived on one day during the trial, my counsel placed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Sei;gar in the witness-box, and proposed to examine him, but <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith would not allow that to be done. When the Court met after lunch, the Chief Justice decided that if we could connect Seagar,  who was the officer in charge of the Invalid Station, near Hobart, with the bribery, &amp;c, he might be examined. This, it must be remembered, was after the Judge had refused point blank to allow us to examine <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Seagar, although he was one of my most important witnesses in connexion with the case then being investigated. My counsel must take responsibility for the fact that, although my principal witness had been present in Court from 10 o'clock in the morning until the adjournment for lunch, he had disappeared when the Court resumed. Thereupon, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Griffith said : " I will give you an hour to find the witness, and if you can find him within that time, and can connect <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Seagar with the bribery, I shall allow you to cross-examine him.'" I have no hesitation in saying, that if the investigation had been conducted by a Committee of this House, an adjournment would have been granted for a reasonable time, in order to enable us to find the witness, and compel him to give evidence, under the section to which I have referred. Hobart is a town of some 36.000 inhabitants, and of fairly large area ; and, although we searched carefully, the witness could not be found within the hour which had been allowed. I ask honorable members to put themselves in my position, which may be theirs fourteen months hence. I am sure we all desire that substantial justice shall be done; and. if I can convince honorable members that justice was not done in my case, I think I may fairly ask them to reconsider the position. Then, we desired to investigate a large number of postal votes. The Chief Justice, however, declined to allow us to examine the flaps attached to them, to see whether the signatures corresponded, and therefore it was idle to proceed with the inspection. Judgment was entered against me, and I was saddled with costs. A little later, I left to attend to my parliamentary duties here, and immediately upon my arrival, feeling that I had been badly treated, I gave notice of a motion in favour of the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into all matters connected with the Denison petition. I did not for a moment entertain the idea that I could unseat the honorable member for Denison, but I desired to bring the subject before the Committee, so that Parliament might subsequently be afforded an opportunity to decide whether or not we ought to revert to the old system of referring all disputed elections to a parliamentary tribunal. I asked my barrister to forward the telegram and the letter of instructions to which I have referred, in order that I might be in a position to prove my case. He ignored my request. In the short space of three months I wrote to him upon six occasions, and personally saw him once. The only answer I got from him was that he was feeling unwell, arid intended to leave for a holiday. He promised that upon his, return he would attend to the matter, but he failed to do so. I was, therefore, compelled to renew my notice of motion in regard to a parliamentary inquiry from time to time. It remained upon the business-paper for the whole of that session, and was renewed again this session. The election petition was heard on 18th April, 1903, and from the next day till 7th October, 1905, I was not asked to pay a single penny of my opponent's expenses. But a short time ago, in view of the large amount of Government business upon the paper, the Prime Minister moved that private members' business be set on one side for the remainder of the session. Only three or four days after that notice of motion appeared, I received the following telegram: - </para>

                            <para>- The bill of costs was not rendered for a year [and eight months. It was then taxed, and within twenty-four hours I received notice that ,if it were not immediately paid proceedings 'would be taken for its recovery. I wish to show honorable members that there is something very suspicious in connexion with the case. I am actuated only by one feeling. I have been through the mill, and have suffered. Two other honorable members have also been through the mill, and, notwithstanding that they have been successful, they agree with me that is is undesirable that election petitions should in future be dealt with by the High 'Court as a Court of Disputed Returns. That is the point that I wish to strongly impress upon honorable members. The Ministry, and particularly the Minister of Home Affairs, have taken up an attitude towards me that Is scarcely fair. The Minister in charge of the Bill did everything in his power to prevent me, at an earlier stage in the proceedings, from dealing with this question. I shall not say' that his action was due to the fact that he is a lawyer, or was prompted by any desire to prevent a slur 'being past upon the High Court; but if honorable members desire substantial justice to be done them in connexion with any election dispute with which they may be concerned - if they desire to see the law, which is designed to secure purity of elections, carried out as it should be - they will decline to allow electoral petitions to be dealt with by the High Court. </para>

                            <para>- I can say honestly that I did not have fair play. The only three honorable members capable of expressing an opinion on this question are unanimously against the continuation of the present system. I have endeavoured, as well as I can, to lay the matter before the House, and have no desire to trespass further upon its indulgence. Only one election petition was dealt with by the Elections and Qualifications Committee appointed by the first Parliament, and I believe that that tribunal did substantial justice. I favour the appointment of an Elections and Qualifications Committee, and do not care how it may be constituted; my sole desire is to endeavour to benefit my fellow members. If I succeed in doing so, I shall feel that I have done something for the parliamentary institutions of Australia. I had proposed to move that the Bill be not read a third time until to-morrow, and to suggest that if the motion were agreed to, the Government should regard it as an intimation that the majority of the House were against the High Court being the Court of Disputed Returns. But as I understand that a satisfactory promise has been made in regard to this matter, I shall refrain from submitting such a motion. </para>

                <para>The first amendment merely varies the original amendment of the honorable member for North Sydney in a way of which I think he will approve. The next provides that questions may be put to immigrants within a year after they have entered the Commonwealth. The third is the insertion of a new clause, making misrepresentations to a contract immigrant an offence, while the last requires the Minister to lay on the table of both Houses of Parliament a return showing the number of immigrants who have been admitted, the places from which they have come, and the number refused admission. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to make a personal explanation. Earlier in the evening I inadvertently voted on a question in regard to which I had paired with the honorable member for Maranoa. I was in the Library when the division was called for, and the bells rung, and, on entering the Chamber, naturally seated myself on the same side as the Minister of Home Affairs, since I was supporting the Government. Before I discovered the fact that the question involved the recommittal of a clause affecting the Court of Disputed Returns, the tellers had been appointed, and, although I was reminded of my mistake by the honorable member for Riverina, it was then too late to leave the Chamber. I had previously said to the Government whip - " I think I am paired ; " but he had replied - "No, you are not," not knowing of the arrangement with the honorable member for Maranoa, which I had forgotten, and which, through our own fault, had not been recorded. I feel annoyed at having made this mistake, and desire to offer my apology to the honorable member for Maranoa for having broken the pair, which I regard as a serious thing to do. The division, too, was a very close one, and without my vote would have been a tie ; but I think that the honorable member for Canobolas will not object to mv saying that, although he voted for the recommittal, he did so not knowing that the clause proposed to be inserted in the Bill had been discussed earlier in the day. He voted on the recommittal to allow debate, but was himself opposed to its insertion. </para>
