                    <para>Ever since Ministers have assumed office, we have had from the Opposition a series of obstructing and stone-walling speeches. . . It is really amusing, when one remembers all the speeches which have lately been delivered, and which have been nothing less than stone-walling. There has been an endeavour to stop business, and to prevent the Government from getting any credit for the work it has brought forward. </para>

                    <para class="block">I think that this motion needs no. apology, in view of the evil effects which the use of opium has upon its devotees, and the danger which threatens the community from the development of the habit of opium smoking among the European population. I have some personal knowledge of these effects, because, in company with Senior-sergeant Jeffs, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. G.</inline> E. Ardill, of the Sydney Rescue Society - a gentleman who for many years has been closely identified with a movement for mitigating the evils attendant upon the use of this drug - I have visited the opium dens in the Chinese quarter in Sydney, and have there witnessed scenes of the most appalling, degrading, and repulsive character, reflecting, n6t only upon the municipal government, but upon the intelligence,ofour race for permitting them, I have also visited similar dens in Melbourne, and have seen the same occurrences there: I have brought with me a photograph of one of the dens in Little Bourke-street, Melbourne, which is self-explanatory, though it does not illustrate the worst phases of this vice, being a picture of one of the more reputable dens. I shall leave it on the table for the inspection of honorable members. I hoped to have been able to produce, this afternoon, a . series of photographs of some of the scenes which are enacted in the opium dens of Sydney; but they have not yet arrived, so that I am unable to do so: The majority of these dens are situated in the lowest quarters of the city. They are to be found chiefly in alley ways, and are ill-ventilated, so that the stench on entering them is abominable, and has a nauseating effect upon those who are unaccustomed to it. In my own case, a visitation of two hours to various houses in Sydney frequented by opium smokers resulted in a fit of nausea from which it took me some time to recover. In a small room, perhaps a little more than 10 feet square, the visitor will find a number of low tables or couches, supported upon trestles, and covered with matting. There is a pillow at the head of each couch, and a tray, and each couch accommodates two persons, In a room of the dimensions I have described, it is no uncommon thing to discover six or eight persons smoking opium. The doors and windows are kept closed, and the blinds are drawn, to exclude both light and air. When first the stranger enters such a room, everything is enveloped in a yellowish vapour resembling a London fog ; but. when the eye becomes accustomed to the gloom, the forms of Chinese, negroes, Portuguese, and men of other nat i oh ali ties, together with European girls, ranging from tender years to ripe old age, are discerned, recumbent on the couches, smoking opium, and in a condition of stupor. One case in Melbourne struck me as being particularly abhorrent, for on one opium couch, smoking from the one tray, was a shrivelled-up, decrepit-looking old Oriental, resembling nothing so much as a revivified Egyptian mummy, and a young European woman of scarcely twenty, very scantily clothed, who, I was informed, was married to a well-to-do business man, and was a frequent clandestine visitor to these dens. According to all the testimony that can be obtained from medical and police authorities, and from others who have had experience of the effects of this habit, its results upon the system are most injurious, and investigation of the reports of the authorities of China, India, and other countries where the drug is extensively used, shows that it is the universal verdict that opium smoking has a most destructive and demoralizing effect upon those who indulge in it, leading to physical decay and mental imbecility. Fortunately., in Australia the use of opium has not yet attained alarming proportions, but those proportions are sufficiently large to make it necessary for us to carefully guard against the spread of the habit. It would be very much easier to check this traffic now than it would be if we were to allow it to develop to a much more formidable extent. When we remember the number of petitions that have been presented to this House from persons residing in all parts of the Commonwealth, and we know that further petitions are being signed in opposition to the introduction of opium into the Commonwealth, except for medicinal purposes, we must realize that the people of Australia are awakening to the danger of the evil, and are anxious to see legislation of -a repressive character introduced. One of the most satisfactory features of the agitation against the opium traffic is that the Chinese residents of Australia 'are joining in the crusade. Chinese merchants, who have been in the habit of importing opium and making large sums of money out of the traffic in that article are at the head of the reform movement, and are anxious that the traffic shall be suppressed. Ministers of various denominations are also entering into the anti-opium crusade with whole-souled sympathy and devotion. Moreover, opium smokers themselves will welcome the proposed legislation, because they are such' slaves to the habit that they cannot resist their cravings whilst it is possible to obtain the drug. It may be urged that prohibition may lead to smuggling, but that consideration should not weigh with us. I understand that the Collector of Customs in Sydney reports that the authorities consider themselves quite capable of preventing the smuggling of opium to any great extent. They say that they make such a thorough search of all vessels coming into port that it is almost impossible for smuggling to be carried on to any great extent. Therefore, it seems to me that it devolves upon us, as an integral part of the Empire, to assist in trying, to get rid of this curse, for the existence of which throughout the world we, as Britishers, are chiefly responsible. It is not to the Chinese themselves that we owe the existence of the opium traffic, but to the British authorities who in earlier years insisted upon the drug being imported into China against the repeated protests of the Chinese authorities, because the Indian Government found that through the cultivation of the poppy in that country and the exportation of opium to China, manufactured from the poppy, they were able not only to secure very large returns in the form of revenue, but also to enable the cultivators to reap very large profits. It has always seemed to me that the history of this subject constitutes one of the greatest blots upon our national escutcheon. One's reflections cannot be pleasant when one considers how largely, responsible our race is for the degradation of the millions of people who have been perniciously affected by the use of opium. It is only just to the majority of the public of Great Britain to say that until recently they were not aware of the alarming effects of the use of opium, and the extent to which habitual indulgence in opium smoking prevails. By means of the dissemination of literature, however, chiefly through the agency of the Christian Union for the Severance of the Connexion of the British Empire with the Opium Traffic, the British people have been largely made aware of their full responsibility, and have displayed willingness to do what they can to remedy the evils which have arisen chiefly through the mistaken policy of their rulers in the past. In the beginning the British authorities forced this trade upon China, despite the repeated protests of the rulers of that country, and it may be interesting in this connexion to read something that has been said by the Chinese Imperial Commissioner, who issued a proclamation upon the subject some time before the first opium war. The proclamation, which was addressed to the foreign merchants in China, contains the following pertinent question and comment : - </para>

But there is a tribe of depraved and barbarous people, who, having manufactured opium for smoking, bring it hither for sale, and seduce and lead astray the simple folk, to the destruction of their persons and the draining of their resources. Formerly the smokers thereof were few, but of late the practice has spread and daily do its baneful effects more deeply pervade this rich, fruitful, and flour i shins; population. . , Hence those who deal in opium, or who inhale its fumes within this land, are all now to be subjected to severest punishment, and a perpetual interdict is to be placed on the practice so extensively prevailing. </para>

Though not making use of one's self, to venture on the manufacture and sale of it, and with it to seduce the simple folk of this land, is to seek one's own livelihood by the exposure of others to death. Such acts are bitterly abhorrent to the nature of man, are utterly opposed to the ways of heaven- . . .

                    <para class="block">Those are noble words, nobly inspired - written, not by a European, but by a representative of a nation which we have always been taught to regard as barbarous. I venture to say that if we compare the utterances of the Chinese Commissioner with some of the .deliverances which have been made from our own side, the greatest credit must be given to the representative of the Celestial Empire on the score of right and justice, as well as wise and lofty ideals of statesmanship and morality. The action of the British authorities in forcing the opium traffic on the Chinese led to a series of wars - three in all - upon which I do not care to dwell, because that aspect of the question is exceedingly painful for any one of British origin to contemplate. There was absolutely no justification whatever for those wars. An attempt was made to induce the Chinese Government to legalize the introduction of opium. But throughout all the negotiations with China a continuous protest was made by that country against its introduction, and it was only the force of British arms which ultimately compelled its acceptance. Upon the subject of the war, I do not think that it would be out of place for me to read what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone</inline> himself had to say.

                    <para class="block">That is very strong language, coming from reputable and responsible sources, but it expresses the opinions of some of the foremost leaders of public thought in Great Britain at that time. Yet, notwithstanding the strong condemnation of the traffic by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone</inline> himself, and by the leading newspapers which I have quoted, it was still persisted in, and has continued to grow until it has reached its present colossal proportions. Up till 1902 the revenue derived from the traffic between India and China was, I think, something like ,£256,000,000. I have not the exact figures before me, otherwise I should give them; but the amount was a very large one. So great was the trade in opium that in some instances traders actually made a fortune out of a single cargo. One case is cited in which the ship <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline><inline font-style="italic">Ryan,</inline> armed with sixteen guns, and carrying seventy men, made a net profit of £50,000 in one opium cruise. Seeing that such large profits were made out of this traffic with China, we can well understand that those who engaged in it did all that they possibly could to prevent interference with it. I mention these facts to show that we cannot blame the Chinese for having introduced the drug into our midst. We have to blame ourselves for forcing it upon a nation which was unwilling to accept it - a nation which clearly saw what a demoralizing influence it exercised upon its own citizens. In this connexion, I desire to read the opinion which Lord Ashley expressed in the Imperial Parliament upon the subject. Lord Ashley, afterwards the Earl of Shaftesbury, moved the following resolution in the House of Commons - </para>

In this connexion it should be remembered that when Li Hung Chang took the matter in hand he really advocated the cultivation of the poppy in China itself. When he found that he could not prevent the importation of the drug from India, he conceived the idea that it would be better to encourage the cultivation of the poppy in China for the purpose of cheapening the price of opium. </para>

                            <para>- I believe that tha't statement is true, but only to a limited extent. As a matter of fact, the poppy was cultivated in China about the period of 600 a.d., if my memory serves me accurately. But at that time the use of opium for smoking purposes was not known ; it was merely cultivated for medical preparations. It was not used for smoking purposes until a much later period. About 1730 a.d. it first began to be used for smoking, but only to a very limited extent. The effect of imposing a high tariff upon this drug was to cause it to be regarded as a greater luxury than ever, and to increase the desire of its devotees to obtain it. When once the opium habit has been acquired its victims will sacrifice almost anything to get the jj rug- They will even sell their own brothers, sisters, .and wives in order to obtain it. For this reason, Li Hung Chang thought that by cultivating the poppy for the manufacture of opium for smoking purposes, he would be able to lessen the imports of the drug, and to encourage the use of the locally-grown article by reason of the fact that the Chinese would be able to purchase it cheaper. His idea was' to discourage the importation of opium until, ultimately, he got rid of it, and then to employ internal means to suppress its use and even the growth of the poppy in China. As far as I am able to gather from a study of the subject, that was his aim in sanctioning the growth of poppies in China itself. I notice that a great agitation has been going on amongst the British people in- opposition to the opium trade, and, on 9th December last, an overflowing meeting was held in Exeter Hall, London, calling upon Christians, under a deep sense of duty, to unite in a determined effort to bring our national connexion with the opium traffic to an end. I have already referred to the self sacrificing efforts of the Chinese themselves in regard to this matter. In this connexion I wish to mention that a great' meeting was recently held in the Centennial Hall, Sydney, in which prominent Chinese merchants and other Chinese residents took a leading part. That meeting was most enthusiastic, and was absolutely at one with the conveners. As far as I have been able to discover, whenever attention has been called to the evil effects of the drug, no opposition has been offered to those who desire to get rid of the traffic. Some idea of the extent of the volume of that traffic in China may be gathered from the fact that during the reign of Queen Victoria 284,582 tons of opium were exported from India to that country. These figures represent an average export of more than half -a- ton for every hour of her late Majesty's reign. These are appalling figures, and represent a terrible state of affairs. Of course, I recognise that the question of revenue is a very serious one to consider in this connexion. But to me that consideration is as nothing compared with the degradation1 and the iniquity of a traffic of this character. I cannot conceive of the possibility of the question of maintaining a revenue from such an unquestionably Harmful source being defended upon any- grounds of morality, expediency, humanity, or necessity. I now wish to say a few words in regard to the report of the Royal Commission which was appointed to investigate the question of the opium trade, and from which I propose to give some brief quotations as to that trade in Burmah, India, the Straits Settlements, and China; I also desire to quote the opinions of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Roth</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Cockburn in connexion with the traffic in Australia. The consensus pf opinion of Burmese merchants is contained in the following sentence of one of the witnesses before the Commission : - </para>

In 1903-4,- the value of the imports of opium into New South Wales was ?16,180; Victoria, ,?9,438 ; Queensland, .?24,831; South Australia, ?6,196; Western Australia, .?4*994; and Tasmania, ?553, the total value of the importations for the year being ?62,192. In Coghlan's <inline font-style="italic">Summary of Customs Imports for 1 903,</inline> we find a return showing the various countries from which our supplies of opium came during that year. The return shows that 319 lbs. were imported from the United Kingdom ; 21,147 lbs. from Hong Kong; 514 lbs. from India; 8,120 lbs. from Straits Settlements; 10,516 lbs. from China; i,8ot lbs. from Macao; and 10 lbs. from Dutch New Guinea; making a total of 42,427 lbs. These figures show that the consumption of the drug in Australia at the present time is exceedingly large, especially having regard to the fact that only a very small proportion of it is used for medicinal purposes. </para>

I sincerely trust that the Government will not be deterred by any considerations as to revenue from making a serious attempt to grapple with this question, for nothing short of the prohibition of the importation of opium into the Commonwealth will be effective. If we could secure the hearty co-operation of the States in passing legislation dealing with those who sell and use the drug, and also with the houses devoted to the use of opium smokers, much would be done towards the abolition of the evil. </para>

                            <para>- It seems to me that to ask the States to take action in this direction, while we continued to allow the importation of opium into Australia, would be to call upon them to incur a responsibility which they would be unable to discharge. They may pass legislation of that character, but, so long as we allow the drug to be imported into the Commonwealth, its provisions will be evaded, just as the laws relating to the sale of liquor on Sundays are evaded. The question of loss of revenue may be put on one side altogether, because I do not think that it is the desire of this Parliament, or of the people of the Commonwealth, to obtain revenue from legalized vice. I feel sure that if the Government resolutely set themselves to secure the prohibition of the importation of opium, they will deserve, and will receive, the best thanks of the community. I trust, therefore, that legislation will be introduced at the earliest possible moment, and we can rely upon the good sense of the people of the States to back it up by any action which they may think it wise to take in effectually stamping out this soul and body destroying, State-encouraged vice. </para>

                        <para>- I sympathize with the views of the honorable member for Maranoa in this matter, and am of opinion that the Government will save time if they at once definitely state their policy on this question. In. view of the petitions that have been presented to the House, and of the fact that two-thirds of its members will vote for the prohibition of the importation of opium, the Government might as well at once de dare their policy in regard to the question. I shall not traverse the ground which has been gone over by the ' mover of the motion, because the stage has been passed when it was necessary to convince members of Parliament, or the country, of the undesirability of allowing opium to be imported. Honorable members have made up their minds on the subject, and nine out of every ten in the community are in favour of prohibition. Therefore. I hope that the Government will not ask for any postponement. </para>

But at the recent Hobart Conference, it was unanimously resolved by the representatives of the States - and the resolution was, to" a certain extent, concurred in by the representatives of the Commonwealth - that joint action should be taken. It was thought that the States should pass Acts restricting to chemists the sale of opium within their borders, and placing the drug in the list of poisons, which, under most, if not all, of the States Acts can be obtained only under medical certificate. The States were also to do what they " could in putting down opium dens and prohibiting opium-smoking, whilst the Commonwealth was to take steps to prevent the smuggling of opium, which, as honorable members know, can be compressed into small parcels of great value, and easily concealed. The late Minister of Home Affairs received a deputation on the subject, and expressed much the same views as most of us hold in regard to the. end to be sought. He made a number of inquiries as to the extent of opium-smoking throughout the Commonwealth, with the result that he was informed that, though it prevails to an alarming degree, and works untold mischief, so far as statistics show, it is increasing only in the north of Queensland, amongst the aboriginals, and in the northern parts of Western Australia. </para>

                            <para>- Statements made on the faith of police reports show the extent of opium-smoking by Europeans to have been ridiculously underestimated, but the reports of officers and the figures relating to importation indicate that the only notable increase of its use occurs in the places mentioned. In the animal report of the Chief Protector of Aboriginals, Queensland, for 1904, which has just been placed in my hands by the Minister of Home Affairs, it is stated that " the degree to which opium is supplied varies greatly in different districts." The inspector remarks that one district, which he names, has " an unenviable notoriety." In the Rockhampton area " the curse appears to have reached its climax." </para>

                    <para>Protector Fitzgerald expresses the opinion that the opium traffic at the different townships lately visited by him is worse than he expected, and that at Duaringa, Blackwater, Emerald, and Clermont it could not be worse. . . . Messrs. Cutten Brothers, of Clump Point, reported that they would probably be unable to get their coffee picked during the season, owing to the blacks with their gins being enticed away by the Chinese with opium. . . . Taking the northern districts of the State alone, as compared with last year's returns, it is a sad comment on affairs that judging from an increase of approximately 15 pc cent, in the number of prosecutions, the evil is not yet under control, in spite of the vigilance exercised by the police. </para>
                    <para class="block">The Chief Protector gives a list of 212 townships where permits for the sale of opium are in force - permits which he declares to be illegal, and against the issue of which he has annually protested. The evil is real, and must be coped with; but honorable members must realize that the hearty co-operation of the States is essential. It is. impossible to suppose that when the question is considered by the States Parliaments they will not agree to provide for the total suppression of the traffic. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Lang adjured the Government not to be greatly concerned about the loss of revenue that would follow the prohibition of importation. About ,£60,000 is obtained from the duties on opium, only one-fourth of which is retained by the Commonwealth, though the remaining three-fourths - .£35,000 - would be a considerable loss to the States. But when what the traffic costs for its regulation is considered, and what the community loses in those who yield to the fatal fascination of the drug, from which recovery is rare, and when vaunted, as in the case of the famous De Quincey, generally doubtful, I do not think that the loss of revenue will be regarded. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, happily so. As this is a revenue matter, the State's are entitled to be consulted, and in the second place, we shall require their co-operation in order to make any prohibition) effective, to put a stop to the cultivation of the poppy plant, and to suppress the practice of opium-smoking where it exists. We may possess incidental powers to suppress opium smoking through the instrumentality of the Customs Department, but the States have at their hands more ready means in the police of dealing with the evil. I think that if we can join hands with the States and work in harmony with them in carrying out a reform which the moral sense of the community demands, we shall be able to act effectively. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly, without a moment's hesitation. I had intended to move the adjournment of the debate so that I might have an opportunity to speak again after replies had been received from the various States, but some other Minister will be able to inform the House of the result at a later stage. I have plenty of evidence here to convince members of the necessity of taking action in this matter. I do not pretend that this is the only abuse for which action is demanded. The Premier of New South Wales at the Hobart Conference produced evidence from his medical officer, who stated that opium-smoking was not distinct from the inordinate use of stimulants. That, however, is not the question at issue. The question is whether we are not called upon to prohibit the drug, even though our action may involve a loss of revenue. </para>

                                <para>- May I remind honorable members, who urge that because the revenue would be affected, some consideration should be given to the wishes of the States in this matter, that the States Governments do not consider us in connexion with movements for the reduction of the drink traffic. I believe that on this very day the New South Wales Parliament is discussing the question of local option, which means, if anything, a movement in the direction of the limitation of the drink traffic, and consequently a serious diminution of the revenue derived from it. I do not suppose that the New South Wales Government have consulted the Prime Minister as to how this movement would affect the revenue, and I think that, apart from the States altogether, this is a matter which we might very well take into our own hands. There would not be any cavil on the part of any of the States, even of Queensland, where the revenue would be most seriously affected. This is essentially a moral question. The opium traffic is a beggaring and a degrading one, and' the sooner we put an end to its existence the better it will be for Australia. There seems to be only one way of dealing wilhthis question. The traffic does not appear to be susceptible of regulation. Every one knows that it is difficult to regulate the vicious appetites of the people, particularly when they take this brutalizing and degrading form, and, therefore, I think We should consult the wishes of the people of Australia as a whole, if at the earliest possible moment we did our best to strike a blow at the traffic. The victims of the opium-smoking habit are practically incapable of earning any money or contributing to the revenue in any way, and if we could restore such persons to their own right mindedness and make them decent, respectable citizens, we should convert them into&gt; wage-earners and revenue producers. We should not hesitate, therefore, to put a stop to the traffic, which can only become more degrading the longer it is continued. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think there is any necessity to enlarge upon the evils of the opium habit. We are all of opinion that it is an evil which requires to be put down.. I can hardly understand how any man can stand behind the bar of a public-house and sell liquor with a knowledge of the evil effects of the liquor traffic, and in the same way it is difficult to conceive how the Government can allow the opium traffic to continue for the sake of the revenue derived from it I think the Prime Minister has taken a somewhat pusillanimous and timorous view of the matter, and that he should be prepared to at once take action. The honorable gentleman seems to think that unless the States pass laws to prevent the cultivation of the poppy plant we can do nothing. I see no reason, however, why that step should be taken. The plant may be grown for ornamental purposes in our gardens, and we may feel satisfied that no one will take the trouble to cultivate it for commercial purposes unless they can find a market for their product. We should prohibit not only the importation of the drug into the Commonwealth, but also its manufacture in our midst. If we prohibit its manufacture, no one will have the slightest inducement to cultivate the poppy plant. </para>

                                <para>- No; I would still permit opium to be introduced for medicinal purposes, but the sale of such opium should be under Government supervision. By this means we might prevent the use of the drug for smoking purposes. New New Zealand has- already passed a law which deals very thoroughly with the evil. Their Act prohibits the importation of opium <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> any form' suitable for smoking - nothing is said regarding medicinal opium. Provision was made in the first Act for a penalty of£100, but that was found to be insufficient, and it was subsequently increased by an amending Act to <inline font-style="italic">£500.</inline> Those who import opium, which may be converted into opium for smoking purposes, are required to obtain a permit. This provision is necessary because medicinal opium can be converted into opium fit for smoking. </para>

I would suggest to the Prime Minister that he now has an opportunity presented to him to write his name in letters of gold in the annals of his country. If he shows that he is a man of the same type as the Premier of New Zealand he will have the approval of the whole of the people of the Commonwealth, and confer an inestimable benefit on his country. </para>

                            <para>- It appears to me that the argument upon this question has proceeded 01: altogether wrong lines. We are assuming that all we have to do is to pass an Act of Parliament when, hey, presto, all sin and misery will disappear from the world. Honorable members, in spite of their experience as to the futility of laws for putting down the evil habits of the people, are, nevertheless, ready to pass an Act for the prohibition of the opium traffic in the full belief that the evil will at once disappear. I venture to say that if we legislate on the lines proposed, the evil, so far from disappearing, will become ten times worse than ever. Four years ago, I pointed out that by imposing an excessive duty on opium we should probably encourage smuggling, and promote the illicit use of the drug. </para>

                                <para>- If it were proposed to imprison opium smokers for long terms the case would be different. The idea underlying all this proposed legislation is that ft will put an end to the evil which it is designed to cure. I quite recognise the evils caused by the excessive use of any drug. We are asked by the honorable member for Lang to prohibit the importation of opium for other than medicinal purposes. What I desire to point out is that, although I agree with the object which he has in view, it is impossible to attain it by that means. We could exercise only an apparent limitation, and if we were to judge by the Customs returns, after we had imposed such a restriction, we should be under the impression' that not a single ounce of " smoking " opium was being introduced. </para>

The honorable member for Parramatta spoke as if it were only necessary for us to pass a Commonwealth statute, in order to accomplish the whole object of the motion. In my opinion, when we had done that, we should not even have commenced to accomplish our object. The honorable member for Hunter, I think, will bear me out when I say that probably the most valuable medicine known is opium, in one form or another. I believe that even the various soothing syrups contain a proportion of that drug. The honorable member for Lang does not propose to restrict its importation as a medicine, and, consequently, it could be used in the form of morphia. I venture to say that there are far more evil results from the excessive use of opium as a medicine than flow from its use in any other form.

                                <para>- That statement is not correct, and it is a slander upon the men who heard that evidence, and who endeavoured to come to an impartial decision upon it. The honorable member for Lang does not relish the finding of the Commission, because it declared that greater evils resulted from the excessive use of alcohol in European countries than attended the excessive use of opium in Eastern countries. </para>

                                <para>- Some persons affirm that the prohibition of the sale of intoxicants in portions of New Zealand has exercised a salutary influence upon intemperance in that country. If, , however, we examine the Customs receipts, we shall find that a larger revenue is being derived from whisky at the present time than was obtained from that source prior to the enactment of the prohibition, laws. When we begin to talk wildly about all that we can accomplish by legislation, I claim that we are deceiving both ourselves and the public. This Parliament alone could not legislate effectually in regard to this matter. The Prime Minister himself has made that admission, and I am bound to say that I agree with him. It is in strict accordance with fact, and, therefore, I cannot differ from him, even for the purposes of opposition. The moment the States commence to deal with the question we may be able to assist them in regulating the opium traffic. If, however, we suddenly prohibit the importation of opium for smoking purposes, we shall, I am sure, have the evil complained of perpetuated in other forms. The honorable member for Hunter, the honorable member for Laanecoorie, the honorable member for Corangamite, and the honorable member for Brisbane will surely confirm my statement that it is possible to take opium in a dozen forms, either as morphia, morphine, or chlorodyne. If we legislate in the direction proposed we shall induce the excessive use of the drug in those forms, making it more difficult for us to deal with the evil. &gt; </para>

                                <para>- If we suddenly pro'hibit the importation of opium we shall not prevent its entry into the Commonwealth. Let me give a case to illustrate my point. Some time ago, a good many <inline font-style="italic">boxes</inline> of preserved ginger - or what was thought to be preserved ginger - were being introduced into Melbourne ; but every one of those jars was so formed that the bulb which ran up the centre was made very large, and in these bulbs a large quantity of opium was secreted. As honorable members are aware, a large quantity of pure opium can be imported in a very small space, and the drug was being surreptitiously brought in in that way. The more we seek to prohibit the traffic the greater will be the incentive to smuggling. In this connexion, I would remind honorable members of the action taken by the Parliament when it was suggested that a heavy duty should be imposed on diamonds. As a matter of fact, we refused to pass that duty, not because we held the opinion that they should not be subjected to taxation, but because we were satisfied that the imposition of the duty would lead to smuggling. </para>

                                <para>- That is so, but since we refrained from imposing a duty on precious stones lest the result might be to increase smuggling, "surely it cannot be justly said that the prohibition of opium would lead to the suppression of the traffic in Australia. Some years ago the Queensland Parliament imposed a duty on diamonds, and I was told by the head of a large jewellery establishment in Brisbane that some time later, the Treasurer of that State asked him why no revenue was being obtained from that source. The gentleman in question replied, " We have given up the direct importation of precious stones; and now buy them locally." To this the Treasurer replied, " But the stones must have been imported and should have paid duty." " That is a matter into which we do not inquire," said the head of the jewellery establishment. " We do not encourage smuggling, but we buy precious stones from those who offer them to us." Surely if the imposition of a duty on diamonds failed to prevent smuggling in Queensland, an attempt to prohibit the importation of opium into the Commonwealth would be equally unsuccessful. I hold that we ought not to play the part of hypocrites. Those who have not had time to consider the question, should not be led to believe that we can stop this traffic. In all fairness, we ought to say to the people, " We agree that the evil should be stopped, but are practically satisfied that prohibition would not have that result." </para>

                                <para>- I cannot, but I feel confident that the adoption ofl the proposal made by the (honorable member would not have the desired effect. We should simply lose the revenue now derived from the duty on opium and the evils arising from the traffic would not be mitigated. I should be prepared to sacrifice the revenue derived from the duty on opium, if by prohibiting the trade we could put an end to the evil ; but I am satisfied that prohibition would really intensify the evil. Probably, far greater injury arises from over-eating than from any other evil habit. </para>

                                <para>- It is certainly much more repulsive so far as appearances go, but we cannot by legislation put an end to these and kindred evils. Under the present system, there is more chance of grappling with the evils arising from opium smoking, than there would be if we prohibited the importation of the drug for smuggling would be successfully carried on, and we should have difficulty in coping with it. It is not because I have no desire to see the evil abolished, but rather because I (hold that the suggested legislation would be fore-doomed to failure, that I oppose the motion. </para>

                            <para>- When this question' was under consideration some days ago I occupied the last few minutes of the time set apart for tl.e consideration of private members' business, and the House granted me leave to continue my remarks to-day. I was then entering upon a reply to the able arguments that had been put forward so calmly and dispassionately by- the mover of the motion and the honorable and learned member for Angas, and urged that the mere fact that the motion was a lengthy one should in itself be sufficient to arouse suspicion. I pointed out that it was really a gilded pill ; that the motion was nicely worded ; and that the speeches of those who had supported it had been characterized by good taste and expressions of goodwill towards the Empire. If all the advocates of Home Rule simply desired the introduction of the system suggested by the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne and the honorable and learned member for Angas, there would be very little necessity to debate the question. But the position is different. In the first place, I think, for reasons which I shall presently submit to the House, that the motion should not have been introduced at all ; but, inasmuch as it has been moved and supported, it becomes my duty, as one who is opposed to it, to combat the arguments that have been submitted in favour of its adoption. In the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne and the honorable and learned member for Angas the motion finds two doughty champions. Their astuteness, their legal training, and their ready flow of arguments make them formidable antagonists, but I shall endeavour to show the House why I, and those who think with me, oppose Home Rule for Ireland, as advocated by the present leaders of the movement. If those who are prominently identified with the agitation for Home Rule in the old world were as philosophical as are those who have supported this motion, there would be little to fear from the carrying out of the proposition. I feel satisfied that if the members of the Imperial Government who are opposed to the granting of Home Rule for Ireland were convinced that its advocates all shared the views of the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne and the honorable and learned member for Angas, their opposition to the proposal would be considerably modified. When the matter was previously under consideration, I pointed out, in reply to the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, who had quoted the remarks of the younger Pitt, that Pitt's policy had not been carried out, and he admitted that that was so. We find, in the concluding paragraph of the motion, the statement that- </para>

With regard to the words " just measure," the first question which arises 'is, "Who is to define a just measure?" Is that system just which is advocated by the honorable and learned member for Angas, who says that Ireland is prepared to receive a subordinate Parliament? What she asks for is a co-ordinate Parliament. She will not be satisfied with an extension of municipal government, because, under- the Acts of 1903, she possesses advanced local government and advanced land legislation. My argument against interference is twofold. The honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne says that Australia has already interfered in matters in which she is not concerned, and instanced our action in sending troops to the Transvaal, and in protesting against the employment of Chinese on the Rand. But in that interference we were justified, because, in the first case, thousands of our citizens had gone . to the Transvaal, and, in the second place, we had had experience of the effect of allowing large numbers of Chinamen to come into the country, which the people of the United Kingdom had not had.

When, during the honorable and learned member's speech, I interjected that a large part of the Irish do not wish for Home Rule, he replied that I interjected officially, as leader of the Orange organization in New South Wales. I am sorry that he referred to that organization, and suggested that I am not a free agent in this matter. To say that I am" not a free agent is as true as to say that he is not, and that he moved the motion at the dictation of the local Hibernian Society, and by direction of Archbishop 0 -' . I am as free in this matter as he is, and take full responsibility for my utterances; but I am sorry that he made that reference to the Orange institution. He further said that in 1800 the Orange lodges opposed the Union ; but there he is wrong in his history, because Daniel O'Connell, speaking at the time, said that it was the Orangemen who caused it to be brought about.

                        <para class="block">There, again, is a striking similarity between the words he employs and those of another Irish advocate of Home Rule, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Devlin, M.P., who, on the 14th July, is reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Galway Observer</inline> to have said of the Union, "It was born of treachery and corruption." The honorable and learned gentleman' appealed to our sympathies by the sad picture which he drew of the depopulation of Ireland, but I ask, Are the only emigrants from the United Kingdom Irishmen? Have not Englishmen, Scotchmen, and Welshmen also left their native country, and gone to other parts of the world? Is not the bulk of the population of the United States English, or of English descent. And is not the bulk of our population of English descent? But we do not find Englishmen, Scotchmen, or Welshmen when abroad posing as exiles from their native land. They do not pretend to stand, with streaming eyes, on the shores of foreign countries, deploring their absence from the country of their birth. Irishmen, like others, go abroad for their own advantage and gain, and they and1 their descendants are glad that they have come to Australia to settle. It is merely to play on sentiment to speak of them as exiles. If all Irishmen felt in that way, why do riot men like the honorable and learned member and the honorable and learned member for Angas, who are able to do so, return to the Emerald Isle? Personally, I should be very sorry if either of them were to leave the Commonwealth. But although the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne expressed so much concern about the depopulation of Ireland, I understand that he is prepared very shortly to vote for the appointment of a High Commissioner, one of whose duties will be to try to induce the people of the United Kingdom to emigrate to Australia. </para>

                                <para>- How is it that Irishmen in America and Australia always profess hatred of England, while Englishmen, Scotchmen, and Welshmen have only kindly feelings for the land which they have left? I do not intend to turn back the dark pages of history; I am dealing only with things as they are to-day. Then, again, although the honorable and learned member deplored and bewailed the decay of Irish manufactures, he, as a protectionist, has always refused to open the doors of Australia to Irish goods. Why does he not prove his sympathy in a practical way, by assisting those of us who would make Australia free to the commerce of the world to open her ports to Irish manufactures? If the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne means to convey anything, he surely desires that the Union shall be dissolved. If he does not so desire, I cannot see how his advocacy of Home Rule can be of any use to those who are in the forefront, of the Irish national movement. Now let us look at the conditions existing in Ireland to-day under the Union with Great Britain. The conditions under British rule are the same in the North as in the South of Ireland. The people in both parts of the island have to obey the same laws. </para>

                                <para>- It is not a slander, because I shall show from their own speeches that what I say is perfectly true. Norway and Sweden existed under a dual system of government for ninety years, and a dissolution took place, as I have said, only a few months ago, as the result of the verdict of an overwhelming majority of the electors. The only members of the Storthing who opposed th'e movement were five Socialists. The referendum resulted in something like 400,000 persons voting in favour of the dissolution, whilst those against it numbered only 182. One of my arguments against granting Home Rule to the Irish people is that they are aiming at separation from Great Britain. There is no use in beating about the bush, so far as that is concerned. They wish to establish a separate Parliament, not only with legislative power, but with Executive force. The honorable and learned member for Angas admitted that; but he suggested as a solution of the difficulty that there should be a Federal Council ; that Scotland, Wales, England, and Ireland should each have its Parliament, and that over them all should be a Federal Council. We have -a Federal Parliament here, and our experience has not been altogether a happy one. This, however, is not the system advocated by the Irish Nationalists, but is merely the solution proposed by the honorable 'and learned member for Angas. The weakness of the dual system of government has also been shown in AustroHungary. The Emperor of Austria is highly respected, and it is said that he exercises a great influence for peace in Europe. He is popular with both Hungarians and Austrians ; but the dual system of government imposes an everlasting strain upon the people, and the union may be broken up at any time. Those who study European politics must bear out what I am now saying. I am now endeavouring to show the evils of dual government. Lord Rosebery, speaking on this subject during the current year, said - </para>

                            <para>I know it is said the views I have expressed are inconsistent with sympathy for Ireland. I do not agree with that view. Our view, as statesmen and legislators, is to do the best that we can for Ireland, and if we do not believe, from contemporary experience, that the measures contemplated at one time would now do good to Ireland, we are not to be accused of want of sympathy with her. We know her long sorrows ; we know the crushing injustice to which she was subjected for centuries, but we also feel that we have done something to redress the balance, and that a country which has given them the freest county institutions in the last few years, and which has within the last two years pledged its credit to no less than £1 12,000,000 to redeem the soil of Ireland from any reproach of ownership to which it was liable, is not particularly subject to any reproach of not being sufficiently attentive to the wrongs of Ireland. My view, in a word, is this - I leave here for a moment my character of a city voter - that you may give much to Ireland - and in that respect we have at any rate the example of the recent dealings of the present Government with Ireland - you may do her inestimable good by proceeding on the grounds of administrative reform, but there is one thing to which no serious statesman would ever expose this country, and that is, the curse of dual government at the heart of the Empire. You see by the long protracted 'crisis in Norway and Sweden - I am not going to say who is right or wrong - you see by the constant crises which seem to have assumed almost a permanent character in Austria-Hungary - that are the results of dualism - vultures gnawing at the very vitals of the Empire, and we may he forgiven if we will not expose our Imperial heritage and Imperial future to any such danger. </para>

I say that, instead of making for the peace of the Empire, the granting of Home Rule to Ireland would make for the pieces of the Empire. If the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne desires to cause disruption and trouble, he is going the right way to bring it about. I have asserted that the advocates of Home Rule desire separation from Great Britain, and I shall produce proofs in support of my statement. I can understand Irishmen who believe in Home Rule asking for separation ; but I cannot understand how proposals such as those which have been presented to this House, could be accepted by the Irish people.

                                <para>- To the friends of Home Rule let me commend the attitude of the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, who, when asked a straight question, replies, " I cannot interject." He would not venture to be even a little disorderly on behalf of the cause he espouses. He knows very well that if he affirmed the resolution which I have read, the motion under consideration would not pass this House. The honorable and learned member is such a great friend of the Irish and of the Irish cause that he cannot answer a pertinent question. Quite recently he stated that I had no freedom of action. I ask him' where his freedom of action comes in, seeing that he cannot interject even a " Yes," or a " No." </para>

                        <para class="block">Thus" we learn that British rule is to-day considered the greatest curse that ever befel a nation. Yet we are told that Home Rule will make for the strength and peace of the Empire. These are the statements of the prominent men in the Home Rule movement. I now propose to deal with the power behind them. I intend to take the United Irish League as it exists in Ireland to-day, and to compare the character of its advocacy with that of the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne and the honorable and learned member for Angas. I wish to make it clear that their desires in this connexion are not likely to meet with the wishes of the advocates of Home Rule in Ireland. " The United Irish League is the official party organization of what is known in the House of Commons as the " National " party. It is that party's fighting organization, and it is composed of the electors of Ireland! who believe in the system of Home Rule, advocated by the men to whom I have already referred. Upon 21st January of the present year the report of the Kinwarra branch of the league appears in the <inline font-style="italic">Clare Champion -</inline></para>

I have quite as much right to doubt the accuracy of his statement when he "quoted Fox - a most miserable authority upon this question. The United Irish ' League is either copying the rules of the Labour Party in Australia, or that party is copying its rules. Possibly that fact may account for the great warmth of the sympathy which members of the Labour Party profess with the cause of Home Rule. The United Irish League is a beautiful specimen of a free agency - if a man does not pay up, he is marked down as a defaulter. </para>

                                <para>- I can show that they have said so quite recently. Surely the Imperial authorities know the requirements of the Irish people better than we do. Are we to understand that the position of the Saxon, with his foot upon the throat of the Celt, still obtains? I ask the honorable member for Coolgardie whether he thinks that the British Parliament to-day entertains the same opinion upon, this question as it did twenty years ago? </para>

He took an active part in this movement with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parnell,</inline> and he must know that, the opinion of the Imperial Parliament  in  regard to  it  has undergone a change. The cry that the Saxon wishes to get his foot upon the throat of the Celt does not hold good now. I wish to show that those who are foremost in the Home Rule ranks are absolutely in favour of separation from the mother country, and', as a citizen of Australia, I am opposed to anybody who would bring about the disintegration of the Empire. I will now' quote from the utterances of the notorious Pat Ford, an earnest, outspoken Irishman. The honorable member for Coolgardie knows his name very well, and he cannot deny that he is an earnest, straight-out Irishman. </para>

Greater Ireland - thirty millions of the American people long for that opportunity. The Irish world has raised many funds for Ireland.

Whether they used the money for parliamentary purposes or for dynamite, or for both, we didn't ask. </para>

                                <para>- I will come to the question of physical force presently. I have quoted a few statements upon the political aspect of Home Rule by its advocates - so far as the South of Ireland is concerned. I have shown that their desire unquestionably is to establish a separate Parliament, and to obtain separation from England. If the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne believes that the existing Union is productive of all the misery which he has pictured he should fight for its repeal. If he does so, he will be found in opposition to the right honorable member for Swan. The latter has affirmed that we ought not to take a vote upon this matter because he has some Irish friends. Why should I not take up a similar position? He must hold opinions- either for or against Home Rule. Let him boldly declare upon which side he is. Everybody is aware that I am an opponent of Home Rule. The right honorable member for Swan is equally an opponent of this motion, but fie does not wish to make ill friends over it. I might as well argue that honorable mem- ° bers ought not to vote in favour of freetrade because by so doing they may offend their protectionist' friends. As a citizen of Australia, I am opposed to this motion. I do not believe that it is in the interests of the people of Ireland that it should be carried ; but, even if it be carried, it will not be acceptable to those who honestly advocate Home Rule as we know it. Then there is another danger to be apprehended. Everybody knows that upon this question the North of Ireland is opposed to the South of Ireland. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone</inline> admitted that there were 2,000,000 Irish people who ware opposed to Home Rule. This admission was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone</inline> in a speech which he delivered in 1886. </para>

                                <para>- If the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne had desired to inflame sectarian feeling in Australia he could not have done better than submit this proposition to the House. If his desire is to create party strife, then he certainly has taken a right step. If the motion be rejected, as I hope it will be, those who are in favour of it will immediately form themselves into camps to support the project in view, while, on the other hand, if it be accepted, its opponents will marshal themselves into line to combat the granting of Home Rule. It will thus be seen that this motion cannot be attended with good results to those who believe in the principle, but, on the contrary, is calculated only to foment sectarian differences in Australia. Those who really believe in Home Rule for Ireland cannot support the measure of Home Rule suggested by the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, while, so far as those who are opposed to the principle are concerned, this motion is merely an attempt to throw the apple of discord into the arena. If I could put an end to sectarianism I should be ready to go a long way to do so. I know that this statement will not be accepted by many in the House, as well as out of it, but I make it in all sincerity. Had those who favour Home Rule desired to encourage the party to which I belong, they could not have taken a better step than they have done in this instance. The straight-out supporters of Home Rule, for Ireland will object to the proposal embodied in the motion as a milk- and-water one, while those who are against it will certainly oppose it in the interests of peace. Either the difficulties under which Ireland labours, according to the honorable and learned member for Angas, must be very trivial, or the solution which he suggests is a very weak one. We know that the Imperial Parliament has, within a comparatively short time, agreed to a measure by which up to£100,000,000 may be advanced to enable tenants to buy their own holdings on easy terms, as well as , £12,000,000 by way of a bonus on the purchase price to induce landlords to sell. In this way, as well as by the passing of the Local Government Act, giving the Irish people free institutions in the shape of County Councils, the Imperial Parliament has done much to remedy the troubles which formerly existed in Ireland. Although the people of the North of Ireland are bitterly opposed to Home Rule, we are urged to step into the arena, and to ask that it be granted. The honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne said that we had a knowledge of the position of Ireland. Does he really think that that is so? </para>

I have no desire to see the present struggle continued. No one: could wish to see one part of the British race pitted against another, but I am satisfied that the proposal made by the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne would not provide a solution of the difficulty. The people of the North, of Ireland say that they are opposed to Home Rule, because they believe it would lead to clerical interference in secular matters. </para>

                                <para>- I do not know whether the honorable and learned member, when he speaks of " the independent Orangemen," wishes to suggest that I am nothing better than a base slave. I am just as free as he is to act in this matter as my conscience dictates. As a matter of fact, an independent Home Ruler would not talk- as he has done. In support of the contention of the people of the North of Ireland that Home Rule would lead to clerical interference in secular matters, I desire to point out that out of ninety-six meetings which were held under the auspices of the United Irish League, between the 21st of January and the 15th of February last, eighty -three were presided over by priests. At thirty of these meetings priests were speakers in favour of the resolutions submitted, while in fifty-six other cases they were supporters of die proposals. I think it is well for me to say at this stage that, in my opinion, a priest is just as much entitled as is any other elector in the community to exercise his civil rights, but it is somewhat singular that interference in secular matters on the part of one section of the clergy is described as "sectarian interference," while such interference on the part of those on the other side is said to be only the due exercise of a civil right. I hold that priests and parsons are just as much entitled to exercise their civil rights as are any other class of men ; but the people of the North of Ireland have had so many evidences of interference on the part of the priests of the South of Ireland that they are strongly opposed to the granting of Home Rule. I have taken an extract from a speech made by a clerical gentleman, in order fo demonstrate to the honorable member for Southern Melbourne, who was at ene time an ecclesiastic- </para>

The Imperial Government have shown their readiness to give her every freedom except that incidental to separation. If Ireland were granted the measure of Home Rule that Australia and Canada enjoy, she would' need a navy and an army. We should refuse to give them those powers. </para>

                                <para>- To say the least, it is remarkable that a skilled lawyer should call upon an unoffending and innocent layman to refrain from playing upon terms. Let me give another illustration of the reason why the people of the North of Ireland fear the introduction of Home Rule. In 1868 Cardinal Moran, whilst private secretary to Cardinal Cullen, re-issued, as a meritorious and valuable work, Peter Lombard's <inline font-style="italic">De Reg no Hibernia,</inline> in which it is declared that- </para>

                            <para>The Irish hold themselves bound in allegiance to the Holy See as its subjects, not only in spirituals, but also in temporals. </para>
                        </quote>
                        <para class="block">That is the crux of the position. The people of the North of Ireland to-day believe that the South of Ireland responds to the sovereign powers of the Pontiff in temporal as well as in spiritual matters. I have nothing to do with any inquiry as to what a man's religion may be. A man's religious belief is a matter which rests between himself and his Creator, and I hold that any one who seeks to come between a man and his religion is guilty of nothing less than downright impudence. But I should like to say that I am an Orangeman, not because of the religious belief of any section of the community, but because I hold that those of the Roman Catholic faith owe allegiance to the Pontiff in matters temporal as well as spiritual. It is for this, among other reasons, that the people of the North of Ireland are opposed to Home Rule. The people of the north and south would, be able to form a happy, peaceful nation but for" clerical interference. The honorable member for Southern Melbourne had the privilege of being acquainted with a distinguished Orangeman in this country - the Marquis of Linlithgow ; but surely he d'd not find him anxious in any way to destroy the peace of the community? Although he was Governor-General of Australia, the present Marquis of Linlithgow - then .Earl of Hopetoun - did not think that it was dishonorable to belong to the Orange Lodge* and that body to-day has among its members some of the leading men in England and Ireland. They have joined that organization, not because they disagree with the religious beliefs of any particular section of the community, but because they fear that British sovereignty will be destroyed by clerical domination in </para>

                                <para>- I wish now to refer ta a statement which appeared in a recent issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Freeman's Journal.</inline> I have no complaint to, make against that publication. The conductors of it exercise their right as journalists to criticise my public actions in common with those of other public men, and in a recent issue they pointed out that when I made a certain interjection in the course of the 'speech delivered by the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, with reference to what' happened in the days of the Irish Parliament, I should have been told that that was a Protestant Parliament. If I had made a statement of that character, I should have been accused of the basest and vilest sectarianism. If the excus'e for the conditions which existed during the eighteen years' life of the Irish Parliament is that it was a Protestant Parliament, are we to take it that honorable members desire to see Ireland with a Roman Catholic Parliament? Does the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne; think that that would make for peaces' Would it not rather make for civil war? Even the advocates of Home Rule, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone</inline> himself, have said that the Irish would fight it out, north against south. I admire the splendid command of language which the Irish possess when appealing on grounds of sentiment, and I wish to see the distresses of Ireland removed. The honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne says that the passing of this bald resolution will remove them, but I do not think that the true advocates of Home Rule will be content with this ' lavender-water style of dealing with the question. Even my comparatively cold nature would not accept advocacy of that kinds. Ireland's cries have little foundation, if the passing of this motion will satisfy them. The honorable and learned member referred to Fox as in favour of Home Rule. I did not think that my memory had served me false, but to make sure, I looked up my history again, and I find that when Pitt proposed to amend the navigation laws to allow Ireland to share in the benefits of the colonial trade, Fox protested that it was an attempt to make Ireland the grand arbitress of all the commercial interests of the Empire, and forced Pitt to recede from his position, and to give a more English colour to the scheme. The troubles of Ireland commenced with the Government which Fox supported. </para>

                                <para>- Not when the troubles of Ireland started. When Pitt had given way in this matter, Fox turned round, and protested that if Ireland joined the Union, she would resign her legislative independence. That is the way in which this reliable friend of Ireland blew hot and cold on the subject. If any' nation has reason to complain of its friends, it is Ireland in this connexion. If I thought that the carrying of the motion would do good, I would support it ; but I think that, on the contrary, it would have the effect of accentuating the difficulty. If the only way of relieving Ireland's distresses were to give her a Parliament, I would vote for giving her a Parliament with powers equal to our own. I am afraid, however, that if she possessed such powers, there would be a struggle between the north and south, and the history of Norway and Sweden shows how Parliaments in proximity - tend to disintegrate a country. Ireland is only a few hours distant from the seat of the Imperial Parliament. Sydney is further removed from the seat of the Commonwealth Government than is Dublin from London, and it might as well be argued that New South Wales suffers from her connexion with the Commonwealth, as that Ireland suffers from her connexion with the Empire. </para>

                        <para class="block">House, whereas she has 103. The honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne in the Convention was strongly opposed to the granting of equal representation to the States, because he thought that representation should always be in accordance with population. There was no stronger advocate then of the democratic principle of representation on a population basis. But, although Scotland, Wales, and England have to be satisfied with such a representation, the honorable and learned gentleman thinks that Ireland has ground for complaint when she possesses a representation of thirty-two members more than her population entitles her to. The Irish question has caused a great deal of trouble in Imperial affairs. It was responsible for breaking up the Liberal party and forming the Liberal Union party, and drove from the Liberal ranks some of its greatest men. For years past it has led to the obscuring of other issues. But the more the Imperial Parliament does for Ireland, the more her people demand, and it is useless to shut our eyes to the fact that the Irish will not be satisfied until they get separation. They certainly will not be satisfied with the passing of this milk-and-water motion. In my opinion, the members of the Imperial Government are not fiends incarnate ; they are not men without sympathy ; nor are they unacquainted with the condition of Ireland. They know the condition of Ireland better than we can, and only two years ago the Imperial Parliament voted £112,000,000 for its amelioration, and granted a further extension of municipal government to Ireland. If, however, the Irish are given a Parliament of their own, the disintegration of the Empire will at once commence. I am thoroughly opposed to any such step being taken, and I think that the people of Australia as a whole are of the same mind. But, as the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has suggested that because I am an Orangeman. I am not a free agent in this matter, I would again remind him that I am as free as he is free from the dictation of Archbishop Carr and the local Hibernian Society, and have as much right to express mv opinions on the subject. The honorable member for Coolgardie is of the religion of the bulk of the Irish people; but I am sure that he will admit that the relations between us have always been of the friendliest. I tell him that if he intends to excite the Orange movement in Australia, the carrying of this motion is likely to have that effect. ' My remarks have been made, in my judgment, in support of the best interests of the Empire and of Australia, and I have endeavoured to combat the arguments of the honorable and learned members for Angas and Northern Melbourne. I trust that the House will not shelve the motion, but that there will be a division upon it, when, irrespective of party considerations, it will probably be defeated. </para>

                            <para>- I will deal with that matter presently. Not one sound argument or good reason has been adduced against the granting of Home Rule <inline font-style="italic">-per se.</inline> The only argument advanced by the opposition worthy of serious consideration is the "hands off" or "no interference" argument. It has been contended that the Federal Parliament has no right to interfere in a matter which is not of immediate personal concern, and it has been pointed out that the members of the party to which I belong were against interference by Australia in connexion with the troubles in the Transvaal. I, and most of those who will vote for the motion, certainly preached the doctrine of " non-interference," or <inline font-style="italic">laissez faire,</inline> in connexion with events in the Transvaal, because at the time war -was raging there, and I thought that Australia should not be involved in a quarrel with which she was not concerned. But I hold that we may interfere in the interests of peace, so long as we approach the Imperial Government with due courtesy, and through the proper channel. We should not interfere to make_ war and strife. There is no parallel between the two cases. There is a reason for interference in this instance, but there was no (reason for interference in the former instance. With regard to our action in respect to the proposed importation of Chinese into the Transvaal, that was justified on the ground that we in Australia had experienced the evil effects of employing Chinese, which the people of England had not. We desire tq respectfully approach the Imperial Parliament, because we have had experience of Home Rule, and can therefore speak of its blessings, and advocate th'e application of the same principle to </para>

                        <para class="block">Ireland. The honorable member for Dalley has pointed to the many beneficent Acts that have been passed by the British Parliament in order to remedy Irish grievances, and to the fact that they have not proved effective. I make bold to say that if Ireland; were granted the best laws in the world, and they were not homemade, they would be regarded as nothing more or less than coercive measures. Universal experience points to the fact that laws in order to have any efficacy, or any claim upon the loyalty of the people, must be home-made. Many good features have been introduced, into the land-laws of Ireland, which have in some respects been models of justice as between landlord and tenant; but because such laws were not made by the people themselves they have been regarded as coercive. In order to make people law-abiding, they must have the right to frame their own laws ; otherwise loyalty in the highest and best sense cannot be expected from them. </para>

If there were opportunities for State prejudices to have full operation in this Chamber, they would outweigh all national considerations. That is one of the reasons why Irish national sentiment has not found full expression in the British Parliament. The English prejudice is represented by the peer, the parson, and the publican- the three great controlling elements in British politics which regulate the national sentiment of Great Britain. </para>

                        <para class="block">Dalley said that Orangemen were advocates of the Union in the first instance. That is perfectly true. The Orangemen, with their usual jealousy and suspicion, at the beginning of the last century gravely suspected the reigning Monarch, and, still more;, the Heir-App'arent, of leanings towards Catholicism. They entered into a conspiracy to keep Queen Victoria from, the Throne, and to place upon it the Duke of Cumberland. These men, who now call themselves members of the Loyal Orange Lodge, and who have had the impudence to falsify history, and to call themselves loyal, are loyal only just so far as it may suit their purpose. There was, however, no loyalty about them at the time of which I have spoken, and the statement that disloyalty lurks behind this motion for the presentation of a petition to His Majesty comes with very bad grace from the party which was begotten in disloyalty, and which utters the parrot cry ' of " God save the King " merely to serve its own purposes. The honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne said he hoped that if Home Rule were granted to Ireland we should hear no more of the objectionable sectarian element which was everlastingly cropping up in local politics. The honorable member for Dalley, 00 the other hand, stated that he "objected to a movement that would have that effect. I can quite understand that a certain type of politician would object to the disappearance of the sectarian issue, because* he lives by it, and if that issue were no longer present in Australian politics his trade would be gone. We desire, however, to eradicate this element, whose existence in our politics all decent men must deplore. Some remarks have been made with regard to the depopulation of Ireland, and I shall endeavour to point out the intimate connexion between the want of political liberty and the lack of interest on the part of the Irish people in the country of their birth. I should like, however, to first draw attention to the distinction which exists between legislative union and Imperial union. I hold that the utmost devotion to the cause of Home Rule and legislative separation is quite compatible with the strongest attachment to Imperial union. It has been held by Gladstone, who was an Imperialist of the first order, that in the interests of Imperial union, legislative separation is absolutely indispensable. Efforts to keep together in a legislative union people who are not fit to be ruled and governed by the same institutions promote dissension and that feeling of dissatisfaction which some men are tempted to call disloyalty. The most effective way of bringing about Imperial separation is <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> insisting, in certain circumstances, upon legislative union. On the other hand, the best way to make a lasting and true Imperial union is to grant legislative separation. The experience of the world proves that. </para>

                                <para>- I contend that the best way in which the unity of the Empire can be promoted is by granting the fullest political liberty to all subjects of the King. We can furnish an example of this- in Australia. It is notorious that at one time the British Parliament desired us to separate from the Crown. They granted the fullest liberty of action in regard to the control of our army and- navy., and legislation generally, and the result was that we have clung all the more closely to the Imperial power. It is notorious that if an attempt be made to hold a people, they are repelled ; whereas if they are granted absolute liberty, they cling the more closely. When once legislative liberty is granted to any people they cling the closer to the central power. That is exactly what took place in Imperial Rome, which was, perhaps, one of the closest and most compact unions that the world has ever seen. It used to be a maxim amongst the Romans that they gave perfect autonomy in local and national affairs to the peoples whom they conquered. In this connexion I would commend to the notice of honorable members Cicero's letters . to Attic us, as to how the Romans ruled their provinces. They gave to the people whom they conquered full liberty in regard to religion, marriage, and other concerns - liberty, indeed, in every shape and form. The Romans ruled their provinces by allowing the provinces to rule themselves. That is a secret which Imperial Britain has not yet discovered. The best way in which to bring about Imperial union is to grant legislative separation. Any man who chooses to seriously consider this great problem will find that the history of the world demonstrates the truth of my statement. Those who cavil at it are flying in the face of all history. I repeat that the surest way to Imperial union is through legislative separation. It has been stated that the Irish people have never preferred a unanimous request that they should be granted Home Rule. But I would ask, " Have honorable members ever heard of any movement in any country upon which the people concerned were absolutely unanimous?" To my mind, the Irish Home Rule movement occupies a unique position in history, because it is the one movement which has commanded the support of an overwhelming majority of its people. The Province of Ulster has been trotted out as one which </para>

            <inline font-style="italic">V</inline>opposed to Home Rule. Is the honorable member for Dalley aware of the fact that Ulster has always returned a majority of Home Rulers to the British Parliament ? More than that, this so-called Protestant Ulster contains a majority of Roman Catholics. It is. a minority - a minority which makes up in noise what it lacks in numbers - that is opposed to Home Rule. A vast majority of the people in the North of Ireland are in favour of that movement, together with an overwhelming majority in the South of Ireland Reference is continually being made to the great battle which took place upon i st of July, 1690. The people who endeavour to keep alive the racial and religious animosity upon which they wish to divide the Irish population, always desire to make it appear that that battle was really a victory for Protestantism over Roman Catholicism. It cannot be too often reiterated that as many Roman Catholics as Protestants fought under the banner of William of Orange, and as many Protestants as Roman Catholics fought under the banner of James II. A change of dynasty was involved, and the question of religion had nothing whatever to do with the struggle. Scottish Protestants were the most enthusiastic Jacobites, vet the most Protestant of the Protestants. It was the mongrel breed of Protestants in Ulster who mixed religion and politics. Consequently the man who represents that battle as a triumph for Protestantism over Roman Catholicism is the veriest ass. I wish, under cover of this motion, to correct many of the absurdities which have crept into this Irish racial discord, which should never have been allowed to show its ugly head in Australia. It is a state of things which we all deplore, and which this Parliament should endeavour to suppress. If the passing of the motion will do anything to correct these misunderstandings, and to remove from our political arena the everlasting sectarian question, it will serve a very good purpose indeed. The honorable member for Dalley has attempted to show that legislative separation would be sure to be followed by Imperial separation. In this connexion he instanced the position of Norway and Sweden as analagous to that of England and Ireland. .1 claim that there is absolutely no parallel between them. The conditions which obtain are diametrically opposite. The geographical' position of Ireland, England, and Scotland' is such that the idea of separation between Ireland and England is absurd. Ireland" is absolutely united to Great Britain, and" the idea of separation would be the most irrational that a sane man could entertain. Providence has ordained that these nations should be one, and it is only the stupidity and the malice of certain sections of the community that keep alive the bogy to which I have referred. The statement has been made that it would be dangerous to grant legislative separation to Ireland, because it would inevitably lead to the destruction of Imperial" Britain. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parnell</inline> has been quoted as: saying that the Irish people would never be satisfied until the last link which bound' them to Britain was severed. Oh, that everlasting link ! I have heard of it for the past twenty-five years. The slightest regard for the context of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parnell's</inline> speech will show that he was referring only to a legislative link. What he desired to convey was that when the last link of political subservience as between Ireland and Britain was severed, the Irish people would have realized their ideal. That is what we all say. From the beginning to the end of his speech <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Parnell</inline> was speaking of a legislative union and a legislative separation, with no reference whatever to an Imperial union or an Imperial separation. No responsible leader of the Irish party from Dan O'Connell down to the present time has made any 'statement which can be construed into a declaration in favour of separation. We all know that we cannot, accept the indiscreet utterances of a member of the rank and file as an official pronouncement of the policy of a great party. I challenge any opponent of Home Rule <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> this House to point to one statement by a responsible leader of the Irish party which can be interpreted as a declaration in favour of separation from Great Britain. One of the great movements of the- present day is the direction of Imperial Federation. I do not care for the word "Imperial," but I like the word "Federation." I believe that in a very short time one question which we shall have to discuss will be that of the desirability or otherwise of entering into an Anglo-Celtic Federation. When that time arrives we shall find that our Home Rule proposal is -a necessary preliminary to that great movement. We desire an Anglo-Celtic Federation - a union with America - which is bound to come. </para>

                                <para>- That is really the situation. Let me take an illustration from chemistry. In chemistry there are two processes - the process of analysis, and that of synthesis. The chemist always breaks up and separates his chemical constituents in order to bring them together again, and secure a desired effect. And so in politics, two processes - the analytical and the synthetical - are always present. The analytical process is really the Home Rule stage, and the synthetical process is equivalent to the Federal stage. When a people speak of federating they have first of all to ascertain their legislative boundaries. That is the history, not only of the Dominion of Canada, but of the Grecian Federation, as well as of the Federation of Australia. It is indeed the history of every federation in the world. The breaking up process - the analysis - must be followed by the synthetical process. The people of Australia could not have federated until they had secured local autonomy ; and we can never have a true federation of England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales until each pa.rt of the United Kingdom has been granted home rule. Once we pass through the analytical stage, we reach the synthetical process,, and if honorable members give the matter serious consideration they will find that every synthesis is preceded by analysis. From a legislative point of view, the analytical stage of Home Rule is sure to come. There can be no combination between the various nationalities of the British Empire until they have first secured! their local Parliaments. England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales/, [having once secured their ' local Parliaments, will be in a position to federate in the fullest sense of the word. But they must first of all separate, so to speak, for under -one Parliament there can never be a true union. The man who says that there exists a real union between Ireland and Great Britain at the present time must indeed be al dullard. As a matter of fact, there is no union; and this talk about separating that which is not united is really the height of absurdity. There is, and always has been, a paper union between Great Britain and Ireland ; but there has never been ai union of hearts. The proposal now before the House is really one to tear up the paper union in order to accomplish a union of interests and of hearts which will last for all time. </para>

                                <para>- I have said that there must be a breaking-up process before a real union can be reached. The honorable member will find this fact illustrated in every department of politics. There must be an apparent separation - .a breaking-up - before we can have the synthesis, the combination, the genuine union. We have, first of all, to define the various rights of the several nationalities concerned. If a parallel be necessary, let me point to the position of our own States. If there had been no States Governments in existence in Australia when Federation was first proposed, with whom would the advocates of that proposal have had to deal ? . They could not have dealt with the people as a people. </para>

Before we can hope to see a federation of England, Scotland, Ireland, and Wales, each of those parts of the kingdom must have its own Parliament. It will be seen that my contention, that every true political union is preceded by a breaking-up process, is correct. It is only the stupid, shortsighted man who would speak of that breaking-up process as a separation. </para>

Even the Empire itself might have to be sacrificed in the interest of the world's peace. If we could see a reasonable prospect of a great Anglo Celtic Federation by the dismemberment of the British Empire, dear though the Empire is to us, the sacrifice would be small compared with the gain in the interests of humanity. </para>

I have said that in the interests of a higher union - the federation of the world - I should be prepared to break up the Empire; but I certainly should not be prepared to see it broken up for any lesser union. The honorable member will recognise that in order to secure a union between Great Britain and the United States of America it would be necessary for the British people to part with their Imperial sentiment, while the Americans would have to part with their Republican sentiment; but if, between the two, we could arrive at a common basis of union, where the best of our Imperial sentiment and the best of the Republican sentiment of the Americans would be conserved, we should secure a higher and better type of federation. We should break up the two in order to make one great nation ; but neither the one nor the other would be sacrificed. I do not think there is any occasion to labour this question. We have stated.- in the terms of the motion, what is our desire, but I should like to reply to the base insinuation that the words in which we express our respect for His Majesty the King are not sincere.

                                <para>- I am responsible for the terms of the motion to a greater extent than is any other honorable member, and I say, with all earnestness, that there is no one in the British Empire whom I esteem more highly for his liberal opinions, and his broad-minded sympathy with the people of various nationalities in the Empire, than King Edward VII. When the Home Rule movement was being carried on under the aegis of the great Gladstone. His Majesty - who was then Prince of Wales - gave his countenance and patronage to it. That is a well-known fact. He was anxious to do his very best for the Irish people in the interests of the Empire, and on ascending the Throne he availed himself of the very first opportunity to visit Ireland. That visit was not a mere rush across the Irish Channel and back again. It was undertaken by His Majesty with the full determination to show the people of Ire-' land that he was in sympathy with them, and understood their aspirations. He has; never insulted the people or flouted their cherished opinions on any political or religious question ; and it will always redound to his credit that he has done his best to bring about that union of hearts for which we are now striving. He has ever shown, himself a true Liberal - a man of broadminded sympathies for everything that is, pure, lowly, and of good report - and was the first of the Hanoverian House to break away from the prejudices of mere sectarianism that had characterised that House for very many years. I rejoice to think that the time is coming when every honorable member of this House will have an opportunity fo record his vote on this question. As the time allotted for private members' business has almost expired, I beg leave to continue my remarks on a. future occasion. </para>

                        <para>- Only two sittings have been devoted to the consideration of the important subject of finance, but last night, on the motion of adjournment, the honorable member for Bland took it upon himself to inveigh strongly against what he termed the obstructive and " stone-walling " tactics of the Opposition. In my opinion, his remarks were quite uncalled for, because honorable members may discover for themselves, if they look through our records, that the work done by the House since the present Administration came into power has been as great as has been done in any similar period since the inauguration of Federation. The Ministerial' statement has been discussed, a number of Bills have been brought up to their second-reading stage, and the Public Service classification, which might have been expected to occasion a fortnight's debate, was disposed of in three days. It is one of the necessities of parliamentary government that every measure brought forward shall be thoroughly discussed, and if Ministerial supporters, for reasons of their own, choose to keep silent, the duty of the Opposition to inform the public mind on the proposals submitted becomes still more pressing, because, as a rule, the people absorb these various questions rather slowly. In contrast with the behaviour of the present Opposition during this session, I would direct attention to the conduct of certain members of the Labour Party last session, when that party was certainly guilty of wilful obstruction and out-and-out " stonewalling." The honorable member for Darling then, on one occasion, took four hours and thirty minutes to deliver a speech. He gave a <inline font-style="italic">resume</inline> of socialistic movements, which was  afterwards  published, and largely circulated throughout Australia. The honorable member for Gwydir made a speech extending over four hours and thirty-five minutes; the honorable member for Melbourne occupied more than three, and, I believe, nearly four hours. I remember an occasion in the State Parliament when he spoke for six hours, and would be speaking now, had not certain of his fellow-members removed the books on which he was relying. The honorable member for Canobolas spoke for four hours and twenty minutes, and then excused himself for not proceeding further, on the ground that he was rather tired through having travelled down from Sydney on the previous evening. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable member were delivering one of his famous utterances at Port Melbourne, about two hours would be enough. As a rule, two and a half hours would be sufficient for Ministers on subjects of importance, though, on occasion, they might be permitted to exceed that limit. I congratulate the Treasurer on the example which he has set for future Treasurers, by following the tactics of the corner party, and adopting a minimum. He has established a minimum, below which none of his successors should be allowed to sink. One of the things which struck me in his speech was his remarks on the subject of immigration. He says that the Commonwealth should select immigrants, and bring them to Australia on terms to be arranged, and that the States should find holdings for them, and finance them through a land bank. He offered no new or striking suggestion for the' development of the resources of the Commonwealth, nor did he speak" as though he were enunciating the policy of the Cabinet. I should, however, like to see this and future Governments do all they can to promote immigration and the settling of the people on the land. The right honorable gentleman made a great boast of what he had done in Western Australia bv giving applicants 160 acres on the Canadian plan, without cost. But I would remind him that what intending settlers require is land, and not sand. </para>

                        <para>- That is not the land which is being given away. The encouragement of settlement is surrounded with very many and great difficulties. It is difficult to obtain suitable immigrants, and it is equally difficult to make a satisfactory arrangement for bringing them here. The right honorable gentleman spoke of the great evil of centralization which exists in Australia, and it is the cause of another great evil to which the Governments of the States should pay attention, the limitation and prevention of families, which now take place. In connexion with the opening up of the lands of Australia, the Federal Parliament has a great work to do in providing for the proper use of the waters of the Murray, so that large areas in the interior which are at present undeveloped may become fit for settlement. In this connexion, I should like to quote the following passage from the report of the Inter-State Royal Commission on the River Murray: - </para>

                    <para>The birth of the Commonwealth has brought onto existence a new authority, vested with powers which within certain limits are supreme. The introduction of this new, and, to some extent, controlling factor, made it more than ever necessary that the States interested in the disposal of 4he waters of the Murray basin, should come to some conclusion as to their respective rights and interests in the river and in works for the utilisation of its waters. Several successive years of drought, too, had made the residents in the Riverina district of New South Wales, keenly anxious for the realization of some of the projects for the irrigation of their lands, already so long under discussion. This anxiety found public expression in. March of this year, when an organization, called the Murray River Main Canal League, invited the Federal Premier, the Premiers of New South Wales, Victoria, and South Australia, and other representative men, to a Conference at Corowa. At the Conference several resolutions were passed, the principal of. which are the following, : - </para>

Some of the land at Hay is. not considered suitable for irrigation, the site, as' a whole, not being so good as that at Mildura. But perhaps the chief reason the settlement has not been quite successful is that those who first took, up the land lacked experience. Regarding this, one witness said : - " I consider the soil is adapted for irrigation, and I have confidence in the scheme if we only had practical men on the area, men who understood fruit culture and the growing of crops by applying water to the land. . .

One of the means by which this Parliament could assist in this great work is by, at the earliest opportunity, arranging; for the construction of large storage reservoirs on the Murray, and for the locking of that river. Of course, we have not a great deal of money to spend in that direction at present, but we could commence by constructing a few locks and increase the number as time went on. We could' also make a beginning with the storage of the waters that are now running to waste. At page 54, reference is made to the proposed Cumberoona reservoir on the Upper Murray, as follows :- </para>

                <para class="block">I think I am perfectly justified in directing attention to this matter, which comes within the purview of the Federal Parliament, and to the opportunities which are presented to us for rendering valuable assistance in the work of developing our territory. It is desirable that the settlement of the land in all the States should be promoted as much as possible. In Victoria, we have large areas of land of very poor quality which, however, are being opened up by the Government through the agency of experimental farms. There must be similar areas in every other State which could be opened up by means of scientific farming, and the Federal Government could afterwards launch a grand scheme of irrigation, or of decentralization, with the idea of inducing people to leave the cities and settle on the soil. In certain parts of Victoria, notably in the Beech Forest and the Heytesbury Forest, we have large numbers of settlers who are doing the finest possible work, and who are really the backbone of the country. These men, who are opening up the land, deserve every consideration. Although we cannot assist these people in many directions, we can render them some aid by providing them with facilities for frequent deliveries of letters, newspapers, and literature, so that they mav educate themselves and their children. </para>

                        <para>- We ought to give these men constant consideration, because they are the backbone of the community. I should like to draw attention to a paragraph which appeared recently in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline> in regard to a letter which has been forwarded by the Victorian Agent-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Taverner,</inline> to the Premier of this1 State, asking if the Government would set apart 1,000 acres of good land for twenty families who would be sent out by the Tunbridge Wells Colonizing Society. That communication shows that the Agents- General are endeavouring to obtain the best men possible to place upon Australian soil. These are the people whom we wish to establish upon farms of their own, and if the Government render the Agents-General of the States any assistance in that direction they will be performing a great and very useful work. At the present moment, there seems to be no disposition on the part of the States to relinquish this work, and until they enter into some arrangement :with the Commonwealth, I think that it would be very unwise for us to appoint a High Commissioner. When that appointment is made, 1 trust that the person chosen for the office will toe a thoroughly practical man, who can impart reliable information to the people at Home as to the conditions which obtain here. Whether rightly or wrongly, it is a fact that the operation of certain sections in the Immigration Restriction Act is doing great harm to this country in the old world. This Parliament should do all that it can to remove the prejudice which exists in the mother country against Australia. We wish to give every encouragement to people in the old country to immigrate to Australia. For my own part, I should like to see the contract labour section excised from the statute to which I refer. There can be no doubt that in some instances, through the indiscretion of officers, that Act has been administered in such a way that people arriving in Australia have experienced a very bad time. These little indiscretions have increased the feeling of irritation which existed in England against us. I agree with the objects of that legislation, so far as they relate to the prevention of the importation of bodies of men in times of industrial trouble. That contingency, however, is already sufficiently provided for. I should like to see the Government and the members of the Labour Party prepared to welcome some of the poorer classes from the old land who are at present living under most unsatisfactory conditions. During the delivery of his Budget, the Treasurer made one statement, to which I wish to direct attention. He said - </para>

The Treasurer, during the course of his speech, made reference to the Naval Agreement which has been concluded with the Imperial Admiralty; but we have had such excellent speeches upon the question from the honorable member for Wentworth and the honorable and learned member for Corinella, that I do not propose to traverse the ground which they have already covered. I may be permitted to say, however, that the contribution which we make to the Imperial Government under the naval agreement is, in my judgment, wholly inadequate. I have no sympathy with the idea entertained by some 'honorable members that we should establish an Australian Navy. Such a navy would be absolutely valueless if any great power were to attack us. I hope that the Government will proceed with the works outlined by the honorable and learned member for Corinella, in order that the scheme for the proper equipment of our land forces may be completed.

                        <para>- Does the right honorable gentleman deny that he has previously expressed himself in favour of the retention of ,the Braddon section ? Did he not say that it was one of the best provisions contained in the Constitution? It may be that the framers of that charter of government foresaw that some day the right honorable gentleman would fill the position of Treasurer of the Commonwealth, and thought it necessary to restrict his spending powers, and to impose a check upon any tendency which he might have towards extravagance. I am glad to know that all the States are giving attention to the Braddon section, and I hope that as the result of their united action, the operation of that provision will be extended. In this connexion, I should like to draw attention to the opinion expressed upon- page 827 of Quick and Garran's <inline font-style="italic">Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth -</inline></para>

            <inline font-style="italic">The amount of Federal Expenditure.</inline>- The chief influence of the section will undoubtedly be in the direction of ensuring economy of Federal expenditure. The. Federal Parliament will be subject to two opposite forces; the national impulse which will tend towards enlarging the scope of Federal operations, and, therefore, of Federal expenditure ; and the restraining influence of the States, and of their representatives in the Federal Parliament, which will make for limiting Federal expenditure so as to ensure an adequate subsidy to the States. The chief merit of the Braddon clause is that it fixes the maximum ratio of Federal to provincial expenditure, and thus checks, during the early years of Federation, any attempt at an undue encroachment of the Federal power. If the vast revenues of the Commonwealth were entirely at its disposal, subject only to such political pressure as the States could bring to bear, there might be a serious temptation to Federal extravagance, and a serious risk of the diminution of the State revenues. </para>

                        <para>- I can only refer the Treasurer to his own words. If he does not believe in them, he should withdraw them. I now come to the receipts of the Commonwealth from Customs and Excise. In 1904-5 the actual revenue received from this source was ^8.799^.530; and the amount which it is estimated will be received during the current year is ^8,683,000 - a decrease as compared with the receipts for last year, which in themselves fell below the estimated revenue by ^180,470. This is a very serious matter to each of the States, and it is most important, therefore, that the Braddon section should be retained. The estimated amount of the deficit, compared with the receipts for 1904-5, is ^72,710. It is satisfactory to note that the income from the Post Office has increased, and promises to still further increase during the current year. But when we come to analyze the Customs revenue, we find that the returns obtained from the majority of the items in the Tariff show a serious deficiency so far as most of the States are concerned. In Victoria there has been an increase in the revenue derived from apparel and textiles, oils, paints, &amp;c, drugs and chemicals, wood, wicker work and cane, jewellery, leather, paper and stationery, and vehicles. All the other items, however, show a falling off of revenue. The estimated sugar Customs receipts in Victoria for 1905-6, as compared with the returns for 1902-3, show a decrease of ^216,491, whilst the estimated sugar Excise returns show an increase of £.133,285, or a net deficiency on the two items of ,£83,206. This diminution of revenue must have been due to one of two causes. Either it has been brought about by a slackness in trade, or by an increase in our local manufactures. I think we may set aside the suggestion that this diminution of imports is attributable to slackness of trade, for we know that there was a very satisfactory increase in the manufactures of Victoria in 1904 as compared with the output for the previous year. I have here a statement from the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> giving the official statistics relating to Victorian factories. It sets forth that - - </para>

                        <para>-- I am informed by the honorable member for Oxley that it is due to an increase in the output of mackintoshes. The official statistics also show that there has been a diminution in the number of hands employed in the following trades : - Glass bottle and asbestos works, wire works, and jam, pickle, sauce and vinegar works. I would draw particular attention to the decrease which has taken place in the number of hands employed in jam. factories, because we have been told that the present price of sugar is hampering the industry. This has an important bearing on the question of the sugar bounty, and it doubtless accounts for the diminution in the number of hands engaged in the industry. There has also been a decrease in the number of hands employed in the following lines : - Cabinet making, including billiard table manufacturing, and brush and broom manufactories. I believe, . although I am not quite sure, that the brush and broom making industry has been removed to a large extent from Victoria to Tasmania. </para>

                        <para>- Not necessarily j but we should not despise information of this kind simply because it is given by that journal. It is pointed out by the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> that the most striking increase is in connexion with the implement factories, and that the wages paid in that industry in 1904, as compared' with 1903, show an advance of £51,348. Another notable increase, showing that we are able to turn out goods that compare favorably with those manufactured in other parts of the world is that relating to the number of hands and wages paid in the boot and shoe trade. I come now to the . important question of the sugar bounty. In the course of his Budget statement, the Treasurer informed us that the Government proposed to continue the sugar bounty, and also the excise duty on sugar, for five years. </para>

                        <para>- I rather doubt the wisdom of continuing the present bounty for a further term of live years. As most honorable members :are aware, the attitude which I take up in regard to 'the policy of a White Australia is that we should have a white-owned Australia; but I feel that it is only fair to all concerned that, having entered upon a policy of a White Australia, we should give it as fair a trial as possible. I am prepared to follow the Government to this extent : that I would continue the existing sugar bounty for two years, and at the end of that time would allow it to gradually disappear by means of a sliding scale. </para>

                        <para>- This question has a very serious bearing on those engaged in fruitgrowing in the cooler parts of Australia, as well as upon our jam manufacturers. It is proposed by the Government to expend £146,000 during the current year by way of bounty on white-grown sugar, but this does not represent anything like the actual loss which the several States will sustain. In addition to that sum, they must suffer considerable loss in the shape of a decreased revenue from the sugar duties. In this connexion I desire to draw attention to two leading articles, which, in my opinion, should be carefully perused, for they practically represent both sides of the question, and are exceedingly valuable contributions to this question. The first of these was published in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of 22nd instant. It was pointed out in this article that - </para>

                    <para>The subject is a most important one from several points of view, and more particularly in respect to revenue. The consumption of sugar in Australia is, roughly speaking, 180,000 tons a year, and the position with regard to revenue may be indicated thus : - </para>

                <para class="block">It will thus be seen that in the first year of Federation revenue to a large amount was sacrificed in order to protect the industry on the then basis of Australian production ; but since then an additional ,£100,000 a year has been sacrificed in order to stimulate the growing of sugar by white labour, whilst, if this process becomes ultimately successful, and all sugar required by Australia be grown by white labour, we shall only receive a revenue of ^180,000. It may be thought that the consumer gets the benefit of a reduction of price by using the Australian-grown sugar, but that is not the case, for he at present pays the same price for all sugar, whether it be imported, whether it be grown by black labour in Australia, or whether it be grown by white labour in Australia, though the revenue obtains respectively <inline font-style="italic">£6, £3,</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">£1.</inline></para>

                    <para>The additional protection of <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> per ton to sugar grown by white labour has, up to the present, had no effect in reducing the quantity of sugar grown by 'black labour - quite the contrary. It has, however, largely stimulated the growth of sugar by white labour in parts of the Continent less suited to sugar production. Thus the production of white-grown sugar in Queensland was in 1902 12,000 tons, in 1903 24,000 tons, and in 1904 31,000 tons. </para>

                <para>As to New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner, in his last Budget speech, said : - " New South Wales has undoubtedly received a very large benefit from the sugar rebate, because before Federation they were growing nearly all their sugar by the aid of white labour; consequently the bonus has been a little godsend to them." </para>
                <para>Quite true. A little godsend to the extent of £114,000 in three years for doing exactly what they were doing before. Alongside the sugar farms in New South Wales and Southern Queensland are dairy farms, carried on with white labour to the great profit of their owners and the community, and receiving not one penny of either bonus or protection from the Commonwealth. Contrasted with the tenderness to sugar-growers is the treatment of the fruit-growers of Victoria and Tasmania. They are heavily burdened in order that the sugar-growers may be coddled. They have to carry on their industry, contribute largely to the revenue, and afterwards make a profit if they can. But the sugar-growers are paid large bounties to keep them in an unprofitable industry, and prevent them taking up a profitable one. </para>
                <para class="block">There is a great danger that this attempt to grow sugar under hot-house conditions, by paying bounties for its production, may lead to the substitution for the kanaka - who is a good man for the work, and can be, and has been, properly regulated - of Chinamen and Hindoos, who are much less desirable. A great many farms in Northern Queensland are now being worked by, or are coming into the possession of, Chinamen. A conference of sugar-growers of Northern Queensland, whose discussions I have studied, by no means minimizes this great danger. </para>

A white man trashing in a cane-field in Northern Queensland would not be earning a comfortable living. I wish now to draw attention to some statements in an article which appears in to-day's <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> In that journal <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Swayne,</inline> of Mackay, is reported to have stated at the recent conference of sugar-growers that - </para>

                </quote>
                <para class="block">This would involve the assistance, of coloured labour to the extent of 35,000, an estimate which the writer of the article regards as so exaggerated as to be unworthy of consideration. The article continues - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>It may be taken for granted that the production of sugar from cane is established and has become essentially a genuine Australian industry. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">I hope that that is the case, and that Australia will shortly meet, and continue to meet, her own sugar requirements. The industry, however, should be carried out under the conditions which will most benefit Australia, and these are the best economic conditions. It is pointed out that the cutting of the cane involves the greatest amount of trouble, and that north of the Burdekin the supply of labour is wholly insufficient. It is suggested that gangs of white labourers might travel from farm to farm, as shearers travel from station to station, going from north to south as the season advances. . A statement of considerable importance is this - 4,491,407 gallons of molasses was obtained. The distribution of the latter is interesting, and as it indicates that cane-growing has an indirect influence in various directions, it may be well to give some particulars. According to the official reports 66,300 gallons of molasses went in 1904 to the distilleries; 491,500 gallons was sold, chiefly for the production of treacle and golden syrup ; 600,415 gallons was used for stock feeding purposes; 201,600 gallons was burnt as fuel in the furnaces; 29,200 gallons was taken for manuring purposes; 797,653 gallons was held in store, and 2,304,738 gallons was allowed to run to waste. </para>
                <para class="block">This statement is well worthy of the consideration of the representatives of country districts. It seems to me that it should be possible, by mixing this waste molasses with foodstuff, to make a cake for the feeding of animals in times of drought, because, as is well known, molasses mixed with fodder makes a very good food for stock when pasture is not available. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> says very wisely that the fact that so much molasses is going to waste suggests want of enterprise. Most great fortunes in recent years have been made by the utilization of waste products, and here we have a waste product which would not only provide a good food for the poorer classes, but which might, if mixed with other foodstuffs, make a valuable fodder. The suggestion that the expansion ,of the sugar industry is likely to be largely confined to what may' be called the temperate districts claims special attention. If that occurs, it will be a sad thing for Australia, because the temperate districts have always been devoted to other purposes. The tropical areas of Northern Queensland are. said to comprise 'the richest land in that State. </para>

                    <para>What makes sugar dear in Australia is the big profits obtained by the refinery. As a fact the whole of the Australian and New Zealand markets are under the control of a single company. The organization is so strongly entrenched that it not only fixes the price at which it will sell sugar, but also deals with the grower in the same manner, by deciding the price of the cane, juice, or raw sugar. This is an in tolerable state of affairs, and demands the attention of the Federal Parliament. The huge profits disclosed in the published balance-sheets of the. Colonial Sugar Company show where the money goes. If anything is to be done to place the Australian sugar-growing industry on a sounder footing, the first step must be to break down this monopolistic organization. </para>

                <para class="block">We have others besides the sugar-growers and the Colonial Sugar Company to consider in connexion with this matter, namely, the consumers, for whom the position becomes very serious, when a monopolistic company is able to keep up the price of sugar in the way that it is now being maintained. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> recognises that some means should be found for the establishment of refineries, which would compete with the Colonial Sugar Company, and I suggest that a portion of the money, which is now allotted to the payment of bonuses, should be devoted to assisting in the establishment of co-operative refineries. In the early days of the dairying industry in Victoria, the Government assisted very materially towards its development, by means of a bonus, and now the production of butter is one of the greatest industries in that State - in fact, it has been the saviour of Victoria. I do not see why we should not. with the assistance of a bonus, succeed in establishing co-operative refineries, because the principle of co-operation amongst farmers has been successfully adopted in the past, and there is room for its further application to other branches of the agricultural industry. I would earnestly commend the articles, from which I have quoted, to the consideration of honorable members who are interested in the sugar industry. A matter of considerable importance is referred to at page 40 of the Budget papers. I find that the defences of Thursday Island in 1904-5 involved an expenditure of £1 2^049, which was borne by Victoria. New South Wales, Queensland, and Western Australia; neither Tasmania nor South Australia contributing anything. Then, again, the expenditure upon the defences at King George's Sound amounted in 1904-5 to £4,842, and it is estimated that in 1905-6, the outlay will be .£5.104. This expenditure is contributed to by New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia, Tasmania again contributing nothing. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; and that State also contributes towards the cost of maintaining the defences at Thursday Island. At page 45 of the Budget papers, various items of new expenditure are dealt with. I find that in the Department of External Affairs and the Attorney-General's Department, increases have taken place; that in the Home Affairs Department the expenditure has risen from .£34,804 to £42,1.36; that there was an increase in the Department of Trade and Customs, a decrease in the Defence Department, an increase in the Postmaster-General's Department, and a slight increase in one or two other smaller items. I think we should watch this new expenditure very closely, in order that we may prevent, so far as possible, any further serious diminution of the amount returnable to the States. </para>

At page 55 of the Budget papers, we find figures which show that there has been a very serious diminution in the amount returnable to the States, and that, according to the Estimates for the current year, there will be a further falling off, as compared with last year, of <inline font-style="italic">£S5h92°-</inline> At page 82 of the' Budget papers, a table is printed, showing the amounts of deposits and of coin and bullion held by the banks of issue in Australia. In 1904 the deposits amounted to £90,000,000, and in 1905 to £96,000,000. That is a very satisfactory increase, and I think that we may congratulate ourselves on the fact that trade continues to show an improvement. The coin and bullion -held amounted to £21,490,355. That is also very satisfactory. The honorable member for Kooyong reminds me that it is not a good sign when -money is being, locked up in the banks. It is satisfactory to have the money to look up, although perhaps it would be preferable to see it invested in profitable enterprise. </para>

                        <para>- It is very satisfactory indeed, and we may congratulate ourselves upon the fact. From page 84 of the Budget papers I learn the acreage which was under cultivation in Australia between the years 1900-1 and 1904-5. This information is contained in table G, which shows that last year the total area under cultivation in the Commonwealth was 11,923,667 acres. I have already shown that along the Murray, Murrumbidgee and Darling Rivers, in the centre of Australia, there is another 50,000,000 acres, which is suitable for intense culture, and that in Australia we have room for a population1' of more than- 60,000,000. Table J sets out the quantity and value of the butter exported from Australia between 1899 and 1904. This is a matter in which Victoria is especially interested. From the official figures, I find that, whereas in 1903, 32,1.24,709 lbs. of butter were exported, in the following year the quantity had increased to 64,807,962 lbs. of a total value of £2,461,450, which is the highest upon record. In this connexion I maintain, that many of the areas which are at present being utilized in New South Wales for the cultivation of sugar-cane could be profitably used by white labour to increase the output of butter. </para>

                        <para>- There is no need to pull down any Tariff wall, because it is merely a question of entering into reciprocal arrangements with the old country. I wish now to direct the attention of honorable members to the fact - as will be seen by reference to page 90 of the Budget papers - that whereas in 1903 the imports into Australia from the United States were £6,368,552, in the following year they had diminished to£4,591,945. In 1903 the exports from Australia to the. United States were valued at . £2,625,399, but the next year they had decreased to £2,228,843. I should have thought that the quantity of wool exported from the Commonwealth would have increased the value of our exports to that country rather than have diminished it, but the figures are against my supposition. Our imports from Japan in 1903 were valued at £330,121, and in 1904 they had increased to£421,153. 1903 we exported to Japan £115,992 worth of goods, and in the following year the amount had increased to £581,214. No doubt that increase was largely due to the war which has just terminated. These figures show that if we will only treat the ally of the Empire in a proper manner, we can do a very large reciprocal trade with her. The rise of Japan amongst the great powers of the world has been a phenomenal one, and it behoves us to do all that we can to foster trade with that country. According to table V. of the Budget papers, Australia has only 1,017,652 pigs, whereas Canada possesses 2,353,838. It will thus be seen that we are weak in pigs. This is a matter of very considerable importance, because I hold that there is a great future for the Australian farmer in pig raising and pork packing. I should like honorable members to recollect the letter of an American merchant to his son, in which he stated that one of the best ways in which a farmer could carry his grain to market was to let it walk there. I wish to impress on our farmers the extreme value of that wonderful rent-paying quadruped, the pig. I, have gone carefully through the Budget papers, and have endeavoured to direct attention to various matters which I regard as important. Unfortunately we have a declining revenue and an increasing expenditure. Whilst we should develop the resources of Australia in every possible way, we should always have a due regard to economy, and though I do not suggest that we should be niggardly in our grants, I would urge upon the Treasurer the necessity of keeping a. strict eye on the finances, if only for the sake of the States in the Union, which have comparatively small populations. </para>

                    <para>- I do not propose to detain the Committee very long. There are, however, , one or two matters connected with the Budget which so vitally affect Tasmania - one of them particularly affecting mv own electorate - that I should be failing in mv duty if I did not deal with them now. The question to which I wish chiefly to direct attention has reference to the sugar bounty. So far as Tasmania is concerned, that is unquestionably the most important item with which the Treasurer dealt in his Budget statement. I have no prejudice against the State of Queensland, or the sugar industry as such, but the position which the people of Tasmania take up is that, whilst the Commonwealth Parliament is seeking to foster one industry, it must be careful that in doing so it does not crush out of existence another of far greater importance to that State, and one which, I venture to say, is equal in importance to the Commonwealth with the sugar industry. </para>

To-day there is not one jam manufactory in Queensland, whereas prior to Federation there were over a dozen. They have been crushed out of existence by the sugar tariff. </para>

                        <para>- It is supported by the evidence given before the Tariff Commission at Hobart a few days ago. Honorable members will find that, whereas before the imposition of the Commonwealth Tariff Queensland was annually manufacturing 50,000 cases of jam from pulp sent chiefly from Tasmania - a small quantity also being imported from Victoria - she has now no jam manufactories. The reason for this change is that, whereas the jam manufacturers of Queensland, prior to Federation, could obtain sugar at £9 per ton, they would now be required to pay nearly , £20 per ton for it. </para>

                        <para>- I say distinctly that the Minister of Trade and Customs has not learnt the alphabet of the practical working of the sugar duties. I would refer him to the evidence given before the Tariff Commission at Hobart by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> Jones, whose firm is the largest manufacturer of jams in Australia. That gentleman distinctly told the Commission that the present duty on sugar was crushing many of the small fruit-growers of Tasmania out of existence. I know that this statement is correct, and I wish that some honorable members who favour the present sugar tariff could be induced to take a trip through the small fruit growing districts of the Huon and the Derwent Valley. Speaking in all seriousness, I say that it is enough to make one's heart bleed when one visits these districts and sees cattle turned into the raspberry plantations, black and red currant trees being uprooted, and plum trees being cut down, simply because the price of sugar has so seriously affected the growers. </para>

                        <para>- That is not the point. Prior to Federation, Tasmania was manufacturing jam practically for the mainland, and for parts beyond the Commonwealth. The local consumption of jam would not be sufficient to keep one factory going, because the great majority of the people in the fruit-growing districts make their own preserves. Prior to Federation, the whole of the sugar used in the jam which Tasmania exported - and which represented practically the whole of her output - was absolutely duty free. A rebate was allowed on every ounce of sugar used in jam sent from Tasmania to the mainland as well as to parts beyond. </para>

                        <para>- I certainly am not. If the conditions prevailing prior to Federation now applied to the jam manufacturers, their position would be markedly different. I wish honorable members for Queensland to remember that, under the Commonwealth system of granting rebates, the manufacturers of jam in Tasmania are being deterred from using Queensland sugar. If Queensland sugar be used in jam manufactured for export beyond the Commonwealth a rebate of five-sixths of the excise duty of £3 per ton is allowed, whereas, if our manufacturers use the imported sugar, they secure a rebate of five-sixths of the duty of <inline font-style="italic">£6</inline> per ton. </para>

The practice of using foreign-grown sugar is forced upon our jam manufacturers by the stupidity of Ministers. They, have to use it in preference to Australian grown sugar, in order to carry on successfully. Would the honorable member for Melbourne Ports seriously suggest that the jam manufacturers should use Queensland sugar, on which they would receive a rebate of only £1 per ton, seeing that they would be entitled to a rebate of <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> per ton on the imported sugar? </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. But honorable members forget that the high price of sugar compels the jam manufacturer to give as little as possible for his fruit. He is forced to do this in order to be able to place his product on the market at a certain price. The moment his price goes beyond that level his output is thrown open to competition from other sources, such as treacle, &amp;c. </para>

                <para>Mr.McWILLIAMS.- The fruit grown in Queensland is entirely different from the small fruits of Victoria 'and Tasmania. In the one case we have a tropical, and in the. other a temperate product. Sugar is wholly the raw material of the jam manufacturers of Tasmania and Victoria, and I wish to briefly state what I think ought to be done in favour of an industry which has just as much right to the consideration of this Parliament as has any other industry in the Commonwealth. I have the authority to state, on behalf of the jam manufacturers of Tasmania, that the duty on jam may be removed to-morrow, so far as they are concerned, for it is not worth a snap of the fingers if they are given sugar free of duty. </para>

                <para>I want honorable members to remember the effect of this sugar dutv. The honorable and learned member for Corinella last night stated that the percentage increase of white-grown sugar was three times as large as that of black-grown sugar; but in this instance no more ridiculous comparison could be made than that of the percentage. It is just as if the honorable and learned member had compared the increase of two towns by saying that one had doubled its population, and the other had increased it Dy one-sixth, when the true facts were that one town of 1,000 inhabitants had gained another 1,000, and that another town of 5,000 inhabitants had also gained 1,000. The facts in connexion with the sugar industry are that the production of white-grown sugar has increased from 12,000 to 52,000 tons, and that of black-grown sugar from 65,000 to 105,000 tons. </para>

I have never taken part in "stone-walling" proceedings in this Chamber, nor have I spoken except on subjects in which I take a serious interest. I claim my right, however, when any matter of public importance, or vitally affecting the interests of those who sent me here, comes up for discussion, to speak on it ; and the Minister will gain nothing, and will not draw me off the track, by endeavouring to introduce personalities'. The Queensland sugar industry has never stood on its own basis, because it has always had the support of the Government. The Queensland Parliament has legislated in regard to it for the last thirty-five years ; and I hold in my hand a return prepared during the recess, to the order of the House on my motion, just before the prorogation, as to the conditions on which sugar mills were erected in Queensland by the Government of the State, and the extent to which the planters of Queensland have carried out the obligations into which they had entered in regard to those mills. </para>

                        <para>- This information was obtained from the Government of Queensland only a short time ago. With what was done by the State of Queensland for the encouragement of the sugar industry I have no concern. It is now proposed to extend the operation of the bounty for another five years, at the end of which time the planters will again come to us for assistance. That is the history of all bonuses. Of course, it is not fair to suddenly deprive an industry of a bonus ; and I would be prepared to agree to a sliding scale reduction, which would eventually extinguish the bonus, as was suggested by me last session, and has been suggested by the honorable member for South Sydney and the honorable and learned member for Corinella during the present session. Let the bonus diminish as the duties on the special Tariff of Western Australia diminish. </para>

                        <para>- Unless we allow a monopoly to control the business, the market price of the world will rule in Australia in respect to sugar when we produce all that we can consume, supposing that the Queensland sugar -grower is placed in the same position as the wheat grower or fruit-grower of other States. The figures produced at a conference of sugar-cane growers in Queensland prove conclusively that although sugar has jumped up in price to from £23 to £24 per ton, the cane producer is receiving a very small proportion of the increase. He has not received nearly the same increase that the Sugar Company has appropriated to itself. </para>

                        <para>- My point is that under present conditions the jam manufacturer is discouraged from using Queensland sugar. There is a duty of£6 per ton upon imported sugar, and an Excise duty of£3 per ton on sugar grown in the Commonwealth. If the jam manufacturers use Queensland sugar, and export, as do the manufacturers of Tasmania, fully one-half of their output, they receive a rebate to the extent only of five-sixths of the amount of the excise duty of <inline font-style="italic">£3.</inline> If, on the other hand, the manufacturers -use Fiji or Mauritius sugar, which is subject to al duty of <inline font-style="italic">£6</inline> per ton, they receive a rebate amounting to five-sixths of that duty. Therefore, they receive twice as much rebate upon foreign-grown as upon Queensland sugar. The result is that Messrs. Jones and Company, who are the largest jam producers in Tasmania, use almost entirely foreign sugar - thirteen-fourteenths of the sugar they use is imported from parts beyond the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member must not blame the manufacturer, but the stupid arrangement which compels him for his own protection to do as I have described. I desire that Queensland sugar shall be used, as far as possible, to meet every requirement of the Commonwealth. No one will be more pleased than I will, when I find that the production of Queensland sugar has increased to such an extent that it will meet all our requirements. Under the present- stupid conditions, however, we give the jam manufacturer a bonus equivalent to£1 out of every <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> if he will use imported sugar. In the name of all that is reasonable, is that to the interest of the sugar-growers of Queensland ? </para>

                        <para>- Half the jam produced in Tasmania is manufactured for export to parts beyond Australia. We send our jams to South Africa, to Japan, and the East generally. , It may surprise honorable members to know that the manufacturers of Tasmania have not waited for the Commonwealth to appoint commercial agents, but have made their own arrangements in that regard all through the East. As honorable members may see from the evidence given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jones</inline> before the Tariff Commission at Hobart, half his total output is sent to parts outside Australia. </para>

                        <para>-It would not be possible for him to make any special distinction between the jam manufactured for the home and for the export trade, and as it is necessary for him to use imported sugar in order to secure the larger amount of rebate in respect to the jams exported, he makes one deal of it, and buys the whole of his sugar in one lump. In dealing with this matter, I would ask the Government to consider whether it would not be possible, alike , in the interests of the jam manufacturers and the sugar-planters, to devise some means by which they can get rid of the present hampering influences. Present conditions are not fair to the Queensland planter, because one of the chief sugar users in the Commonwealth is compelled for his own protection to use imported sugar, whereas he would naturally prefer to buy what he requires here if the conditions were equal. I know that the Government desire to help the Queensland sugar industry, and I suggest that they should, in pursuance of that object, do their best to remove the inducement which is at present held out to' manufacturers to go beyond Queensland for their raw material. </para>

In 1902-3 Queensland sugar was quoted at £15 12s. 6d.,. and foreign sugar at from £11 17s. 6d. to £12 12s. 6d. In 1903-4 the price of Queensland sugar was , £15 12s. 6d., and of foreign sugar £12 12s. 6d. These prices are exclusive of duty and excise. </para>

                        <para>- In 1904-5 Queensland sugar was sold at £15 7s. 6d.. and foreign sugar at £12 7s. 6d.y and the prices for 1905-6 are quoted as Queensland sugar £15, and foreign sugar £12 17s. 6d. per ton. The last prices presumably are those at which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jones</inline> has contracted for the supply of sugar for the current year. These figures show that I was well within the mark when I said that the price of foreign sugar f.o.b. at Melbourne, Hobart, or Sydney was between . £12 and £13 per ton in ordinary years. I know that shortages will sometimes occur, and that the price will go up, as happened recently when sugar was quoted at £24 per ton. No matter, however, what may be the price of foreign sugar f.o.b. at our principal ports, the quotation for Queensland sugar will, owing to the monopoly of the Sugar Company, always represent the price of the foreign sugar, plus the full amount of the duty. </para>

                        <para>- To that must be added the excise of £3 per ton. I do not wish to labour the matter ; but I ask honorable members, whilst they are considering the assistance they are prepared to give to the sugar industry, to remember that there are, scattered throughout Victoria and Tasmania, hundreds of the very class of men whom we want to settle in Australia. These men have gone into the forest, without any capital beyond their own energy and industry, and have established little homes for themselves, and have planted gardens with raspberries, currants, and other small fruits, and we are now placing a heavy burden upon them by reason of the provision we have made for the assistance of the sugar industry. I would also point out that the sugar planter is receiving a very small proportion of the increase which has been brought about in the price of sugar. This is owing to the huge monopoly which now controls the whole trade. </para>

                        <para>- I am aware of that fact. Personally, I am of opinion that there should be no Excise duty chargeable upon Queensland sugar. I have always held the view that it is no fairer to levy an Excise duty upon Queensland sugar than it is to make a similar charge upon Tasmanian apples, Victorian wheat, or New South Wales butter. All these commodities are the natural products of the different States. So long as protection is the accepted policy of this House. I am prepared to give to the Queensland sugar grower a measure of protection proportionate to that which we extend to every other producer in Australia. But I do not wish to perpetuate a system under which assistance is rendered to an industry in one State in such a way as to crush out an equally important industry in another State. </para>

It is a natural industry - the one above all others which is suited to the conditions that obtain in that particular State. I claim that this House should exhibit the most complete sympathy with an industry in which a man. without capital can make a comfortable living upon a very small block of land. There is no industry, in Australia which is so conducive to closer settlement as is the fruit-growing industry. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the. average in Tasmania would be under 10 acres of orchard per family. Scores of men are making a good living off. 6 or 7 acres of orchard. These people do not ask for a bonus - they do not ask for assistance. They merely say - " Do not place a handicap upon our natural industry." All they desire is that they shall be left alone Only to-day I had an. interview with a Tasmanian member of the Fruitgrowers' Conference- who is at present in Melbourne, and he informed me that the average production this season would be about 7,500 lbs. of raspberries or currants per acre. To convert that fruit into jam would require about three and a half tons of sugar, upon which, a duty of£21 would be collected. Half of that quantity would be exported, and upon that proportion five-sixths of the duty would be refunded ; but upon the other half, which is consumed in Australia, no rebate would be allowed. I am sure that the honorable member for Melbourne Ports will be interested to learn that during last year the number of employes of Messrs. H. Jones and Co., of Hobart, ranged from 140 in midwinter to 750 in midsummer. Even in a city like Melbourne, an, industry which employed that number of hands would be regarded as a very considerable one. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I am giving these figures, because I know that the evidence taken by that body will not be available until after this debate has closed. The total wages paid by Messrs. H. Jones and Co. amount to £214 weekly, or an average of 25s. per hand. Label lers - girls upon piecework - average from 20s. to 30s. per week all the year round - the Victorian rate being 14s. per week. </para>

I know of no more honest and straightforward man than the gentleman who gave this testimony. It seems to me that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jones</inline> gave his evidence in the most straightforward manner. I repeat that labellers - that is, girls engaged upon piecework - receive an average wage of from 25s. to 30s. per week all the year round, whereas the Victorian rate is only 14s. per week. </para>

                        <para>-That is the average paid to all his employes, and these include a very considerable number of children. The honorable member must know that in the fruit season a large quantity of juvenile labour is employed in cleaning the fruit, and in performing other little odd jobs. It seems to me that, in giving evidence before the Tariff Commission, it is not necessary for a manufacturer to disclose the profits which he makes from his business so long as he makes it clear that he extends reasonable treatment to his employes. I do not propose to detain the Committee by discussing the general matters which were referred to in the Budget ; but I do ask the Treasurer to bear in mind one statement made by the honorable and learned member for Corinella. I wish publicly to thank that gentleman for his action, whilst holding the portfolio of Minister of Defence, in coming to Tasmania at very considerable personal inconvenience, and settling a very serious difficulty there. The Hobart Artillery Corps, it will be remembered, had been treated with very scant consideration indeed by Major-General Hutton. I have never contended that its members did not commit an error of judgment, but I claim that for the late Commandant of the Military Force to sweep out of existence, with one stroke of the pen, a corps whose record had been of the most exemplary character, and some of whose members were due for their long service medals - men who had served for years without receiving one copper from the State, and who had been compelled to purchase their own ammunition - was a great mistake. The Treasurer is aware that I took a very considerable interest in that trouble, and endeavoured to get it settled. The present Postmaster-General, when Minister of Defence in the previous Deakin Administration, said that if an opportunity offered during the recess he would visit Tasmania in order to discuss the matter. His Government, however, went out of. office before Parliament was prorogued, and he was unable to carry out his proposal. His successor, the honorable and learned member for Corinella, visited Hobart, and, as Minister of Defence, received a deputation from the non-commissioned officers and men. The honorable and learned member spent nearly two hours in discussing the matter with them, and as the result of the interview a basis of agreement was arrived at, upon which the whole of the men consented to go back as a complete corps. The Minister promised that if that were done arrangements would be made as soon as the House met for the reinstatement of the corps. I believe from the statements made yesterday by the Treasurer and the honorable and learned member for Corinella that a small reduction is being made in the defence vote for Tasmania by postponing the proposed increases until the1st January next. For the last five years we have suffered delay after delay in this way, and this has given rise to all the trouble that has taken place in connexion with the Defence Forces in Tasmania. I appeal to the Government to carry out the promise made by the late Minister of Defence when he visited Hobart'. It is true that he is unable to give effect to the pledge which he gave, but there is such a thing as inherited responsibility, and, in view of these promises, I hope that action will immediately be taken. I actually took to the men a promise in writing from the present Postmaster-General when he was Minister of Defence, and I urge the Government not to upset the arrangements that have been made. </para>

                        <para>- I do not. I listened with great pleasure to the speech delivered yesterday by the honorable and: learned member for Corinella - a speech which, in my judgment, is one of the ablest on the subject that I have ever heard. I am one of those who have always held that our defence system is on a wrong basis. The whole of the revenue of Australia is insufficient to give us an adequate military force on the lines now being followed. I strongly advocate a system under which every child attending our State and private schools would be compelled to learn the rudiments of drill, and taught also how to handle a rifle. I would compel every young man to undergo a certain number of military drills, and to go into camp from time to time for that purpose. </para>

                <para>Mr.McWilliams.-I do; but I should treat rich and poor alike. No distinction whatever should be made. It is only in this way that we shall be. able to secure a defence force capable of defending Australia when the pinch comes. The mere handful of men that we can maintain on the present terms would be insufficient to enable us to hold our own against even a third-rate power, if we lost the protection of the British Navy. I have always thought that in the matter of defence we have sponged on the mother country. Great Britain pays about , £35.000,000 per annum for the maintenance of her Navy, and towards that expenditure Australia contributes only , £200,000per annum. I would prefer to see portion of the sum which we are now expending on militarism devoted to an increased subsidy to the Imperial Navy -which is, after all, our chief protection- and would spend the balance of the Defence vote on a purely citizen force. We should then be able to devote the rest of the money that we now expend on our defences to the work of developing Australia on truly progressive lines - to the settlement of the people on the land, rather than to the training of them in military- encampments. I thank the House for the consideration which it has extended to me, and must apologize for having spoken at such length. I can assure honorable members that it has been from no desire to unduly prolong the debate that I have occupied their attention so long, but because I believe that our present fiscal system is striking a serious blow at what must be for many years to come one of the most important industries of the Commonwealth - the fruit-growing industry of Victoria and Tasmania. </para>

The labour of the native population would surely be available if called upon; but capital and enterprise are required for the opening up of the country.

                        <para>- I have never had an opportunity. If I ever had the chance I would declare a clear and definite policy, with no humbug about it, so that every one would know what I meant.. The Ministry, no doubt, are acting in accordance with their lights ; but the Treasurer, instead of telling us what their intentions are, says, when asked for any information, " Refer to the Budget papers," or he tells us that the Minister of Defence, or someone else, knows all about the subject. From end to end of his speech he gave us no definite information. The Treasurer pointed out that where the State pains through the operation of the Federal Tariff, the people of that State have to pay, and that where the State loses they save; but the immediate effect of the Tariff has been to a large extent to crush out of existence the manufacturers of States like Tasmania and Queensland to the gain of the manufacturers of New South Wales and Victoria, and especially of the latter. The people of the States, however, have not benefited, because the duties have increased prices, and the increase has gone ' into the pockets of the manufacturers. The Treasurer has indicated that the Government intend to get rid of the sugar bounties in about another five years, but he has not said when a measure will be brought in to provide for their extension. </para>

                        <para>- I am_ against the sugar bounty, and all other bounties. New South Wales has done better out of the sugar bounty than Queensland has done, simply because the money has been a pure gift to the sugar growers of the former State. There were very few coloured people engaged in the New South Wales industry. But, although my State obtained an advantage, if I had my way I would remove the bounty altogether. Our production of sugar will probably equal our consumption at the end of the year. When we reach that stage we shall begin to export. In the ordinary course of things, the effect of that should be to reduce our price to the level of that of the world's market. But because we have a large sugar monopoly in the Commonwealth, that cannot happen. The price will still be kept at a high level, and we shall still be paying money out of the Treasury to make pur own sugar dear. I do not complain of dumping when people dump on us; but I do complain of dumping if we are to dump on other countries. I can quite understand honorable members opposite smiling at that remark, because they do not understand the question. To put our hands in our pockets and make our sugar <inline font-style="italic">£fi</inline> a ton dearer, in order to sell it at a cheaper rate outside, is, to my mind, a silly thing to do. That is the sort of dumping that I object to. The dumping that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chamberlain, Mr. Balfour,</inline> and other men, who are playing a game in Great Britain, object to is the system whereby America and Germany send steel and other products into Great Britain and sell them at lower prices than they charge to their own people. I do not object to men dumping in that way. If people choose to increase the price of goods to themselves in order to make them cheaper to us, I am prepared to take all they will give me on those terms. But I object to make the price of our sugar dearer, and to handicap our industries for the purpose of making it cheap to outside buyers. Why does the sugar monopoly exist? Because of the duty. Those who protest most about monopolies are the very men who create them. Take off duties, and let the competition of the world have free play, and these monopolies will gradually cease to exist. We have heard something about the increase in the price of sugar during the last year or two. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> was instrumental in bringing about that increase. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> induced the British Parliament to enter into an arrangement with various sugar producing countries that the bounties which those countries gave should cease to exist. What was the effect? Formerly England obtained her sugar cheaper than any other country in the world, and that gave her the command of the market in many industries that depend upon sugar. But immediately the bounties ceased to be paid in other countries, the price of England's sugar went up. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> was foolish enough to bring about that state of things. Honorable members jeer at the idea of that policy being the cause of the increase, but, as a matter of fact, it <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> quite correct. When the sugar bounties were first originated amongst European nations, the effect was to give cheap sugar to England, whilst increasing the price in the countries which gave the bounties. When the price of sugar commenced to go down in England, employment decreased in the sugar refineries; and the Committee, which was appointed to inquire into the matter, reported against any interference with the bounties and against the imposition of any countervailing duty, on the ground that the lower price had been of great benefit to the poor and to consumers of sugar generally. The confectionery, fruit-preserving, and other industries, the main raw material of which is sugar, advanced enormously, but, though employment was increased in this connexion, it, as I say, fell off in the sugar refineries. When the price of the raw material of an industry is increased, great injury is done, and no corresponding benefit is conferred. Sugar was grown in New South Wales with a small duty, and in Queensland practically without duty, because in the case of the latter State,' the export stage had been reached. Even then the price of sugar to manufacturers was not reduced ; because the Colonial Sugar Refining Company did what it is likely to do in the future, namely, exported the sugar and sold abroad at the world's price, whilst charging the world's price, plus the duty within the borders of the State. The Treasurer has made it clear that we are losing the duty, and that all the revenue from sugar is obtained in the way of excise, out of which the bonus has to be paid. To-day 185,000 tons of sugar costs the people of Australia £1,122,000 because of the duty. About £514,000 is received in excise, and about £93,000 from the duty, a total of £600,000 odd. There is a net return of £461,000, on an expenditure of £? .1,1 2 2, 000, .representing a loss of some £700,000 to the people at large. If the duty, the excise, and the bonus were abolished, some revenue would be lost, but the people would be £1,122,000 better off. It seems absurd that, in order to get . £461,000, we should present to the private producer a sum equal to £700,000. We pay a bonus of £3 or £4 per acre on the production of some of the richest lands in the Commonwealth; and I ask why should the wheat-growers, who toil from one end of the year to the other, not be placed in a similar advantageous position? On what moral ground can we give the bonus in one case and not in the other? Of course, I know that the idea is to get rid of coloured labour ; but, let the figures be manipulated as they may, the fact remains that the sugar grown by black labour is increasing as fast as that grown by white labour. </para>

                        <para>- If white men can do the work, why should any bonus be paid for employing them ? When sugar was produced in New South Wales with white labour, I thought it could similarly be produced in Queensland ; but when I ' visited the latter State two or three years ago. I was able to see what the conditions really were. I may be told that I know nothing whatever about the business, but I obtained permission to go through some plantations, and took steps to obtain the best information available. I went to the chairman of one of the sugar mills, and asked him to put me in the way of obtaining information with regard to his side of the question. I also called on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens,</inline> a recognised champion of a White Australia, and asked him to offer me similar facilities. Therefore, I acted with absolute fairness. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Givens</inline> furnished me with a typewritten document, setting forth his side of the case, and I proceeded to make inquiries. After I had completed my investigation I came to the conclusion that it was very difficult for white men to work in . the cane-fields of Northern Queensland. The intense heat in the cane-fields is most distressing to the men working there, more so than when they are engaged out in the open in railway work or upon gold-fields. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know. I visited the cane-fields in May, which is not a hot month ; but I obtained my information regarding the heat from those who had experienced it. I do not deny that some men can work in the cane-fields ; but even to the best of men the work must be most exhausting. At the time I was there a contract had been let by the Mulgrave mills to a number of white men to load and unload wood. That would not be very hard work, even in a very hot climate, and yet the white men failed to carry out their contract, and black men had to be engaged to do the work. I went to Northern Queensland with an impression that the work in the canefields could, as in New South Wales, be carried on with white labour; but it was represented to me that the conditions were very different. One planter said to me - "' Here .we have a vertical sun for six weeks, whereas from Rockhampton southwards you always look to the north for the sun. In these regions the vertical sun beams down into the cane-fields, and makes it very oppressive for those who are working there." That, of course, is a matter of which I had not known anything previously. </para>

                        <para>- It has been stated that trashing is necessary, and the contrary assertion has. been made. Strange as it may seem, both statements are true. In some districts trashing is not necessary, whereas in others it is essential. In the Burdekin district the planters say that they do not need to trash, because that operation injures rather than benefits the cane. It was explained to me, however, that the heavy rainfall in the Cairns district renders trashing necessary, because otherwise the moisture is retained by the trash, and. injury is done to the cane. In the Burdekin district, where sugar-growing is carried on by means of irrigation, and the rainfall is comparatively light, trashing is not favoured. I found that the general opinion was that white men could not stand the work in the cane-fields. That opinion was shared by many persons who were in favour of a White Australia, I found that the view was strongly held that the - sugar industry could not be successfully carried on in Northern Queensland by means of white labour. At about the time that the greatest amount of work has to be performed in the cane-fields, the pastoral and other 'industries are in full swings and white men will not cut or trash cane if they can secure other employment. Therefore, there is no possible chance of obtaining the necessary number of men. Last session a planter came down to me, with a letter of introduction from a son I have in Townsville. He came to get my views as to whether the sugar bounties would be continued. I told him that if I had control of the matter they would not; but that it appeared to me that the Parliament would be willing to continue them. In the course of a conversation, I asked him if he believed that sugar Could be grown with white labour in North Queensland. He said "yes." I then said, "Have you registered your plantation as one on which sugar 'is to be grown with white labour?" and he said he had. </para>
