                    <para>- I have every reason to expect that the course of consulting the Australian Government in regard to any arrangement about the New Hebrides will be followed by the Imperial Government. The negotiations in regard to the appointment of the New Hebrides Land Commission have been inordinately prolonged, but inquiry has not shown that any actual progress has been made towards the launching of &#34;that Commission, for which we have been looking so long. The proposals of the French Committee on foreign and colonial relations contain no novel element. They call attention once more to the fact that a considerable sum of money is being annually expended out of the State funds of the Republic of France for the benefit of the settlers in the New Hebrides. </para>

                        <para>- An arrangement has been imminent for the last eighteen months, or, at any rate, since the date of the treaty, or whatever may be the proper term for the friendly agreement between Great Britain and France. One of the articles of that agreement was that an arrangement should be arrived at with regard to the New Hebrides, but I have not been able to discover, as yet, that any definite step has been taken towards completing that arrangement. The hope that it will be settled at an early date appears to be optimistic, but I am watching the proceedings very closely. </para>

                            <para>- I admire the Prime Minister for one thing, the shortness of his policy speech, because it looks like business. I commend it on that account to the members of the party who sit below the gangway on the Ministerial side of the Chamber. I also applaud the remarks of the Attorney-General as to the need for getting on with the business of the session. The nine or ten months of last session were about the most useless and indolent that I have ever spent. We came from our homes and our businesses to transact the affairs of the country, and we did nothing. Therefore it is about time that we proceeded with business. But we, who arc members of the Opposition, have a duty to perform. </para>

I was returned to this House as an opponent of the Deakin . Administrator&#93;, and secondly, to oppose the aims and work of the Trades Hall, Labour, or Socialistic Party. Now that I see on the Ministerial side of the Chamber the Deakin and Labour parties linked together- </para>

The honorable and learned member for Parkes last night deprecated the use of the <inline font-style="italic">post-mortem</inline> in politics. According to his application of the metaphor, a <inline font-style="italic">postmortem</inline> could be made only on the body of the leader of the Opposition, because it is he who is dead, and no good purpose could be served by criticising him in any way. </para>

                            <para>- I refer, of course, only to his political death as leader of a Government. In pathology one learns more at the <inline font-style="italic">post-mortem</inline> table in some months than from years of observation of living subjects in the wards of a hospital ; but there is another method equally useful for obtaining knowledge of the human constitution, and that is by vivisection. I propose to apply that method of examination to the new Administration. Vivisection is carried on, sometimes with an anaesthetic, and sometimes without one. Some honorable members may prefer to use the anaesthetic, as being the more humane method, while others may think that more is to be learned by conducting the operation without an anaesthetic. Every one to his taste. I am one of the more merciful kind, and will examine the Government and their policy and methods with an anaesthetic. I think that in all the States Constitution Acts it is provided that, if members take an office of profit under the Crown, they must immediately offer themselves again to their constituencies, and thus obtain the opinion of the people upon their action, and upon the new Administration which is to be formed. It was deemed necessary to omit such a provision from the Federal Constitution, and no doubt its adoption would have created many grave difficulties ; but there are times when one may question the wisdom of omitting such a provision, and I think that this is one of them. The Leader of the late Government, after his defeat, asked the representative of the Crown to send the members of this House to their constituents to obtain the opinion of the country on the situation ; but the Governor-General deemed it desirable to allow the House to go on under the new conditions. The leader of each party had in turn attempted to carry on business and had failed. When this Parliament first met, the honorable and learned member for Ballarat was at the head of an Administration, which was put out of office by the leader of the Labour Party, who, after having taken up the reins of office. </para>

In every State the feeling against the head of the Government is very strong. </para>

He may not realize, to the same extent that some of us do, the seriousness of the position that is created when an honorable member, who has been regarded as inspired by the highest ideals of honour, acts in such a way as to forfeit public respect, and shatter the faith that was formerly reposed in him. </para>

                            <para>- I would not say that, because some Ministers were perfectly consistent in so far as they supported the Labour Party throughout last session. We have nothing to say against them, but I think we have a right to direct the strongest criticism against the action of others. When the fate of the Watson Ministry was hanging in the balance last session the members of the Labour Party, notably the honorable member for Gwydir and the honorable member for Southern Melbourne, clamoured for a dissolution. What do we find now? The desire for a dissolution has gone. Yet the circumstances to-day are almost identical with those which obtained at the end of last session. Honorable members now sitting on this side of the House had no desire for a dissolution, but the conditions became intolerable, and they expressed their willingness to go to (he country. The members of the Labour Party immediately changed their tune, and evinced, a sudden dislike for an appeal to the people. What was the reason? Was it because there were very serious dissensions in the ranks of their party outside the House? Is it not a fact that many matters connected with the Trades Hall Party in Victoria require to be adjusted ? Do not the circumstances connected with a recent election in East Melbourne need to be thoroughly sifted, and is there not a great deal of dissatisfaction amongst the members of the Trades Hall Party in relation to matters connected with the management of the <inline font-style="italic">Tocsin</inline> and the payment of the workers on that paper? </para>

                            <para>- Not to the satisfaction of all parties. Turning to New South Wales, we find that .there is very considerable dissension in the ranks of labour, and that large bodies of unionists are withdrawing from the central organization. These and other matters throw considerable light upon the sudden dislike which members of the Labour Party have conceived for a dissolution. Then there is the question of stamping goods made by union labour, which will, no doubt, be discussed when the Trades Marks Bill is under consideration. I would also point to the fact that the honorable member for Yarra has had to make an emphatic protest against a charge that he was dealing with a non-union baker. The honorable member said1 that there was no truth in the statement. </para>

                            <para>- There is no question of sweating involved. The baker with whom I deal is kept under control by the Factories and Shops Act. The opinion of the people of Australia with regard to the Prime Minister has undergone a complete change, and instead of his standing upon the highest pinnacle of their regard, he has now sunk to the lowest depths of their contempt. He is now in office, but not in power, because he is entirely dependent upon the Labour Party - a party which he has frequently denounced. It is true that he has been just as often and as violently denounced by the Labour Party, who are now supporting a man in whom they have declared that they have no confidence. We have had read to us quotations from articles which have appeared in newspapers published in Queensland and New South Wales, and we know the opinion that is entertained in Western Australia regarding the Prime Minister. I now propose to quote from an article published in the Labour newspaper in Adelaide, the <inline font-style="italic">Herald.</inline> of 8th July last. In an article headed &#34; The Champion Betrayer,&#34; the Prime Minister is criticised as follows : - </para>

What we require for the good of Australia is a restoration of the two-party system of Government, and the chance of bringing this about has been improved by the action of the Prime Minister and his colleagues. All those honorable members who sit on the Ministerial side of the House stand for Socialism and socialistic aims and methods, whilst those who are on this side of the Chamber are opposed to all such principles and objects. </para>

                            <para>- With honorable members upon this side, it is a question of Australian liberalism, and of sound business principles. For my own part I should like to see the very earliest opportunity taken to allow the electors to decide this question by resolving the three parties in the present Parliament into two. When that question is submitted to the people, the Deakinites must be voted for as Socialists, and honorable members upon this side of the House should be regarded as straight-out opponents of Socialism. There can be no cross-bred business about the matter. The electors must be taught to view it in that way - they must either vote for one side or the other. Personally I should much prefer to see two parties in the House divided upon those lines, rather than that there should be any cross-bred members, who are neither one thing nor the other. What we require, in order to carry out the spirit of the speech delivered by the Prime Minister before the Australian Natives&#39; Association,) is the disappearance of the Deakin party from the Federal political horizon. </para>

This ship is laden with a non-combustible cargo above the Plimsoll mark and carries no passengers, for the reason that she is not able to command their confidence. </para>

                            <para>- No, I can assure the honorable member that I have occupied only a few days. But whatever time may have been occupied in its preparation &#93; have at any rate produced something, while the honorable member has not produced anything. The captain, the leader &#34;of a great cause, has courted shipwreck, at the beginning of the voyage, by turning turtle on all his previous records, sacrificing his reputation and the cohesion of his most trusted followers. From being the most trusted of all leaders he has fallen to be the least worthy of confidence in this House, and throughout Australia even his written pledge would be treated with grave suspicion. I wish to direct special attention to the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of this vessel. The pilot is the honorable member for Bland. The captain is the Prime Minister, who had his certificate suspended by that pilot in April, 1904, but who has been allowed to resume under suspicion, and with a special pilot in all troublesome waters. The chief engineer is a large and important man in this ship. He is . represented by &#39; the Minister of Trade and Customs. He was appointed to that position because he is said to be a great man in subterranean waters. Next to him comes the Postmaster-General, who is declared to be a worthy second of his chief on account of his special peculiarities; he has been appointed to the vessel as comptroller of submarines. The third engineer is the Vice-President of the Executive Council. He has been engaged because of his entertaining qualities, and because it is necessary to have a comical man in such a comica crew. By virtue of his previous performances he has been named &#34;Peritonitis.&#34; and he has been appointed to the position of third engineer in order that he may look after the chief engineer. Being a man connected with agricultural industries he holds another appointment, in that he is supposed to groom the family mule. </para>

                            <para>- That matter has not yet been disclosed, inasmuch as the Navigation Bill has not been passed. The chief officer of this vessel is the Attorney-General, the honorable and learned member for Indi. Of him it is said that upon one occasion he nearly obtained his master&#39;s certificate, but not quite. He was dismissed from a previous Administration under a cloud. The second mate upon the bridge is the Minister of Home Affairs. He is alleged to be able to rebuild the bridge, if necessary. The purser - the representative of the capitalistic class - is the Treasurer, an ex-Emperor, and a man who is never happy unless he occupies some official position. Honorable members have doubtless heard of the dirt-eating disease which obtains in Northern Queensland. Of that it is said that when once people have contracted it they can never be prevented from eating dirt. The right honorable member for Swan is a remarkable instance of a man who seemed for a time to have entirely recovered from that disease, but who has unfortunately&#39; suffered a serious relapse. I hold in my hand a copy of the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> of the 5th April of the present year. That newspaper was published just after the visit of honorable members of this House to the Western State, and just prior to the visit of the Prime Minister and the present Postmaster-General. Upon that occasion the Treasurer said - </para>

                        <para>No one in Australia can say that we are not drifting. We are drifting. We are looking about to see what we cun do, and no one seems to know what to do. . . . There is no doubt about this - we have been coerced by a minority which looks big, and which most people are afraid of, but which is not so big after all. It only wants to be properly tackled. </para>

                    <para>Upon that occasion the right honorable member was speaking of the Labour Party, and his remarks remind me irresistibly of the story in reference to the big oyster. It merely required to be &#34;properly tackled,&#34; and just&#39; as the man tackled the big oyster and it disappeared, so the right honorable member for Swan has tackled the Labour Party. Either he has taken it on board, or it has taken him. I am inclined to the latter view. Coming to the other members of this remarkable crew, I find that the bo&#39;sun is the Minister of Defence in another place, who is a veritable Tom Bowling. The bo&#39;sun&#39;s mate is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keating,</inline> who is taking his first voyage as <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> petty officer. The chief steward is the honorable member for Bourke. He is said to keep the captain well-informed as to the condition of the ship&#39;s stores. There are other officers upon this vessel, because it is the ship of State, and one who has been specially appointed to a new post is the captain of the horse marines. </para>

                            <para>- We have not yet come to the dead marines. To the position of captain of the horse marines the honorable and learned member for Corio has been appointed as a reward for past services, and because upon one occasion he slew a horse, and is said to be a great authority upon frontal attacks in the absence of the enemy. He further objects to consecrating the flag <inline font-style="italic">a la mode.</inline> Then we have Surgeon Salmon - I mean the honorable member for Laanecoorie. The position of chief harbourmaster is occupied by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, who, after safely guiding his vessel into the harbor, according to his lights, was rewarded by an offer of a seat upon the lookout - an offer which he scornfully declined, because having been trained as an engineer, he felt that he was entitled to a seat in the engine-room, and to no less. Most of the crew are alleged to be seriously disaffected and inclined to mutiny. In this connexion I specially refer to the honorable member for Bass, the honorable member for Moira, the honorable and learned member for Bendigo, the honorable member for Mernda, and the honorable member for Riverina. During the early stages of the voyage, several late members of the crew were lost overboard - some think as the result of oversight on the part of the captain, but others - and they are the more numerous- have hinted treachery on his part. This steam-ship would be of no value in the absence of stokers, and their places have been filled by the members of the Labour &#39; Party. Obviously, the vessel must have stokers and coal trimmers. They are engaged for this voyage only, to try the effect upon white men of a passage through the Red Sea in August; but rumour hath it that they have no confidence whatever in the captain, and refused to sail under him unless he put himself for the whole voyage under the eye of a good pilot, and submitted to them for approval the names of all officers and a full manifest of the cargo. Not only is this pilot to be in charge for the whole voyage, but another condition to the engagement of the Labour Party to serve in the stokehold - amongst the coal - was that they should select the chief engineer and chief officer. This is the Ministry that asks for the confidence of the people of Australia- a Ministry that was conceived in shame, brought forth in treachery, and which lives by politically prostituting itself. </para>

                            <para>- I shall begin by answering a question which the Prime Minister repeatedly put to the honorable member who has just resumed his seat, and which, if I remember rightly, was whether he was to be expected to vote for a dissolution in which he did not believe. The answer is to be found in the last Ballarat speech, delivered by the honorable and learned gentleman. After castigating the leader of the Opposition for daring to say anything about a possible dissolution, he went on to say upon the occasion in question - </para>

                        <para>It seemed to me even if attention had not been directed to it in this express fashion, that none of us could have failed to realize that the dissolution upon which he has dwelt is coming very close. </para>
                        <para class="block">Thus Ave find that the Prime Minister himself, a week or two ago, declared that a dissolution was imminent. His taunt, today, therefore is a perfectly idle one. He himself declared but a week or two since that this House was unworkable, and that a dissolution was at hand. </para>

                                <para>- I admit that we have been supplied with some very subtle refinements of what the honorable and learned gentleman said, and now we have another edition. Last night we listened to a speech delivered by the Attorney-General in the most grandiose tones conceivable,, in which he solemnly asked this House, in the name of the country, to attend. to the country&#39;s business. I interjected at the time that he, of all honorable members, had no right to speak in the name of Australia at the present moment. I repeat that statement now. The Government, including the Attorney-General, have not the confidence of the country, nor of this House. They are living on sufferance - upon terms which no self-respecting Government would accept for one moment - and through their capacity for dirt-eating. Afflicted as they are with that South African disease to which the honorable member who has just resumed his seat has alluded, they are remaining in office without power, and attempting to govern a country whose highest interests they have outraged time and again. </para>

                                <para>- The Attorney-General spoke last night of this debate as an airing of personal grievances. I ha.ve not heard a personal note obtruded,, and I think that the less that honorable and learned gentleman says about personalities in the present instance, the better it will be for the Government, and for those who are supporting them. So far the debate has been an impersonal one, unless indeed one is said to be indulging in personalities when one quotes the honest opinion which one honorable member expresses respecting another. If any personalities have been introduced into this debate, they have consisted mostly of quotations of the opinions of Ministers on Ministers, and of the opinions of the people outside, whom the Government say they represent, concerning the present Administration. </para>

                                <para>- The concluding phrases uttered&#39; by the honorable member&#39; for Corangamite were similar both in tone and severity to hundreds of others that are being made by newspapers all over Australia at the present moment. For instance, some five years ago, when the Federation was being launched, the then Prime Minister of Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, accompanied by the present leader of the Government, journeyed to West Maitland to deliver a <inline font-style="italic">pronunciamento</inline> to the people of Australia, in which everything appertaining to a rarer atmosphere was attributed to the Federal Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton spoke of prosperity, peace, prestige, and power, and at this time the Government of which he was the leader had no stronger backer than the newspaper from which I am about to quote. I propose to read an extract not from any of the labour journals of the continent, but from the <inline font-style="italic">Maitland. Mercury,</inline> which at that time strongly supported the Government of which the present Prime Minister was a member, and declared them to be men of high principle, abounding in political honour. A few years have passed, and here is what that journal has to say of the present Prime Minister - </para>

                        <para class="block">I commend these statements to the Government as the sentiments of a newspaper which was at one time a firm supporter of a Ministry to which several members of the present Administration belonged. It has no sectional aims or interests to serve, and is not seeking to aggrandize itself by abusing any other party, or by breaking up another coalition. This is what a journal that at one time gave members of the Government credit for high principle, and for possessing every attribute of political honour, with a genuine desire to advance the interests of the Commonwealth, now records, as its deliberative judgment of the present Prime Minister. What the honorable member for Corangamite has said is as nought when compared with this trenchant criticism by one of the Government&#39;s erstwhile organs. The Attorney-General last night went on to say that the Prime Minister&#39;s character was beyond the criticism of the leader of the Opposition. That may be so; but it is very singular that, although various charges have been launched against the leader of the Government, no honorable member seems to be disposed to rise in his defence, and least of all, those who have been interjecting most incessantly in reply to everything that has been said on this side of the House. Is it not a singular feature of the circumstances in which the Ministry at present exist, that although the Labour Party are keeping the Government in power, to use them, as they unblushingly admit, not one of them either inside or outside the Chamber has ever had a good word to say of the Prime Minister? </para>

The members of the Labour Party while in this Chamber, seem to be very cordial in their relations with the Government; but when they go forth to address the electors of Australia they are suddenly seized with a very different spasm.

                        <para class="block">I venture to say that this is the opinion of the party now sitting in the Ministerial corner regarding the Government. The Ministry are existing as a Government to be used by the Labour Party, which has not one word to say in defence of them. In these circumstances I hold that the Attorney-General had better busy himself in answering such criticisms as those to which I have referred rather than in replying in tones of assumed indignation to any remarks that may be offered from the Opposition. The point of our criticism has been barbed all through with quotations from the utterances of those who are sitting in the Ministerial corner ; the greatest and severest condemnation of the Government has come from the party with whom they now profess to be so closely in league. The Attorney-General last night made a statement to which I desire to call special attention. In speaking of the reasons that had induced the Government to dislodge the late Ministry, he used this expression - </para>

Is it the opinion of the Postmaster-General, or the Treasurer, who, only a little while ago, were the most cordial supporters that the present leader of the Opposition had? The ink is hardly dry on the page which recorded the speeches made by the Vice-President of the Executive Council during his tour of the Richmond electorate, in which he professed the greatest contempt for every one who was opposed to the right honorable member for East Sydney. Is he now in this combine to preserve the State from the danger of Reidism? If the statement of the Attorney-General is true, if it contains a correct summing up of the position of affairs on the Ministerial side of the Chamber, if he has rightly outlined the bond of agreement between members there, those members must be written down as political tricksters of the first water, as Nihilists who go into and out of the house of a man with daggers hidden beneath their garments, to despatch him on the first convenient occasion. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable and learned member for Indi last night appealed to us to get on with the business of the country. What is primarily the business of the country? The most important business of Australia at the present moment is the preservation of the integrity and reputation of its Government. All these things that are spoken of as programmes are trumpery in comparison with the reputation of the Commonwealth. It is because there appears to be no prospect of the improvement of the reputation of Australia from the reign and rule of the present Government that we should be justified in trying to terminate the existence of this Parliament at the earliest moment. </para>

                                <para>- During a certain journey from Sydney we had the greatest difficulty in getting to our virtuous couches in the train, because of the kindly attentions of the honorable gentleman. He perambulated the corridor of the oar like a kindly spirit let loose in this mundane sphere. We see him to-day wreathed in smiles, whereas before the change of Government we could not get anything out of him but a grunt. I said at a public meeting the other day that if he remained out of office very much longer he would drop dead of apoplexy, brought about by his feeling in regard to the leader of the Opposition ; but I am , glad, for his health&#39;s sake, that he now seems disposed to bury the past, and lives under happier conditions. What is the first business of this Parliament, if it is not to look after the credit and reputation of Australia? Are we in a fair way to maintain our reputation abroad, or to increase the small reputation which we have, by these constant changes of Government, and by keeping in office a Ministry which is absolutely without power, and is prostituting every constitutional principle by which we should be guided ? I venture to say that the Government is smashing up our credit in the London market by every act it has done since it took office. In the markets of the world they take for their standard in politics the high constitutionalism of the Mother country, and when we see what is going on here we may well fear for the reputation of Australia. If our reputation in the markets of the world goes, Government programmes will not restore it. Therefore it is our chief and primary obligation to see that the reputation of Australia is not besmirched by any Government, or by any set of parties, or politicians. The honorable and learned member for Parkes last night had something to say on this matter. He, too, urged that we should get on with the business of the country, and he pointed out - none can do it better than he when in the mood - how our reputation abroad depends on our conduct of affairs, and does not depend merely upon seasons, as some honorable members interjected that it did. A country may have the best of seasons, and be abundantly prosperous, and yet its credit may be at zero, and its reputation almost annihilated. The South American republics form a case in point. They are the most prosperous countries in the world to-day from the mere material point of view, and yet their reputation is the lowest in the markets of the world. These facts were pointed out last night by the honorable and learned member for Parkes, and he also pointed out that this Government, to whom he said he would give a steady support, has done the very thing which would contribute to the undoing of our credit and national reputation. In reply to the taunt that we are unwilling to get on with the business of the country, I say that we are considering the most important business of the country when we are concerned as to how best to maintain the reputation of this Parliament and our financial credit in the great countries of the world. The honorable and learned member for Indi, too,, seems to have been suddenly seized with a spasmodic desire to carry on parliamentary work. We all know how industriously he labours in the other relations of his life; but only a few months ago he used to enter this Chamber, and beam upon the obstructionists who were spending hour after hour in the avowed intention of preventing the transaction of business. He came here only when the opposition to the progress of business seemed to be. lagging, and set it going again with some trumpery proposal regarding the reduction of expenditure by1s. If there is one man in the House who has deliberately contributed to the obstruction of parliamentary business, he is the present Attorney-General. </para>

That, I think, remains the only achievement of their four months&#39; occupancy of the Treasury benches. The Prime Minister, in declaring the Government policy, used these words - </para>

                                <para>- I promise Ministers that they will gain nothing by this contemptuous and insulting treatment. Not only is the Ministerial party not the same as it was previously, but I venture to say that the Prime Minister himself looms up upon the political horizon of Australia very differently from what he did twelve months ago. The same thing has happened to the Prime Minister to-day that occurred to another illustrious man who is no longer in this House. The Prime Minister has scintillated all over the political sky for years past, and has been careful to detach himself from anything that would involve him in obloquy. The parallel between himself and his erstwhile leader is complete. The first Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, when in New South Wales, could never be induced to enter the hurly burly of politics. He devoted his attention almost entirely to addressing academic societies on the subject of Federation. The Prime Minister has done the same thing in Victoria. He has shouldered none of the harder responsibilities of office, and has practically occupied the position of a propagandist. Now, however, we have got him down here with the responsibilities of office upon him, and I venture to say that in his case, as in the other to which I have just referred, the people of Australia me beginning to find that the feet of their god are of clay. We have an exhibition of the material side of his make-up in the tactics which he is pursuing at this moment. The Deakin party is not the same by a long way. The Prime Minister went on to 9\ - </para>

                                <para>- Bound together by no common tie, with mutual antagonism separating them &#34; as far as the East is from the West,&#34; they yet sit cheek by jowl in a conspiracy of silence. There has never been a more humiliating spectacle. The Government has no right on the Treasury benches. It does not possess the confidence of the House or the country. All parties and all leagues condemn the Prime Minister - not one has spoken in his favour. He is kept in office in order that use may be made of him. The delegates at the Inter- State Labour Conference had no word to say of the Prime Minister except in condemnation. How could they have expressed confidence in a man who in a short twelvemonth has made a complete circuit of the political heavens, who has been the main instrument in turning out three Governments, and who has essayed to carry on a fourth Government under conditions which he has already declared to be intolerable? He told honorable members immediately after the last general elections that this was an impossible Parliament. What has made it possible to-day ? He was driven from office, disgusted and angry, by his present allies. What has since improved the prospects of going on with the business of the country? He is trying to operate a Parliament which, upon all the platforms of the country, he has declared to be unworkable. He has objected to the three-party system of Government, and yet he has taken steps to accentuate the revival of conditions which he has condemned. He has denounced the caucus in unmeasured terms, and yet he now submits his policy for its approval. He takes his political bread to be passed through the caucus mould. Everything that was wrong twelve months ago appears right to-day. I venture to say that the honorable and learned member, on his own showing, has violated every sound principle of constitutional procedure. He has done his best to establish the principle of minority rule throughout the length and breadth of Australia. He can exist only by maintaining an attitude of abject servility. He is eating the political leek every day of his life. He has been at this game a long time - he says so himself. In the speech which he delivered some time ago he spoke of having made repeated efforts to enter into an alliance with the Labour Party. He said that he wanted them to be the left wing of his party. He has always been intriguing with the honorable member for Bland. Therefore, what he is doing now merely represents a reversion to the political type which is becoming fixed in his own personality and political notions. He is going back to the position in which he formerly stood. This is no new phase of his character. He adopted reformative methods for a few months, but the principle which operates all through nature, and tends to make everything revert to its type, is operating in this instance, and he is now back again, trying to bring himself into closer alliance with the caucus party. The Labour Party are not going to enter into any alliance. They dare not - their masters have said they must not, and the masters in their case are supreme. It has been declared that at the end of this Parliament all relations between the Prime Minister and the Labour Party must cease. If I had been in the place of the Prime Minister I should have handed my resignation to the Governor-General the moment that declaration was made. Any man with ordinary self-respect would decline to be used as the Labour Party propose to use the Prime Minister. </para>

                                <para>- If the Prime Minister is to be opposed by a Labour candidate at the next election, it would be fitting that the selection of the Labour Party should fall upon <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mann,</inline> who, now that he is out of the pay and control of the Labour Party in Australia, is turning round and denouncing them as dead slow people, in whom he can see no virtue. He has also taken to advocating physical violence in place of more reasonable methods. It is very strange that this apostle of physical violence should have been unanimously invited to take a seat beside the president at the Inter-State Labour Conference, at which a majority of the members of the Labour Party were present. Consequently it would seem that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Tom</inline> Mann was just the proper person to send to Ballarat, because he would have ho scruples whatever in denouncing either the part\, with which he has been associated so intimately. or the present Prime Minister. Indeed, he would be a fit and worthy opponent to try conclusions with the latter at the next election. The honorable and learned member for Ballarat appealed to .the Labour Party, almost pathetically, to relax their methods of operation. He said, in effect. &#34; Make your control mors reasonable. It is perfectly true that I was prepared to ally myself with your Party, and that I have often suggested an honorable alliance. At such times, however, I have always said, &#39; Make your machine such that those who stand by you shall be treated in every respect upon an equal footing with those who subscribe to the Labour platform.&#34; The honorable and learned member obtained an answer to his &#34;proposal from the recent InterState Labour Conference. That body declared, first, that it would not permit any alliance to be made with the honorable and learned gentleman. It then went on to say that instead of making its methods of control more reasonable and lax, it would tighten its control over honorable members of the Labour Party. One of the first things which it did .was to declare that whenever a Labour Government came into power, its members should be elected by the caucus. What is the difference in principle between the caucus selecting the members, to operate a platform, and the caucus selecting the platform, and telling honorable members outside what they must do in regard to it? That is precisely what  has happened in this case. The honorable and learned member for Ballarat submitted his programme to the Labour caucus. That body said, .in effect, &#34; Yes, go on with it, but remember that our alliance is only for a term of twelve months. If it seems to be in the interests of Labour at the next election, we must fight you. We cannot treat you on terms of equality.&#34; Yet the Prime&#39; Minister is now facing the very position of affairs which he so trenchantly denounced. I predict that after his helping the Labour Party in every possible way, its members will turn round and rend him. </para>

                                <para>- Last night the honorable member for Bland made a short speech to which I wish to make one or two references. He justified his temporary alliance with the present Government bv declaring that there was an exact parallel between the position which the Reid Government in New South Wales occupied some years ago in relation to the late leader of the Opposition, and the support which the Labour Party is at present affording the Prime Minister. I wish to say that there is no parallel between the two&#39; positions. The present Government, possesses only about half the numerical strength of the Labour Party, whereas the Reid Government in New South Wales were three times as strong as that party. They had no option but to support us. Their only alternative was to support the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Dibbs and the present Minister of Trade and Customs, who had declared upon the public platform that he would repeal the Payment of Members Act- </para>

                                <para>- I am merely pointing out that at that time the Labour Party had no option but to support the Government led by the right honorable member for East Sydney. Their only alternative was to turn him out of office, and to put in a gentleman whose name at that time stood for all that spelt Conservatism, including the repeal of payment of members. That matter has to be remembered in connexion with the action of the present Minister of Trade and Customs. Great democrat that he is, he is now sitting with the Labour Party cheek by jowl, and he believes in State Socialism. He alleges that he has always been a democrat. My experience of him is that he suddenly became a democrat when he saw a chance of dispossessing the right honorable member for East Sydney in New South Wales. Before he was permitted to dispossess the present leader of the Opposition, the honorable member for Hume had to submit his programme to the Labour caucus. He set out in writing, and forwarded to the secretary of the Labour Party in New South Wales, a communication in which he offered to undertake certain things if that party would assist him to dispossess the right honorable member for East Sydney. </para>

To all of those requests, a categorical &#34; Yes &#34; was given. These are the terms upon which the honorable member became Premier of New South Wales. </para>

                                <para>- I can assure honorable members that the facts are as I have asserted. My statement can be proved by reference to the public prints of Sydney, and to the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of New South Wales. I. say, therefore, that the present Government is following the precedent which was laid down by the Minister of Trade and Customs. I do not quarrel with the honorable member. I think that he stands upon velvet over this business. Last night one could not help noticing his chuckle. His face was wreathed in smiles at every reference which was made to his two colleagues. Every barbed arrow which was shot at them caused his countenance to be suffused with smiles. Last night was a positive triumph for him, and I congratulate him upon his most astute course of action. Now, for what purpose has all this been done? Why has this lightning change been made, and why have these conflicting elements converged in the present Government? With his usual bluntness; the honorable gentleman last night declared that protection had been in danger, but was not so now. </para>

                                <para>- A great many quotations have been made from various labour journals in the Commonwealth which I can only describe as a mass of journalistic filth. The single reason for quoting them has been to show that after all the efforts of the Prime Minister to resurrect responsible government, and to abolish the three parties which exist in this House, the Ministry have had to mount a pedestal erected upon a mound of journalistic filth. It is set on that pedestal, and the only cement that can hold it together is that to which I have just alluded. It is for this reason alone that these statements are being quoted to the. House. We quote them, not because we subscribe to them, for they are altogether too strong; but to show the vomit that the Government will eat in order to retain their present position of power and irresponsibility. We are told that all this is being done in the interests of protection. I make this prediction, and make it with the greatest confidence, that whatever further protection is possible under the present Administration was possible under the late Ministry, and that whatever form of protection was not possible under the late coalition conditions is not possible in the present situation. The protectionists of Australia who support the Government in the delusive belief that further protection is now possible, will find that my statement is correct. It must be so for very sufficient reasons. First of all, the electors themselves at the last general election declared against any further tinkering with the Tariff, and fiscal peace was the basis on which this Parliament was elected. Then we know that the Inter-State Labour Conference has emphasized that verdict of the electors, and has declared that the fiscal question must not be raised in the Parliament of Australia. The Prime Minister said to the Labour Party &#34; Put protection in your programme if you want our support.&#34; The answer given to him clearly and unmistakably is &#34;No protection, but a fiscal referendum.&#34; And until a referendum is taken, no action of any kind having relation to fiscal matters is to be permitted in this House. That is the mandate of the masters of the Government; so that whatever action may have been supposed to be in the interests of protection is no longer so. It has been decreed impossible by the masters of the Ministry outside. If the Prime Minister had any self-respect - and I venture to say that he has not much left - he would not tolerate such a position of affairs. I do not wonder at the honorable and learned gentleman evincing irritability and nervousness. If ever a man was in a political mess he certainly is, as he will discover before he has proceeded much further under the conditions on which he holds office. The whip will be applied to him constantly from the Ministerial corner. If he were driven from office angry and disgusted before, he will find himself whipped with scorpions next time, because he can- no longer expect to rush into the arms of others in order to free himself from the control of the Labour Party. The next appeal open to him can be only to the electors, and the sooner it is made the better for the country. I should like to make a brief reference to the motives which prompted the famous Ballarat speech, which led to the undoing of political parties in this House. The Prime Minister tells us himself that people all over Australia were writing to him. That is a very remarkable reason&#39; to be offered by a Prime Minister for the upsetting of parties in this House by his own deliberative act. He does not tell us who his correspondents were, but contents himself with a statement that they were interested in protection. The Treasurer gives us the remainder, and, I venture to say, the more substantial part of the reason which animated the making of that speech. The right honorable gentleman said - </para>

May I remind honorable members that this zeal for protection is of very recent occurrence. No &#34;mention was made of protection in the Prime Minister&#39;s speech at She opening of this Parliament. The subject, on that occasion, was quietly and carefully excluded from the Government programme. The honorable and learned member for Ballarat and his party went to the country at the last election, backed by the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> with a declaration that the fiscal issue must be sunk, not for once but for the next two Parliaments, and that statement was quoted by the Prime Minister himself in a recent debate in this House. </para>

                        <para class="block">This was the interpretation of the &#39;intentions of the Deakin Government at the last general election. There was to be fiscal peace in Australia for five years. The Minister of Trade and Customs who has once more become a rampant, raging protectionist, then said that ten years was a sufficiently short period to fix for the existence of the fiscal peace - it should continue until the expiration of the Braddon blot. That was the suggestion which he made at Albury, but after the matter had been discussed in Cabinet, and when ^ Ministers came to make their political pronouncement to the people of Australia - they, as a Cabinet, said that the fiscal question should rest for at least the next five years. Now we are told that it is a burning question. </para>

                                <para>- Quite so. In spite of this solemn undertaking to the people of Australia - and this is one of the gravest charges I have against the honorable member - in spite of the formation of a coalition in this House upon that understanding which was put in black and white, the Prime Minister tells us that within three months he agreed to a course which the present leader of the Opposition thought would not &#39;re-open the fiscal question, but which he was positive would have that effect. If that is not treacherous conduct both to the people and to the coalition, I should like to know what is the meaning of the word &#34; treachery.&#34; The Prime Minister told us in this House in reply to a statement that I made that he knew when the Tariff Commission was appointed that it would reopen the fiscal question. And that wis&#39; within three months of the making of the solemn compact with the leader of the Opposition that the fiscal issue should be sunk during the life of the present Parliament. We are told, in the programme that has just been issued by the Government, that it is hoped that the Commission will make reports to the House during this session, and that when they are received they will be immediately dealt with. So far as the Opposition are concerned, it will be its endeavour to keep the solemn compact that was made with the country. It occurs to me that there is no escape from it - that the keeping of that compact with the country will prevent the honorable and learned member from doing anything of the kind that he suggested in his speech of a day or two ago. </para>

As honorable members will recollect six months before the last Ballarat speech was made the Prime Minister delivered another one in his constituency in which he condemned Socialism, and he joined in the formation of a league with the avowed object of destroying Socialism, declaring that it would bring the country into social slavery. In his last speech at Ballarat, however, he made a different statement, as will be seen from the following quotation from one of the railway journals in New South Wales, conducted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arthur</inline> Griffith, a prominent member of the Labour Party in that State- </para>

So here we have an interpretation by a man who knows all about the business, who knows what are the aims and objects of the Labour Party, and is an avowed social democrat of the first water, and he says that the honorable and learned member for Ballarat is one too, plus a little frill. This is the fundamental reason why the opposition to the right honorable member for East Sydney was engineered. This is probably what the Attorney-General meant when he said that the combination on the Ministerial side of the Chamber was against Reidism. Why? Because the members of the Government have taken Socialism to their bosoms. I do not say it; a prominent labour man and Socialist has said it.  </para>

                                <para>- When the Prime Minister delivered his socialistic speech at Ballarat, his challenge to the Socialists to define their position was only frill, or ornamental lace. He defined the position accurately himself, in language almost identical with that which has been used by the leader of the Labour Party, who could wish for no more accurate description of their methods of procedure. This is the fundamental reason why the Reid-Deakin coalition was dissolved, and the present Government took office. </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">- His</inline>leader is in it, and I believe that he is loyal to his leader. He has always been a faithful follower of the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, and it seems that he is going to follow him into Socialism. At any rate, these are the unmistakable declarations of his leader in regard to Socialism. Let honorable members opposite, and particularly those who a month or two ago so fiercely denounced the Socialism of the Labour Party, understand that their leader has declared for straight-out Socialism, although he says that it must be gradually and cautiously applied. In each instance, he says, every socialistic proposal must be dealt with as a plain business proposition. That is what the Labour Party say. and is what the honorable member for Bland says on every occasion. I say that it is impossible to so treat them. You cannot detach this and that proposal from their propaganda, and examine it as a separate business concern. Their proposals are so inter-related that you cannot deal with one without dealing with all. It would be better for a man to take the plunge, and declare himself an out-and-out Socialist at once than for him to tinker with Socialism in this cautious, timid way. Honorable members will recollect that, when dealing with the Tariff, the duties were found to be intimately related to each other, and that we could not consider a proposal to tax an article like sugar without considering its effect upon those interested in articles like jam, biscuits, condensed milk, and other commodities of which sugar is a component part. So it is with Socialism. You cannot put one industry under the aegis of Government control without affecting other industries, and you have no right to give preferential treatment to certain industries, and to give better terms to those employed in such industries, than can be obtained by those employed in the non-favoured industries. Such a thing would not be fair to the workers outside who would have to pay the piper. Where would be the justice of saying to the miners, &#34;You must pay more taxation, in order that men employed in other industries may be given higher wages and better conditions than you enjoy&#34;? They would have it that the proposals of the Socialists are wrong when put in their proper light, and could not be carried into effect without grave injustice, and the perpetration of the worst forms of class prejudice. The pinch will be felt by those who now call loudest for Socialism when some particular industry is taken over by the State. Suppose that to-morrow the mining industry was taken over. </para>

                                <para>- I suppose I have hewn as much coal as the honorable member has hewn, but I am prepared to admit that he knows more about coal than I do. The main point I wish to make is that if the coal industry of Australia were nationalized, the Government would close up half the coal mines in New South Wales. Some of our mines are now not paying at all, and others, again, are giving only two or three days&#39; work a week. The first thing the Government would do would be to employ people where the coal could be most cheaply and easily obtained, and half the mines in the honorable member&#39;s district would be closed and the miners turned adrift, because no other employment is proposed. The gradual application of socialistic proposals will eventually destroy the socialistic propaganda, because the pinch will be so severe that socialistic principles will be repudiated when they begin to operate fully. The honorable member for Bland recognised this in the last speech that he made at the Protestant Hall, Sydney. To the accompaniment of the howls of the audience, he wanted to know where were my tears for the poor man who had been dispossessed by the tobacco combine. The audience howled when that question was asked; but they did not see that the leader of the Labour Party was giving away his whole case. A Government combine would dispossess more labour than a private combine would dispossess. The private combine would dispossess only to obtain larger profits, while the Government combine would turn men away to find more work and better wages for those who remained in their employment. Is it fair to the great mass of people outside that they should have to shoulder the cost and responsibility of maintaining in employment a favoured few lucky enough to be connected with industries taken over by the Government? Socialism is like protection in this particular, that if applied at all it must be applied all round, as otherwise it is grossly inequitable and unjust. Why, the Inter-State Labour Conference, with this statement of the Prime Minister before it, did not agree to an alliance between the Labour Party and the Government, and would not allow the members of the party to sit right behind the Government, and go to the country with them, I cannot understand. The programmes of the Prime Minister and the leader of the Labour Party are identical, but for the lace and frill of the former. I said when the late coalition was formed, and events have justified my remark, that the supreme test of the <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> of the man who made it was that he should be in it. His excuse was that he could help the coalition better by sitting behind it than by being a member of the Government. May I remind the House of the close parallel between the action of the Prime Minister in this connexion and that of an intimate friend of his in New South Wales, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wise,</inline> who, when the Reid Government was formed there some years ago, refused to join it for exactly the reason given by the honorable and learned member for Ballarat for not joining the late Reid-Mclean Administration ? </para>

Only one thing is necessary to complete the parallel, and it remains to be seen whether that thing will happen at the next elections. </para>

He stands discredited before the country; his own action has stamped him as a faithless political weakling. </para>

                                <para>- It will always stand to the discredit of the present Government that they performed one of the most appalling political somersaults on record. I do not propose to traverse the statement of the Prime Minister, but I wish to say a few words on the subject of electoral reform. Only the vaguest possible reference was made in the statement of the Prime Minister to that very important matter. We are told that the statistics on which our present system of representation are based are fourteen years old, and one need only mention that fact in order to show the urgency for an alteration of the basis of representation. The honorable member for Bland attempted to justify the action of those honorable members who, in the last Parliament supported the gerrymandering of the electorates. He said that the drought had disturbed the ordinary population conditions, and that the time at which the first proposal for a redistribution of seats was made was not opportune. When the honorable member was told that the drought had now broken up, he denied it, and when challenged on the subject, pointed to one small district in which the drought, if it did not still exist, had only just broken up. The fact is that in all the large States, even in the most plentiful year, there is some spot devoid of rain. There is always a barren droughty spot somewhere, and if we are going to wait until every district in a State is smiling with fertility, we shall never have a redistribution of seats. With all his evasion and all the avoidance of the real point at issue, the honorable member for Bland has said nothing as to what he wishes the Government to do. This matter is more vital to the members of the Labour Party than to any others in this House. </para>

                                <para>- I am afraid that the honorable member has no other idea in connexion with politics than how to obtain place and pay. Office is not everything. If the honorable member took office, he would find that it was not quite the bed of roses that he apparently supposes it to be. It is not a matter of office, but a question of fair and square dealing towards the electors of Australia. We have been in existence as a Parliament for nearly five years, and we have not yet done anything to fully enfranchise the people of Australia. The returns show that an outrageously large number of electors are disfranchised, and that we are violating one of the fundamental principles of our Constitution. I have been taunted with having been at one time the leader of the Labour Party in New South Wales. The first plank in the platform of that party at the period indicated was &#34;one vote one value,&#34; and after the lapse of fifteen years, I am standing at this table defending that principle which is opposed by the very men who ought to be its warmest champions. It is not being opposed actively or outwardly, but in the most insidious form - by the process of evasion. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member may laugh. He is in a safe position - he has to stick to the caucus, to which any political sin does not come amiss. That is one of my objections to the caucus. I have seen things done under the aegis of the caucus rule which have worked the greatest injury to the people of Australia, and which would not have been possible if members had been able to exercise their independent judgment. If it were not for the caucus, many honorable members who belong to the Labour Party would rage against the present inequalities of representation. But they shelter themselves behind the caucus. They are solid in this political crime, and being safe, they can smile. It is something to smile at, particularly for a member of the Labour Party, when in one electorate represented by a labour member two electors are entitled to only the same representation that is given to one elector in another. </para>

                                <para>- All I can say is that the opposition which is being directed to the redistribution of the electorates is of the most scandalous character. By methods of evasion and postponement honorable members opposite are denying common justice to the electors of Australia. It would be far better for them to be manly and open, and to say exactly what they mean, namely, that the present inequalities of representation suit their purposes, and that they care nothing about political principles. The Government say that the question of determining the number of representatives for each State can be dealt with only by means of a Bill. Whoever suggested any other process ? In the present case, the Bill proposed to be introduced by the Government will merely declare what the Constitution has already declared. There is no necessity for that, and the sole object of the Government appears to be to shelve the matter. If the scheme of redistribution, which was recently proposed, had been adopted by the Executive, would it not have been placed before the House, and would not Parliament have had the fullest control over what was proposed? What difference can be made by the introduction of a Bill ? Honorable members appear to have some hazy notion that the late Executive intended to violate the prime principles of parliamentary government. As a matter of fact, the late Government proposed to do exactly what is intended by the new Administration, except that the Deakin Government contemplate cutting the original proposal in two, instead of submitting it intact. This is intended to delay the settlement of the question, and that will undoubtedly be the result. This matter, affects not. New South Wales alone, because the case of New South Wales to-day. may be that of any other State in the near future. If a gold-field were discovered, say, in Victoria, the tables might be turned within twelve months by a sudden influx of population. Therefore, one is driven to seek for a reason for the evasion of the issue. The Prime Minister blows a cloud of words upon every project he brings before the House. As sure as he wraps up anything in a cloud of words, so surely is he seeking an opportunity to alight on either side of the hedge, as the occasion may seem to demand. It is impossible to obtain a definite statement from him. There is nothing definite about his programme. He puts things forward in a misty, hazy way, blows upon them a cloud of beautiful words, and leaves honorable members to search in vain for an accurate statement of his intentions. He has refused to give them even the slightest pretence of an explanation. I repeat that our present electoral arrangements completely vitiate the representative principle upon which not only our Constitution, but our whole parliamentary system is supposed to rest. Where one electorate possesses double the voting power of another, we have in existence the worst features of plural voting and class representation. I marvel that honorable members occupying seats below the gangway do not instantly put an end to this anomalous state of affairs. A democratic franchise, such as we are supposed to enjoy, is a farce, if it is to be crippled in its mode of expression, and I say that we might as well have the worst form of class representation operating in our electoral system as allow the present distribution of seats to remain upon the statute-book of the country. I should be glad - even now - if the Government would state clearly their intentions with regard to the scheme for redistributing the divisions for the election of&#39; members of this House, and the decision of the Executive, so far as State representation is concerned. Having regard to the vagueness with which reference is made to this matter in the policy speech of the Prime Minister, I fear that the Government intend to - </para>

                        <para>I wish to say a word or two in reference to the question of population. Last evening the honorable and learned member for Parkes made a most useful contribution to this aspect of the matter, and I desire to say a word or two upon the same subject. For some time past the Prime Minister has been vaguely talking about the desirability of attracting settlers to Australia. He has been speaking in that fashion for three years, but he has never submitted a single proposition in the way of materializing his ideas. </para>

                                <para>- I am talking of our parliamentary procedure since the inception of Federation. Every State&#34; Administration in Australia has been converted into something akin to our enemy. Instead of the Commonwealth Government endeavouring to work cordially with the States Governments, they so act that the latter seek at every turn to protect themselves from what they regard as the sinister influence of the supreme Government of Australia. When, therefore, the honorable and learned member for Ballarat writes a letter to the States Governments dealing with this matter, he might just as well save his time, because they will take no more notice of his communication - and will not do so for some time to come - than if it had been written by &#34; the man in the street.&#34; </para>

                                <para>- How are we to attract population to Australia? That is a problem which we ought to face, but it cannot be solved by writing letters no matter how great their literary excellence may be. Neither can it be solved by making pretty speeches throughout Australia, nor by indulging in generalities, but only by seeking to overcome difficulties in every way that may be open to us. What are those difficulties? The Prime Minister is constantly pointing to Canada, whose example he declares we ought to imitate. How can we imitate it? In the first place, we are selling our lands to immigrants in Australia at the highest figure we can procure, whereas, in Canada, the Government give settlers the land. We exact the uttermost farthing from them. Not only that, but immigrants who come to Australia to acquire land have first to find it, and that appears to be a most difficult thing at the present moment. </para>

                                <para>- The right honorable member for Swan has entirely missed my point. Whilst the Government are prating all over the country about the desirability of attracting immigrants to Australia, and submitting vague proposals for the encouragement of population, I am showing how we might .imitate &#39;the example of Canada with advantage. That country puts the immigrant upon his plot of land. </para>

                                <para>- I say that our methods of land settlement &#39;in Australia practically amount to a lottery gamble, whilst in Canada they represent a free gift. The immigrant who comes to Australia has to go further afield for his home and his land than does the immigrant to Canada, in addition to which he has to incur - after his arrival here - great risk as to whether he can get any land at all upon which to make a home. After he has traversed thou- sands of miles of ocean, bringing with him his little available capital - and no man in Australia can settle upon the land unless he possesses capital - there are various handicaps which he has to face. In the first place, we must recollect in connexion with all our Parliamentary .proposals that the exports of Australia to the markets of the world represent the very life-blood of this Continent, and &#39; will do so for generations to come. What we need to do is to ascertain the handicaps which we have to face in regard to our exportable produce. What are those difficulties? First of all we are very much further removed from a profitable market than are the producers of Canada. Our wheat-growers have to face a handicap of 5d. or 6d. per bushel as against the wheat-growers of that country, owing to the increased distance which separates them from the markets of the world. That is an initial difficulty which must be overcome. In the case of wheat, I repeat that it represents a disadvantage of 5d. or 6d. per bushel. Of course, it must be said in our favour that we produce a better class of wheat than does Canada ; although I doubt whether our advantage in that respect is sufficient to overcome the discrepancy between the two rates of export freight. </para>

                                <para>- I should say that they suffer more. Whilst&#34; upon the whole we enjoy a much sunnier climate than does Canada, we have less growing hours of light during the summer months. There they have sixteen or seventeen hours of daylight in midsummer, whilst we have only thirteen hours. When settlers come to Australia their difficulties consist, first of all, in obtaining land, and afterwards when they have been lucky enough to settle upon the soil here, in getting their produce to the markets of the world. These are the problems which the Prime Minister should set himself seriously to face. I am afraid that he will not find a solution of them merely by writing letters to the Premiers of the States, and he certainly will not by putting the word &#34; population &#34; in the Ministerial programme. A better plan to attract population would toe to abolish every obstacle that can be removed to the flow of immigration to Australia. I would suggest very respectfully to those who imagine that the Government is going to solve the problem affecting immigration to Australia that the one thing that has brought disaster to our financial reputation abroad, that has lowered&#34; our reputation throughout the whole world and done more to prevent immigration to our shores than has anything else, has been the bungling administration of the Government that is once again in power. </para>

A more bungling piece of administration has never been experienced in Australia than that which led to the scandal of the six hatters. Any man with the slightest desire to avoid that scandal could have done so. The Minister charged with the administration of the Immigration Restriction Act knew that the men in question were coming to Australia. He had an opportunity to make a full investigation days before they arrived here, but, instead of doing so, he remained in his office, taking no notice of what he knew, but rather courting the trouble, thinking no doubt that it would bring him some momentary popularity. To that administrative bungle must be attributed the besmirching of the reputation of Australia in the eyes of the whole world. I am not touching the question of legislation ; I am dealing simply with the matter of administration. Those who were responsible for the six hatters incident are in office again. </para>

                                <para>- Whose duty is it to see that the laws are observed? Is it the duty of the man outside, who is seeking to evade them, or that of the man who is responsible Tor their administration - the man who is paid a high salary, and given power and prestige to administer them ? I would remind honorable members of something more. There is a vital difference between the position of the immigrant to Canada and the immigrant to Australia. The latter must be prepared henceforth, not only for a double land tax - a State land tax, and a Federal one - but for a progressive one into the bargain. That is the latest edict of the caucus. He must also be prepared later on to have the very land that he has purchased taken from him by the Government. That is the latest decision of the Socialist Party. I am not going to traverse the merits of that decision ; I merely point out at this stage the difference between the position of the two immigrants. </para>

                                <para>- If it is, I am afraid&#39; that it is Socialism of a very different character from that which the honorable member favours. If he will agree with Socialism of that kind we shall be with him all the time. I am showing, however, that it is. not Socialism. In Canada a man is given every encouragement to own land, and to cultivate it. The best is done for him by the Government, not with a view to assist a mass of men to socialize their production, but to stimulate him in his individual efforts to better himself. An immigrant to Australia, however, has to go further for his land, with the risk of not getting it when he comes here; he has to pay through the nose for it to the uttermost farthing that we can wring from him, and, when he has done that, he has to face, not only the increased difficulties of exportation, but the possibility of a double progressive land tax, and the fact that the land may be taken from him. </para>

                                <para>- The secretary of the honorable member&#39;s party declared the other day that he was in favour of a land tax. But of what description? A land tax to socialize the wealth of the community ; prohibitive protection to begin with, and then, to make up the revenue, a progressive land tax, and not merely with a view to its substitution for other taxation, but plus other taxation, with the object of buying the wealth of the country. In other words, the land tax favoured by the Labour Party is a proposal to make the people buy themselves out. The honorable member for Bland knows that that is so, and I challenge him to deny it. It is these initial difficulties that we have to face in dealing with the question of population. How is our reputation abroad to be revived ? How is our credit to be put upon a proper basis ? Not by this Government, which has already besmirched it ; not by this Government, which had already destroyed it. Why have not the debts of the States been taken over before now? Simply because of a want of confidence on the part of the States that has been begotten of the administration of the very Ministers now in office. We could not induce the States at the present moment to transfer their debts to the Commonwealth, no matter what advantages we offered them. They do not believe that their finances would be better administered by the Federal Government as it now exists, and the first duty we have to discharge is that of reviving the credit of the Federal administration. When we do that we shall get from the States all that we can take by appealing to the people, who may then trust the Federal Government to administer their affairs in a more advantageous way than is now being done by the States Governments. The Government now in office is really that which created the administrative bungle of the six hatters. It is the same Government that perpetrated the <inline font-style="italic">Petri ana</inline> scandal. </para>

                                <para>- I am speaking, not of the legislative aspect of the question, but&#39; of the scandalous administration which made the incident of the six hatters possible. I repeat that the same Government are in office, administering the same law, and that they are no doubt prepared to do the same thing again at the first opportunity. This Government comes upon the scene also with its hands laden with further material blessings for the people. We hear of rural bounties and many other things which mean excessive expenditure and, according to the last return furnished by the ex-Treasurer, if our fair obligations were being met to-day, we should be already right up to the limit of our spending power. Instead of lauding themselves up as an all-bountiful Government, and proposing to make themselves the almoners of Commonwealth benefits, the first thing Ministers should do is to set about squaring the financial ledger. Let them be financially just before they are financially generous. If they take that course there will be very little left with which to deal out further material considerations to the people of Australia. I do not know that I shall pursue this matter further. This question of attracting population is a most important one, but I repeat that there will have to be some drastic changes in Australia before we can offer to intending immigrants the advantages which are offered to them by people in other parts of the world. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member for Bland is quite right; I have just been pointing that out. But all that will not be altered merely by the insertion of the one word &#34;population&#34; in a Ministerial statement. What are the Government going to do about it? The honorable and learned member for Ballarat has been repeating this shibboleth of population for three years, and &#39;we axe to-day no further than we were when the honorable and learned gentleman first began to talk about it. The question has still to be faced. I venture to say, echoing the words used by the honorable and learned member for Parkes last night, that the best way to attract population to Australia is to rehabilitate our position and credit on the other side of the world. In that way we should attract not only people, but people who have the requisite capital to enable them to find useful occupations when they come here, and to do all those things which in time we hope will build up a prosperous rural population in Australia. I say the present Government is not the Government to do that kind of thing. It is not the Government to face this problem. The leader of the Government has been tinkering with this question for three years, and we, have vet to begin to deal with the matter. I do not believe that the present Government will solve this or any other important problem pressing for solution in Australian politics at the present moment. A Government, founded as this Government is. founded, in intrigue, and which can maintain, itself in office only by prostituting every principle of parliamentary and responsible government, can, by its action, do nothing but further vitiate the springs of our industrial prosperity and bring misery, if not absolute destitution, on the people of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I do not propose to follow the example set so regularly by speakers on the other side. The members of the party to which I belong have never resorted to this practice of washing dirty linen in the addresses which they have felt called upon to deliver in this Chamber. Such an exhibition, as we have had in this debate, of dirty linen displayed by political washerwomen to the public of the Commonwealth, has not, I think, been exampled in the history of this or any of the State Legislatures. There is really nothing worthy of a reply in any of the addresses which have been delivered by honor able members on the other side. I congratulate the honorable member for Parramatta on his initial effort as deputy leader of the Opposition, inasmuch as the honorable member has at least proved that he is a worthy echo of the leader whom he so tenaciously follows. In the ferocity of his attack upon the Government of the day the honorable gentleman has forgotten that there is such a thing as public honour and public reputation at stake in the debate which is going on. He even excels his leader in the venom of the attack which he makes upon the Government. To us it is amusing to see these gentlemen exhibit the material of which they are made. These general washing-days, selected by washerwomen politicians in this Chamber, would appear to be necessary in order that the people may be, instructed as to the character of the men who have had the control of their destinies in this Parliament. Why does the honorable member for Parramatta - a patriot, no doubt - occupy the position of deputy leader of the Opposition ? Because it was vacated by his predecessor as soon as there appeared to be no immediate opportunity to scale the Treasury bench. In the same way, that honorable gentleman&#39;s predecessor, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> McMillan, when be discovered that there was no possibility of his attaining leadership in this House, also vacated the position. Each one would appear to patriotically assume the position prepared to devote his time and service to the country, but as each has seen his chance of power diminish he .has vacated the position, and has left this Parliament and country to the destiny which awaits them at the hands of the notorious Labour Party. During the recess, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> McMillan and other representatives of honorable members on the other side have been preaching to the people on their lack of patriotism as electors. They have told them that if the electors would only vote aright they could put an end to the Socialistic <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> at once. But where are the gentlemen who have lectured the people on their failure to exercise the franchise? Immediately they find that the object of their ambition is not within reach they fail to attend in this Chamber, and in some instances refuse even to occupy a seat in it. They prefer to wait until the time is ripe for them to secure some of the plums to which reference has been made to-day. These honorable members, who chide the people for their want of patriotism, consider it a great sacrifice to be present in this Chamber, whilst honorable members are addressing themselves to various political questions. That their attendance is spasmodic, and very infrequent, mav be discovered from a little difference, which occurred during the recess, between the honorable and learned member for Parkes and the present leader of the Opposition. Those honorable gentlemen displayed to the public how attentive they were to their public duties, and how often they attended here to watch over the great interests of the people. </para>

                                <para>- The honorable and learned member was not responsible for the reference, and I do not think it was to the credit of his leader to adopt the attitude which he did in regard to one who has stuck loyally to him in the past. It naturally grates upon a man who expects from his camp followers, not the loyalty of men who reason together, and work with one mind for a given object, but the loyalty demanded by a despot, to find that one of his followers has an opinion of his own which he is <inline font-style="italic">mot</inline> afraid to express. The caucus party knows no such despotism as is practised by the king of the late Administration. I agree that it is about time that we got on with the business of the country. Those who are responsible for the delay in attending to public affairs are the plotters who now sit on the Opposition benches, and who have voted for principles which they have denounced in order to secure the downfall of Governments. During the past twelve months, they have disembowelled this Parliament, making it useless for practical work. It was they who brought about the defeat of the Deakin Government, and when the time came, they plotted for the defeat of the Labour Government. </para>

The leader of the Opposition was plotting still more deeply during the recess to bring about the downfall of his allies. He has blamed the honorable and learned member for Ballarat for deserting him.

He was being conducted towards a precipice, and had he gone a little further, would have been flung over by the leader of the Opposition.

I have no desire, however, to follow that example, because I think it a bad one, and I feel that the people have a right to require that we shall now give attention to public business. Therefore, by way of concluding my few remarks, I say that we, the Labour Party - at any rate I speak for myself, as one of the party - feel that we have no part in the quarrel between the two parties who sit on the Treasury and Opposition benches. </para>

Last session, however, although I was most strongly opposed to the right honorable member for East Sydney, when he was called away on public business to attend at some public meeting I undertook to see that there would not be a count-out in his absence, and others entered into that undertaking far more frequently, at the invitation of the then Prime Minister. The conduct which we are now witnessing is the return that we are getting for our consideration. We find honorable members opposite, who profess to be anxious to proceed with the business of the country, rising in their places and wasting time by calling attention to the state &#39;of the House.

His utterance amounted to a revelation to this House and the country, and I compliment the honorable member upon having at last appeared before the country in such a way that no mistake can be made as to his intentions and desires. Before he had any idea of aspiring to the position of deputy leader of the Opposition, he often claimed that he was as good as a Labour representative; that he had not forsaken his old principles ; and that he stood practically in the same position as when he was leader of the New South Wales Labour Party. </para>

                                <para>- I hope that I shall never occupy the same position as the honorable member, that I shall never turn turtle and appear before the country as the enemy of the men I previously professed to serve. I should not like to suggest that the honorable member is impelled by any ignoble motive, but, at any rate, I have no desire to emulate his example. It will be of no use for the honorable member to again tell the people of New South Wales that he is as good as a Labour representative. The Labour Party can claim that, whether on the Government benches, in opposition, or on the crossbenches, they have at all times done credit to themselves, and have retained the respect of the public. No matter what may be said against our principles, it must be admitted that we have given the closest attention to our duties, and have endeavoured to push on the business of the country. When the Watson Government were in office they knew the value of their powers, and exercised them as far as possible in the public interest. The moment they found that they could no longer occupy office with, honour, they resigned their seats. We are now supporting a Government with a programme - not a blank sheet of paper, such as that which the leader of the Opposition presented honorable members. The intentions of the Government have been made quite plain, and we are . anxious to proceed to work. The leader of the Opposition admitted that we had defeated his attempt to bring our party to political destruction, that we had seen the danger of allowing him to persevere in the course which he had mapped out for himself. I believe that the public will agree that we have saved the country from disaster, and that we have relieved the Parliament from a false position. We had to make our choice between two evils, and we have concluded that, for a time, at any rate, it will be to our interest, and to that of the public, to support the present Ministry. The honorable member for Parramatta had nothing to say in denunciation of the Labour Party; but his criticism was directed entirely against the occupants of the Treasury benches. Such is politics. Office ! office ! office ! is the cry of the members of the older .parties to whom principles are of no account. I do not intend to detain the House any further, because I think that we should proceed with the work that lies before us without any delay. I would urge honorable members, in the public interest, and for the sake of their own political reputations, to at once cease fighting and snarling at one another, and settle down to business. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know that I ever rose to address the House with greater reluctance than I feel upon the present occasion. It seems to me that we have reached a very sad state of affairs indeed, and I am sure that the electors of the Commonwealth now view the way in which public business is being mismanaged in this House with the greatest consternation. For some time I have felt a desire to embrace &#39;the earliest opportunity of bringing prominently under its notice the question of party, government, with a view to obtaining a decision upon it. It seems to me that the events which have transpired during the past few weeks have emphasized the necessity of taking some such action at the earliest possible date, in order that we may discharge our duty to our constituents, and carry on the business of the nation with more ability than we have hitherto been able to display, owing to the conflict between parties in this House. I am sorry that) the feelings of grief which I experience have been occasioned very largely by a politician for whom I have always entertained the sincerest admiration and respect. I refer to the honorable and learned member for Ballarat. I recognise that, constituted as the House is under the existing system of party government, evils will crop up from time to time. I am quite prepared to admit that, under that system, we must be sometimes confronted with moles such as those whose under- ground operations have played such a large part in the recent change of Administration. I do not blame the Minister of Trade and Customs in the smallest degree. He seems to have come in for a large share of vituperation during the present debate, but to my mind he occupies a position which, cannot be. challenged. From the very first he set himself up as an open and declared opponent of the coalition Government upon the ground that he sympathized with the Labour Party. He stood upon his principles, and was content to wait until that party were once more in the ascendant. Consequently, I cannot urge anything against the honorable member for Hume, nor can I say much against some other honorable members who took such a prominent part in bringing about the recent change of Government. The same sort of forces are always at work, especially amongst political mediocrities, who take advantage of every opportunity to make it impossible to carry on the affairs of government unless they have some share in the emoluments and honour which pertain to the occupancy of the Treasury benches. -But in the case pf a gentleman like the Prime Minister, who stands head and shoulders above so many honorable members upon the opposite side of the chamber, who voluntarily&#39; subscribed to the terms agreed upon by the coalition Government,&#34; and who invited the rest of us to share in the responsibility of creating that Government </para>

                                <para>- He did. That is the feeling which I experience in addressing the House. The honorable and learned member for Ballarat took a prominent part in framing the agreement under which the coalition Government was called into being. He refused to accept office in that Ministry - a decision which I could not understand at the time, but upon which recent events seem to have cast some light. I say that we have arrived at a stage in the history of Australia when we are compelled to consider whether the system of party government is the best that we can adopt. It seems to me that if we can effect a coalition between two parties there is no reason why we should not effect a coalition between three, four, or five parties. Honorable members would then have the power of nominating the administrator of each Department of the State, and of giving the position to the man by whom its affairs would be best administered. We should thus get rid of the terrible party struggle which has absorbed so many months in every preceding session, and which is bringing Federation into public contempt. The action of the honorable and learned member for Ballarat constitutes really one of the saddest experiences in my brief political life. I did think that he would be loyal to the compact made with the right honorable member for East Sydney, in the arrangement of the terms of which he took so prominent a part. I think that I was the first to advocate, in this House, the formation of that coalition Government. At one time, indeed I went so far as to express my willingness to sacrifice one or two of my political principles in order to bring it about. Eighteen months ago I thought that Ave had reached a condition of affairs when it was&#39; necessary, as the Duke of Wellington remarked upon a memorable occasion, &#34; to carry on the Queen&#39;s Government.&#34; It seemed to me then - as it seemed to the honorable and learned member for Ballarat - that the state of political affairs was such that it was impossible for any party to carry on the business of the country, in the absence of some agreement with either one of the other parties. The honorable and learned member for Ballarat invited the formation of the late coalition Ministry, and led myself and others into supporting him in creating it. A definite understanding was arrived at between two considerable parties in this House to work in unison for the principles which they had in common; and to make subsidiary those principles in regard&#39; to which they disagreed. In the whole course of political history nothing could have been clearer, more concise, or more easily understandable than that agreement. I regret that the honorable and learned member for Ballarat did not accept office in the Ministry. At the time - I do not think that I am disclosing any secrets of party organization - I think that the party to which I belong and the right honorable member fbr East Sydney himself would have been quite content if the honorable and learned member for Ballarat had been made Prime Minister, assuming that arrangement to have been an indispensable condition of his joining the coalition. For reasons I cannot analyze, he saw fit to decline the position. He thought it would be better for him to remain outside. I believe he said that he would not like to stand on the other side of the House as a member of that Administration, and see opposed to him&#39; some of those gentlemen with whom he had worked in close political connexion for some years. Now, what is the result? By his own action he has placed himself in opposition to gentlemen with whom he had worked for very many years, and whom he induced to enter the coalition Ministry. He has forced me to stand opposite to him and to bitterly criticise him as I must do. That is nothing to the honorable and learned member ; but it is something to me that, after I had entered into this compact, after I had agreed to sink some of my political principles for the good of the country, I am forced now to make what I consider the first personal attack I have ever made upon any man. It is something to me that his action has forced me into that position. When I met my constituents a few months ago to ask them to indorse the action I had taken, I pointed out how necessary it was to get stable government, how necessary it was to have enough support in the House to carry out whatever proposals were required to complete the establishment of this Federation. When I pointed out that nothing could have been done without the sinking of some principles on my part, and without the sinking of some principles on the part of others ; when I further pointed out that in all this we had the loyal support of one of the ablest politicians here, in the person of the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, some man in that audience asked : &#34; How do you know that you have got him?&#34; I answered straight out. because I honestly believed what I said, &#34; We know that we have got him, because we have his written promise. He is a man of unimpeachable political integrity, and we know that we can altogether rely upon him.&#34; </para>

                                <para>- Yes j this view was honestly held and expressed by me. I can hardly express to the House the feeling \ had upon reading the Ballarat speech, which was delivered on the 26th June last. Various honorable members have sought to explain away that speech ; its author has sought, to explain it awa&#39;y ; but no amount of explanation- will ever explain away the fact that in that speech for the first time the honorable and learned gentleman declared his explicit intention of breaking up the coalition, in the formation of which he took so prominent &#39;a part. No amount of explanation will ever get rid of the fact that 99 per cent, of the people of the Commonwealth, upon- reading the report of that speech next morning, like myself, came to the conclusion at once, &#34;the fat is in the fire,&#34; or &#34; it is Reid&#39;s notice to quit,&#34; or &#34;it is the end of the coalition Government,&#34; or &#34;it is an effort to bring back a protectionist Government.&#34; In all directions, no matter how the feeling was expressed, it was stated most definitely and explicitly that this act of the honorable and learned gentleman was an act of political treachery by which the coalition had been ruined. I cannot understand the honorable and learned gentleman. Look at the speech as you will, view it with all the explanation which he and others have been able to give, the fact remains that the intention was clear and definite, that he. was determined to wreck the coalition Government which he had helped to form. I cannot find for myself, nor have I had offered to me, any sufficient excuse for this action on the part of the honorable and learned gentleman, whose integrity, as I say, through a long course of political history, has made him one of the most admired men in our midst. When the honorable member for Parramatta was speaking this morning, I asked, &#34; What is Reidism &#39; anyway ?&#34; because it is said that this action was taken to preserve the country from what is called &#34; Reidism.&#34; My honorable friend sought to give me an answer; but the answer I wish to get is from those who advance the statement as a sufficient reason for the conduct of the honorable and learned member for Ballarat. What is &#34;Reidism?&#34; I ask. I can see nothing at all in the expression, because as far as I am able to understand, the right honorable member for East Sydney loyally abided by the terms of the agreement, and was prepared to go on with the Business of the country, carefully and, I think, skilfully adopting, with good reason, I believe, what might be called non-contentious measures, so as to pave the way for a subsequent appeal to the electors of the Commonwealth to decide how its future government was to be carried on. If &#34; Reidism &#34; means anything at all, surely it would mean, as some persons have implied, that there was to be an effort to sneak in free-trade under the domination of the right honorable and learned gentleman While he was at the head of a coalition Ministry. The only possible ground there could be for such a belief - and it is of the flimsiest nature - was the fact that the more immediate and more numerous body of his supporters were representatives of New South Wales, who were mostly free-traders by conviction. But I can assure the House that the organizations which were initiated in New South Wales in support of the principles which the coalition was formed to carry out, ha&#39;d not the slightest reference to the question of free-trade. I studiously declined to take part in any free-trade meetings in New South Wales after the coalition party was formed. On several occasions when I was invited to attend or address meetings in the interests of freetrade, I declined to go. I said, &#34; I have loyally adopted the principle that we are to abide by the terms of the fiscal peace until such time as we can go to the country again, and get some other mandate.&#34; This principle of fiscal peace was never one which I adopted. At the last election I came out definitely again as a revenue tariffist, who was determined, if the opportunity arose, to endeavour to get the Tariff amended in certain directions in the interests of providing a larger revenue, and of giving freer play and fairer opportunity to our great primary industries. These were my determined convictions, and I made concessions in agreeing to the combination for specific purposes - purposes which at the time I believed to be most invaluable to the welfare of the Commonwealth. At the last election, I was fought by an opponent who placarded the constituency with the cry of &#34; fiscal peace &#34; in blue ink on a white ground, and whose funds were provided by the honorable member for Hume and his party, who wished to knock me out on my fiscal belief. How is it that today I am met with a revival of the fiscal controversy from the very men, at any rate from some of them, who were instrumental in trying to knock me out of my constituency and who subscribed money to pay the expenses of my opponent - who tried to get him returned on no other ground than that of the desirableness of maintaining fiscal peace. As I said, I did not stand at that time for fiscal peace. I was returned for fiscal war, and was prepared for war if it arose. But I have often had occasion to remark that consistency to principle is a matter of com paring the magnitude or relative value of one principle with another. It was&#34; of no use carrying on fiscal war when no good could be derived from the warfare. There was other work to be done ; there were other principles which divided this House. The great machinery measures necessary to the complex tion of Federation had to be attended to, and, as I said before, I was one of the first to suggest the idea of a coalition Ministry, which would enable us to pass those measures, many of .which are of a non-contentious and non-party nature, and could have been more thoroughly considered and determined in a House where we had fiscal peace for a few years, than in a House where fiscal feeling was rampant. I agreed to fiscal peace when I saw there was no other alternative; and now supporters of the right honorable member for East Sydney are accused of endeavouring to introduce free-trade principles under the cover of the late alliance. I ask the people who make that charge in this House, as well as outside, what evidence they have. I am in the counsels of the party, and I know very well that no action was there taken. We never thought of such a thing for a moment. </para>

                                <para>- And many other protectionists were working with us up to a point. There came a time, though very late in the day, when it was seen that scheming, underground engineering, and mole burrowing was going on. About two months ago a meeting was held, with a view to opposing the Labour Party by a coalition of the other two parties, in my constituency of South Sydney, and just at the last moment I received&#34; from many men, who were, notable protectionists in the district, a refusal to attend the meeting, because they thought the question of parties was not vet decided. It is quite evident now that, so far from the free-traders trying to do anything of the kind suggested, it was the opposite fiscal party who were undermining the agreement which had been arrived at, and were promising all sorts of new things if only the protectionists held back from the combination. Can honorable members who say there was any sort of treachery on the part of the free-traders point <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> a single fact or incident to support the charge? As one who is in the counsels of the party, I, for one, refused to have anything to do with the fiscal issue. I declined to have anything to do, even with the old Free-trade Association of New South Wales. When I was spoken to by the secretary of that association with reference to the continuation of its organization, I said to him - &#34; We are bound as honorable men to take no measures to uphold or disseminate the principles of free-trade ; we must, as honorable men, representing constituencies of the Commonwealth, refuse to add to our strength or interfere in any way with the fiscal truce.&#34; Then there came that bombshell of the Ballarat speech. I know that the Prime Minister has explained that he meant nothing by that speech. It is difficult sometimes to find out from the words of politicians exactly what they mean, but it&#34; is certain, as I said before, that ninety-nine out of every hundred of the people of the Commonwealth had no doubt whatever what the speech meant. To view that utterance in its least objectionable light, it was an effort to damn the movement with faint praise. There was a manifestation of this spirit on the part of the honorable and learned member - that he was &#34; willing to wound and yet afraid to strike.&#34; Put what complexion we like upon the speech, the fact remains that it was, as stated by the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> a definite &#34;notice to quit &#34; - a notice to quit which, I believe, the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> had more influence in bringing about than, perhaps, any other power in the community. During the whole period of this amalgamation of parties, there had been a struggle, unknown to me and unseen by many, between the Government as it existed - composed partly of friends of the honorable and learned member for Ballarat, and partly of his old political enemies - and a combination of those who remained outside hoping for some turn of affairs to bring them back into office with the members of the Labour Party. There had been a constant struggle going on, &#34;pull devil pull baker,&#34; - a never-ending contention as to which way the honorable and learned member for Ballarat was to be pulled, and finally the devil got the best of it. That may be one of the indents of party politics, but to my mind it is the last straw - it is the element that condemns the whole system. I have been told in all directions that if we initiate a system by which each Minister of the Crown shall be individually and separately responsible to this House, we shall create all sorts of difficulties and evils of which we do not now dream&#39;. But I say there cannot be suggested or imagined a bigger difficulty than has been created by the treachery .of the honorable and learned member for Ballarat. I regret to have to say this, because, as I have remarked before, I regarded the honorable and learned member as one of the most admirable men in our political life - as one of the most gifted and best qualified members of this House. But the sad fact remains that he, who- is a supporter, I believe, of the system of party government, has given to that system its &#34;knock-out&#34; blow; and it will take him many years to get over the effect on his personal reputation of that Ballarat speech, that significant instance of political treachery. The right honorable member for Swan, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, and a number of other honorable members now on the Government side of the House, were glad to get rid of the trouble created by the domination of the Labour Party, and we need not go beyond their public utterances for confirmation of. that fact. The right honorable member for Swan even went so far as to lift the curtain which is supposed to be religiously closed over the proceedings of Cabinet Ministers, and let out the fact that he frequently felt the evil of the domination to which I have referred to be so great that in his opinion no man ought to be called upon to bear it. </para>

                                <para>-&#34; Vomit &#34; is a term used to express that physiological action which takes place when we cannot digest something - when something we take is nauseating, irritating, or poisonous - which must go when one&#39;s gorge rises. This is a fair analogy of what took place when honorable members opposite threw off the Labour Party and joined the coalition. There was a fair, legitimate, open, loyal undertaking carried out by honorable members on this side with absolute adhesion to principle - not only to the letter, but to the spirit of the undertaking. But honorable members opposite have given it up for no reason that I have heard of that is at all satisfactory. The last reason I heard was from the Treasurer - that &#34; we were not going to put up with being imposed upon.&#34; </para>

                                <para>- How was any honorable member opposite treated with contempt, either by the right honorable member for East Sydney, or by any member of his party? The only contempt I can imagine was the feeling generated in the minds of honorable members at finding themselves left out of power. The Prime Minister did not wish to take any part in the coalition Government from the dislike of seeing opposite to him some of those men who had worked with him in the past. But he has now come back into power, and he sees opposite to him not only some of those men with whom he previously worked, but, in the person of the late Treasurer, the late Minister of </para>

                        <para class="block">Trade and Customs, and the late Minister of Defence, he sees three of <inline font-style="italic">his</inline> principal supporters - three of his principal coadjutors. They are bound as honest and loyal men - men of their word - who had entered into an agreement, to say that they cannot possibly understand the action of the Prime Minister. Like a certain theological virtue, it &#34;passes all understanding.&#34; No adequate explanation has yet been given. It is one of those political mysteries, like that of &#34;The Man with the Iron Mask,&#34; which remain mysterious for years and years before they are explained. When I think of the circumstances, my feelings induce me to go nearer than I have ever been in my life to making a personal attack upon any man in politics. The Prime Minister has fallen from my esteem. He has delivered a blow against the institutions of our country, from which it will take them a long time to recover. He has departed from the principles of constitutional government for which he and others made such a gallant fight but a few months ago. Only last year he said that the then position was intolerable, and that there would have to be an amalgamation of two parties out of the three. He tried to amalgamate with the Labour Party, on terms which would be honorable and acceptable to himself. He failed in that. Then he made proposals to the present Opposition party. These proposals were finally adopted. They have been abided by loyally by members on this side of the House. They have been scandalously set aside by the Prime Minister. I say, again and again, that we have had no such explanation - no excuse - for his action, as would rehabilitate that honorable gentleman in the reputation which he once enjoyed. , We have had no excuse, no explanation that is adequate to the circumstances. I regret to have seen the honorable and learned gentleman in such a position. An appeal has been made to us by the Attorney-General, who tells us that we have to do the work of men. We have had the work of men to do all along, and that work, I am sorry to say, has not been done. Much of it remains to be done. I will respond to that invitation to join with others to get the work of the country discharged. I will assist the Government or any Government, as far as I can, and as far as their proposals agree with my principles, to get that work done in as short a time as possible, consistently with doing it well. I will not oppose their measures simply because I have a very strong opinion as to the way in which they came into office - that they were conceived in political treachery, that they were brought into office by an act of political shame, which is not to be compared with anything in the history of this country. I am prepared to assist&#34; them to carry out the work of the country, but the fact remains that the country cannot but entertain feelings of sincere grief that a man of such great reputation, whose political integrity was at least- equal to that of any other politician in the Commonwealth, should have descended, for reasons which no man can understand, to an act of political treachery, by which a Government which might have done good work for the country was destroyed. I do not altogether agree with the action taken bv my right honorable leader in meeting this Parliament with the determination, after hearing the declaration of the present Prime Minister, to bring about a dissolution of the House, and to make an appeal to the country. The right honorable member was guilty of what I consider - despite his great qualifications in political affairs - to be a tactical blunder. I think that the proper course for him to pursue was to go on with the work of the country, despite the fact that he had received such a staggering blow from his foremost supporter. There was no reason- for stopping the work of government. The issue has shown, I think, that the view I then took was correct. I think it would have been wiser on the part of the right honorable member if he had forced the present Prime Minister to complete the action which he had taken, by committing an open act of treachery in this House. It would have been better for the country if the right honorable member had brought forward the whole of the measures which he had intended to introduce, and which, in greater or less degree, are the measures which the present Government intend to propose. In fact, they have promised to bring them in. The right honorable member, would have been better advised if he had proceeded with those measures, leaving the present Prime Minister to complete, openly if he intended to do so, his act of political treachery. </para>

                                <para>- It would have been better for the right honorable member to go on with the business of the country, leaving honorable members opposite to decide what action they were going to take under the circumstances. The position of the right honorable member would have been stronger from the first if he had done that. I saw, with what little prescience I have, that it was almost impossible for the Governor-General to grant the right honorable member a dissolution under the circumstances. The supporters of the present Government were enabled to put the matter in such a way that it seemed to me that from constitutional precedents, it would be utterly impossible for His Excellency to dissolve Parliament. The then Opposition were able to show that they were prepared to go on with the business of the country. Consequently*, the right honorable member put himself in the wrong from that time on. </para>

                                <para>- Losing office does not cover the whole ground. There was the matter of carrying on the business of the country. The fact remains that we have not in this country septennial Parliaments. This is a triennial Parliament, and it seems to me to be improbable that for some time to come we shall be able to abolish the three parties that we now have. There might be individual changes, but all that could happen as the result of the expense and trouble of a general election would be the return of seventy-five gentlemen more or less evenly divided into three parties, so that the balance of power would rest with no one of them. Thus I think that nothing was to be gained by attempting to shirk the responsibility of going on  with the business of the country, although I can well understand the action of the late Prime Minister, in view of the treatment he received. From that time onward there has been a struggle between Box and Cox. That has been our difficulty in this Parliament. In my young days a famous farce, entitled &#34; Box and Cox,&#34; was very popular. It dealt with the troubles of a landlady who had but one bed on which one lodger slept by day, and another by night. On one occasion the two lodgers came home at the same time, and then the landlady&#39;s difficulties commenced. The difficulty of this Parliament has been its inability to simultaneously put the right honorable member for East Sydney and the honorable and learned member for Ballarat into the same political bed together. If we could have done that, many of our difficulties would have been solved, and probably the political treachery of which we are now complaining would not have transpired. The position in regard&#39; to these two great leaders reminds me of the line in Pope&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Prologue to the Satires -</inline></para>

                        <para>A cablegram published to-day is also apposite, for it tells us that the Sultan of Turkey fears that an attempt has been made by his brother to bring about his assassination by means of a bomb. Our difficulty is that we cannot put the two honorable gentlemen to whom I have referred in the one political bed at the same time; and until we solve that problem we shall be always in danger of frequent Ministerial crises. We shall be always in danger of a stop being put to the work of governing this country, and shall be exposed to all the difficulties and scandals arising from party intriguing for possession of the Treasury benches. I hope, therefore, that at a very early date we shall solve the question of how the Executive of this country is to be selected and dominated by the will of the House, each member of the Ministry being made individually responsible to that will. That, to my mind, is the only solution of the difficulties with which we are confronted. It is the only way in which we shall reestablish the belief of the people in the Commonwealth Parliament. There is no doubt that the people are inclining to the view that Federation has not been a success; that the Parliament is not what it ought to be ; that we have not reached that rarer atmosphere and higher plane which was predicted ; and that we have, in fact, adopted all the evil practices that have been the main source of trouble in the Legislatures of the States. The feeling of the public is that we have not placed ourselves beyond these evils, although under our Constitution, if we choose to exercise it, we have full power to do so. This is one of the points which have been brought out prominently by the present situation ; but nothing can overshadow the fact that an honorable and proper undertaking entered into by honorable men has been broken and broken so disgracefully that I do not think honorable members opposite will be allowed for many years to forget it. </para>

                    <para>- I think it would be wise to leave this matter over until next week. We are here initiating a new principle. The standing order governing this matter was brought down and agreed to somewhat hurriedly last year, and rightly or wrongly, I am of opinion that the motion now made is in conflict with section 56 of the Constitution. That is not merely my opinion; but it is held also by a number of legal members of the House. There is more involved than conformity with a standing order of the House. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">It might be so narrowly interpreted, as subsequently to be found injurious, in connexion with questions which might crop up under the Constitution, and on the other hand, we must guard our rights, and to do so it may be wise to interpret the Constitution in the broadest possible way. Another point should be mentioned, and that is that, since the Bill was introduced and passed by this House, additional information has come to hand in the last report from New Guinea, and in a paper laid on the table some time ago dealing with questions to which I referred when the Estimates for New Guinea were going through. This is the only motion on which we can have a general discussion of the various matters dealt with in the Bill. I believe it is well known that wherever an attempt has been made to take up a lapsed Bill under such a standing order as we adopted last year, the proposal has led to a longer discussion than would have been involved in a re-introduction of the measure. In this particular instance I think we should have an opportunity to discuss the motion, and personally I should very much like to do so. It is too late to enter upon such a discussion to-day, and if I do not do so I shall have lost my opportunity until the Estimates come on, when perhaps the same attention may not be given to the remarks which honorable members have to make. Other honorable members may desire to say something on the motion, and in the circumstances I suggest to the Prime Minister that it would be wise to postpone it until next week. </para>

                        <para>- There is a proper remedy for that. If the Minister has any idea that imports are being undervalued, why does he not put into force section 235 of the Commonwealth Customs Act, under which it is provided that whoever wilfully makes any false statement shall be guilty of an indictable offence, and shall be liable to imprisonment with hard labour for any period not exceeding four years. My complaint is that the Minister of Trade and Customs, without seeking the advice of Parliament, and without endeavouring in any way to deal with those who are supposed to have undervalued imports, and merely because it pleases him to say that there has been undervaluation, whether that is correct or not - and evidently the honorable gentleman does not believe that it is, or he would have enforced the section of the Commonwealth Customs Act to which I have referred - has practically said that, in future, the duty on imported harvesters is to be raised from 12&#189; per cent. to over 25 per cent. This is a matter about which Parliament should be extremely careful. It is we, in Parliament assembled, who fix the Customs duties, and not Ministers. I do not propose to suggest now the opportunities which this would afford for fraud, but it is clear that if we are to permit this kind of thing, and allow Ministers to be the persons to determine the Customs duties to be imposed, they may, in the same way, raise the duty upon any article from 25 per cent. to 125 per cent., and actually bring about prohibition of its importation. I shall not here debate the question whether protection is a wise policy or not, but I say that it is an infringement of the rights of Parliament for a Minister to take it upon himself to deal with Customs matters in the manner complained of. Let me put the matter from another point of view. Suppose another Minister of Trade and Customs comes into power, and declares that the valuation of these harvesters shall be not <inline font-style="italic">&#163;65,</inline> but&#163;25, surely protectionists would consider that they had some grounds for objecting to such a thing? It will be the most serious thing which has happened in this community if we permit the Minister of Trade and Customs for the time being to determine what Customs duties shall be imposed. If the Minister really believes that there has been undervaluation of imports, let him enforce the Customs Act. We have made provision for that, as I have explained, and, moreover, under section 240, three times the value of the goods can be claimed from those who have undervalued imports. Surely there is a sufficient duty imposed on harvesters, which are used solely by the farmers? They ought not to be the only class singled out for a special impost in the interests of any manufacturer. What has become of the Labour Party? Are they not going to see that justice is done to the farmer? </para>

                        <para>- I am not dealing with that point. It may be that honorable members opposite will, later on, say, &#34;We will make the manufacture of harvesters a Government Department.&#34; The point I am dealing with is that at the present time the Minister of Trade and Customs has it in his power to increase the taxation on the farmers by raising the duty on harvesters, and Parliament alone should Have that power. What renders the question all the more serious, to my mind, is that last Monday week I was informed that one of the companies manufacturing harvesters in Victoria, had, with another firm, succeeded - the words were very plain - in getting at the Minister of Trade and Customs, and had him on their side. It was meant that the Minister is acting on. behalf of those people. </para>

                        <para>- It was said that the McKay Harvester Company had got at the Minister, and that he is working with them, and that therefore the rate of duty on imported harvesters would be increased beyond* the rate sanctioned by Parliament. I took it upon myself, at the time, to absolutely deny the statement, because I did not understand that the Minister of Trade and Customs could have done what he was said to have done. The information, however, turns out to lie correct, because the rate is to be raised. </para>

I should have said a &#34; certain combination.&#34; At the time I said that the Minister of Trade and Customs could not alter the rale fixed by Parliament, and honorable members can therefore understand how great was my anger when I learned this morning that the rate is to be altered. The effect of the action of the Minister will be to raise the duties on imported harvesters from 12 <inline font-style="italic">\</inline> to over 25 per cent. We cannot be too careful about things of this &#39;kind. If the Minister of Trade and Customs thinks that there is a fraud, let him deal with the matter under the Act, but do not let it be spread through the country that the Minister will twist the law in favour of certain firms. Do not let it be said that the man to go to if you want things is the Minister of Trade and Customs. We had a lot of that kind of thing in New South Wales before the scandal became public. It was said that the man to go to if you wanted things done was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> N. Willis. We do not want to hear, that sort of thing about the Minister of Trade and Customs. But when a Minister takes it upon himself to increase a Customs valuation at his own sweet will- </para>

                        <para>- The valuation was nearly doubled. I remember the time when harvesters cost from &#163;110 to ,&#163;120 each, but they have gradually gone down in price, and many farmers are hoping that they will go down still more, as the various parts are manufactured in larger quantities, until, instead of costing about <inline font-style="italic">&#163;$0</inline> each retail, they can be bought for about ^50 each. The Minister ought not to have power to interfere with the rate of duty behind the back of Parliament. No doubt the protectionists look upon his present action with favour, because they wish to see the rates of duty raised, but what would they say if a Minister were in power who was a strong free-trader, and he lowered certain rates? If what has been &#34;done can be done during the sittings of Parliament it can be done when Parliament is not sitting, and during the six or seven months of a recess there would be opportunities for fraud which might make our standard still lower than it is at present. If the Minister of Trade and Customs knows anything against these importers, let him prosecute them. I have read the sections under which they may be prosecuted. That is the way to deal with them. If they are punished in that way, it cannot be suggested that the Minister is using his power to the advantage of any particular manufacturer or body of manufacturers. I hope that the Prime Minister will take every care that this matter shall not be allowed&#39; to go further. We must remember that since the Minister of Trade and Customs was Premier of New South Wales very nasty things have come out about his then Secretary for Lands, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hassall,</inline> who had to leave the State because of the fraud and corruption that went on. The door was at first left open for small things, and the fraud and corruption has been continued by men who were supporters of the Minister of Trade and Customs. I do not wish to leave the door open for fraud1 in connexion with the Commonwealth Administration. It is for Parliament to see that it is closed. We should not allow the Government this power which they have taken. </para>

                    <para>- I am glad that the honorable and learned member for Werriwa has called attention to this matter. Had he not done so I should have done so myself. I think it a monstrous injustice that the rate of duty on harvesters should be nearly doubled, and I should like to know what the constituents of the honorable member for Hume and the farmers of Australia think of this action of his to increase the price of harvesters. It means a further handicap on those engaged in one 6f the chief primary industries of the Commonwealth. And who is to get the benefit of this increase in price? Not the country, and certainly not the users of harvesters, whose industry is thus further handicapped. Has not the Minister done what is complained of to divert public money into private pockets ? Action of this kind should be opposed tooth and nail by all who have the interests of honest government at heart. There are some ugly rumours in circulation. </para>

                        <para>- I have no desire to impute motives, and I do not wish to be understood to impute dishonesty. At the same time, I think, it is very serious that such action should be taken as to give colour to the statements which have been made outside. Apart from this, we have evidence before us from the Minister&#39;s own statements that there is likely to be a resumption of that system of persecution of importers which characterized the <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> of a previous Ministry, and I hope that we shall not hear any more of the same kind of thing under the <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> of the present Government. Every time an attempt is made by a Minister to go behind the back of Parliament and raise the duties upon imported goods I shall protest to the very utmost of my power. I warn the Minister of Customs that every attempt of this kind on his part will be closely watched, and I think there are enough honorable members on this side of the House who have sufficient regard for just administration, to join me in giving the Minister a very warm time whenever he abuses the powers of office, and nullifies parliamentary legislation by administrative action which results in increasing the duties on imports. </para>

                        <para>- If the Commonwealth is being robbed, the Minister has a perfectly clear course open to him - let him bring the offenders before the Court ana have them punished. He has no right, on any pretext, to increase the duty upon the machines in question. If the importers of such machines are defrauding the Customs they should be brought before the Court and, upon being found guilty, should be punished. Some reference was made by the Prime Minister to the duty upon harvesters, and I presume that the Minister&#39;s action is part of the game that is to be played under the present Administration. We have heard from some honorable members that the imposition of duties cheapens the cost of articles to the consumer, and it has been represented to us that the local manufacturers are philanthropists. If the manufacturers desire to sell their harvesters at a cheaper rate, and to thus help the farmers, they can do so without the aid of any duty. Statements&#39; such as those to which I refer, like many others, are usually made with the tongue in the cheek. The local manufacturers want to have high duties imposed in order that they may rob the community. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, it is. When a manufacturer endeavours by unfair means to obtain excessive prices for his goods, whether he acts under the law or otherwise, he is a robber. No law can make moral that which is immoral. The sole object &#39;Of the local manufacturers is to raise the price of their machines. I should say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> is well paid for his machines. He has complained that his business has fallen off, and I would ask how that decline has been brought about. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> knows, and others are also well aware of the facts. The reason is that, during recent dry seasons, the farmers believed that their crops would be short, and cancelled their orders for machines. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> claims that he is competing against the harvester combine. But he is in the combine which has as its object the robbery of the public, and no consideration should be shown to him. If he were fighting the combine, and standing up honestly with a view to supplying the farmers with machines at fair prices, we might be inclined to listen to his pleadings ; but under no circumstances should the Minister of Trade and Customs be allowed to adopt the course he has followed in this case. The Minister has no power behind him, so far as the members of his own party are concerned ; but he is depending upon the support of the group of honorable members who have practically placed the Ministry in power. He is at the beck and call of the Labour Party, which should prevent him from persisting in his present course of action. If the importers have done any wrong, they should be brought before .the Court and be afforded an opportunity to defend themselves. The Minister has complained of imputations that have been made against him, but I would point out that he is making imputations against the importers - he is charging them with defrauding the Customs. Why does he not give them an opportunity to defend themselves? I enter my strongest protest against the Minister of Customs being allowed to do what he has done, and I submit that the House should not permit the matter to pass without visiting upon him the strongest condemnation. </para>

                        <para>- I did not know the cause of those charges, but I found out afterwards. I took the trouble to go down and look at the papers in connexion with this case, and I am in a position to inform honorable members that the whole matter was brought up to a certain point by my predecessor. The papers were submitted to me on the 21st inst., with a recommendation from the Comptroller-General of Customs, who knew the whole circumstances, that certain action should be taken, and I followed the course suggested. I had no hesitation in acting on the recommendation of the Comptroller-General in a matter of this kind, because he was fully acquainted with the facts. I merely wrote the word &#34; approved &#34; on his recommendation. That is the whole of the case. As to the insinuations that have been made, I need only say that I do not know the local manufacturers of harvesters, and I think that it is very hard, and very unfair, that I should be made the object of such unjustifiable criticism. I would point out that, under section 151 of the Customs Duties Act, the Minister is clothed with special power to deal with matters of this kind. If the honorable and learned member for Werriwa had referred to another matter upon which I was questioned on Wednesday, namely, the f.o.b. values of American and Canadian goods, including all kinds of machinery, he would have dealt with a subject of some importance. The matter now under consideration is one of comparatively small importance, but the other question is one involving; a loss to the Customs of&#163;30,000 to&#163;40,000 per annum. When the honorable member talks about prosecuting these men, I would point out to him that it is a very difficult thing to deal with matters which have taken place in the United States of America and Canada. </para>
