Cervais, in his report, remarks that " considering the excellent relations between London and Paris, it was to be hoped that our neighbours would be able to bring the Australian States to an equitable appreciation of our rights, in order to secure us a confirmation in the New Caledonian archipelago of the situation due to us owing to our pecuniary sacrifices, and the moral and material efforts of our subjects, and because it is incontestable that the geographical facts of the New Hebrides constitute them a dependency of a French colony." </para>

                        <para>- It is indisputable that, <inline font-style="italic">so</inline> far as we are informed, the most excellent relations exist at the present time between our own nation and the French Republic. Of that we are happy to hear. But I am not aware that relations of the most intimate character would justify the sacrifice of established rights by either Power. The Imperial authorities are well aware, and have recently been reminded at length, of the strong views we hold upon this question. I am sure that they would not, in the name of amity, ask the French Republic to sacrifice its rights, and I am equally confident that the French Republic would not make any such request to us because our nations are united by the <inline font-style="italic">entente cordiale.</inline> On the contrary, we trust that the relationship which exists between Great Britain and France will lead to an early consideration of the reciprocal rights of each party, and result in a just settlement. In our view a just settlement cannot but be beneficial to Australia. </para>

                        <para>- In reference to a reply given by me on Tuesday to a question asked by the honorable member for Southern Melbourne, with reference to the importation of harvesters, I have been furnished with a memorandum, which states that three or four words were inadvertently omitted from one of the sentences. The reply, which should have been given, states that the records of the last two years show that the heaviest importations of agricultural machinery, which includes harvesters, are in the months of November, December. January, and February. The words "of agricultural machinery, which includes harvesters," were inadvertently omitted from the sentence. The House has already been informed - <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> page 5279 - that no separate record of the imports of harvesters was kept prior to 1st January, 1905. Hence the necessity for giving this reply in a general form. </para>

Although the views that have been presented in some quarters in opposition to our ideas have been scarcely due to ignorance, I believe that in many instances they have been due to misconception - misconception not only as to the tenor of the proposals placed before the House, but misconception also as to the history of the subject and the way in which it has been dealt with in a far larger community than ours, and one in which mercantile interests of huge proportions are involved. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I should like, in the first place, to read the clause, which presents no difference in principle or substance from the series of amendments for which it has been substituted. I have, I believe, in the clause now before us put into more concise form the series of amendments which were issued under date 15th September. Those amendments related both to union trade marks, and to individual workers' trade marks, under the combined heading of " workers' trade mark." I shall read the clause, because I believe that the language into which I have put these proposals correctly represents what those in favour of them have always maintained is the root principle of the proposed legislation, that is to say, the prevention of fraud. I shall endeavour to the best of my ability, to put before the Committee the facts and circumstances which I think justify the proposal. I shall also endeavour - fairly, I hope - to examine some of the objections that have been <inline font-style="italic">raised very often</inline> and very ably, if I may presume to say so, by several honorable. members. The proposed clause 73 reads in this way - </para>

                <para class="block">Then there is an inclusive definition of " association," declaring that it means any number of associations acting together, in which case the members of the combined associations will be the members, of each separate association. The clause further provides - " Production " means production, manufacture, workmanship, preparation, or product of labour ; " Produced " has a meaning corresponding with " production. " </para>

                <para>That, of course, relates to cases in which goods are imported, and may be liable to forfeiture for a breach of the Customs law. It is merely inserted to guard against accident, and the belief that the only penalty provided is a monetary one. Assuming this Trade Marks Bill to be constitutional - and I shall deal with that aspect of the matter hereafter - my view is that these clauses only confer upon workers the same advantages that are extended to capitalists in the remainder of the measure. Before I resume my seat, I shall offer to the Committee the testimony of Judges who have expressed the opinion that it only places the efforts of the labourer in the same category as the tangible property of the employer or ordinary tradesman is put by other sections of the trade marks law. That is the foundation of the morality, if I may call it such, of giving to the worker the power to register his trade mark, irrespective of whether he is a single worker, whether he is a unionist, or whether he is combined with other workers who are not members of a union at all. He can register a trade mark without anybody's consent; but in no case can he affix it to any goods. It is quite clear that it is improper that it should be falsely applied. Under this clause, if a worker applies that mark to any goods of his employer without his employer's authority, he is liable to a penalty of£50. A trade mark cannot lawfully be attached to any goods, except by the employer himself, or by some member of an association - if it be an association mark - or by the worker himself - if it be a worker's mark - with the authority of the employer. In short, I take it that when we are passing a Trade Marks Bill our aim should be to make no discrimination between various classes of the community. I believe that I am right in saying - and I hope I shall be able to prove it to the satisfaction of honorable members - that this Bill represents an effort to place workers and proprietors of goods - " capitalists," or whatever we may term them - upon an equality before the trade marks law. At the present time the whole contention of honorable members upon the other side of the Chamber is that a worker has no right to register a trademark. I intend to examine that argument, and to discuss why he should have that right. If it be lawful, and if it is a right thing to do from a moral stand-point, I do not see why we should not allow him to register a trade mark. If it be a wrong thing to do morally, it is certainly not proper for us to permit him to register it. But I take it that there can scarcely be any difference of opinion upon the question that it is right to say that in respect of any mark, which a worker may adopt to distinguish the product of his labour, or which an association of workers - whether it be a trades union or not - may adopt to distinguish the product of the labour of its members, it is a moral offence, and ought, if possible, to be made a legal offence to forge that mark. That is all that the clause to which I refer provides. As honorable members will notice, it imposes a prohibition upon a person falsely applying a trade mark to any goods for the purposes of trade or sale. It also imposes a prohibition against knowingly selling or exposing for sale, or having in possession for sale, or for any purpose of trade or manufacture, any goods to which such a mark is falsely applied. Then there is a further prohibition upon the importation of goods into Australia bearing an Australian mark, when those goods have not been produced in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- It is absolutely impossible to honestly import into Australia goods bearing a mark to the effect that they have been made in Australia, but which have not been 'produced here. That is the position. The remainder of the clauses must, I believe, be recognised - if this principle be once adopted - as purely machinery provisions. The registration of a mark is nothing more or less in this case than it is in the case of an ordinary trade mark. In ordinary business circles, a man may have a trade mark. It may be the representation of a horse, as applied to salt. If that is the trade mark of one business man, and another person invades it by selling salt with the representation of a horse upon it. the owner of the trade mark can appeal to the Court, independently of any Trade Marks Act, and restrain the thief. The Trade Marks Act was introduced to allow registration for the purpose of more effectively providing evidence and remedies. Therefore, registration, in every case, is simply for the purpose of allowing the public to see what trade marks are protected, and to establish - after the lapse of a certain time, at all events - Beyond all doubt who is the owner of a specific trade mark, to provide remedies of a comparatively simple nature, and, in some cases - if the right to the trade mark is contested and withstood - to have the trade mark taken off the register. In short, it is to allow the public to know to whom the registered trade mark belongs, and to give the owner greater facilities for protecting his property. If we admit that the workers have the right to some symbol designating the product of their labour, there can be no objection to allowing them to put it on the register, because by so doing the public will be protected in every way. If we do not allow that, the result might be that a worker, a union, or an association which is not a union, might by advertisement or in some other way, notify the public that a certain mark belonged to them, and the employer who wished to apply it might be caused great confusion, because he might have grave doubt as to whether he was correctly applying it by acting upon the consent of one person when he ought properly to get the consent of another. Without this Bill at all, any trade union, or any worker - I will take the case of a trade union, for the purpose of my argument, because that is the organization which is uppermost in the minds of honorable members - can at the present time pass a resolution adopting a certain label. It can advertise it in all the newspapers- </para>

                        <para>- At the present moment, independently of this Bill, a union may adopt a label, and an employer, if he chooses, may attach that label to goods which answer its description. In other words, if the goods are the product of union labour, an employer would be doing no wrong to the public if he put that label upon the goods so manufactured. But supposing - as is often the case in connexion with trade marks - the public recognise that label, and wish voluntarily to promote the welfare of that union by purchasing goods to which it is affixed ; what would be the inevitable course of proceeding amongst those who do not observe union conditions? Undoubtedly there would be a few - sufficient in number to break down the guard that the public had, and so to deceive and injure them - who would put that mark upon goods which were not truthfully described. There would not be a ready - if any - means of restraining the man who was undoubtedly a rascal. </para>

                        <para>- They cannot. Let me tell honorable members what happened in America, because it will serve to point what I am now saying. In 1874, the union label was first introduced in the United States. In that year the state of affairs existing in California, and particularly in San Francisco, was very bad indeed. In the cigar trade, white persons who were working at a proper wage found that there were shopkeepers and manufacturers employing others - some white and some Chinese operatives - at what would be starvation wages from a union worker's point of view. They found that these persons were employing coolies, and also women and children in what were called small rat tenements, in manufacturing cigars, which were circulated among the people, and were, in some cases, dangerous to human life. They were certainly made under conditions of labour which tended to greatly depress the conditions of living. </para>

                        <para>- There may have been such a danger, but that is not the point. What happened? The unionists met together, and, just as we desire to have a White Australia, determined to stand out for a White California. They therefore adopted a white label, and decided that it should be affixed, with the consent of the employers and the unions concerned, to the products of those who gave reasonable wages and made cigars under proper conditions. The public supported the unions. They set their faces entirely against the sweating, improper, and dirty conditions that had obtained, and the white label achieved popularity. But unscrupulous persons, who were not adhering to reasonable conditions of labour, affixed the white label to their products, with the result that: the unions sought protection in the Courts Decisions were then given, which, in some cases, have been cited in opposition to our proposal. The Court said to the unions, " We cannot say much for the morality of the action of which complaint is made, but, viewing the matter from a strictly legal stand-point, we see no ground for protecting the unions. The white label is not at common law, apart from statute law, a trade mark in the strict sense of the term. The unions are not carrying on a business of their own, and we cannot consistently, with precedent, give them the protection they seek." What did the unions do? Finding themselves thrust aside in this way, they determined to appeal to the public to support them. They advertised in the newspapers that A, B, and C, whoever they might be, were the only persons authorized to affix the white label to their goods, and they asked the people to support them. That has been described as boycotting. It was. an intimation to the public as to who were justly and truly affixing the white label, to their goods. When the public found from experience that this was a proper system to support, the Legislature stepped in and passed a law dealing with the subject. A provision was passed similar to that which was agreed to by the. Senate, but which I thought too drastic, and not necessary in this country. I have entirely altered that provision, which was passed in the United States of America for reasons which will be obvious to honorable members, now that I have related a portion of the history of the matter, and which are certainly inapplicable here. I altered it because, as it stood, it would have given the unions here the same power as is enjoyed by unions in every State where the union label has been adopted - the power to give or! refuse permission to place the union label on all goods. What happened in America? The question was dealt with in various Courts. The hatters and clothiers took up the matter, and issued a union label in the same way as other unions had done. But in each case, unscrupulous persons applied it to goods which did not deserve in truth to bear the label. Time after time the unions went into Court, and were told that, from a strictly legal point of view, they could not. act as they desired. But gradually the sense of the people of the United States so manifested itself that in a few years Legislature after Legislature adopted the union label law. 1 wish to emphasize the . point that such a law was not passed by a chance vote in one Legislature. It was not the result of one rapid panic vote. Year after year the Legislatures of forty large, medium-sized, and small States and territories, having a. population of about 68,000,000, adopted that law. Is not that a strong manifestation of public opinion in favour of some such provision? There is another point which I wish to put to honorable members as a fair subject for consideration. We know that the American Legislatures, if controlled at all, are controlled not by the poor, but by the rich. We know that for some reason or other American Legislatures are, to a large extent, favorable to the large and wealthy corporations. If that be so, we may judge of the strength and the volume of public opinion which has forced upon those Legislatures the enactment of such a law. </para>

                        <para>- That is an important point. The Watson Government were only a short time in office, and had not very long to consider the matter. Whilst the Bill was before the Senate, what took place ? It was read a first time at the instance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> a member of the Watson Government, on 14th July, 1904. It. was read a second time on the 27 th July, 1904, and on 10th August of that year, while the Watson Government were in office, the part relating to trade union marks was introduced as an amendment by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> On the following clay, the first clause in that part was agreed to without a division. The remaining; clauses" of the same part were proceeded with, and the next one was also agreed to without a division. Then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> moved the insertion of a clause forbidding trade unions to refuse to authorize a manufacturer or employer who adopted the rate of wages and the hours of employment fixed in reference to the trade of such unions to apply the union trade mark to his products. That clause was rejected by a majority of ten. The remaining clauses were agreed to without division, and the Bill was reported to the Senate with amendments. On the 18th August, the Reid Government came into power, but the Bill did not leave the Senate until 30th November, some three and a half months later. During that time it was under the charge of the Attorney-General in that Administration, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator 'Symon,</inline> but there was no intimation that his Government were opposed to these clauses. On one or two occasions, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> gave expression to his own individual opinion, . and I would call attention to what he said. On the 7th September, 1904 - the proceedings are reported on pages 4335 of Vol. XXI. of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> - the honorable gentleman moved that the Bill be recommitted for the reconsideration of clauses 15, 72, and 93. Clause 72 was one of the trade union label provisions, and it was proposed to recommit it to enable <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> to move an amendment which would strengthen it. </para>

That he was not hostile to the amendment is shown bv the fact that in Committee he suggested words which would better carry out <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce's</inline> purpose, and, his suggestion having been accepted, the clause was amended accordingly. It is only fair to add that he said that he thought it a mistake to insert these provisions in the Bill. He remarked, speaking of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> - </para>

He expressed himself against the principle of the clauses, but the chief reason which he urged for the recommittal was that under the clauses as they stood, a manufacturer, although paying union rates of wages, and observing union hours and conditions, could not use the union trade mark unless a union saw fit to allow him to do so. That defect has now been cured. The honorable senator, however, was against the principle of the clauses altogether. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Josiah</inline> Symon, as the representative of the Government, would not agree to the proposed recommittal, and asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt. -Col.

But if this House had accepted the union label provisions, they could not have been again considered by the Senate. There is no indication, so far as ,1 can discover - other honorable members may be more fortunate - that the members of the Reid-McLean Administration, as a Government, were opposed to these provisions during the three and a half months which elapsed between the 18th August, when they came into office, and the 30th November, when the Bill was sent from the Senate to this House. </para>

                        <para>- No; but they had an opportunity to express their views as a Government in regard to its provisions, through their representative in the Senate. I have referred to these matters because it has been said in some not very well-informed quarters - I do not remember that it has been said by honorable members in this Chamber - that the present Government introduced the trade union label provisions. What we have done has been, not to introduce those provisions, but to make them as fair as possible, and great credit is due to the Labour Party for having honorably agreed to take a much less degree of protection for the trade union label than, is given in any State of the American Union. I have in- formed honorable members of the nature of the trade union label, and have given its history, so far as I can ; let me now consider the objections to it. The chief objection which has been raised is that, in America, it has resulted in boycotting. I think that what has happened in America has been greatly exaggerated, and that, if the American reports are consulted, it will be found that the boycott, whenever its existence has been proved, has been repressed. I use the word " boycott " in the sense of intimidation, or coercion, by an unlawful act of some kind. If honorable members say that it is boycotting for a union to openly and frankly appeal to the public to support it, they attach to the term a signification which I cannot accept. It is no more boycotting for a union to ask the public in a peaceable way to support it than for a candidate for office to ask his electors to vote for him in preference to his rival. But if there is intimidation, coercion, or oppression by any unlawful act, that is wrong, and, so far as I know, such proceedings have been universally and uniformly repressed in America, in England, and in this country. When the subject was first discussed, we heard a good deal about the American decisions. It was said that in America it has been decided that the trade union label is not a trade mark, that its use has been discountenanced by the Court, and held up to obloquy by the Judges. Case after case has been quoted from the American newspapers, and repeated <inline font-style="italic">ad nauseam,</inline> to show that the trade union label has been used in America as a,n instrument for boycotting. I have found no case, however, in which a decision has been given against the validity of the union label on the ground that it was being used for boycotting. What I have found is that unions have been prevented from boycotting, although, in one or two cases, the use of the union label was part of the facts stated. The instances to which I refer are of this kind : No employer can lawfully use a trade union label without the consent of the union, and agreements have been made whereby, in consideration of being allowed to use a union label, an employer has agreed to observe union conditions. Unions have been accused of boy.cotting by refusing to allow the use of their label to those who would not adopt such conditions. But the decision of the Court would have been the same if, without the withholding of the label, coercion had been used against a manufacturer, because he did not employ union men or observe union conditions. Then we were told that there were a number of cases after the Acts had come into force, and we were also frequently informed-though not lately, because that idea has been utterly exploded - that the American Courts had pronounced the Union Label Acts ss unconstitutional, and contrary to the United States fourteenth amendment, and also to the Constitutions of the States. I can say confidently that, in no case that I have looked at has there been one single decision impugning the constitutionality of these Acts. I challenge any honorable member to produce a decision showing that one of these Acts was Unconstitutional. If it had been opposed to the fourteenth amendment of the Constitution of the United States, no State would have had power to pass such an Act under any circumstances. And, therefore, we may rest perfectly assured that all that we have heard about the Acts having impaired the liberty of the citizens of the United States, and being contrary to the United States Constitution, is all moonshine. </para>

                        <para>- That does not affect what I say one bit. I maintain that every one of these Acts is in operation, and is unchallenged to-day. <inline font-style="italic">In</inline> case after case the Acts have been enforced, and have ever since their enactment been held to be valid, constitutional, and binding. I have a list here of some fifteen cases which have been tried - some before the Act, and some after it - and I wish to direct attention to the fact, which' is very instructive, that every one of these cases has arisen through unscrupulous persons counterfeiting the label. Before the Act was brought into operation, these offenders were able to go away, triumphing in the fact that in spite of their dishonesty the law was not strong enough to convict them - they were honorably acquitted on a point of law. These people have now been repressed, and in case after case convictions have been upheld. In the case of <inline font-style="italic">Colin</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">People,</inline> Illinois, 1894, 41 American S.R., 304, the conviction was upheld.

S.R., 637, the bill was filed in 1890, before the Act was passed, but the Court gave its judgment on the morality of the case, and although the label was not a technical trade mark, they accorded it protection. In the case of <inline font-style="italic">Schmals</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Woolley,</inline> 1898, New York, 73 Am.

I should like to read at this juncture what the Court of Appeal in Equity had to say on the subject. They had to consider the constitutionality of the union trade mark, and they made some observations as to the right of a workman to have a mark Indicating his workmanship. This was the judgment of the final Court of Appeal of the State - the highest Court of Appeal for such a subject - </para>

                    <para>The public object sought in the protection of trade marks is to bring upon the market a better class of commodities, and the means for attaining that object is by securing to those who are instrumental in supplying the market, whatever reputation they gain by their efforts toward that end. The workman by whose handicraft the commodity is made is one of these instruments, just .is his employer, who furnishes the raw material, and owns and sells the finished product; and if the former is permitted by the owner to place upon the commodity a mark to indicate whose workmanship it is, and thereby commend his workmanship to other employers, this license from the owner should be deemed a right- against everybody else. His aptitude in his trade is his property, and if by a mark he can have it identified as his in the market, he may enhance its saleable value, and thus secure the same sort of advantage as his employer by similar means. No reason exists why this advantage should not be protected by the Courts in the same manner and to the same extent as is the like advantage of the employer. The mere fact that one rather than the other of these persons has placed the product upon the market has no rational bearing upon the matter, for both alike have had the market in view in the efforts they have made, and through those efforts the market is supplied. </para>

                    <para>We understand from the bill that the members of the association represented by the complainant are connected together as journeymen hatters; that their skill in this trade, and their mutual assistance in profiting by its practice, form the motive and chief aim of- their association. The connexion is as clearly one for business purposes as is that of members in a partnership, or of stock-holders in a corporation. Although it is a comparatively novel species of relationship, it has become an established one, and therefore calls for the application of those general principles of law and equity which are applied to other species of business associations. According to these principles, we think a workman or a number of workmen engaged in the same branch of industry, and banded together for their mutual profit in the pursuit of their common vocation, may acquire a right of property in a trade mark designed to distinguish their workmanship from that of other persons, and that a trade mark so owned is entitled to the same protection as other trade marks. </para>

And it would be strange if this thing of value, this certificate of good workmanship, and which makes the goods made by them sell, and thus increases demand for their work, be entitled to no protection, because those making the selection and application are not business men, engaged in selling cigars of their own. The man who is employed for wages is as much a business man as his employer in that larger sense in which the word " business " has come to be used by statesmen and legislators. </para>

                        <para>- Not entirely repealed, except with the object of substituting a better Act. So far as I have been able to trace the matter, the States have gone on, clown to 1903 and 1904, passing these union trade mark laws, and in no case can I discover that they have receded. May I point out, for the information of honorable members, that in 1898 only twenty -eight of the States territories had union trade mark laws; but during the six years that have elapsed, the number has been increased to forty. Then it has been stated that the conditions in the United States are different from ours ; that in America they have no labour laws. I have heard it stated that there are no laws which in any way resemble our factory, anti-sweating, or industrial conciliation laws, and so on. In one sense, and to a limited extent, that is true. That is to say, I do not think there is any Act which, from the beginning, compels arbitration and conciliation. I am clear, from what I have seen, that with a very few exceptions there is no law fixing wages generally. But there is a huge body of labour legislation which in all other respects is quite as stringent as ours for meeting sanitary and humane conditions, giving protection to wages and to the labourer, and in some few cases fixing the wages, more particularly for work done for the State or for municipalities. I intend to briefly indicate the nature of these laws. There are laws in twenty-seven States providing for the appointment of inspectors of factories and work-shops, whose duties consist in visiting and inspecting factories, work-shops, mills, and, in some cases, mercantile establishments, sweat-shops, bakeries, laundries, and building construction work, and enforcing the laws concerning the same. In regard to mining labour, a very extensive set of statutes has been passed in the mining States. I can give honorable members the details if they desire them. Then the statutes relating to hours of labour which have been enacted in various States must be considered in five groups, namely - (1) General laws, which merely fix what may be regarded as a day's labour in- the absence of contract ; (2) laws defining what shall constitute a day's work on public roads ; (3) laws limiting the hours of labour per day on public works generally ; (4) laws which limit the hours of labour in certain occupations ; (5) laws which specify the hours per day or per week during which women and children maybe employed. The statutes considered in the first four groups relate to employes regardless of age or sex. Then laws exist as to the payment of wages - that is, the times and mode of payment - certain privi leges and special protection in relation to wages, such as freedom from attachment of wages, preference given- to wages, prohibition of deductions from or fines upon wages. In some States notice has to be given - in some cases thirty days' notice - before reducing wages. Four States have statutes in force fixing the minimum wage rate for labour on public works. In California and Nebraska the minimum rate is fixed at 2 dol. per day, the law in Nebraska requiring the work to be performed by union labour. Nebraska has a population very nearly, if not quite, as large as that of Victoria. A Delaware statute provides that the daily wages paid for a legal day's work to labourers,- workmen, or mechanics in the employ of the municipal corporation of the city) of Wilmington, or of any contractor or sub-contractor for public works for that city, shall not be less than the prevailing rate for a day's work in the same trade or occupation in the locality where the work is done. Then there are laws as to employers' liability, coercive boycotting, black-listing on the part of employers, and intimidation of employes and employers. A Federal trade union law, which was passed on 29th June, 1886, provides for the incorporation of international trades unions. " National trade unions," within the meaning of the Act, signify associations of working people having two or more branches in the States or territories of the United States for the purpose of aiding their members to become more skilled and efficient workers, for the regulation of their wages and hours, and for securing conditions of labour, or benefits such as obtain in friendly societies, or such other objects for which working people may lawfully combine. </para>

                        <para>- Under the Inter-State commerce sections of the Constitution, I think. That shows the extent to which Congress has gone. Whether its action is constitutional, I am not prepared to say. But the fact remains that in America the Federation has done what we are told it is improper to do - it has extended Federal recognition to trade unions. Then laws have been passed creating Boards of Conciliation and Arbitration. These bodies differ very much in many of the States, as well as under the Congressional law. They are appointed - in some cases temporarily, and in others permanently - and an opportunity is given to the unions to appear before them, f they do so appear, the decisions of the Boards are binding, and can be enforced. In my opinion it is not a valid argument <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> say that no labour laws have been enacted in America. As a matter of fact, very extensive labour laws have been passed there. I should like to ask honorable members who urge that in Australia we have industrial and factory legislation. and that, therefore, no necessity exists for the introduction of the union label, " What is the constant cry that we hear in regard to that legislation from those whom they represent " ? Are we not frequently told that such laws are injurious, that they are not effective, and that they ought to be repealed? Do we not hear that they do not prevent sweating, and that they only make matters worse? " Are we not constantly assured from those honorable members, and the section of the community whose views they so ably represent, that that sort of legislation ought to be repealed <inline font-style="italic">as</inline> quickly as possible? In the view which I am now presenting, the question at issue is not union as against nonunion labour. It is a question of the workers, as a great body, asking that the same recognition in trade marks law should be extended to them as is extended to those who are not workers. They say, " It is true that in. many cases litigation has to be resorted to to get our rights. It is true that in too many instances it is difficult to get exact justice without friction, and without irritation,' by means of arbitration. Tt is difficult to secure exact justice in many cases by means of wages boards. We desire an opportunity - but only with the employers' consent - to ask the people of Australia whether they are willing to support us. We wish to appeal to them peaceably, and apart from any restrictive enactments." That is a fair and strong argument. The unions cannot possibly succeed unless public opinion is with them. If my honorable friends opposite are right, and if the public are against them, the very worst thing they can do is to put a union label upon their goods. If public opinion is in favour of supporting union labour, is it not a fair thing to give it a chance of doing so? If the people are opposed to union labour, is it not a very good thing - from the standpoint of those who oppose this Bill - that the unions should have an opportunity to attach a distinctive label to their goods at the earliest opportunity ? If the public want goods to which a particular mark is affixed, why should not they have them? When we are told that only a minority of unionists desire the adoption of the union label, is not that a cogent argument that they will not boycott the rest of the people ? The unionists of Australia number only about 7 per cent, or 8 per cent, of the population. </para>

                        <para>- I am putting this argument apart from any feeling, because I wish it to be discussed upon its merits. If public opinion is opposed to the unions, the adoption of the union label will be fatal to those organizations. When we are told that there is no demand for a law of this character, except by a minority, is not that a strange argument to emanate from those who always stand up for the rights of the minority ? If we are to judge by minorities, how many people in this country desire to take advantage of the trade marks law ? Comparatively few. Only the large manufacturers, the importers, and the large dealers. We do not find the small shopkeepers and the country dealers rushing for trade marks. It is not a fair argument to say that it is only a minority of the workers who desire this legislation. I am not so sure that throughout the Commonwealth it is only a minority. But even if it be a minority, that minority will be perfectly helpless unless the great majority of the people support them. What would be the use of an ordinary trader putting a mark upon his goods if he did not expect a large number of people to favour those goods? To my mind, this Is a peaceful way of asking the public whether they will support the unions or not. The decision is entirely in the hands of the people. Then we have been told that the union label is a weapon of boycott. In the multitude of words warning this country against the danger of boycott, there is one little incident to which I should like to direct attention. I do not know who represent labour in this country. I have always understood that every honorable member in this House, more or less, represents labour together with other interests. But I think it will be conceded that if there is one section of this Chamber which distinctively represents labour, it is the labour members. When we are told by the opponents of this proposal that it will be used to injure the non-unionists, is it not a remarkable thing that there has not been a single petition presented to this House by them in opposition to it, and that not one word of expostulation by a non-unionist worker has appeared in the press? Not a single individual worker has stood up and denounced it. It seems to me only fair to say that labour members represent labour in all its forms far more distinctively than do any other honorable members in this House. </para>

                        <para>- If we look the matter fairly and fully in the face, we must recognise that, until it organized, labour did not have any fair rights accorded it. Capital is always self -organized, but labour is not. It has been said over and over again that " capital speaks every language," can transfer itself instantly from one country to another, can pass from one business to another, and is, in short, cosmopolitan. But labour is in a different position. It is not only native of the country - it is not only as a rule tied down to one country - but is nearly always tied down to the one place and to the one occupation. Until labour has organized it cannot hope to fight a fair battle with capital. I do not wish to do anything more than hold the scales, as far as lies in my power, fairly and evenly between the two. But it is a remarkable and noteworthy fact that from no quarter whatever has any objection beer, offered to this proposal, during the twelve months or more that it has been before the Parliament, by a single worker who is not a member of a union. </para>

We have been told that the passing of these provisions will lead to a boycott by labour, and the word " boycott " is used in a derogatory sense.

                        <para>- I am glad to hear it. I fully and frankly accept the assurance of my honorable friend. My acquaintance with the employers, and the courteous, frank, fair, and outspoken way in which they have always met me, leads me to believe that they would not lend themselves to anything of the kind ; but I wish to warn the country against accepting the statements of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walpole</inline> on all occasions. I do not think that on all occasions he properly represents the employers, and in many respects he may do their cause great injury. As this statement has been put before the country by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walpole,</inline> who may be taken by the people to properly represent the Employers' Council, I think that the latter would do well to see that such memoranda are properly scanned before they are sent out. I wish now to deal with the constitutional aspect of the matter. If these clauses, from a moral and political standpoint, ought to be enacted, then we should enact them-, unless, as I take it, we can clearly see that they are beyond the range of our power. Are they clearly beyond the range of our power? I should like to remind honorable members that, under subsection xviii., section 51, of the Constitution, power is given to the Parliament to make laws with respect to copyright, . patents of inventions and designs, and trade marks. It has been contended for a very long time by those who hold that the provisions now before us are unconstitutional, that the power of the Parliament in this respect is restricted to the passing of laws relating to marks which are used by the seller of goods to denote that they are sold by him. I have referred to some American cases which very considerably shake that view. One of the clauses which we passed last night distinctly departs from it. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. When honorable members look at the section of the Constitution to which I have referred, they will see that it gives us power to legislate with regard to trade marks. There are two separate words. It is possible to take a broad view ; it is possible to take a restricted one. Even if we take the restricted view, I am not sure that the contention that it is outside our power to deal with such a matter as this is correct. I should like to call the attention of honorable members to a point which does not seem to have occurred to some of the critics of this power. I refer to the fact that all we propose to say in regard to this matter is that a trader, a man who has goods to sell, is not to put upon those goods a mark for the purposes of trade or sale - which is practically the same thing in that regard - unless it is a true one. </para>

                        <para>- That has been done. We have not said that the unions are to be able to apply the mark to goods which do not belong to them. We have not given them power to apply a mark to goods ; but we have said that a man in trade, having a right to .sell his goods, may apply to them a particular mark, if it be true. I should think it would take a lot of argument to show that such is not a trade mark. It is a trade mark used for the purposes of trade. </para>

                <para>If we take a broader view of the matter-- if we remember that ours is a Constitution for all time - it seems somewhat remarkable to assume that for all time as a Commonwealth we are to be restricted to legislation in respect of just such trade marks as were used and known in commerce when the Constitution Act was passed. I think that the honorable and learned member for Angas wished to limit the power to common law trade marks. </para>

                        <para>- That is so. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Cussen says the question is one of extreme difficulty. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Jos'iah</inline> Symon said that it-was a moot question. When we have two distinguished lawyers, one saying that it isa question of extreme difficulty, and another, when in a position of responsibility, declaring that it is a moot question, are we, as a Federal Parliament, at once going to admit for all time that we have no power to pass these provisions? Surely it is right to consider the question on its merits. Surely it is right to deal with it from the stand-point of political justice ; and, if we come to the conclusion that it is proper, to place these provisions on the statute-book, leaving the only tribunal of which the Constitution knows to say whether or not we have the necessary power. We are told, forsooth, that this must mean costly litigation. It has been said in some quarters, and I think we find the statement in this morning's issues of both the Melbourne dailies, that the Employers' Federation object that the proposal will be costly to test in the Courts, though if is one that will affect the welfare of thousands and tens of thousands of the workers of Australia now and to come. That being so, how could we justify the exclusion of these provisions from our legislation, on the ground that it may cost <inline font-style="italic">£50</inline> or £100 to test our power in this regard ? </para>

                    <para>At that time the amendments were not circulated, but simply read to us; and now, after more careful consideration, I have come to the conclusion that the term " trade mark " in the Constitution is a term to receive an interpretation according to the varying conditions and requirements of the- time .as we progress. If we were bound by the interpretation put on the term by ordinary common law - that is, by the common law of to-day - we should need a new Constitution every few years. I think the marks referred to in the proposed clause come within the term "trade mark" in the Constitution, and that it is perfectly competent to insert those clauses in the Bill. </para>

The Constitution gives us power to deal with telegraphs, but it might be said by some that we have no power to legislate in respect of wireless telegraphy, because it was necessary, in connexion with telegraphy as known under the Constitution, that there should be a wire connecting the sender and receiver of messages. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly we can, so long as the mark is used for the purposes of trade, and answers a general description. In that view I am supported to a large extent by English legislation. I find, by reference to <inline font-style="italic">Sebastian on Trade Marks,</inline> that as far back as 1423, in the reign of Henry VI., it' was provided thai no. harness of silver should be offered for sale in the city of London " until touched with the touch of the leopard's head," and also with the workman's mark, under penalty of forfeiture or payment of double value. </para>

                        <para>- Similar laws were passed in the reigns of Henry VII., Elizabeth, James 1., and George III. Then, by an Act of 41, George 111'., it was provided that a free man of the Cutlers' Company might give his mark by will, and in default of a will, the mark should pass as personalty, subject to the widow's life estate. Therefore, the worker's mark was treated as absolute property, and passed to his representatives, lt also provided that gold or silver plate should not be sold or exported unless marked with the worker's mark. Even at the present day, the Sheffield marks and the goldsmiths' marks, which are purely workers' marks, are similarly protected by legislation ; so that there is nothing new in the idea. </para>

                    <para>In Malta there is no law or. statute establishing the registration of trade marks, and no authority exists from whom an exclusive right to a particular trade mark can be obtained. The rights of the parties to this cause are therefore dependent upon the general principles of the commercial law, some of which are referred to in the judgment of the Court of Commerce. These principles have been very fully illustrated and explained by the House of Lords in the <inline font-style="italic">Leather Cloth Coy. Ltd.</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">American Leather Cloth Coy. Ltd.; Wotherspoon</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Currie; Johnston and Co.</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Orr, Ewing, and Co.;</inline> all of which were cases which arose before the passing of the first British Trades Mark Registration Act in the year 1875. In the first of these cases, the interest which a merchant or manufacturer has in the trade mark which he uses was thus defined by Lord Cranworth : - " The right which a manufacturer has in his trade mark is the exclusive right to use it for the purpose of indicating where, or by whom, or at what manufactory the article to which it is affixed was manufactured." As soon, therefore, as a trade mark has been so employed in the market as to indicate to purchasers that the goods to which it is attached are the manufacture of a particular firm, it becomes to that extent, the exclusive property of the firm ; and no one else has a right to copy it, or even to appropriate any part of it, if by such appropriation unwary purchasers may be induced to believe that they are getting goods which were made by the firm to whom the trade mark belongs. </para>

                <para>It seems to me that his Lordship admitted that a trade mark may exist without being the exclusive property of anybody, and that when by any circumstance, as by some of the traders using, it, if it were common to the trade, dropping out, or parting with their interest, or from any other cause, it became publicly known as indicating the good's of a particular person, then that particular person had an exclusive right to it. But the judgment assumes that there may be a trade mark, that is, a mark used for the purposes of trade, even though no exclusive right in it is enjoyed by anybody. </para>

                        <para>- I think that those words necessarily carry that meaning. I should not be justified in occupying the attention of the Committee at any greater length. I have stated, as fast as I can, the various considerations which I thought necessary to present to honorable members. The provisions which I wish to insert are an honest attempt to accord to the workers of Australia the same recognition of their trade marks as is enjoyed by the capitalists of the Commonwealth, be they large or small. But there is something further - and I press this view as a final consideration upon the attention of honorable members who desire to promote Australian manufactures. As I said to the deputation from the Chamber of Commerce which waited on me, it is a great thing to enlist the manhood and the womanhood of this great Commonwealth in the cause of Australian manufacture. No goods can honestly bear the union trade mark unless produced in Australia. If we desire to promote Australian manufactures, to give work to Australians, and to provide a. larger home market for our producers, we may combine this consideration with the justice of extending equality before the law - including the trade marks law - to those who are rightly termed the workers of the Commonwealth. </para>

                    <para>- The Attorney-General presented his case very ably, and I trust that those who present the opposite point of view will be listened to with the attention and respect given to him. He spent a great deal of time in telling us about the union label and its use in America ; but he gave us very few reasons why it should be introduced into Australia at the present time. I am sorry that he appeared to cast a reflection upon honorable members on this side of the Chamber bv stating that there is a demand abroad for the repeal of the industrial legislation of Victoria and some of the other States. </para>

                        <para>- He asked whether there had not been a constant cry for the repeal of these laws on the part of the opponents of the union label provisions. I have not heard of any cry of that kind, and the remarks of the Attorney-General should not have been directed to men who from the very beginning have supported legislation intended to confer 'benefits upon the workers. Some honorable members on this side of the Chamber have taken a great interest in factory legislation and other enactments designed to confer advantages on the working classes. I have had occasion to defend factory and similar legislation when it has been cavilled at during my travels through other countries. I have represented that it is desirable that our workers should carry on their operations under fair and favorable conditions, even though we may have to pay a little more for what they produce. The Attorney-General stated that from no quarter had any objections been received to the proposals now before us, and that no public meetings had been held in opposition to them. That would not have been at all strange, in view of the fact that the Bill has been buried for the last four months, and was only resurrected on the 14th instant. The public had almost forgotten about it until it was brought prominently under their attention about a fortnight ago. Since then, however, I venture to say that scores of objections have been expressed all through the country. </para>

                        <para>- From shire councillors who are placed in their positions by the workers. Protests have been made by residents in all parts of the country against the adoption of the union label proposals, and we find that the great newspapers of the Commonwealth are almost unanimously opposed to them. Attempts have been made to associate some honorable members who are opposing the union label provisions with the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walpole,</inline> the secretary of the Employers' Federation. I feel sure that honorable members in the Labour corner would not care to shoulder the responsibility for all the utterances of Tom Mann, and other persons of a similar character, and therefore it is scarcely fair to expect honorable members who are opposed to the union label provisions to accept the responsibility for all the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walpole.</inline> I had hoped that at this stage of the session the Government would have divorced the union label provisions from the others in the Bill, and have held them over until next session, with a view to introducing them in a separate measure. No stronger reason could be urged for the adoption of such a course than that furnished by the speech of the Attorney-General. He has given us a great deal of information which we have had no opportunity of checking; nor have we had any chance to ascertain what can be said on the other side. Unfortunately, all the literature on the subject in our Library was borrowed by one of the Ministers, and was therefore not available to honorable members on this side of the Chamber. The trade union label provisions have not been shown to be necessary. They will certainly prove irritating, and possibly may turn out to be useless. Therefore, there is no reason why, at this stage of the session, we should block more important work in order that we may devote our time to passing a measure of doubtful utility. Ministers now stand in a false position, and would do better to postpone the consideration of the whole question until next session, when, honorable members could approach the subject with the fullest information at their disposal. These provisions have been to some extent sprung upon us. </para>

                        <para>- The history of the Bill is an extraordinary one. As the honorable member says, it has been on the notice-paper for two years, and yet we have not been asked to deal with it until the fag-end of this session, when important work still remains to be done. It first appeared on the notice-paper this session on 28th July, and gradually dropped down to the bottom of the list of "Government measures, where it remained for four months. On 8th November last, when the Prime Minister made an announcement as to the measures which the Government desired to pass before the session closed, he placed the Trade Marks Bill third from the last on the list. Honorable members did not expect that it would be brought forward with such a rush, or that the Government would have pushed matters to such extremes as they have done. Some marked changes have been made in the provisions of the Bill since it was first received from the Senate. I have no doubt that the Attorney-General has found it difficult to submit to honorable members just as much as he thought they would stand, and at the same time to satisfy his friends of the Labour Party. He has done his best to disguise the dangerous features of the provisions, and thus disarm suspicion, both in and out. of the House. The term " trade union mark " has been converted into " workers' trade marks." The term "trade union," which was used in the Bill when first received here, has been superseded by the word " union." Now a further change has been brought about, the term " union " having been altogether superseded by the word "association." Whilst the" form and verbiage of the clauses last submitted to us are different from those first proposed, the policy is the same, and in dealing with the clauses we have to treat them as if they were purely and simply trade union label clauses, in the form in which they were received from the Senate. Not only have the provisions been altered in the way I have indicated, but as was ably pointed out by the honorable and learned member for Angas, and the honorable and learned member for Corinella, amendments had been made in other clauses - apparently in the hope that they would escape notice - in order that the powers desired to be conferred in the first place should be granted. Our thanks are due to the honorable and learned members referred to, for the ability with which they have indicated the true meaning of the provisions to which I refer. The readiness with which alterations were accepted by the Attorney-General last night caused me to suspect that he knew all about the defects sought to be remedied, and made them good, only when he was found out. Very little has been said by members on the Government side in support of these provisions. The honorable member for Bland has spoken, but not a word has been heard from any Minister, except the Attorney-General. The public ave entitled to know why certain Ministers have changed their views since last session. The proposals now submitted for our consideration, although they were drafted before the Prime Minister announced his policy two years' ago, have not been embodied in any policy submitted to the country. No Government has seen fit to take the responsibility of bringing them forward. It was left to a private member of the Senate to introduce them. Since they have reached this House they have been nursed by the Attorney-General, and the honorable member for Bland has acted as medical adviser, and has careful I v watched over them to see that no harm befell them. We have a right to know why the whole of the business of the country is being turned upside down, in order that certain new conditions, the operation of which no one can foretell, may be introduced into our industrial life. I can only conceive of one reason for all this hurry, namely, that the members of the Labour Party are determined, before the session closes, that the principle of preference to unionists shall in some form or other be embodied in cur Statutes. Honorable, members must have a vivid recollection of the struggle that took place over the question of preference to unionists in connexion with the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The Government of the day, rather than accept a modification of the provisions contained in the Bill, elected to leave office, and now they have succeeded in bringing to heel those who formerly opposed them. If these provisions are passed, the Labour Party will claim that they have achieved a triumph, and no doubt they will have done so. They will say that they compelled a recognition of their principles. Of course, the Attorney-General, the Minister of Trade and Customs, and the Minister of Home Affairs are perfectly consistent, inasmuch as they supported the proposed provision in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. But it is only fair to the country that the other members of the Ministry, who, upon that occasion, told us that to grant a preference to unionists was -wrong, should rise and explain why they have changed their minds, and why a proposal which was then so baneful has suddenly become so salutary. </para>

                        <para>- It is due to the Committee and to honorable members who followed those gentlemen at that time that they should state their reasons for their changed convictions. If they still believe that preference to unionists is a bad thing, it is only fair that they should not make a party question of this proposal. It should be an open question with them, and they should be at liberty to vote in accordance with their convictions, If that were done, honorable members upon this side of the House would be quite content. It is not fair, however, that members of the Ministry should be compelled to vote under duress. The Attorney-General did not tell us that these provisions would prove of great benefit to those in whose special interests they are submitted. Only the other night the honorable member for Bland distinctly stated that he did not think any very great benefit would be derived from them by members of trade unions. His support of these proposals, he declared, was based rather upon the benefit which the public would derive. He said that the adoption of the union label would determine the quality of goods, and would protect the worker bv insuring that they were manufactured under fair conditions. How. </para>

                <para class="block">I ask, can it determine the quality of goods? The worker, as we all know, has to take the materials which are placed in his hands. Although he may put the best of work into those materials, the goods which he produces may not be of high quality. Indeed, it is probable that these union labels will shelter very inferior articles. If, for example, it were found that a union label was a popular mark, manufacturers, who were no better than other people, would take advantage of it, and use materials of inferior quality, thus deceiving the public. When the honorable member for Bland declares that the adoption- of the union label will insure that goods are made under fair conditions, I would ask him who prescribes those conditions? In Victoria they are prescribed by the Wages Boards, and in the other States by Arbitration Courts. The introduction of the union label will mean the application of Trades Hall conditions to the production of goods, and thus we shall have two conflicting sets of conditions established in this country. If these provisions are enacted, they may actually ruin all those who are working under State laws under good. conditions, and who are doing the best for their employers. We must not forget that upon more than one occasion the honorable member for Bland has expressed approval of the boycott. That fact, however, was carefully kept in the background by the Attorney-General. The fear entertained by the public is that the introduction of the union label in Australia will mean a boycott, the extent of which we cannot foresee. It has been said that all the States have not established Wages Boards or Arbitration Courts; but as this is essentially a State matter, it is the duty of those States which have not created those tribunals to come into line with the other States. It seems to me that the proposals under consideration will absolutely destroy the 'beneficent laws- under which labour is working at the present time. What conditions are laid down by the Trades Hall ? In this connexion, it is interesting to read the debates which take place there every week. Only three or four weeks ago, I find that a motion was submitted by Mr. Stephen Barker, in favour of the adoption of a six-hours' day. It was discussed at three or four meetings, and finally carried. </para>

                        <para>- No; in many of the deep mines in Victoria at the present time, the men are working six-hour shifts, and in some cases only four-hour shifts have been worked. But that has nothing whatever to' do with the union label. If the Trades Hall leaders declare that a union label shall only be applied in connexion with a six-hours' day, what chance will employers have of competing with the labour outside of this country ? Unfortunately, in Australia the same evil practice which has obtained in Great Britain for a long time past is being introduced - the practice of giving less work for more wages, in order that work may not be made too plentiful, lt is well known that in many trades in Great Britain the unions insist upon only a certain quantity of work being done per day, irrespective of whether or not that work represents a fair return for the wages paid. Even in this country, the unions insist that only a certain amount of work shall be done. That is an actual fact of which I have been informed by those engaged in industry. If our workmen are not to do the best that they can for their employers, how can the latter compete with the rest of the world? Then we shall find that those who do not work under Trades Hall conditions will be boycotted. If these provisions are not to be used in that way, it is idle to D]ace them on our statute-book. The inevitable result will be that .we shall get "clear goods of no better quality. What will happen then? The people will not purchase them. The ordinary purchaser will not pay a higher price for goods to which a certain label is affixed merely from sentimental considerations. He cannot afford to do it. The wives of the workers have to husband every sixpence that they get. </para>

                        <para>- Because we do not wish a wrong to be perpetrated. We do not think that those who claim to represent the workers in this House have a monopoly of wisdom. The Attorney-General, in defending the introduction of the union label legislation in America, showed that it was intended to cope with a set of conditions entirely different from those prevailing in Australia. Powerful trusts were grinding the workers down as low as possible, and they had to band themselves together, and resort to the use of the union label to protect themselves against, not only these trusts, but the enormous influx of coloured and other cheap labour, which was then pouring into the United States. We have no such conditions here, and why should we throw in this bone of contention ? Why should we pass provisions which will set individual against individual, and class against class, without conferring a benefit upon even one section of the community ? The people of America are between the upper and nether mill-stones. They are ground down between the trusts on the one hand, and the trade unions on the other. Had I known that this matter was to come up for consideration, I should have taken care, when in the United States recently, to collect full information, both for and against the proposal ; but I had other work to do, and, therefore, did not give special attention to it. I did not hear much about the union label, but was certainly informed that wherever it had been introduced the cost of living had been enormously increased. Within the last fifteen years the cost of living in districts where trade union label legislation prevails has increased from 20 to 25 per cent. </para>

                        <para>- The explanation is simple. The trusts, which must make their profits - and make perhaps more than they ought to do - have control on the one hand, whilst the unions have control on the other. Wages are exceptionally high, and every demand on the part of the trusts for increased profits, and on the part of the unions for higher wages, results in an increase in the price of goods to the general consumer. That is one reason why, without any desire whatever to block this measure, I would strongly urge upon the Government to withdraw these provisions. Let us pass those relating to trade marks, and thus bring a most useful measure into operation ; but let us refrain from dealing with the question of the union label until next session. By that time we shall have had full opportunity to consider it, and will be able to approach it with open minds, and possessing full information on the subject. We can point to only one country where these provisions have been in operation, and they were brought into force there because the situation required something of the kind. But such legislation has never been adopted in any other great industrial country. Having regard to the infancy of our industries, why should we rush these provisions on to the statute-book when we do not know what their effect will be? They may prove beneficial, whilst, on the other hand, they may prove a curse ; but once they are placed on the statute-book, it may be very difficult to repeal them. In our desire to promote the welfare of our industrial life, we must have regard to two considerations. We must remember the man who has to find the money as well as the worker. This class of legislation will deter investment ;indeed, I may say that it is alarming capitalists, and causing them to refrain from investing their money in Australia. We require settled conditions. Whatever our conditions may be, let them be settled, at least, for a time, and then the people will know exactly what their position is. As it is, they never know what special legislation may be passed that will have the effect of making, or marring, the industries in which they are engaged. We desire to have large manufactories, but who is going to start fresh undertakings? Under present conditions, no one will feel disposed to do so. Industries that should be forging ahead are languishing. We have not that industrial spirit, that desire to establish new industries, and that common agreement between employers and employe's that prevailed before the Labour Party came into existence. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that the Labour Party are doing much good for the country. Their aim is to discourage private enterprise, in order that they may carry our their desire to nationalize all industry. In the meantime, whilst this state of affairs prevails, who are the sufferers? Not the Labour Party, who come here to represent the workers,' but the workers themselves. The cry of the unemployed which we hear from week to week, for food and work, is , evidence of this. We must have some consideration for the men who embark in different industries. If we are going to play into the hands of the faddists who wish to nationalize all industries, Australia will never rise. </para>

                        <para>- Like the honorable member. I am only a worker. It seems to me that the trend of legislation in the Commonwealth is more and more to set individual against individual, class against class, and State against State. Five years ago, when the union was consummated, we fondly hoped that we were going to be one people. But although we have a political union, a union of heart and of feeling is further off than it was. Who are responsible for this state of affairs? The responsibility rests with those who control the affairs of the Commonwealth. It appears to suit some people to maintain this unsatisfactory position. I do not propose to say anything about the constitutional aspect of the situation. That is a matter which must be threshed out by the Attorney-General and the other lawyers in the House. But we have some three or four leading barristers in the Government who are constitutional authorities, and I should like to hear them indorse the opinion expressed by the Attorney-General. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. We find that the position taken up to-day by several members of the Government is very different from that which they took up a year or two ago. We know that the Prime Minister preferred to leave office rather than agree to the passing of a law which he considered would constitute an attack upon States rights. He was not prepared to allow the High Court to settle the question then at issue. Is he going to allow the High Court to settle the moot point now before us ? Surely there is no reason why we should attempt to deal with certain matters when our power to legislate in regard to them is in question. If the present policy of the Prime Minister is that which he advocated a year or two ago, he should allow this legislation to stand over just as he urged should be done in regard to the application of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill to the railway employes of the States. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cussen,</inline> a leading member of the Victorian Bar, has expressed the following opinion : - </para>

                        <para>- I believe it was shown that they could not constitutionally pass such legislation. Is the Prime Minister prepared to chance the enactment of these clauses, or will he follow the wise course that he laid down some time ago in connexion with the Conciliation" and Arbitration Bill ? Those who are opposed to these provisions feel that they will bring discredit upon the Commonwealth, and that they will force men to join unions against their will. We feel that the union label will bring into vogue a system of espionage, which will be degrading to those who take part in it. When we look the whole matter fairly in the face, we cannot refrain from asking, "What good will it confer upon any one?" If its value be so problematical, why should we waste our time, and cause trouble and confusion, by endeavouring to pass such legislation? We have so far only touched upon the fringe of the work that the Commonwealth should take over from the States. We have powers under section 51 of the Constitution that remain untouched - powers that should be exercised for the benefit of this great Commonwealth. But we are shelving great and important questions, and wasting time in the consideration of such miserable matters as those now before us. Judging by the opinions expressed in the press, the workers' label is not popular. It will be an instrument of coercion and boycott. It will force. non-unionists to join unions, and in a little time may lead to the introduction of the walking delegate. The benefits to flow from such legislation are so unreal and shadowy that I feel compelled to oppose it, and trust that the majority of honorable members will consider it their dutv to reject these proposals. </para>

                    <para>- In view of the very elaborate discussion which took place on the second reading of the Bill, and which has also occurred in Committee, we should, as far as possible, place a reasonable limitation upon our speeches. I do not consider that the Attorney-General consumed an unreasonable amount of time in his clear exposition of the reasons which induce him to move the insertion of these provisions. He put his case with good temper and ability, and with the usual clearness as to his meaning. I agree with him that, on some points, there may be a fair difference of opinion. One should not be too confident as to what is the law on any subject, and constitutional law is so broad, and, with respect to our Constitution, in such a probationary stage, if I may use the term, that only a juvenile in legal matters would be cock-sure in any expression of opinion in regard to it. But one may be permitted to express his convictions with emphasis without being dogmatic. I understand the prefatory apology of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cussen,</inline> a lawyer whose mature judgment we respect. There are few lawyers, no matter how eminent, who have not learned bv experience to be humble in judgment, and who, when their opinions are sought by solicitors or others, will not indicate that there may be some doubt on the point in regard to which they have been consulted. Indeed, it is not unusual for an opinion to end with the suggestion that the matter might well be referred to the determination of the Court. Therefore, I do not pay too much attention to the modesty of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Cussen's prefatory observations. Nor do I place much stress on the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Josiah</inline> Symon assisted a member of the Labour Party to perfect some clauses which were inserted in the Bill in the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Josiah.</inline> Symon, as well as an able, is a tactful man; and if he' sees that the <inline font-style="italic">suaviter</inline><inline font-style="italic">in ,odo</inline> will soften opposition, is capable of employing it. But his opinion in regard to the proposals which the Labour Party are now supporting are clearly indicated by the remarks read by the Attorney-General, who I do not think would contend that the action of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir</inline> Josiah Symon, in suggesting that the wording of certain clauses might be susceptible of improvement, was an adoption of the trade union label principle. It is the primary duty of members of an Opposition to criticise proposals with a view to the discovery of the truth underlying them; but when a principle has been approved, honorable members are justified in seeing that clear expression is given to the will of toe Legislature. Therefore the action of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Josiah</inline> Symon, in endeavouring to perfect the wording of a clause with the spirit of which he was in disagreement, is quite understandable. </para>

                        <para>- The time which I have determined, with the permission of honorable members - I have to make that qualification now that the new standing order has been passed - to devote to this subject will not permit me to reply to ali the arguments with which the Attorney-General endeavoured to buttress his case. Like all politicians, he appealed to the sentimentality of his hearers, and especially of a certain section. He enunciated several moral 'propositions and truisms which we cannot controvert any more than we can say that they have the slightest applicability to the subject under discussion. In this connexion I would remind honorable members of Burke's warning against the "delusive plausibilities of the moral politicians." The Attorney-General asked, at the beginning of his remarks, why, if a thing is morally right, we should not do it? But I have yet to learn that it is the duty of Parliament to express and sanction in its legislation every moral action. We must not prevent men from doing what is morally right, but we cannot enjoin by Act of Parliament the performance of every act to which no moral reprobation attaches. It would be morally right for me to walk to Adelaide, but it would be absurd for Parliament to legislate to require me to do so. Then, at the conclusion, of his speech, the honorable gentleman assumed that the electors who were opposed to the adoption of the nonunion label are in a minority, and asked if the principle that the minority shall rule is to be applied in the present case. The action of the Opposition to which he referred when he asked that question was taken wilh a view to emphasize the rights of a minority, not to rule, but to express its opinions. Correlative with that right of a minority is the right of a majority to rule until the opinion of the minority, if a sound one, has been adopted by the majority. But these moral propositions and truisms, like the " flowers that bloom in the spring," have " nothing to do with the case." So far as our powers 'to legislate on this subject are concerned, I think the matter has been fairly discussed, and I do not wish to go over ground which has been well trodden. But I do not think that it has been controverted that there cannot be a trade mark - except in one instance - divorced from proprietorship in the goods to which it is applied. </para>

The Attorney-General told us that, as far back as the reign of Henry VI., workers' marks were recognised : but they were the marks placed upon goods produced and sold by the man who applied them - the craftsman whose disappearance has been so much lamented by Ruskin, and who will not be brought back again to compete with the factory operatives of modern, industry while Parliament places legislation of this kind on the statute-book. As used by the guilds, trade marks, or workers' marks, indicated quality and finish in the goods to which they were applied. The exception which I have mentioned does not weaken the principle of the Trade Marks Act of 1905, that there must be proprietorship in the goods to which trade marks are applied. Proprietorship does not mean direct ownership ; but the Act declares that the manufacturer of goods who applies his trade mark to them has a proprietary interest in them by virtue of their manufacture, even after he has parted with the legal ownership of them to the retailer. We must be careful not to accept the statements of honorable members on this subject without the qualification attached by the trade marks law. I might refer briefly to some of the decisions mentioned by the Attorney-General, as having been given in America, as to the validity of union labels. I would point out that all these decisions have been given under States laws," they are States decisions, and as such they are incontrovertible. Under the Trade and Commerce section of the American Constitution, the Federal Parliament has assumed power with, regard to trade marks, and, I think, copyright, but that power, being connected with the trade and commerce clause, can only be exercised in relation to goods - and this is significant - that are intended for trade and commerce between the States, or "for export to foreign countries. The balance of the trade marks Dower remains with the States, and is, I believe, exclusive. Therefore,^ the States, wherever they have passed laws to allow of the registration of union labels, so as to protect them against piracy, have been acting perfectly within their constitutional powers. Congress could not have assumed such power under the trade and commerce clause. Upon the question of the Federal power, I wish to quote the opinion of one of the labour leaders of America, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Samuel</inline> Gompers, who was examined before the Industrial Commission on the conditions of capital and labour, in 1901. At page 629, of one of the volumes of that Commission's report, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gompers</inline> - who was the President of the Federation of Labour, but not a lawyer - said - </para>

                    <para>We realize that under the conditions of the United States a trade mark or label cannot be protected unless the party owns the proprietary right in the article covered by the label, transacts business with foreign nations, or with a tribe of Indians, and that makes it exceedingly difficult to overcome, so that we have not made any real, serious attempt to secure national legislation on that subject. </para>

                <para>That statement of a representative workman., who desires to obtain Federal protection for these labels, is certainly very significant. It indicates that no serious attempt has been made to secure such protection, because it is recognised that the Constitution bars the way. Again., the Federal power has been assumed, whether rightly or not, under the trade and commerce clause, which deals with goods which pass from one State to another or to or from foreign countries. Therefore, the trade marks power has arisen in connexion with goods, and the label divorced from the goods would not be recognised under the Constitution. That strengthens my opinion that the High Court may hold the provisions now before us to be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> of our power. At the same time, I admit that if the Attorney-General believes in the policy of placing such legislation as that now proposed upon our statute-book, he ought not to hesitate to go forward with it because there is a reasonable doubt as to whether our powers  extend  to sanctioning the use of trade-union labels. We ought not to commit constitutional suicide by refraining under a doubt with, regard to our powers. The Attorney-General appears to have abandoned all pretence that a union label may be used as a registered trade mark, but he intends to penalize any man who uses a label in defiance of its ownership by some one else. He could not, however, adopt these penal clauses, and give them efficacy, unless the Bill had been so framed as to cover union labels. The point of our observations at a previous stage was, that the variations from the English Act, whether they had been made deliberately or otherwise, although making no express provision for union labels, were of such a character (hat union labels would be brought within the scope of the Bill. Emphasis has been given to this view by the fact that the clauses now before us assume that union labels are covered by the Bill, and merely provide that penalties shall be inflicted' upon any persons who pirate such labels. It seems to me that it would have been far tetter if we had followed the Canadian and American precedents. In Canada, a Bill was introduced, for six or seven  years  in succession, dealing  specially  with union labels, because it was  recognised  that they did not come within the  description  of trade marks. That measure was called " A Bill to deal with Labour Union Labels." They stated in clear and  unpharisaical  language what they meant to do. Clause 2 of that measure provided - </para>

                <para class="block">That is clear, straight, and genuine; and there can be no mistake as to what it meant ; whereas we are being asked to make provision in a much less direct form, by merely providing for the imposition of penalties upon those who improperly use such labels. The first series of amendments introduced by the Attorney-General were a little more definite upon this point, because they defined a union trade mark. But now all definitions have disappeared, and all we have is a workers' trade mark. But, as if there were some unfortunate association attached to the word " union," it has now been dropped altogether, and the word " association " has been substituted for it. </para>

                        <para>- The Attorney-General professed to regard any interference with the proposed union label as an interference with trade, and he altogether ignored the association between " trade " and " mark." I should like to turn for a few minutes to the circumstances connected with the introduction of the union label into America, and the assumption that the conditions which might have justified its introduction there at a certain stage, exist here to an extent that will warrant us in following in the footsteps of the United States. I conceive that, at certain stages of the agitation between labour and capital, justification may have existed for resorting to the label as an expedient to tone down the oppressive action of capital. I mentioned, when speaking on' this question before, that Acts had had to be passed in America to prevent capitalists from excluding non-union labour from their employment. Therefore, the union label, as a -weapon of offence, might have had a sort of quasi- justification that could not be urged to-day under the conditions of labour and capital in Australia. We have been told that" the union label was first introduced in 1874 in connexion with the cigar-making industry. In 1868, between 11,000 and 12,000 Chinese were landed on the Pacific Coast, and many of them found their way into the cigar-making industry of California. The result was that a great, many white people were thrown out of employment, and great distress resulted. The condition of affairs at that time has been referred to by' Miss Helen Campbell, in her <inline font-style="italic">Prisoners of</inline></para>

                    She shows that the most appalling results followed from the competition of Chinese labour with the white workers in the cigar industry. She tells us that, upon going round among the tenements of the cigar-workers, she found a family of seven, three of them being under ten years of age, and all the children being girls, in a room measuring 12 ft. by 14 ft. The tobacco lay in heaps in the room; the place was filthy dirty, and was pervaded by a rank smell ; and it was almost inconceivable that human life could exist under such conditions.

                <para class="block">That is the admission of a friend of labour as to the comparative ineffectiveness of the American Statutes to protect, and give the desired status to labour. I think it is not without some reason that I allege that the conditions which prevail in America are not reproduced here. We ought not, upon the theory of moral right, to experiment in a direction, the development of which appears to have been somewhat unfortunate. At the same time, I wish to say that if the conditions in Australia were similar to those which obtained in California in -1874, I should hesitate before I opposed the adoption of the union label. Apart from the constitutionality of the matter - that is the word that we use in connexion with Federal and States powers - apart from the fact that the label does not come within the trade marks law, there is no broad opposition from the point of view of mere naked rights that can be urged against the adoption of this proposal. If it be true - as is stated in the evidence of some of the labour leaders in America - that their intention was not so much to perfect the conditions of manufacture as to strengthen unionism, and if their efforts in that direction have led to such extraordinary developments, I hold that with certain Qualifications rendered necessary bv the different conditions which obtain in the two countries, we may reasonably assume that similar results will be brought about here. It has been alleged that in America the use of the label leads to better workmanship, and improved conditions, from the point of view of the consumer. In this connexion, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brooks</inline> says - </para>

                    <para>It is hardly open to doubt that such action upon the part of municipalities would greatly strengthen the use of the label, at least until such time as the experiment was found to fail. Upon its theoretic side, the label stands, primarily, for " better pay and for improved conditions of labour." </para>

                <para class="block">Quoting from some of the leaflets circulated in America on behalf of the unions, for the purpose of inducing the consumers to purchase only union goods, the writer mentions that in some cases - for instance, in that of the Prospect Union, in Massachusetts - it does stand for excellence of workmanship. In this connexion he says - </para>

                    <para>The aim is, moreover, to make the label stand for excellence of workmanship, restoring something of the ideal of the craft guilds in their better =days. That this has not been done more generally with the label is clearly a weakness, especially if appeal is to be made to a larger purchasing public. It has been usual to claim for the label that it represented merely that the work was done under strictly union conditions. So far as these conditions - wages, hours, sanitations, &amp;c. - stand for higher excellence (as in many cases they do) it may be claimed that the label also represents a better quality of work. Further than this very indefinite claim, the label cannot be said to stand for excellence of workmanship or of product. The cigarmakers usually admit this, although they have an organization of extraordinary completeness and efficiency. . . . In the case of the hatters it is even more difficult to trace any relation whatever between the label and quality or improved conditions. Many shops, conspicuous for the high quality of their product, wages, and entire circumstances under which the labourer works, have never used the label, nor is there any likelihood of their so doing. </para>

                <para class="block">Subsequently he acknowledges the unfortunate developments which have characterized the use of the label, without at the same time denying that there have been gross abuses of power by the capitalistic classes as well. I should like to refer to one case which was mentioned by the Attorney-General. He sought to lead the Committee to- believe that some of the English Judges' had considered that there might be trade marks in use which were necessarily connected with the proprietorship of goods. The case to which he referred was that of <inline font-style="italic">Somerville</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Schembri,</inline> which is reported in XIV. Appeal Cases, page 453. In that case it was held that the mere fact that the label used by cigarette manufacturers had also been used by other trades did not affect its exclusive use by the cigarette manufacturers for the purpose of cigarettes. It was laid down that "exclusive use" did not mean that the label must be used only by one firm, but that it must be used only by that firm in connexion with the manufacture of a particular article, which is quite a different matter. In this connexion Lord Cranworth, page 457, says - " The right which a manufacturer has in his trade mark is the exclusive right to use it for the purpose of indicating where, or by whom, or at what manufactory the article to which it is affixed was manufactured." As soon, therefore, as a trade mark has been so employed in the market as to indicate to purchasers that the goods to which it is attached are the manufacture of a particular firm, it becomes to that extent, the exclusive property of the firm ; and no one else has a right to copy it, or even to appropriate any part of it, if by such appropriation unwary purchasers may be induced to believe that they are getting goods which were made by the firm to whom the trade mark belongs. Had it not been for the views expressed by the court of appeal in giving judgment, it would hardly have been necessary for their lordships to observe that the acquisition of an exclusive right to a mark or name in connexion with a particular article of commerce cannot entitle the owner of that right to prohibit the use by others of such mark or name in connexion with goods of a totally different character ; and that such use by others can as little interfere with his acquisition of the right. </para>

                    <para>- I listened very attentively to the greater portion of the speech delivered by the Attorney-General, and I think that the weakness of his case was shown by the length of his utterance. When he has a good cause he puts it very pithily, and occupies only about half the time that he occupied to-day. I regret that he scarcely touched upon the points in these proposals to which I take exception, and I may say at once that my objection to them has no reference whatever to unionism. I object to them upon general principles. The Attorney-General has said that these proposals will place workers and capitalists upon the same footing. I join issue with him upon that statement. It is impossible to put the two classes upon the same footing, because there is no analogy between their positions. The enterprise of the capitalist is based upon ascertainable facts and business principles. It is of general benefit to the community. </para>

                        <para>- I trust that the honorable member will allow me to develop my argument in my own way. The advantage of a trade mark is that it acts as a guide to qualitv. Having tested goods bearing a certain mark, the consumer knows for what he has to ask in order to secure the same quality. But a workers' label would be used for a different purpose. It would simply indicate the peculiar political tenets of a particular section of workers. </para>

                        <para>- We have had no experience of the workers' label in Australia. It would certainly give no guarantee of quality. Under the system adopted by mediaeval guilds, membership indicated skill. Men were allowed to join such guilds only when they possessed special training. But the workers' labels would not be an indication of the skill of those engaged in producing the goods to which they were affixed. I remember my father telling me, years ago, of a guild of wharf labourers in Aberdeen, the members of which wore a large bonnet with a red tassel, and were largely employed for general work. Each of the men, on applying for admission to the guild, had to undergo a certain test. If he could carry 5 cwt., on his back, up a flight of stairs. Tie was admitted. And so it was with the ancient guilds. A certain test was applied to determine the skill of intending members. They had to pass through an apprenticeship, so to speak, and that was a guarantee that those belonging to the guilds were specially skilled, and, therefore, entitled to some special consideration. But those who use these labels will not be required to pass any <inline font-style="italic">lest. The use of</inline> the label will divide the workers into two hostile camps. It will assist the partisans on either side to more effectually use their strength. The Attorney-General this afternoon read an extract from a document issued by the Employers' Federation, and signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walpole.</inline> In doing so, he unconsciously supported one of my arguments against the workers' label", because I hold that such a label will lead to the establishment of a boycott on both sides. I believe that the result will be "war to the knife." When this proposal was first introduced, it consisted simply of one clause, to provide a particular weapon, the union label. But now unionists and non-unionists are to be put on an equal footing. As the Attorney-General has said, there is to be no discrimination of class. I do not think that the situation will be improved in this way. The only outcome will be the supplying of both parties with more improved methods of injuring each other. I have no hesitation in saying that both parties will use it as an instrument of boycott. There would be at least a silent boycott; there would be a determination on the part of each party to avoid purchasing the goods of the other. The possibility is that in that respect the unions might be worsted ; it would depend largely upon the purchasing power of the partisans on either side. Apart from any consideration as to who might be worsted, <inline font-style="italic">my</inline> desire is that there shall be no clashing. Without offering one word against unionism, I would say to my honorable friends of the Labour Party that I think they make a mistake in rushing towards extremes. Every set-back which unionism has received in this State so far as I know, has been due to that. The honorable and learned member for Corinella last night anticipated something I had intended to say in regard to the Wages Boards. I heartily concur with his - suggestion that there should be a mark indicating whether or not goods have been manufactured under Wages Boards conditions. That would give us a clear-cut line on a national rather than a sectional basis, and no one could cavil at it. If the proposal were to provide for a label showing whether or not the goods to which, it was applied had been made under Wages Board's conditions, I should be distinctly in favour of it. But to go further than that is, to my mind, to set aside the elements of political economy. As the honorable member for Echuca has said to-night, the proposal is to bring in all <inline font-style="italic">sorts</inline> of devices to shorten the hours and to reduce the standard of labour. I have seen rules, in which it is laid down that men should walk to their work as slowly as possible in the employers' lime. That is the sort of device that would be resorted to as the result of this system. </para>

                        <para>- There may still be many people who do not take that view.' If the suggestion made by the honorable and learned member for Corinella were adopted, what justification would there be for going further? If we do go further, we shall simply pander to the idiosyncrasies of certain people. The workers' label will not be an indication of superior skill. The abandonment of the original clause, which confined the mark to goods produced by unionists, is an acknowledgment of that. The label will not be a mark of quality. </para>

                        <para>- One tests the quality of an article bearing a trade mark, and on finding that it is good, asks again for the same article. Briefly stated, my objection is that the label will not be worth anything to the worker, but will be simply a badge to provoke strife. It will be something worse than the orange and green. It will be of no value to the community, but will help the opposing factions to disturb the peace. I think it should be deprecated by every law-abiding citizen. If I had! my wray, I should legislate against any attempt to set class against class in connexion with such matters. With the passing of these provisions', the supporters of the non-unionists would, in my opinion, exercise a greater boycott than would the others. There, would be, as I have sa'id. a silent boycott. It would be a case of " Take only the goods of the side you espouse," and1 the whole matter would be settled in that way by the two opposing sections. That would not be for the benefit of anybody. It only aggravates the position to require the consent of the employe. As the honorable member for Echuca has pointed out, employers, if their men are squeezing out of them higher rates of wages than leave a certain amount of profit, might enter into collusion with their employes to increase prices. That has been done in California, under the voluntary application of the trade union label ; but it is now being, proposed here that we shall pass a law which will compel employers to obtain the consent of their employes to use these labels, and the two will have to work together against the interests of the consumer, who must always suffer if rates of wages are too high. I was impressed by an article by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Graham</inline> Brooks, which I read the other day, upon the co-operative method adopted in Belgium. There they have introduced the minimum wage, but have coupled with it the condition of a minimum product. They do not believe, to use the old Scotch woman's phrase, in a " muckle wage and wee work," and require a minimum production for the minimum wage. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member will not swallow anything which does not coincide with his own opinions. We are too prone to adopt laws because they are in force in other parts of the world. It is very easy to make a quotation from one and another authority in support of any such proposal ; but I recollect that in 1874, when the Californian law was brought forward, leading writers were of opinion that it was a great advantage that the trade union label could be legalized only by the laws of the States, and not by a Federal law, because if one State chooses to go to extremes, others, later on, seeing the mistake that has been made, will avoid following her example. What is now proposed, however, is to legislate in regard to the trade union label for the whole Commonwealth before we have had an opportunity to test the usefulness of Wages Boards and Arbitration Acts in each of the States. The unions, having failed to obtain a preference under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, put forward these proposals as another means of bringing all the workers under their control ; but, fortunately, the clauses have been altered, so that that danger may be avoided, and, instead of every one being made the mental and moral slave of a certain section, we shall have two parties competing one against the other. I do not see how the trade union label can be made to serve any useful purpose. . Its application to goods will not show that the workmanship in their manufacture is better than, the workmanship in goods not similarly labelled, and, as I think that conditions will be infinitely worse for' the working classes if we adopt these proposals than they are now, I shall strongly oppose it. </para>

                        <para>- I am. I followed the address of the Attorney-General pretty closely, and made notes, so as to lose none of his points, of which there were two to which he gave especial prominence. According to him, the crux of the whole matter is : How shall we legislate against the pirate? Under the law as it stands, apparently, any organization may register a label, but cannot prevent the use of that label without its permission. There was no meed for the Attorney-General to elaborate the statement of fact that the label is not now used because it is of no value.  </para>

                        <para>- I am aware that in Kalgoorlie - a very intelligent and enterprising community, but one far removed from other centres of civilization - the union label is in use, and the storekeepers there, who have not to fear the competition of similar tradesmen in Perth, encourage its use to secure the trade of the miners. Selfishness is at the bottom of the encouragement given to the system at Kalgoorlie, so that I do not think that what is done there should be advanced in support of the proposal to legalize the use of the union label. I wish to look at these proposals fairly, because, like other honorable members, I represent all classes of the community. I desire that the non-unionist shall not be hardly dealt with simply because he is not a member of a union. </para>

                        <para>- I am afraid the goods marked with the union label would be in demand, while those not so labelled would be tabooed by unionists. While we are prepared to deal with the complaint of the Attorney-General that labels may be pirated, I ask the leader of the Labour Party if he and his followers are in favour of inserting in the Bill provisions which will prevent non-unionists from being badly treated by unionists. The Attorney-General said that the legalization of the trade union label would promote the purchase and consumption of Australian goods, and in his peroration waxed warm in advocacy of the encouragement of Australian manufactures. But while we, on this side, wish to entourage local manufacture, we say that it is in the interest of the workers, both unionist and non-unionist, that there shall be competition. If the union label is to be used to bring about the exclusive consumption of Australian-made goods, it will put an end to that competition. </para>

The Attorney-General asked why the unionists should not be organized, but he had not a word! to say for the non-unionist, who, I am afraid, will_ suffer if the unionists are given, the right to register labels for use only on their own terms. </para>

                        <para>- He said that a union could adopt a label, but that as the label might be pirated, the proposed legislation is necessary. I see no reason whatever for objecting to the registration of union labels, provided that the registration will operate for the good of the general community, as well as of the workers. But what is the special object of the provision before us? Is it not designed to enable unionists to insist upon the use of the label by manufacturers, and to compel them to employ union workmen? Is it not intended, further, to enable unionists to expel non-unionists from employment, or compel them to join the union? The ultimate effect, will be that manufacturers would be prevented from employing any but union workmen, and the members of the unions would be precluded from purchasing any goods other than those manufactured by employers of union labour. I understand that this state of affairs exists at Kalgoorlie to-day. It seems to me that a manifest injustice would be inflicted upon non-unionists if they were subjected to coercion of the kind I have indicated. I am a thorough believer in the fullest liberty of action, and I think that a workman should be free to join a union or not, as he may think fit. We are told that non-unionists would still be free to refuse to join the union. That may be so, but they would have to face very serious consequences if they proved contumacious. Men might be compelled to join unions which partake of a political character, and might have to support candidates who hold views quite opposite to their own. The proposals now before us are distinctly of a class character, and are intended to be used for political purposes. The unions at present nominate candidates for Parliament, and actively organize in order to secure their election, and it is well known that unionists vote <inline font-style="italic">en bloc</inline> for their own nominees. </para>

He votes in favour of all legislation approved of by the caucus, and although he did not receive the labour nomination at the last election, he will probably be. the approved candidate upon the next occasion. As a matter of fact, I think the honorable member ought to join the caucus and become a straight-out labour man, because he is acting in the same manner as if he had signed the labour pledge..

                        <para>- I contend that they are comparatively few in number at present, and that, owing to that fact, they are all the more anxious to acquire powers which will enable them to increase their membership. The object of labour leaders all over the world is to force men into the unions. Tom Mann has openly stated that the objects of the unions in England and upon the Continent is to obtain power to force non-unionists into their organizations, by intimidation and coercion. It is for such a purpose that it is proposed to use the union label. The unions are aiming at the achievement of the highest form of political power. </para>

Why should the union label provisions be required, except as a means of forcing men into the unions ? </para>

                        <para>- He has used &amp; variety of expressions, which all convey the same idea. The Labour Party have decided to send a representative to Europe to attend the International Labour Congress next year, so that the aspirations of the unions here may be brought into accord with those of the British and European organizations, which are in the direction I have indicated. Is it not obvious that it is intended to force men into trade unions? Is it not equally obvious that if all men belonged to those organizations, no particular advantage would accrue to the employer who used a union label ? </para>

                        <para>- Certainly not. Man is not a chattel. Another objection to this proposal is, that if it be adopted, a skilled workman who is not a member of a trade union will not be permitted to act as foreman upon any undertaking. Only the other day a gentleman died in Adelaide, who was quite as well able to take charge of a thousand men upon a work as most individuals are to control a dozen. I refer to the late Mr. Puddy. who built most of the railways in that State. He was particularly well qualified to handle men, but he was not a unionist, and did not belong to a trade union. Yet, amongst the working classes he has been very highly respected during the past forty years. Under this Bill such an organizer would not be permitted to manage large undertakings. In olden times a foreman was expected to look after the interests of his employer more than of those who were subordinate to him. That, however, is not "the case here. The honorable and learned member for Angas dealt very fully and ably with the speech delivered by the Attorney-General, and I hope that the latter will read his address in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

                        <para>- I merely desire to put in. a plea for the non-unionist. I say, in justice to those men who have conscientious scruples against joining a union, that this provision should be amended in the direction of allowing employers freedom to employ whomsoever they may please. I suggest that a workers' trade mark shall not be registered if a trade association prevents, or attempts to prevent, its members from exercising freedom of choice in the purchase of goods, either of union or non-union manufacture. I ask the Attorney- General if that is not a fair proviso to insert ? I am perfectly satisfied that if no coercion is exercised, the introduction of the union label will not have so bad an effect </para>

                        <para>- Does the honorable member imagine that I am not concerned alike with the interests of unionists and non-unionists? Does he think that I come here simply for the purpose of talking? If I cannot accomplish some good for my race, I have no desire to occupy a seat in this House. I wish to see justice done all round. Therefore, I say that the unionist ought not to be intimidated by his union. Let us provide that he shall be allowed to spend his money wherever he may please. Let us insure that he shall obtain full value for his expenditure., If we do that, very little harm can result from the adoption of these proposals. It is not a good thing for the country to be dominated by a small committee of an organization. It is notorious all over the world that the ablest men seldom come fo the front. It is the " pushing " individual who gets there. The able, thoughtful, studious man, who sits back and thinks, is compelled to wait a long time for the call of " Friend, come up higher." Similarly, in the unions, we do not find the ablest men on top, but the extremists. We have only to read the labour publications to see that. </para>

                        <para>- It is the same everywhere. I hold that legislation of the character proposed is destructive of business enterprise. The Attorney-General said that the capitalists are organized, and asked why the workers should not be organized. I do not object to the organization of artisans, but I am certainly opposed to the capitalists being organized. The Attorney-General, however, put the matter fairly when he stated that their interests brought them together. They wish to gain something through the power of their capital, and they are organized to that extent. The worker is at liberty to join a trade union, and I do not object to every man joining an organization of that kind if he chooses to do so. But are we going to starve the women and children because the bread-winners cannot see that it is to their advantage to become members of a trade union? I ask the Attorney-General to accept an amendment upon the lines I have suggested, so that the evil effects of this proposal may be removed. </para>

                    <para>- I had hoped that my honorable friends in the Labour corner would have undertaken some defence of this proposal. Upon "the second reading of the Bill very few of them addressed themselves to the question of the introduction of the union label. Upon that occasion we were assured that in Committee their views would be placed before us, and their justification of these proposals would be made. So far, however, we have heard very little in the nature of any such justification. I must congratulate the Attorney-General upon the excellent speech which he has delivered this afternoon. When the honorable member speaks after preparation, his remarks - whether one agrees with his conclusions or not- are always worthy of the closest attention. If one thing more than another struck me during the delivery of his speech, it was the rapt attention with which it was followed by his colleagues, the Treasurer and the Vice-President of the Executive Council. Those honorable gentlemen were evidently looking for some justification for their action in swallowing life-long principles, and, doubtless, hoped that the Attorney-General's speech would enable them to turn a double somersault without attracting public attention. </para>

                <para class="block">In dealing with a political measure of this kind, we are entitled to ask, first of all, what is its object? It is not my purpose to deal with the legal aspect of the question. I do not think that much is to be gained by doing so. The matter should be left in the hands of as few as possible, and with the Attorney-General on the one side, and the honorable and learned member for Angas and the honorable and learned member for Corinella on the other, I think that it will be sufficiently debated. I wish to ask why these proposals have been put before us - why we are asked to support what is known as the union label. I invite honorable members to cast back their minds to the events of last year, and to recollect the fierce struggle which took place in this House in connexion with various provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. Honorable members will remember that there was a fierce conflict over the proposal to grant preference to unionists. We who opposed it said that its object was to force men into unions, so that those organizations might be built up numerically and financially, and that as they were largely political machines, used by one section of the people, they should not be strengthened at the expense of all other sections. That was the objection winch" was frequently voiced, and with- the assistance of the present Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, and the Postmaster-General, we succeeded in almost annihilating preference to unionists. I think honorable members will admit that it was practically killed. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable members will recollect that preference to the members of a union having political objects was also prohibited. A proposal in that direction was scotched by us, with the assistance of the members of the Ministry to whom I have referred. Being free agents, and not having, as far as I am aware, covetous eyes on the Treasury benches, they voted for amendments which had the effect of practically annihilating the principle. It was at that time that we heard so much of what is known as the caucus, and of the dangers of machine government. Reference was made to them in eloquent speeches in this House, and in still more brilliant utterances at Ballarat. We were told that my honorable friends of the </para>

But all this has been changed. If I may use a well-worn, simile, "Barbarossa has had to do penance." Those who helped us to annihilate preference to unionists are now supporting a proposal that will have the same effect, but will be devoid of the safeguards attached to that principle in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Preference to unionists under that Act cannot be awarded except by an order of the Court. Therefore a Judge must, in the first place, hear the <inline font-style="italic">-pros</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">cons</inline> of the question before application for such preference can be granted. There is no such safeguard offered in connexion with the provisions which we have before us. There is some justification for the demand for preference to unionists under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, because the organizations which bring disputes 'before the Court have to bear the cost of presenting their case, and their funds are liable to attachment if any of their members fail to observe the award of the Court. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member scarcely does me justice. I did not forget it, but thought that it was outweighed by arguments on the other side. I do say, however, that that argument deserves consideration, and it was certainly advocated with all the fervour that my honorable friends in the Ministerial corner possess. But it does not apply in the present case. There is no question of an organization or union incurring large expenditure in bringing a claim before the Court to apply a union label, nor is there any question of its funds being attached in the effort to do nob only its own members, but other persons, good service. So far as these provisions are concerned, we have therefore a complete change of front on the part of the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, the Postmaster-General, and_ the Vice-President of the Executive Council. They are eating the leek. Indeed, the Treasurer and the Vice-President of the Executive .Council are swallowing it whole, and are endeavouring to hide from the public the wry faces they are making in the attempt'. The proposal to legalize the union label seems to. me to be one to legalize the boycott. I have given careful and exhaustive study to the multitude of pamphlets, papers, reports, and so forth that have been written and printed upon this question, and I say, unhesitatingly, that the inference must be drawn from thorn that a boycott or an attempted boycott is necessary to the effective use of the union label. Wherever the attempt has been made in the United States, a boycott has inevitably followed. The means adopted by the unions to establish the union label, and so to strengthen their ranks, are in essence and in fact a boycott. The first method adopted is to persuade all unionists to buy only those goods which bear the union label. The next attempt is to force them, if need be, not to buy from a retailer who sells articles that do not- bear the label. By every means in their power they seek to extend the feeling that those who make, sell, or handle goods made by non-unionists should not be patronized. The action of the hatters', the cigar-makers', and other unions, to which reference has been made, shows that the usual forms of address issued by the various trade unions and federations of labour are, " Do not purchase such and such goods," "Do not purchase articles made by such-and-such a firm." " Do not purchase articles unless they bear the union label." By direct and indirect means the boycott is set up in respect of all good's that do not bear the union label. This has just the same effect as has preference to unionists, except that the boycott takes a more drastic and deadly shape. Unlike preference to unionists, it has not the sanction of a Court. </para>

                        <para>- I invite the honorable member to consider the case, say, of the Bootmakers' Union. Let us assume that it applies the union label to goods manufactured by its members. Then bootmakers generally are urged to buy only union-made boots bearing the union label, and every other union issues the same request to its members. That is the first step, and it is iri itself a kind of boycott. The next step is to urge unionists not to buv from any retailer who handles good's which do not bear the union label. Forty or fifty unions comprise a goodly section of consumers in certa'in portions of this State, and if their members determine to buy only union-made goods, and to boycott any individual who has invested in a business which handles non-union articles, the position becomes serious. </para>

Hallanan  is the manufacturer of a patent rubber horseshoe pad, which he alleges was in common use in this city until the commencement of the boycott. He became involved in a dispute with the  Horseshoers  Union of New York over the placing of the union label on the output of his factory. On his refusal to comply with the demands of the union a boycott was declared against his goods, and all the  horseshoers  in this city are alleged to have refused to handle the rubber pads made in his factory. Hallanan made an application to the United States Circuit Court for an injunction and restraining order, which was granted by the court, and an order was, issued directing the defendants to appear in court to show cause why a permanent injunction should not be granted. </para>
                    <para>After hearing the evidence in the case, Judge Beatty ordered that the restraining order be continued, holding that the testimony had borne on the allegations of the plainiff, and that the boycott on the article which he manufactured and put on the market as a commodity was unlawful, inasmuch as it tended to injure his business. </para>

                    the author of a well known article on the subject, also shows how the union label is used for the purpose of keeping men " good " on the union books, and building up the funds of the unions. We must recollect that, in Victoria at least, the unions have political as well as industrial objects. The effect of the legalization of the union label will be that men will be forced to join unions whether they wish to do so or not. Thus the unions will be strengthened, both numerically and financially, and the political organizations of one section of the community will be built up at the expense of all other sections. The Attorney-General, in his exhaustive speech, endeavoured to make the question at issue fair wages or unfair wages, by assuming that goods made by unionists are always made by men getting fair wages, while goods made by non-unionists are, in like manner, made by men who are not getting fair wages. All through the discussion, the supporters of these proposals have assumed that those who are not members of unions do not receive fair wages. While that may be true in some parts of the world, it cannot be true of industries which are under Wages Boards or Arbitration Courts. In Victoria there are forty trades under Wages Boards, while in New South Wales all industries are subject to the awards of the Arbitration Court.

                        <para>- It cannot be said that the union label is necessary to distinguish sweated from unsweated labour in the productions pf industries which are under Wages Boards or an Arbitration Act, because sweating cannot take place in those industries. If the desire were to legalize the union label merely to distinguish between sweated and non -sweated labour, no doubt the proposals would be accompanied by a clause providing that they are not to apply to industries under Wages Boards or Arbitration Acts. But there is no such clause, and honorable members opposite are not likely to vote for such a provision, because their intention is not, primarily, to improve the conditions of labour, but to strengthen the political labour organizations. For that reason they will doubtless prevent the Government from accepting any amendment in the direction I speak of. The speech of the Attorney-General is more ingenious than ingenuous. It was based on the assumption that the union label is being brought forward to distinguish between goods the product of sweated and goods the product of non-sweated labour. Whereas in truth and in fact the label will do nothing of the kind. He is distinguishing between men who belong to unions, and those who do not, to the prejudice of those who, for various reasons, do not care to associate themselves with the labour organizations. It is making the lot of those outside the fence harder than it is at present. If the union label be brought into operation, it will tend to force men out of employment, or into the unions. A remark of the secretary of one of the unions is recorded, to the effect that all the men employed in the industry with which he was connected, were in the unions. No non-unionists were working, because such of them as were left were in the hospitals.r I do not suppose that any such state of affairs will be brought about in Australia, but that apparently expresses the spirit which actuates some of those who - desire to impose upon us the union label provisions. They aim at forcing off the earth all those who, for reasons satisfactory to themselves, refrain from joining unions. All our Australian legislation is based upon the assumption that it is desired to treat all classes of the community alike. That is why we call ourselves a democratic community. But proposals of this kind make class distinctions, and are designed to place in the hands of unionists a means of oppressing those who do not belong to their own organization, and of making their position in life more difficult than it is. It is because I do not believe in these differentiations, or in creating any privileged class, that I regard these proposals as specially dangerous. Experience in the United States shows us that the concomitant of the union label is not only a boycott of workmen, but a boycott of retailers. The system creates the greatest ill-feeling, and the greatest mischief wherever it is introduced, and once provision is made for it upon our statute1book, it will be difficult to remove it. I do not profess to deplore the fact that it may be necessary to bring this , matter before the Courts, nor am I going to predict what will be the result. I have great faith in the opinion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cussen,</inline> who has been mentioned by the Attorney-General, and I think that his view ought to receive the fullest consideration. I do not base my opposition to this proposal upon that opinion. We should be inflicting a great wrong if we brought about any class distinction by making it more difficult for certain men to earn their living. I voted consistently against the union preference provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill last year. I then found myself sitting side by side with half of the members of the present Ministry. At present those gentlemen are eating the leek, but I believe in sticking to my principles, at all costs, and I shall do my best to defeat these proposals. </para>

                    <para>- I have listened in vain for anything approaching an adequate reply to the verv able speech of the Attorney-General. The honorable and learned member for Angas indulged in some very fair criticism, but he had to admit the force of the Attorney-General's arguments. Other honorable members have taken flights into the regions of romance. Whilst listening to the honorable member for Robertson, I began to doubt whether I knew anything whatever about trade unions. I certain! v have never experienced anything of .the kind that he has described. I have never heard of any of that coercion of employers to which he has referred. All such talk is sheer nonsense. If the unions are so influential as the honorable member represents them to be, and can exercise so much coercion, why are their members working for wages, instead of running the country? If every member of a union were coerced into joining it. the organizations would soon fall asunder, because the units would be mutually repellent. Pressure, which may, in some instances, be called coercion, has been brought to bear upon individuals, but it is absurd to say that that would apply generally. We are not here to deal- with extreme cases that no one would attempt to justify. No attempt has been made to controvert the fact that the public opinion of the United States, as expressed in the laws of that country, shows that the majority of the people regard the trade union label as an excellent institution. Honorable members have been hunting round for some time past for cases that could be quoted against it. The honorable and learned member for Wannon has mentioned some vague decision with regard to a case of boycotting, but that is a poor reply to the mass of evidence that has been adduced by the Attorney-General. Experience gained in the United States affords the fullest support to the proposals now before us. No mention is made in the clauses under consideration of the trade union label. The Attorney-General has evidently been endeavouring to please the Federated Employers' Union and the members of the Opposition, whom it is impossible to satisfy. </para>

                        <para>- I am just about to do so. Unfortunately, the clause before us does not deal with union labels, but I shall assume, for the sake of argument, that it provides for the use of union labels similar to those adopted in America. In the event of a union adopting a label, the employer who believed that his business would be extended by the use of such label would apply for the right to affix it to his goods. What actuates the employer is his own self-interest, and no force is brought to bear upon him. He looks upon the label as a means of securing additional business. As the result of friendly negotiations, in most cases the employer's application would be granted after an understanding had been arrived at with regard to wages, hours of work, and labour conditions generally. It has been stated that the union label provisions would operate detrimentally to non-unionists. That term has been improperly applied to all men who are outside of the unions. Those who are referred to in harsh terms by the members of labour organizations are the non-unionists who work alongside unionists, and who take advantage of all the benefits secured by their organized fellow employes. There are a number of men outside unions who are not necessarily non-unionists. They may be thorough unionists in spirit, but they may not find it to their interests to form themselves into organizations, or possibly the conditions may be unfavorable to their doing so. I would point out that after the passing of the Conciliation -and Arbitration Act in New South Wales, a great number of men, who had formerly been unorganized, formed themselves into unions, not as the result of coercion, but because they found it would be of advantage to them to do so. </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking of industries in which there were no organizations among the employes. No question of coercion or preference or anything of the kind was involved. They formed themselves into unions in order that they might represent their case to the Arbitration Court and obtain redress of their grievances. I have no sympathy whatever with the individual who is opposed to unionism, but I admit that we are entitled to consider those who are not members of trade organizations. Under these proposals what will happen? An employer will put a union label upon his goods, because he knows that by so doing he will secure an increased business. The fair employer will gain that additional measure of business at the expense of the "sweater." The moment his sales are increased he will have room for additional hands. Where will he get them? Obviously from the ranks of the non-unionists of whom the honorable member for New England speaks. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to deal with one subject at a time. I say that the adoption of the union label will secure an additional business to the fair employer, and will decrease the evils of sweating. What has been the experience in Australia ? For years past a preference has been given by many individuals to union employers. When a union is first established, it usually requires certain printing to be done. In that instance a preference is naturally given to the union printer. So it is in other branches of industry. When I started housekeeping in Sydney, before the Arbitration Act came into force, one of the first things that I did was to find out a union baker. I knew that there were union employers in the baking trade, who were paying their employes <inline font-style="italic">£2</inline> 12s. per week for forty-eight hours, whilst non-union employers were paying their workmen only 36s. per week for ninety hours. </para>

Let me supply another illustration from my own experience. When the employes of Messrs. Bur.gon and Ball desired to form a' union, that firm, which was engaged in the manufacture of sheep shears, locked them out. I wrote to the employes, advising them to form a co-operative union, and to manufacture the shears themselves, promising that if they produced a good article they should have our trade. They acted on my suggestion, and soon captured the Australian market. </para>

                        <para>- The Trades Union Sheep Shears Co-operative Society Limited. It is located at Sheffield, England. During the course of this debate, the statement has been made, without .any justification whatever, that if these proposals are adopted, coercion will be exercised by the trades unions. It has been urged that the trades unions will pass rules compelling their members to purchase their wares from employers who use the union label. In the case which I have cited, no such compulsion was exercised. But the loyalty of the men naturally induced them to give a preference to the particular article produced by the society in question. That sort of thing is done every day. We select the best tradesman available, and1 give him a "preference." That is the correct term to apply, and the word " boycott " in this connexion is a misnomer. Why should a union be prevented from registering a trade mark if it desires to do so ? Why should not an employer have a right! to place a union label on his goods? There will be no coercion used. </para>

                        <para>- I am satisfied that they will be just as ready as are employers in the United States to use the union label. In this connexion I would give the employers a hint. Let us take, for instance, the jam industry. The first jam manufacturer who applies a union label to his goods will double his business during the first season. The members of the Shearers'' Union, for instance, would buy such a jam in preference to any other. I "mention this commodity because it is one of those articles that are largely used in the back-blocks. Employers will find that it pays to use the union label. There are thousands who, like myself, wish to know where the goods which they consume are made, and how they are made. A friend of mine the other day was speaking to a gentleman who was denouncing the union label proposals now before us, and, after listening to him for a time, he said, " Where were your boots made ?" The gentleman replied, " In America.'' "Then," said my friend, "if you examine 'them, you will find that they bear a union label." He did so, and my friend's prediction was verified. </para>

                        <para>- Many shire councillors and others who denounce these provisions are wearing boots bearing the union label. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Walpole</inline> sends out circulars to municipal and other organizations, and, because half-a-dozen of them support his views, we are told that public opinion is against this proposal. The <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> attacks the union label; and that in itself is said to show that public opinion is opposed to it. We have been asked. What will be the position in the States where arbitration laws prevail ? We have an Arbitration Act in force in New South Wales, and factory laws are in operation in Victoria. Manufacturers in those States export largely to other parts of the Commonwealth, and those who are among the first to place a union label on their goods will secure a big business throughout Australia. We should leave the question an open one. Those who desire to use the union label should have a right to use it. I have heard nothing to justify the suggestion that we should prevent the use of such a mark. As; one who is within the inner circle of trade unionism., let me mY at once that there is absolutely no ground for the doleful predictions which have been made. There is no foundation for the suggestion as to boycotting. An illegal boycott is practised by employers, and has been practised by them for many years, but I have never heard those who oppose these proposals denounce it. True, when we refer to it, they reply that they do .not approve of it, but they have never taken any decisive action to emphasize their disapproval. I fail to see how it would be possible, as the result of the passing of these clauses, to bring into play a system of boycott which would inflict injury on the people. We are told that a man who prefers to use goods bearing the union label boycotts nonunion goods. It might just as well be said that the sentiment so freely expressed today in favour of Australian goods for Australian people amounts to a boycott. In various places public meetings, have been held, urging the people to buy Australian goods ; and now when one orders a suit of clothes, one takes care to ask : " Is this Australian-made tweed," or "Australian-made serge," as the case may be. What is that but a boycott, if such a term is to be employed. But I hold that it is a misnomer. The proper word to use is " preference." Probably our State Legislatures will compel manufacturers to so stamp their goods as to show by whom' they have been made. There are thousands in Australia who, if they could, would give a preference to Australian-made articles. They need something to assure them that they are buying locally-made goods, and we say that anything that prevents deception in this respect serves a useful purpose. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. Prior to the passing of the law requiring that to be done, one had to accept the word of the shopkeeper. But if a registered mark be placed on goods, we shall secure certainty in this regard. I propose to quote an extract from a sermon delivered by a clergyman, in Baltimore. A clergyman is one who is not usually regarded as taking sides. Indeed, I hold it is wrong to speak of sides in this connexion. Instead of seeking to drive capital and labour further apart, we should endeavour to secure mutual agreement between, them. In the United States an employer is allowed to use the union label because he observes fair conditions of labour. Does not that in itself suggest that the system tends to bring about harmonious relations between the two parties? Instead of driving employer and employe apart, -the union label legislation of the United States has caused a better feeling to prevail. It certainly must extend unionism, but every honorable member of the Opposition has expressed himself in favour of unionism. </para>

                        <para>- Unionism can only be voluntary. How would it be possible to keep a body of men together by coercion. If some honorable members of the Opposition had had experience of these matters, they would know that it is unnecessary to talk of coercion. The honorable member for Parramatta said that he was opposed to these clauses, because he did not think they would tend to swell the ranks of unionism. </para>

                        <para>- That is only another way of putting it. The union label will certainly tend to increase unionism, because the employers who avail themselves of it will increase their business, and so add to the work to be carried out in their factories. I know that, in connexion with some trade union movements, attempts have been made to coerce men, but I challenge any one to disprove my statement that the movement generally is a voluntary one, and that, in a free country, it can exist only because it is voluntary. Those of whom we speak as non-unionists are men who consent to be hired to displace others who are on strike. There is no difficulty in inducing the great mass of the workers in a trade to join a union organized in connexion with it, </para>

                        <para>- Certainly. The most notable feature of the trade union movement in America to-day is the decrease that has taken place in the number of strikes. A large federation has been formed to mediate in disputes between employers and employes ; the profit-sharing system has also been introduced, and, whilst the union label has admittedly strengthened the membership of unions, it has led to a more harmonious state of affairs as between capital and labour. Some few years ago those who follow up the trade union movement closely were alarmed at the outlook in the United States. A social upheaval seemed imminent. Many strikes were taking place, and in connexion with those disputes arms were used and blood was shed. But during the last year or two the outlook has become more hopeful. I contend that trade unionism has been largely responsible for the change. </para>

                        <para>- The building up of big trusts is going on quite apart from trade unionism. The union label will prove beneficial to employers, for there are many who, like myself, wish to avoid sweaters just as we should avoid any bad character. It will (enable the employer to secure the market, and thus assist him in paying fair wages. At the present time the man who pays fair wages suffers from the competition of the man who pays unfair wages. </para>

                    <para>What can be more sacred or more deserving of the reverence of men than the Union Label, which signifies that human life has been more highly valued in the production of commodities than the mere profits sought for by greed? </para>
                    <para>The label is an emblem of justice, of fraternity, of humanity. When you find a label on a garment, or a plug of tobacco, or a box of cigars, or a loaf of bread, or a piece of printing, you can be sure that none of them was made in a sweat-shop, that no little children's fingers were compelled to sew, or to sort tobacco, in the hours of the night intended for childish sleep. When you see the Union Label on any commodity you can buy it with a clear conscience, knowing that in so doing you are not becoming partner to any institution that degrades humanity for private profit. You can sleep soundly also, and not be worried with thoughts of typhus fever, smallpox, or leprosy, which are so often . scattered broadcast from Chinese opium dens, convicts' cells, and tenement sweat-shops, where the most degraded specimens of humanity put their life's blood into marketable goods, from which the poor unsuspecting public suffers all manner of foul and loathsome diseases. </para>
                    <para>The Union Label is a religious emblem. It is a religious act to buy goods to which a label is attached, an act blessed on earth and honoured in Heaven, while it is a sin to buy a plug of tobacco, a cigar, a piece of clothing, a pair of boots, or a loaf of bread without a label, for then you do not know but what you are building up the business of some heartless tyrant, who is extracting a fortune from the drudgery and degradation of his fellows, at the risk of public health. </para>
                    <para>God bless the label ! And I hope that all of - you will carry indelibly impressed upon your minds the pictures of the Union Label, and that you will always know that the favorite banner in Heaven represents justice to Labour, fresh air and sunshine and healthful conditions to those who toil, and the truth that human life is of greater moment than gain of gold. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>I leave it to honorable members to justify their opposition to the label which is so highly spoken of in that passage - and the opinions there expressed represent the opinions of the general public of the United States, because of the good which has been seen to result from the use of the union label. </para>

That is not logical reasoning. Most of us would prefer to patronize the best if we could recognise it, to help the fair employer, and to stamp out the sweater, by purchasing the goods of the one and refusing those of the other, until all1 are compelled to act as decent men. and to comply with fair and reasonable conditions. </para>

                    (New England).I have always stood firmly for the equal rights of all men, whether they are unionists or non-unionists. If that is not true and perfect democracy I do not know what is. I do not wish to prevent men from joining unions if they desire to do so, but I feel that they should not be forced to join unions if they desire to keep out of them. Men should not be compelled, by means of the union label, preference to unionists, or any action of that kind, to join unions against their will. If the honorable member for Darling says that my position is a wrong one, he stamps himself as a Tory, instead of as the pure-hearted democrat which he claims to be, and I brand him and his party as Tories. Why is it sought to legalize the union label? The object is to secure special privileges for a certain section of the community; not to. give equal rights to all, but to give, by the operation of law, a preference to the smallest class in the community. The Legislature will be doing wrong if it agrees to anything of the kind. The honorable member for Darling assumed that, because goods bear a union label, they will be of good quality. But there are thousands of men who are not. unionists who are as good and as capable workmen as are the members of unions. A union label does not indicate quality. All that it means is that the goods to which it is attached have been made by unionists, and it is used to compel the public to buy only such goods by boycotting those who use any others. This Legislature has no right to countenance such action. Not only the honorable member for Darling, but the Attorney-General - about whom I shall say a few words presently - made the assumption that the union label stands for quality. The honorable member for Wide Bay, the deputy leader of the Labour Party, in a speech made at Hurstville, New South Wales, on Saturday last, said -

                        <para>- I now understand the Attorney-General to say that there was no declaration on the part of the Reid Ministry that, as a Government, they were not opposed to the trade union label proposals. What is the evidence on that point? The Attorney-General read a certain statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> with a view to indicate that the Reid Government were not opposed to the trade union label. Would any Court assume that the other members of the Government were in favour of the union label, because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> the only Minister who had expressed any opinion on the subject, had stated that he was opposed to it? </para>

                    <para>My honorable friend will forgive me for taking advantage of this opportunity to say that it is a mistake to insert these provisions in this Bill. I thoroughly understand his object in desiring to legislate in this way, and I am not saying one word adversely or otherwise with regard to the principle he has in view, but I think that from his own stand-point, it is worth consideration whether he should ask us to' insert these provisions in a Bil I relating to what is entirely distinct matter - trade - marks - and whether it would not be better to have a separate piece of legislation dealing with this particular subject. .1 know that in America - and that is the pattern which my honorable friend has followed - some enactments for this purpose have been passed ; but it is noticeable that these are-not Federal enactments. Our Constitution enables us to deal with " trade marks," and it is a moot question as to what is meant by that term. </para>

                    <para>When, on the last occasion, there was a recommittal of this Bill, in order to effect some alterations where one or more unions are acting together, I indicated that in my opinion these clauses were in the wrong place. I do not think they should be included in this Bill. I tried on that occasion to persuade my honorable friends opposite that it would be very much better to eliminate them from this Bill, and legislate independently in respect of what is sought to be dealt with here, as was done in New York, I think, where the State Legislature passed legislation of this character. </para>

                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline>
                    would not desire me to do so, especially at a period of the session when every moment of our time is extremely valuable. My honorable friend moved a motion to recommit last week. With two exceptions, every member of the Senate was accounted for in the division as to recommittal. There was an equality of voting, with the result that, according to the Constitution, the question passed in the negative. I voted with my honorable and learned friend in support of the recommittal. But I am not prepared again to support the motion to recommit. I do not take the view that because an amendment is made in a Bill with which I do not agree, I ought, therefore, to vote against the third reading. I do not think I ought to sacrifice a Bill because of some provision in it which I do not like. This measure is intended for the regulation and registration of trade marks. I do not think that a trade union mark is strictly within the meaning of the measure at all. But the question has been fought out, and an amendment has been carried. Now the Bill is ready to be sent on to another place. There is very little hope of it being passed this session., But whether that is so or not, the other Chamber' will be able to deal with the whole subject. " If the trade union mark provisions are retained by a majority, they will form part of the Bill ; if they are rejected by a majority, they will come back to the Senate for reconsideration.

                        <para>- It does not show anything of the kind. Any honorable member who can make such a statement is apparently prepared to support the contention of the Attorney -General. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon</inline> was distinctly opposed to the union label provisions, and seeing that he spoke as the representative of the Reid Government, we may fairly assume that his colleagues shared his views. The Attorney-General undoubtedly attempted to convey the impression that the members of the Reid Ministry were in favour of the trade union label proposals, and yet we find that all the evidence tends to show that the contrary was the case. The honorable gentleman told us that some 500 years ago something equivalent to the union label was in use in England. He knows very well that no trade union label was in existence at the time. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; but it was not of the same character as the union label. The Attorney-General, however, mentioned that fact with a view to support his arguments in support of the present proposal. If that was not his intention, the fact referred to was not worth mentioning, The workers' mark of the time referred to was used by individuals. Nearly all the goods were manufactured in those days solely by individual workers. There was no such division of labour as we now see in our factories. Every man who produced an article and sold it for himself was entitled to use a worker's mark, and it would be open for him to do the same thing to-day. The Attorney-General knew this very well, but he wished honorable members to infer that because there was a workers' mark in existence 500 years ago, we should make provision for trade union labels to-day. Even if a trade union label had been in existence 500 years ago, it would not follow that we should make similar provision to-day. In view of the development which has since taken place, and of the improved methods of production, I say that the legislation which fitted 500 years ago is not applicable to-day. The argument of the Attorney-General was an absolutely foolish' one. </para>

                        <para>- I am not using it. I am merely replying to the statement of the Attorney-General. I endeavour to argue upon fair lines, and I would not use an argument which did not fit the circumstances of to-day in the way that he did. The honorable and learned gentleman also stated that in ancient times marks were given to the members of various guilds. That statement is perfectly true. But I would point out that members of the guilds were required to serve a long apprenticeship to their trade, and were only allowed to "mark!' their goods after they had satisfied those whom they had served that they were competent workmen. </para>

                <para>But do the members of trade unions serve any long apprenticeship to their trades, and are they required to establish the fact that they are good workmen ? No ! They undergo no examination of any kind. None of the safeguards as to quality of workmanship, which used to be insisted upon in connexion with the old guilds, are imposed in their case. </para>

                        <para>-Although I know very little in regard to their internal working, I have seen enough from the outside to prevent me from joining them. The honorable member for Darling made some reference to the encouragement which he offered to certain employes in England to establish a co-operative society for the manufacture of sheep-shears. I commend him for his action in that connexion. Many years ago a strike occurred in the district which I have the honour to represent, and I was asked to speak at a meeting in Armidale. "Upon that occasion I recommended the workers to do exactly what the honorable member for Darling advised the employes of Messrs. Burgon and Ball to do. I counselled them to start a co-operative factory, and to sell their own goods, and I offered - I was a member of the State Parliament at the time - to undertake the travelling for them - so far as the adjoining towns were concerned - without fee or reward. If a union can sell its goods voluntarily, it should have perfect liberty to do so. Nobody objects to that. But I contend that men should not be coerced into using a union label. Such a label is not required for the purpose of guaranteeing the quality of goods, but merely for the purpose of enabling unionists to boycott those firms which do not exclusively employ union labour. The honorable member for Darling has admitted that. We have no right to enact legislation which will create strife between any sections of the community. How can a union label be applied to goods which are the product of a minute division of labour? The great bulk of the work to-day is done by machinery. What right has an employer to attach a union label to goods thus produced, and how can any such label be a guarantee of quality ? Take the manufacture of oatmeal as an example. Under this provision, I suppose that the oats would have to be ground by union labour; the building in which the oatmeal was manufactured would have to be erected by union labour ; indeed, the whole of the processes connected with its production would require to be carried out under union conditions. I say that it is utterly impossible to insure that. These provisions will merely provide the necessary machinery to enable unionists to boycott non-unionists. The honorable member for Darling has assured us that their adoption will result in everybody being employed, and at a higher rate of wages. If that were so, I would vote for these proposals. I have as much sympathy with the working classes as those who stand up and "mouth" it so much. I desire that men should have the fullest employment. But the adoption of the union label will not provide them with work. All these artificial methods for employing them will fail. In Victoria the Wages Boards merely help the man in employment - they are of no assistance to the individual who is unemployed. In New South Wales, the Arbitration Court does not even help the man who is in employment. What we need to do is to bring natural opportunities within the reach of the working man. Then he would be able to find work for himself, and would not need the assistance which it is alleged the adoption of the union label will afford him. The honorable member for Darling has said that every machine which was used pressed men out of employment. How will the union label help them in that case? I say at once that every machine invented would advantage the working classes if proper conditions obtained. The reason why machinery is apparently injuring the worker is that he is not free to take his natural place upon the lands of the country. The Labour Party profess to be the great friends of the people. They are in power in several of the States to-day. Let them enact legislation which will open up avenues of employment for the people upon the land. In Queensland and South Australia at the present time they are in power. Why do they not act in the way that I suggest ? </para>

                        <para>- The Labour Party talk outside of what they will do ; but when they are in power they do nothing. I do not wish to further discuss this question. I do not believe that the position of the workers can be much improved by means of legislation. Legislation of this kind will fail to accomplish its objects. I have the strongest desire to help the masses, but I have always voted against legislation of this character, because I believe that it can have no good effect. If the union label be legalized in Australia, the working, classes will find that th'ey have been fooled, and that it is of very little service to them. Under present conditions, all who are seeking employment cannot find it, and if we give this power to the unions, non-unionists will find it impossible to obtain work. We know that a wharf labourers' union in New South Wales demanded a fee of from a man who wished to join its ranks, and I have been told that in some of the States' there is an aristocracy of labour which carefully shuts out others who would join it. The Arbitration Court in New South Wales has compelled the unions <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> open up their books to every one. Labour unions have tyrannized over their own class wherever they have had an opportunity to do so. </para>

                        <para>- It is not. We know, for example, that in New South Wales the Court compelled the Shearers' Union to expunge from its rules a regulation imposing a fine of on every member who voted against a candidate it put up. That was an attempt to take away from the members of the union liberty of speech and freedom of thought ;it was an attempt to make the union one great political machine in the hands of those who controlled it. There can be no defence for such conduct, and since the unions have not hitherto used their power wisely, it would be absolutely foolish to pass these provisibns, and so place in their hands a greater power than that which They now possess. </para>

                    <para>- After the fervid speeches of the two honorable members who have just preceded me, I feel at considerable disadvantage in addressing, the Committee; but whilst unable to emulate their eloquence, I desire to give my reasons as fairly as I can for opposing the union label clauses. Before doing so, I wish to refer to a statement made by the honorable member for Darling. In the course of his speech, he argued that firms which attached the union label to their goods would secure an increased trade, and when I inquired what would become of those engaged in producing the same class of goods, who did not use the label, he replied: "They would lose their trade ; the others would undoubtedly gain it." I interjected that they would be ruined, and in this connexion I should like to read a short extract from a decision given a shorttimeagobyJudgeHunt,ina boycott case in California. In <inline font-style="italic">American Industries,</inline> for 15th September, 1904, it is stated that - </para>

                    <para>His decision is based on the rights of property. He holds that it is the duty of the Courts under the laws to protect the property of an employer, and also the non-union workman's right to labour. "Therighttolabour," he says, "isarightof property, and the duty to protect it is the highest office of our laws. No syndicate of employes or union of employes can bar one of the right to labour, for the right to labour is the right to live." </para>

                <para class="block">If the right to live is taken from those who do not employ union. labour, we shall strike a blow at the highest privilege that man can enjoy. Presuming that all employers fell into line and employed unionists, the result would be an increase in the prices of their products. I understand that my honorable friends opposite are opposed to sweating ; but if the price of a commodity be increased by those producing it, who must suffer? The rest of the community. </para>

                        <para>- That is not assured. After carefully examining these provisions it appears to me that their primary object is not to benefit unionists particularly, but to force non-unionists into the unions, and so add to their political power. We know perfectly well that majority rule prevails amongst the unions. They decide in caucus what they propose to do, and the minority are bound by the will of the majority. If a large body of men throughout Australia be forced into a union, they will have no freedom of action ; they will have to do as they are told, or suffer ejectment. Such being the case, what must be the object of these clause.;? Is it not to enable the unions to acquire increased political power for the benefit at the present moment of a comparatively small section of the community ? </para>

                        <para>- If that be so, it is curious that so many of the workers of Australia remain outside the unions. We hear a great deal about affording employment for the workers; but surely they know what is best for themselves. If the benefits of unionism be so patent as our friends in the union ranks declare, why is if that non-unionists do not voluntarily join such organizations? As a matter of fact, I believe that at least considerably more than half of the workers of Australia do not belong to the. unions. </para>

                        <para>- Extreme cases indicate the lengths to which men will go under extraordinary circumstances. I shall oppose the clauses which the Attorney-General wishes to insert in the Bill, in order to prevent legal authority being given to extreme action. There is another way of looking at this question. There is a large number of unions in Australia, and if they are given the power which the Government seek to give them, it will be possible for them to ruin the primary industries of the country. I ask honorable members to consider what the position would be if unionists refused to handle the wheat, grain, wool, or other productions sent down from the country, because non-union labour had been employed in connexion with them ? Our prosperity depends not so much on what we sell in Australia as on what we sell abroad. I may be told that such action as I anticipate would never be taken. But if it were taken the prosperity of Australia would be ruined. At the present time a small section of the community is trying to force through Parliament, by fair means or foul, certain provisions which they think will be of advantage to them. </para>

                        <para>- In Tasmania there is a very strong feeling against this proposed legislation. The people hold that it is being sprung upon them before they have been given an opportunity to express their opinion in regard to it. Nearly every person with whom I have conversed is of opinion that the legalization of the union label will not benefit the State. Therefore, apart from my personal views, I am bound to endeavour to voice the opinions of those who sent me here, who view this proposed legislation with extreme disfavour. There is no objection to the Trade Marks Bill as it now stands. Similar legislation was adopted in Tasmania some years ago, and any person desirous of doing so may, on payment of a small fee, register a trade mark, and thereafter prevent any one else from using it. That is a fair and reasonable arrangement. Trade marks do not guarantee quality or purity, but they show that the goods to which they are attached were made by a certain man or a certain firm. The honorable member for Darling says that he wishes to legalize the union label in order to raise wages, and for the purpose of driving the sweater out of existence by handing over his business to the man who pays fair rates Of wages; But our people can do only a certain amount of trade' amongst themselves. When the local demand is met, we have to find a market for our surplus produce abroad, and we can either export our raw material, or send away manufactured goods. . In either case, the price that we receive is governed, not by the conditions of labour and rates of wages prevailing here, but by the prices ruling in the markets of the world. It does not matter to people abroad what our millers have paid in wages, they will give for the flour which we export only the rates ruling in the markets of the world. . Therefore, if our millers have to sell their surplus abroad. at a loss, they must make it up by charging higher prices to the local consumers. They and their employes mav benefit by this state of affairs, but those who have to pay more for their flour, without receiving ' any corresponding advantage, are injured. This proposal is merely protection run mad. In my opinion, we shall do well to allow wages to find their natural level, giving a certain amount of artificial assistance to encourage the establishment of industries within the Commonwealth. I feel it my duty to oppose the proposed new clauses, which are being brought forward by the Government, not to benefit the people of Australia, but. to benefit a small section whose representatives here are bringing pressure to bear upon them. </para>

                        <para>-No; but I am opposed to their introduction into a Trade Marks Bill, since their subject-matter is quite foreign to the subject-matter of the Bill. A trade mark, as has been pointed out bv eminent legal authorities, is really a traders' mark. Trade unions, or associations, and individual workers are not traders, and therefore cannot properly use a trade mark. The union label is not a trade mark in the sense in which the term is employed5 to signify marks placed upon goods for the purpose of indicating the place of manufacture, or the persons by whom they were manufactured. The union label is not accompanied by a proprietary interest in the article to which it is attached, which is one of the essential and basic principles of the trade mark. I think it ought to be referred to a Select Committee, so that evidence might be taken and we might ascertain what justification there is for putting the clauses in the Bill, and whether the title of the measure should not be altered to " A Bill for the Legalization of the Boycott, Intimidation,, and Minority Rule." For, after all, those are the purposes for which the union label is to be called into existence. It is intended to distinguish goods made by trade union labour from goods made by non-union labour. Power is sought by those who are responsible for these clauses to put into the hands of trade unions the right to coerce the majority of workers into joining such organizations against their will. Not only so, but it is intended to give the right to trade unions to coerce employers into discharging non-union labour. It is intended to limit the freedom of citizens to act on their own judgment in buying or selling. They are to be confined to goods which are marked with the union label. </para>

It is the very essence of a trade mark, as ordinarily understood in trading circles, and as laid down by the most eminent legal authorities, that the user of the mark must have a proprietary interest in the goods to which it is applied. The union label is in no respect a trade mark in the proper sense of the term. An eminent legal authority in Victoria has pointed this out. It has also been pointed out by the courts of the United States. Several judgments have been given in America, in which it has been stated - </para>

                <para class="block">So that the grounds of objection which this eminent legal authority takes, are identical with the grounds of objection laid down by the Courts of the United States. But perhaps the most serious objection to this union label proposal is that it will condemn thousands of honest working men in this country to the loss of their employment.' That, I think, is absolutely a certainty. If we are to judge from the operation of similar measures in the United States, it will have the effect of coercing employers into giving employment only to those who are members of trade unions. In fact, every one who knows the origin of this proposal is aware that the experience of the United States has guided the authors of these clauses. They have seen what a powerful engine for tyranny and coercion the union label has been in </para>
                <para class="block">America, and they see that by' getting it legalized here they can use the' forms of law to deprive the citizens of the Commonwealth of their equal rights under the law and to secure to themselves the legal power to coerce and intimidate non-union workers. I have no objection whatever to trade unions. I believe in the right of workers to combine together in a lawful manner for the purpose of bettering the conditions of labour and securing the best terms they can get.' But action of that "kind should be purely voluntary. I do not believe in coercion. I believe that' every inducement should be held out to wage-earners to join trade unions. But the element of compulsion should be entirely absent; because as soon as compulsion or coercion steps in, the equal rights of individuals are destroyed. I have noticed that some members of the Labour Party, when speaking on public platforms, have been very loud in the declaration: of their belief in the principle of recognising equal opportunities for all. Whilst they are so loud in proclaiming this principle outside on the public platform, their legislative acts in this Chamber- always tend in the direction of denying the right- of equal opportunity for all, and setting up a system of class privilege. The result of this sort of legislation is not to set one class against another, but to confer special privileges on a section of one class - a section which they come here specially to represent. At one time, we are told by labour members that they are here to equally represent unionists and non-unionists - that they know no distinction, and that they would not be here but for the votes of both sections of workers. That is an. argument which they use when it suits their purpose, but when it does not, they fall back on another argument, which is a flat contradiction to that I have just indicated. They say that they are not here to represent non-unionists, but only unionists. </para>

The argument has been used that the union label is necessary as a guarantee of quality. But every honorable member knows that the provisions of this Bill do not pretend to guarantee quality, and that the shoddiest possible article might, with this union label, be foisted on the public. Honorable members who use the argument are perfectly well aware that the union label would not afford the public any such guarantee, but that the public are left absolutely at the mercy of the union shops regarding the character of the goods they purchase. The Bill seeks to compel the public to purchase goods which bear the union label, even if those goods be of the most inferior quality. </para>

                        <para>- There are various methods of .exercising compulsion, with very many of which I have no doubt the honorable member for Yarra is perfectly familiar. At any rate, that is the central idea underlying the union label, and it is the cause of so much opposition to this legislation. If the union label were designed to insure the public against fraud, it would not meet with opposition from this side of the House. It is because there is a sinister purpose in this proposal, aiming at interference with the liberty of every section of the community, that such strenuous opposition is shown.-. One of the first duties of a Legislature is to conserve the equal rights of all citizens, and afford equal protection under the law; and Parliament has to see that those equal rights are not infringed by any individuals or sections of the community. This union label, however, has for its object that very interference which it is for the law to prevent. The honorable member for Darling, in one of those specious, sophistical processes of reasoning, which so often do duty with him as argument, contended that we all give preference in one form or another- in the everyday transactions of life. That statement is true, so far as it goes ; but the honorable member did not point out that that preference is totally different in kind from the preference sought under cover of the union label. It is true that everybody, in their every-day transactions, exercises the rights of preference to a greater or lesser, extent; but that is a purely voluntary exercise of preference. </para>

                        <para>- It is perfectly true. The honorable member for Darling' stated that men could not be coerced into joining trade unions. But many men have told me that they have -been compelled to become unionists, because otherwise they would not have a chance of getting a living. They were so tyrannized over and intimidated that they were compelled to become unionists. Working men in my own constituency are now members of unions which they were forced to join' through the pressure of circumstances. I contend that sooner or 'later this very process of compulsion must lead to disintegration, and to the ultimate downfall of the unions. </para>

                        <para>- I have no objection to any man joining a union; but perfect freedom of action must be enjoyed. No doubt the main purpose of the union label- is to bring direct or indirect pressure to bear upon non-unionists to induce them to join unions, and that is the chief danger, of the proposal now before us. -The honorable member for Darling stated that the first employer who adopted the union label would .make a lot of money out of it. Perhaps he will - it is hard to say - perhaps he will not. At any rate. if the label, is such a good thing for employers, it is remarkable that the Chamber of Manufactures - an association of employers - and the Chamber of Commerce, also largely representative of employers, should have been fighting tooth and nail against the adoption, of the union label. The members of the farming community and of the trading community have expressed their strong opposition to the proposed legislation, which has met with universal condemnation. The union label is regarded, and properly so, as steeped in iniquity. </para>

In <inline font-style="italic">Billings</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Hall</inline> the Supreme Court of California refers to the constitutional question on this point as one of the fundamental principles of en1 lightened government, without a rigorous observance of which there can be neither liberty nor safety to the citizen.

                <para class="block">That is a sound principle to lay down, and, coming from such authority, should command respect, even from members of the Labour Party. It lays down the principle that every individual is entitled to the full rights of property in his own labour. It is also pointed out that the right to live is involved in the right to labour, and that every man should be permitted to dispose of his labour as he chooses, without interference 'from outsiders. Canada has been profiting by the experience which has been gained from the abuse of the union label in America. During the last ten years repeated attempts have been made to legalize the use of the union label in Canada. The latest effort was made in the early part of this year, but after a five-months' struggle it was defeated. </para>

                <para>There is only one other point to which I desire to refer. It has been said that the employers themselves will be great gainers by the introduction of the union label. In opposition to that view, I wish to point out the effect of its adoption on the commercial value of trade marks, as instanced in the cigar trade in Canada. The cigar manufacturers there, 'controlling 85 per cent, of the cigar production, of that country, recently made strong representations to the Dominion Parliament in opposition to the Bill which was rejected early during the present year. They thus stated their case - . </para>
                <para>All cigars are marketed to the consumer under labels or brands, and as certain lines grow in public favour, the Trade Marks, as covered by the various label designs, become very valuable assets of the manufacturer, and are saleable for large sums. If labour organizations are also permitted to register their particular emblem as a trade mark, and can then through the strength of their organization compel the manufacturer (as they oft-times do) to affix this label on each box of cigars, the value of the Trade Mark becomes practically ruined as a saleable asset. All the labels on a package of cigars are equally part of the Trade Mark with the brand name, and except they can be delivered complete, their sale is ruined. The manufacturer cannot sell the Union Label Trade Mark on his package with the rest of his Trade Mark, nor can he give any guarantee that the privilege of its use will be extended to the purchaser of his brand. Instances have occurred within the past few years where the presence of the Union Label has prevented the sale of a brand at a large figure. </para>
                <para>Any effort to discard this emblem of Union Labour has invariably been followed by the most strenuous and persistent boycott. The use of the Union Label is not optional, at least this is the experience of cigar manufacturers. Factories' have employed union labour, and complied with all union conditions except that they would not affix the Union Label on their brands. Strikes have been precipitated to enforce this ruling. On certain high-grade brands of cigars the Union Label is a serious drawback in the sale of the product, and to give this emblem the status of a registered Tirade Mark is but the first step to its compulsory use wherever the union issuing same has sufficient powers. </para>
                <para>The registration of the Union Label is necessarily illegal. It is not, nor can it ever be, made a Trade Mark by process of law. This opinion has been laid down by the Trade Mark Branch of the Department of Agriculture, and by several eminent trade mark authorities in Canada. A trade mark is essentially a mark placed on a piece of merchandise to indicate its ownership. To register the Union Label would be to accord the unions part proprietorship in every piece of merchandise to which their label was affixed. According to the legal advice of the Dominion Cigar Manufacturers' Association, such an act could not be sanctioned by law. </para>
                <para>The registration of the Union Label would be simply disastrous to cigar manufacturing interests in Canada, and would eventually ruin the immensely valuable assets owned by cigar manufacturers in their popular labels and brands. </para>
                <para class="block">Here we have evidence that a large association controlling 85 per cent, of the total cigar production of Canada has issued a memorial to the Government of the Dominion, in which they positively state that the use of the union label has the effect of injuring the value of their trade mark, that the union label itself is not a trade mark, cannot in its nature, or by any process of law, be converted into a trade mark,, and that its enforced use, even upon goods; which have all been made by union labour, brings about the ruination of trade in many instances, and certainly depreciates1 the value of the trade mark of those engaged in the production and sale of cigar* in that country. There are several decisions in the American Courts to the effect that a union label is not a trade mark, and also that trade unions are not trading corporations, and, therefore, cannot be entitled to the use of a trade mark. Here is one, which was given by Judge Williams in the case of <inline font-style="italic">M'Vey</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Brendel,</inline> in 1891, in Pennsylvania - </para>

                    <para>It may be conceded that the label is not what is generally understood by law-writers to be a&gt; technical trade mark, because it does not pretend or intimate that the cigars are owned, prepared, or manufactured by the union as an organization, or that as such union, it has any interest or property therein, nor by what particular firm or persons the cigars to which it may be attached were manufactured. </para>

                    <para>First we may admit that the label of the Cigarmakers' National Union is not used as a trade mark in the ordinary sense of the word. It is not a brand put on goods by an owner to separate or distinguish them from the goods of others. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">Similar decisions given in other cases could be quoted, and all the authorities agree that a union label and a trade mark are essen.tially different things, and that one cannot serve the purpose of the other. It cannot be argued for a moment that workers, whether working in their individual capacity or in association as unions could, by the use of a label upon the goods they produce, acquire a proprietary right in those goods; nor can it be urged that they could be classed as traders in those goods. The very essential purpose of a trade mark is absent from the union label. The purpose of a trade mark is to protect the owner, seller, or trader in goods from the piracy of others engaged 'in the manufacture or sale of similar goods. It is to protect individual rights, or the rights of corporations trading 'in goods or manufacturing them, that the trade mark is granted. These conditions cannot possibly apply to all the workers engaged in the production of goods, and they cannot have the same proprietary rights as the owners or sellers of the goods. On these grounds I think that these clauses ought to be referred to the investigation of a Select Committee. I am, assured that very many persons in this community are willing to come forward and give valuable evidence before such a Committee, which at a later stage might be used for the information of honorable members, and perhaps to convert those who are now opposed to. the union label to a different way of thinking. In, the absence of any investigation of the kind, and of such evidence as might thus be obtained, the Opposition are perfectly justified, on principle, in opposing these clauses, and in resisting the attempt to engraft such provisions on a measure dealing with trade marks. I wish it to be distinctly understood that, in opposing these clauses, I am not opposing trade unionism., or speaking against it in any way. Though some honorable members may laugh at that statement, I have always been an upholder of the principle of trade unionism.

                        <para>- No._ I would help them on right lines; but' I have .always contended that the principle of liberty should be steadily kept in view in the formation of these associations, and that the element of compulsion, should never be permitted to enter into them. As soon as it does, the free right of choice is lost to the individual, and that is a thing which should always be guarded against by every marr who professes any regard for liberty or correct principle. It is because of the compulsion which underlies the whole of these proposals, and because of that element of compulsion which has suggested their inclusion in this measure, that we are opposed to them. We object to the will of the minority being forced upon the majority, and to coercive measures being brought to bear to compel free men to sacrifice their freedom and to become members of organizations which they have no desire to join. At the same time, I would heartily recommend all workers to voluntarily join unions, and especially those who believe in freedom, so that, by their influence and reasoning, they may be able to convert those who are opposed to the principles of freedom from the error of their devious ways. If the unions form themselves into voluntary trading corporations, there is mo reason why .they should not have trade marks. I could see no objection to that. If trade unionists desire to secure the reasonable benefits of the provisions of a Trade Marks Act, let them form themselves into trading associations. Let them form themselves into voluntary co-operative institutions, and engage in the manufacture and sale of goods, and then they will be' equally entitled, with other manufacturers and sellers of goods, to the protection of their wares, but they cannot claim a protection for wares which they do not own. Therefore, it seems to me that to attempt to confuse a union label with a trade mark is one which can only impose upon those who are either wilfully deficient in understanding, or are willing to be imposed upon. </para>

This question has occupied the attention of the House for a very long period, and although I did take up considerable time to-day it was only due to the members of the Opposition who had previously advanced their arguments that I should endeavour to reply to them. I feel that possibly we can arrange now that the consideration of this question shall be finished to-morrow.

                    <para>- I am prepared to discuss the question of the union label now, if the Government wish to go straight ahead. Excellent feeling has been displayed on all sides of the Chamber this week. We have passed through a long"stone wall." I do not suppose that a "stone wall" had ever been previously conducted with such good feeling on all sides. If it had not been for that unfortunate occurrence, we should have got rid of this Bill at least a week ago. The only reason why I would suggest to the Attorney-General the propriety of not proceeding further to-night, and not trying to force the Opposition into the position which he has laid down, is that there are at least ten amendments to be moved, each of which involves a separate principle. I recognise the force of what he said about concluding the debate on this question, but I cannot see how he can propose to compress ten hours' work - for I presume that any amendment i's worthy of an hour's discussion - into a six-hours' day. However, if he does not see the force of that, I shall proceed with my speech. </para>

                        <para>- In the course of the debate several honorable members have referred to the silence of the members of the Labour Party. I do not see any reason why the members of that party should address themselves particularly to this question, because their views are fairly well known. For that reason, I do not think that we. can rightly object to the silence which has been observed by honorable members, with the. exception of the honorable member for Darling. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member has addressed himself to it, but I do not think that the party generally can claim that they have done so. I do not blame them ; it is fair for the Labour Party to adopt this attitude, in so much as they have thrown down the gauntlet on this question. But honorable members who until quite recently have been opposed to any such principles as are incorporated in these clauses should most certainly have addressed themselves to <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> question: There are three honorable, members - Ministers - who are always mentioned in this connexion, but there is one who so far has escaped mention. This is only another indication of the truth of the saying "Least 'said, soonest mended." Three of these honorable gentlemen have statements in cold print showing their principles, the fourth has shown his principles by votes, but, I think, has rarely expressed himself in the same forcible way as have his colleagues in opposition to the principles he is now prepared silently to espouse. It is for this reason that the Post master-General is in a much better position than are his colleagues, the Prime Minister, the Treasurer, and the Vice-President of the Executive Council. These honorable gentlemen should without doubt try to explain the reasons which have prompted their change of front. If they do not, the country must come to the conclusion that it is because of sordid reasons which they cannot express. </para>

                        <para>- I refer simply to the sordid desire for power. I should not demean myself by inferring that they wish to cling to office because of any other consideration. Their seeking for power, or, should I say, "place without power," has necessarily been regarded by the country as the only reason for their change of front and for their being ashamed to give expression to the opinions that have prompted that change. The Attorney-General this afternoon made a speech upon which we can all congratulate him, because his arguments were clear, even if his deductions were not so patent. He told us that the case for this proposal has not hitherto been put. I do not know whether he remembered at the time the two able addresses which I understand the leader of the Labour Party has made on this subject. If he did, I agree with him. </para>

                        <para>- I am not seeking to pin down the Attorney-General to any disrespectful utterance in reference to the honorable member for Bland ; I should not like to place any supporter of the honorable member in such an awkward position. But I shall pass from that subject. I take it that this is the first exposition that has come from the Government of its corporate view with regard to these provisions: We are told in, this official pronouncement that the various sets of amendments which have been circulated are the same in principle, the only difference being an improvement in drafting and in verbiage, due mainly to the more concise form in which they now appear. That is a straightforward statement, for which I honour the Attorney-General. It shows us that; so far as these different proposals are concerned, we have only to consider the same fact, and so we shall not waste time in looking up former amendments to see what they meant. But after putting our minds at rest in regard to this fact, the Attorney-General went on to put into flowery language the bald terms of his proposal ; and after two hours of rhetoric and able argument, we have still as vague a comprehension of the ground meaning of these proposals as we had before the honorable and learned gentleman rose to address the Committee. I may say, in passing, that each section. of his speech was truly able and clear, but the natural sequence between each progressive argument was not equally clear, at all events to myself. It is for that reason only that I say that we knew as little after the honorable and learned gentleman had concluded his address as we knew before. We were told, however, that at the present time any union or association of employes could use the union label ; at the present time they have absolute liberty to apply the union label to any goods, subject, of course, to the consent of the manufacturer. If that be the case, what is the reason for these provisions? The honorable gentleman will naturally say that the proposal is one to prevent the pirating of union labels. I hold that, if the unions can already use union labels, and that the only thing which necessitates this part of the Bill is piracy, the Attorney-General ought first to show that there has been piracy of union labels in Australia. If he cannot show that, his whole case falls to the ground. I challenge him1 to prove a single instance of piracy of a union label in the Commonwealth. Never has a union label been, of sufficient importance in Australia to cause any dealer or manufacturer to pirate it ; such a thing has never been done, and until it has, the Attorney-General's case must, perforce, fall to the ground. It must be clear to all honorable members that in Australia, where the sense of fair play is so inherent amongst the people, piracy of a union label would be almost impossible, for the label, we are told, relies for its efficacy on the good-will and sympathy of the people generally, and that sympathy would be doubled if any employers resorted to piracy. According to my honorable and learned friend's own showing, if a manufacturer were to resort to the despicable practice of pirating a union label, he would at once have all his goods boycotted. I use the word " boycott " in the venial sense - that is, the individual refusal to buy. That manufacturer's or dealer's goods would be refused by every sympathizer with unionism, and there are many sympathizers with <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> unionism in the Commonwealth to-day. I suppose that every one in the community is such a sympathizer. If that be the case, it is clear that under present conditions any piracy of a union label which had not been improperly used would react on those who were guilty of it. What, then, is the position? Do honorable members urge that we should guard against piracy in order to secure the unions from the natural consequences of any folly or malpractice in regard to the use of the union label? So long as it is properly used, piracy will be impossible, but if it is employed to promote such boycotting as has taken place in the United States ever since its institution there, should the unions be shielded from the natural consequences of such action? At the present time, if such practices were indulged in in the Commonwealth, the unions would lose the sympathy and support of the public, and that alone would make it possible for any manufacturer or dealer to pirate the union label. So long as the unions enjoy the sympathy and support of the public, no manufacturer or dealer will dare to pirate their label. Why. then, should we legalize the registration of the union label, and allow the unions to use it as they choose? </para>

                        <para>- I do not wish to labour the point. The Attorney-General has told us that the provisions inserted in the Bill by the Senate were too far-reaching and stringent, and that those which he is now proposing to insert are a considerable modification of them. I do not challenge that statement, but the expression of the Labour members when he was making it indicates how they regard the proposed modification. They showed unmistakably how pleased they were with it, and I leave it to honorable members to judge therefrom the nature of the modification. The honorable gentleman made a point by stating that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Josiah</inline> Symon did not strenuously oppose the introduction of the clauses originally inserted in the Bill in the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- That is the whole point. I have not a report of the proceedings at hand, so that I cannot say that there may not have been some technical reason for what he did, and there may be grounds for difference of opinion as to the effect of his action. No doubt he naturally looked forward to the provisions being opposed in this Chamber. Will any honorable member say that they would have been agreed to, had they been brought forward here last session? They would have been defeated by three or four votes at least. The late Attorney-General looked at the matter from the point of view of al public man and a politician. He recognised that it was of no use to waste the time of the Senate in fighting the question there, especially as when the Bill came to this House he could rely upon the present Prime Minister, the present Postmaster-General, the present Treasurer, and the present Vice-President of the Executive Council as supporters of his Government. That is what the late Attorney-General recognised, and that is why he did not undertake a useless fight in the Senate. </para>

                        <para>- What did it matter to the late Attorney-General that the clauses were carried in the Senate, when he knew that he would have the support of the present Prime Minister and other members of this Government to reject them when they came to this House ? We are all politicians here, although we are saints before our constituents, and we know what would be in the mind of any reasonable leader when put in such a position. The Attorney-General in his speech to-day went on to explain that in the United States the union label was not prominent in any boycotting case. I have already given the Committee numerous instances where undoubtedly the label has been used in that country to further the boycott. I do not wish to pursue the matter, as I have already dealt with it sufficiently. But the Attorney-General went on to ask whether there was any boycott in union sympathizers voluntarily purchasing only union-labelled goods. Of course, one would not describe that as boycotting. We hare no wish to prevent free agents from buying any goods they wish to buy. </para>

                        <para>- That is not so. Suppose, for instance, that a union is formed especially for the purpose of using the union label. A union of that description would not come under the Arbitration Act, and consequently would not be hedged round with those safeguards that apply to unions working under that Act. It would make it one of its first rules that ,no article should be purchased by any of its members to which the union label was not attached. Then that union would appoint walking . delegates to go round and see that, not only its members, but also their wives and families, wore no articles except such as had the union label attached to them. That, I say, would be boycotting. The action of the members of that union would not be voluntary. It would not be the action of free agents. And such unions would be the inevitable consequence of passing these union label provisions ! I can, quite understand that members of unions should be governed by a. majority of their fellow-members; and if the majority of the members of a union choose to pass a rule of the character I have described, it is only a fair thing that the whole of the members should be bound by it; for, if they do not care to be bound by it they can, of course, leave the union. But, in such a case as I have instanced, not only the members of unions, but also their wives and families, would be bound. In this country we have not only manhood suffrage, but adult suffrage. The rights of women have to be considered, as well as those of men. A woman has to make the pounds, shillings, and pence of the household go as far as possible. I .am afraid that in many families there are only shillings and pence to spend. The woman has to make the money go as far as it will. She purchases the stock to keep the household going. Is not such a woman to be a free agent? Can she not buy her goods in the market where she can get the best value for the money she has to spend? Is she to be affected by the tyranny of the union label? Certainly she should not; but that is a consideration which obviously has not struck the Attorney-General. That is one form of boycott that naturally results from the adoption of this legislation. Honorable members have asked what is a boycott. I will tell them : If a walking delegate, upon entering a shop, and finding that 10 per cent, of the stock did not bear the union mark, afterwards hired a couple of sandwich men - of course, at the union rate of wages - to parade up and down outside) and announce that the shop should not be patronized - that would be a boycott. There are other forms of boycott to which I could refer, but to which I shall not allude, for fear that I may unduly lengthen the debate. The opponents of these proposals have been accused of antagonism to trade unionism. Personally, I deny the charge. I regard unionism as one of the best and most hopeful institutions in our industrial life. </para>

                <para class="block">I also regard the voluntary co-operation of its members as constituting the very life-blood of unionism. What has made unionism a living force to-day ? Not compulsion, but the voluntary co-operation and mutual enthusiasm of the unionists. These elements alone have enabled the unions to tide over their most serious difficulties. If any system of compulsion were adopted, the involuntary recruits gained thereby would prove a source of weakness, and would eventually lead to the downfall of the institution. For this reason alone, the advocates of true unionism should range themselves alongside the opponents of this proposal. The Attorney-General has laid considerable stress upon American precedents. He has told us of the States that have adopted union, label laws, and has given us particulars as to their population, which I presume, in the case of the southern States, would include the negro element. He told us further that some of the States had passed restrictive measures, in order to prevent blackmailing and boycotting by means of the union label. Honorable members seem to forget that in a number of the States union labels have been deliberately introduced, with the object, by levy upon the trusts, of raising funds with which to fight proposals for the enactment of restrictive measures. </para>

                        <para>- There are a number of authorities. My statement is absolutely correct. America is the home of political corruption, and the system to which I have referred has been deliberately resorted to by the political parties in the States Legislatures. I do not think that the Attorney-General was wise in asking us to follow American precedents. The United States is the home of Tammany, and also the home of "place without power," .and "power without place." We have already had experience in this country as to what is meant by " place without power," and " power without place," and we have had a sufficiency of American precedents for the present. The Attorney-General and the honorable member for Darling talked all round this subject, without touching its real crux. Neither of them attempted to explain the true reason for the anxiety of the Labour Party, to get these proposals adopted. We have been assured that the object of the introduction of the union label is to insure that goods shall be manufactured under proper conditions. But we know that in Australia we have already established Courts for that special purpose. What, then, is the object of these proposals? Undoubtedly it is a political one. As a proof of that, I would remind honorable members of the extreme anxiety exhibited by members of the Labour corner to dispose of this Bill during the current session. In order that this may be done, we are being detained here unduly long hours. </para>

                        <para>- I am afraid that the honorable member is getting away from the question, and is discussing a matter which is not before the Chair. I would point out that certain expressions have been used which should not have been employed. For instance, honorable members were referred to as " animals." That was not a proper remark, ,and it provoked another interjection which was not in order. I am afraid that I heard still another remark which was not strictly in order. I think, however, that if we allow the matter to remain where it is, no great harm will be done. </para>

                        <para>- The Labour Party desire this Bill to be passed, in order that their political organizations outside may become conversant with the details of administering the union label, so as to make it effective at the next election. The moment they have secured their object they will throw over the present Government, and assume the reins of office themselves. Ever since the -inception of the Commonwealth Parliament, the Labour Party have been endeavouring to increase the strength of their political unions. When the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill was under consideration, they desired a preference to be extended to unionists. They were defeated upon, that, proposal, with the aid of several of the present Ministers. They did not get their undiluted preference, nor did they get political preference. They had then to consider a new method, or a new form of the old method, to increase their political organization ; and they devised the union label. If there is one thing on which I can congratulate the Labour Party it is on the possession of a Machiavellian trait, which no other political party in Australia can equal. There is no party in this country so far-seeing, if so selfish, as is the Labour Party. The moment they were beaten in their endeavour to utilize this House as a recruiting agency for their own political strength they began to reach out for the union label. I shall show how they will use the union label to improve their political position. Under these clauses it can be used by any association, and not merely by a union registered under the Arbitration Act. I appeal to honorable members opposite to say, before this debate closes, whether they are prepared, to restrict the use df the union label to unions registered under that Act. </para>

                        <para>- I should be prepared very, seriously to consider the advisability of doing so, should they be made innocuous in that way. If these clauses are passed in their present form, the result will be that new unions will be formed -to use the union label. They will be unions having political objects, finding funds for the Labour Tarty and voting for Labour candidates. Union label boycotts will be fostered in order to compel men to enter these political unions at the peril of their livelihood, because the products of workers who are not members of these unions will not be purchased. Honorable members are prepared to compel men, at the peril of their livelihood, to enter unions formed to vote for themselves, and to pay funds into the party chest that supports them. These are the objects of these provisions. If honorable members opposite were in a Court of Law they could not deny that, and I hope they will not have the temerity to deny it in this .House. This accounts for their anxiety to have these provisions -passed this session - that they may be used as a means of organization for the next Federal elections. In these Clrcumstances. the Attorney-General cannot complain that the Opposition, feeling that this is the case, and knowing that these proposals have not been before the country, should desire that a reasonable time should he devoted to their discuission. If I were in order in saying so, I should be prepared to say that the Opposition hold the view that one of the grossest conspiracies ever known in the history of Australia is at present being, carried on in this Chamber. </para>

                        <para>- -Then I shall not say so ; but, though I am unable to express certain opinions in an orderly way, I still must hold them, and when, in common with other honorable members, I hold such strong views in connexion with this matter, I claim that we are entitled to ask for a. reasonable time to permit the debates in this House to operate as an educative medium throughout the Commonwealth. The associations who will take advantage of these proposals are associations which will be paying subscriptions to the Labour Party and voting for Labour candidates. As a proof that I am in no way extreme in holding these views, I should like to mention one of the reasons which induces me to hold them. One of the most important unions in the Commonwealth, ably and subtly presided over by the honorable member for Darling, a year ago had rules which compelled its members to vote in a certain direction. I refer to the Australian Workers' Union, which took a part in politics and ran a newspaper, circulating strongly partisan views, and which issued a levy upon its members of is. per annum. Under the Commonwealth Arbitration Act that union was compelled, if it3 wished to register under the Act, to give up its political objects. Now there is nothing so certain as this : The moment the Trade Marks Bill is passed into law, with its union label provisions complete, the Australian Workers' Union will register a trade mark ; and, under its old rules and its political objects, start on a general propaganda under new auspices. Apart from the merits of these provisions, we certainly have the right to consider the inadvisability of bringing one Act of this Parliament into direct conflict with- another. If we pass this Bill with these clauses, it will be found to be a direct inducement to one of the greatest unions in the Commonwealth to sever its association with the Arbitration Court in order that it may try to gain its object in another way. Is not that a condition of things which the Committee should regard with the utmost seriousness? </para>

                        <para>- I am aware of that. I have already expressed my complete sympathy with trade unionism. What I object to is that political unionism should, in this House, be encouraged to the detriment of persons outside them. I do not object even to political unionism, so long as it is voluntary, but I do object to giving political unionism power over its competitors by Act of Parliament. I do not object to the Australian Workers' Union having political rules. All I say is that if, for any reason, it wishes to compel persons by Act of Parliament to join its ranks, it must so frame its rules that every member will have absolute liberty of action. </para>

                        <para>- I know that it has completely changed its rules, but my fear is that the change has not been voluntarily made by the majority of the members, and that, when it gets an engine which will enable it to proceed without the help of the Arbitration Court in. the settlement of disputes, it will revert to its old political rules and register a union, label in order to increase its membership. That is a point which I submit the Committee must take into serious consideration when it is considering these proposals. This danger could be guarded against in two ways. In the first place, political unionism should be guarded against so far as it affects the liberties of outside persons. I have no quarrel with political unionism, or any other form of unionism, when it is voluntary. But, in view of the fact that to express a predilection in favour of any goods made by any union necessarily means to drive persons, willingly or unwillingly, into the union, since they can get no sale otherwise for the product of their labour, I submit that it is really another form of preference to unionists. We must guard against political unionism by seeing that no union which devotes itself to political objects shall get any of the advantages of the union label proposals. If they are absolutely free and open, if any recruit is not compelled to vote for any political party- </para>

I take that statement on the part of the honorable member as being the only reason that prompts him to support the proposal. He will recognise that if it be essential that consumers should have a true indication in that regard, there must be as few union labels as possible in any one line of trade.

                        <para>- I am not suggesting that there should be any compulsion. I am simply pointing out that, according to the argument of my honorable friends opposite, it is to the advantage of the consumer that there should be only one union of employes associated with any industry, because he has then to" make a bald choice between the product of good sanitary and labour conditions, and that of " sweat " shops and tenement houses. That being so, it is clear that in. this Bill we should, as far as possible, encourage the practice of having only one Union of employés connected with an industry. As that is the object of my honorable friends in the Ministerial corner, I hold that every labourer whose conditions of labour are vouched for by either of the States Courts as being sound should be allowed to use a label in his trade. I think that is clear, and I propose to test it when we proceed to deal with the amendments. I wish to test the <inline font-style="italic">bonafides</inline> of the opinions put forward by honorable members of the Labour Party. </para>

                        <para>- Yes ; but I think that the provision to which the honorable member refers is a most misleading one. No article manufactured in Australia is the product of one man's toil. In the present state of our industrial life, an article, before it becomes a finished product, has to pass through dozens, perhaps hundreds, of hands, and therefore every article to which an individual worker attempted to attach his brand would necessarily bear the marks of hundreds of men. Therefore the provision to which my honorable friend alludes will be absolutely inoperative ; and I regret that it has been inserted. Honorable members have argued, in the course of this debate, that if the union label proposal be unpopular, it will meet its own reward - that people who have no unionistic ideals will combine and refuse to buy politically-union-made articles. That is begging the question. These proposals will not be flung broadcast over the country. I have too much respect for the Machiavellian tactics of my honorable friends in the Ministerial corner to suggest that they would make such a serious blunder. The union label will be brought into use, first of all. In those districts which sympathize with militant unionism, to force storekeepers and others to sell none but union-made goods; and from those districts it will spread outward, until the whole Commonwealth comes within its noxious embrace. If it were put into general use at once, Ft would be scouted; but those who control the unions are too clever and far-seeing to let that happen. The boycott will grow by the boycott. In conclusion, I wish to show that the principle of preference to unionists is diametrically) opposed to the objective which the Labour Party have announced on every platform in Australia. We have been told that they desire the equalization of opportunity for every man, woman, and child in the Commonwealth". Does preference to unionists mean equalization of opportunity ? Will not its adoption make it more difficult for those who are worst off to earn an honest livelihood ? Who is it deserves our sympathy and aid - the man who belongs to a strong and powerful corporation, who will be succoured in his darkest hour by its funds, or the man who has no settled occupation, and wanders from job to job, never knowing what the morrow will bring ? I oppose the trade union label provisions, because I believe in absolute liberty. I believe that every man in the community should have absolute liberty to live as he will, and to work as he will. </para>

                        <para>- If, in the city of Sydney, a man dropped on evil days, and tried to get a job on the public wharfs, he would be asked to pay an entrance fee of10s., and, in advance an annual subscription of 10s., to the Wharf Labourers' Union be- fore he could get a job.

It is almost impossible to determine whether the documents which he desires to quote ought to be laid upon the table until the honorable member has quoted them. So far, we have had nothing to indicate their character. </para>

                    the union label clauses. Having considered the matter fully, your Committee is convinced that such legislation would be detrimental and extremely harassing to the trader who would be called upon to discriminate between individuals as unionists and non-unionists by the stocks he kept, although both are df equal value to him ; in all ways it would make for coercion, dissatisfaction, and loss. I trust that you, in common with all well-wishers of the Commonwealth, will use every effort to have these obnoxious and mischievous clauses expunged from the contemplated legislation.

The secretary referred fully to the union label clauses of the Trade Marks Bill, and the following resolution was carried unanimously : - " That in the opinion of this meeting, the union, label clauses of the Trade Marks Bill now before the Federal House, will if passed be a direct interference with the liberty of the subject, and a discrimination of persons, and that in favour of a minority as against a majority. It will hamper storekeepers in their operations, and penalize the purchasing public, of which so large a class are women." ,

                <para class="block">This question is really the great question' of preference to unionists, which was threshed out last session when we were considering the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. According to <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan,</inline> there are 150,000 unionists in Australia, and by means of these provisions they are endeavouring  to secure preference over 1,102,000 adult males in this Commonwealth. At page 61 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> for this session, it will be found that the Prime Minister, at the beginning of this session, in speaking to the Address-in-Reply, told the right honorable member for East Sydney that he had parted with his_ opportunity to put this great question of preference to unionists before the country in a concrete form. On page 62, he repeated the statement in another form. The honorable and learned member for Ballarat has now an. opportunity of putting the issue before the people in a concrete form, because the union label embodies the principle of preference to unionists in a worse shape than has ever been submitted to the country. It is only because the Attorney-General wishes to placate the corner party that these clauses have been accepted by the Ministry. If we are to judge by the opinions which have been expressed, I should say that there is a very narrow majority here in favour of their enactment. If the Prime Minister is true to the words which he spoke on the Address-in-Reply, he will seek a dissolution of the House, and take the verdict of the people. I can assure him that the members of the Opposition will be ready to respond to a challenge in that direction. I am satisfied that there is a strong feeling throughout the country districts in Victoria, and, I believe, throughout the rest of Australia, against the insertion of these clauses in the Bill. Practically, the only desire of the members of the Labour Party in seeking the enactment of this class legislation, is not to suppress piracy or sweating, but to increase the membership of their unions for political purposes. They intend to use the union label as a means of boycotting manufacturers and compelling workmen to join the unions. In supporting the union label, the Attorney-General is preparing a sword which will eventually be the means of politically slaying himself. The union, label can be of no value to the Labour Party unless it is to be used as a means of boycotting. According to <inline font-style="italic">Webster's Unabridged Dictionary,</inline> the word " boycott " means "to combine against a landlord, tradesman, employer, or other person; to withhold social or business relations from him, or to deter others from holding such relations." It has been urged by honorable members that some individuals themselves apply the boycott ; but according to this definition it can only be applied by an association of persons. It is desired to put the power of the boycott into the hands of the unions. The honorable member for Bland has gloried in the fact that he has indulged in boycotting, and he has admitted that employers have the right to do so. If it were not for the power which the union label will give the unions, they would not have asked their chief assistant, the Attorney-General, to bring forward these clauses and to after them so many times. The word " boycott " as a noun is defined in <inline font-style="italic">Webster's Unabridged Dictionary</inline> to mean " social and business interdiction for the purpose of coercion." So that these clauses are designed to introduce not only a system of boycotting, but a system of coercion between employers and employes, between tradesmen and their customers. In my opinion,, the Attorney-General and his colleagues should have left the positions which they now occupy rather than have been drawn by any means into bringing forward such proposals. The honorable and learned gentleman must know, from what he has read on the subject, .that in America the labels have been used almost entirely for the purpose of boycotting tradesmen who would, not submit to the dictation of unionists. </para>

It is generally acknowledged that practically the object of the unions in seeking to legalize the union label is to apply this pernicious system to all the relations existing between employers and employes in the Commonwealth. No one takes exception to voluntary trade unionism, but the coercive unionists who recognise as their leader the honorable member for Bland are aiming at the introduction of such a system as that which exists in connexion with the Flint Glass Workers' Union of America. </para>

                        <para>- I thank the honorable member for the interjection, which is perfectly true, and quite pertinent to the issue. I am not suggesting that the evil has been or is only on the one side. The Attorney-General knows that it is customary for the members of the learned profession to which he belongs not to work with those who are outside the union. But the custom obtaining throughout the learned professions is due to reasons quite different from those which actuate members of coercive trade unions in taking the course I have indicated. The effect of these clauses will be to introduce into Australia the system that now obtains in the United States. During the grea't shearing strike of a few years ago, one of the chief points at issue was as to whether or not non-unionists should be allowed to work side by side with unionists. </para>

                        <para>- Has it not been one of the burning questions at issue ? The Attorney-General has argued that the boycott to which reference has been made is a matter that affects only the United States; but I am showing that the system is not unknown in Australia. Another point having an important bearing on this question is that the workers'1 label clauses are designed, not to indicate the sweater, but chiefly to force all workmen throughout Australia into unions.

                    <para>When the non-union man, denominated a " scab " by the union, tries to take the place of strikers, violence is often visited upon him by the union, as some years ago in England ; but the majority of the unions do not countenance violence. </para>

                <para class="block">I know that the majority of trade unionists do not countenance violence, but this is an indication of the treatment which will be meted out to those who object to the union label by the coercive unions which .are represented chiefly, if not wholly, by honorable members in the Ministerial corner. The members of labour organizations and the general public will be urged to buy no goods except those -to which the union label is attached. All other goods will be boycotted, and as it will not be possible for manufacturers to use the union label unless the whole of the workmanship in their wares is that of unionists, the logical result will be that none but unionists will be able to get employment. What is aimed at is to force all the labour of the community into unions, and I do not envy the name which the Attorney-General will leave to posterity if he is successful in getting these clauses placed on the statute-book. The secretary to the American Federation of Labour reported, at the Convention of 1896, that a large -number of trades, of which he read a list, had adopted the union label ; and spoke of the growth of the label as sure. He added, "It is the backbone of some of our unions." Most of the unions in Australia are at the present time without a backbone, and that, I suppose, is why they are so anxious to adopt what is said to be the backbone of the American unions. As honorable members know, the union label was used in the first instance to distinguish cigars made by white labour from those made by Chinese labour. If the union label is adopted in the cigar trade of Australia, and there are many union propagandists as energetic as is the honorable member for D ar I. ing, its use will be pushed to an extreme, which will mean that the label cannot be attached to cigars unless none but unionists have been employed in connexion with their manufacture in all its processes. As in this country the tobacco leaf from which the local cigars are made is grown chiefly by Chinamen, that, I think, will present a difficulty in the way of applying the label to cigars made from local leaf. If the shoemakers adopt a label, and the principle is again pushed to an extreme in their business, it will be necessary not only that the boots and shoes to which the label is applied shall have been made by unionists, but that the leather shall have been prepared by unionist tanners, and the hide flayed by unionist butchers. Perhaps they may even go so far as to require that only the hides of cattle reared on properties worked by union labour shall be used. The honorable member for Yarra has shown me the design of the label u.sed by the Hatters Union of America. Hats are made of various materials. I do not think that many straw hats are made in Australia, but many of the hats worn here are manufactured from rabbits' fur. </para>

                        <para>- If, however, the stamp of legality is given to the label it will be extended to the whole of the trades :n the Commonwealth. In America label leagues are being established in many places. They are simply attempting to coerce the people into using no goods but such as are marked with the union label. We shall soon have the same sort of thing prevailing in Australia. </para>

                        <para>- I do not think that that has anything to do with it. The mere mention of the word does not permit a debate to take place at this stage upon a subsequent clause. I am sorry to intervene, but I do not think that the honorable member for Corangamite can complain that latitude has not been given to him. </para>

                        <para>- I think the question is of such grave importance that it should be fully discussed. It has so many ramifications that its branches can hardly be dealt with succinctly. Allegations have been made that Australian manufacturers have been in the habit of stating that goods were made by union labour when, as a matter of fact, they have been made by non-union workmen. The Chambers of Commerce state that those allegations are without foundation. </para>

                        <para>- It is undesirable that this class of legislation should be placed on the statute-book in the early history of Federation. Its tendency is to create bitterness between employers and their workmen. Manufacturers have good ground for fearing that the clauses will be used for boycotting purposes. A letter which has been sent to me points out that the honorable member for Bland admitted that they would be used as a weapon for boycotting. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly ; I have no wish to make any statement concerning the honorable member for Bland to which he takes exception. I have here a statement written by a baker, which shows the difficulty of applying the union label to bread-. How is a housewife to distinguish between bread which is marked with a genuine union label and bread which is fraudulently marked? I am of opinion that the union label will have a serious effect upon local industries. No protectionist ought to vote for such provisions, and most of the manufacturers who are interested in the protected industries are crying out against them. Their effect will be to take the ownership and directorship of the industry out of the hands of the men who have put their brains and capital into it, and place them in the hands of the caucus and the Trades Hall. Furthermore, the union label will be no guarantee of the quality of goods. . In fact, goods tearing a fraudulent label might actually be better in quality than goods which bore the genuine union label. This is a form of class legislation which is not intended to benefit the mass of the people of Australia. It would be no guarantee that proper wages were paid to the workmen who had manufactured an article. The greater part of the manufactures of Australia are made in States where there is stringent factory legislation, and where, consequently, there is no need for this new system of coercion. </para>

                        <para>- Another point is that without these clauses it is quite competent for any Trade union to use a mark. Common law rights pertain to any union that chooses to do so. It is therefore unnecessary for us to pass these clauses. Their legality as part of this Bill has been challenged, and it is exceedingly probable that: the question will be argued later on before the High Court. Their adoption simply means that the Commonwealth will become a recruiting agent for trade unions who want to increase their political strength and get completely in their hands the reins of industry - to drive the business coach. When that happens, the power thus conferred upon the unions will convert them into a veritable Juggernaut car, crushing the industries of Australia to dust. </para>

                        <para>- Public business ought not to be conducted in this way. We have to submit to the views of the Government and their supporters, but I do not think that their tactics are reasonable. We made a reasonable offer to the Government which they might verv well have accepted. The point that struck me most forcibly in the Attorney-General's speech was that all his references were to America. He had nothing to say regarding the union label in Canada. " He did not tell us that this subject was discussed for five months ' in the" Dominion Parliament, and' that, notwithstanding that, the Bill did not succeed in passing. </para>

                        <para>- The country is in a state of alarm about the Bill. As a rule people engaged in commercial pursuits do not take alarm for nothing. They are hard-headed business men. They see in this measure a menace to their industrial occupations, and to the ramifications of business, and their alarm seems to be based upon the experience of this kind of legislation elsewhere. The Attorney-General told us of benefits which would accrue to the community from the adoption of the union label. He referred to its successful operation in America, and pointed' lout that from the highest moral stand-point there was every reason for adopting such legislation in Australia. If it be true that in the interests of morality these proposals should <inline font-style="italic">be</inline> passed - if they are necessary in the interests of the higher development of our industrial relationships - why has the Government been so careful to drop from the Bill any direct reference to trade unions? Judging from the way in which the Attorney-General has shorn down his amendments, one would think that he was ashamed of trade unions. Why has he eliminated every reference to trade unions, and at the same time preserved to them every privilege? If the union label has operated in the direction of increasing the <inline font-style="italic">morale</inline> of the workers as a whole, and of preventing sweating, why has every reference to trade unionism been omitted from the Bill ? </para>

                        <para>- We are told that one of the main purposes of these provisions is to prevent fraud and piracy - to prevent other people from taking advantage of the labels which will be owned by the trade organizations of Australia. Surely we do not play at legislation in this Parliament. We do not reel off so many Acts without some objective in view, other than to make the people outside believe that we are a grand lot of fellows, and that we are doing them- a lot of good by our statutes. I challenge the Attorney-General to show the necessity for legislation of this kind in Australia, to show that piracy is proceeding, or that fraud is taking place in regard to the sale oE union-made goods. I challenged the honorable member for Darling this afternoon on the same point, and he mentioned an incident which had occurred in his own expedience. He stated that he was setting up house, and was anxious to buy his furniture at a union shop, and he wanted to be saved the small trouble of making inquiries at the Trades Hall as to the place at which he could get what he required. Are we to pass a Bill of this kind in order to facilitate the honorable member's purchase of his furniture? Does he pretend that a little incident of that kind affecting his likings and his pleasure is to furnish a basis for legislation of this kind? I ask honorable members to show the need for preventing piracy of union trade marks, or for preventing fraud in connexion with them. </para>

I am heartily in agreement with all the excellent moral precepts to which the Attorney-General gave utterance this afternoon. His statements would have done credit to a professor of moral philosophy at one of our universities. I agree with him that fraud ought to be punished wherever it may be found. I concur with him. also, that it is one of the meanest of acts for one man to perpetrate a fraud upon another by appropriating his life's work, and that we should severely punish such offences. I do not believe, however, that we should legislate upon the off chance that something of that kind may occur at some time or other. We should not go to the trouble of introducing drastic legislation merely because fraud has occurred somewhere else under conditions which are entirely different from ours. If all that is desired is that goods shall be described truly to name, and that the individuals who produce the goods shall derive the full benefit of the conditions under which they are manufactured, those ends can be achieved by adopting the amendments proposed by the honorable and learned member for Corinella. The Attorney-General will be met at every point, so far as his high moral view of the question is concerned. </para>

I am afraid, however, that that is not all that is being sought for in the Bill. .

                        <para>- Some of the unions now use labels, which are not the subject of any grave frauds. There may be incidental cases of that character, but I deny that any urgent need exists fbr preventive legislation. The Attorney-General said that if persons wished to purchase union-made goods, they should not be subject to being deceived by pirates. That is pretty strong language to use. </para>

We ought to occupy our time with) matters which are vital to the interests of the country. I did not quite follow the Attorney-General when he was discussing the question of trade union legislation in, America. He told us that trade union label Acts were in operation in forty States and territories, but I was not clear as to whether the union label provisions were in every case attached to a Trade Marks Bill, or embodied in a separate measure. </para>

                        <para>-I am quite prepared to believe that the Attorney-General is acting in perfect good faith, and that he believes that we have power under the Constitution to legislate in regard to union labels. It is a curious fact that in America, where they have a Federal Constitution very similar to our own, the trade union label provisions have been embodied in separate Acts, instead of being bundled up in a Trade Marks Bill, as is proposed here. I' believe that in the Canadian case the head of the Trade Marks Department declared that union label provisions could not be incorporated in a Trade Marks Bill, and declined on, that ground to register them. That was the reason why the Parliament rejected the union label provisions in the first instance. All the expert evidence was to the effect tha£ the union labels were foreign to the object of a Trade Marks Bill, and could not be incorporated in it. The same view was taken by the Commissioner of Patents at Washington, who said that union labels were not trade marks, because they did not include ownership. Shall we not accept the dictum of an expert who has devoted his lifelong attention to trade marks matters. rather than that of a Judge versed merely in the dry technicalities of the law ? I do not think that it was ever contemplated that we should meddle with legislation of this kind. The drafting of the Bill now before us makes it. very clear that the union label is foreign to the purposes of a Trade Marks Bill. If a union label is a trade mark, why should parts iii., iv., v., and vi. of the measure have to be made non-applicable to it? Why could not the whole of the machinery of the Bill be made to apply? The answer is that there is an immense difference between a union label and an ordinary trade mark. That difference arises, first of all, with regard to the ownership of the label. The anomaly in connexion with this Bill is that while the worker is given a proprietary interest in the label, he cannot use it at all himself. He cannot attach it to any goods, Does that indicate ownership? The only person who can use the union label is the employer, who cannot own it. The employer cannot own it; but is allowed to use it, whereas the worker is permitted to own it, but cannot use it. If there were any tangible- marketable ownership which could be transferred, surely a man would have a right to its use without the interference of an outside person. Yet that cannot be done with a union label. Therefore the workman cannot own a union label in the sense that a man owns a trade mark, and provisions such as those now before us must necessarily be foreign to the genius and purpose of a Trade Marks Bill. I do not think we have any right to interfere in industrial matters, which- are expressly, placed beyond the range of our powers. Eminent counsel tell us that we shall lay up a heavy crop of constitutional difficulties by acting in the manner now proposed. The Attorney-General quoted the statement of one of the American Judges to the effect that a man had a right to have his special skill labelled as such ora the market; but the Bill does not propose to give a working man that right. He cannot use the label. That is left to another man, in whom the proprietorship of the label w not vested. Without the intervention of the employer, all the workman's efforts to put an indication of his special skill on the market must be futile. The Attorney-General has so tied the workman up in this Bill that he cannot move hand or Toot without the employer. </para>

I have no wish to set up in Australia industrial conditions such as those which exist in America, and I shall do my best to prevent anything of that kind occurring. Yet all the illustrations used by the At torney-General have been taken from that country-. </para>

If these be the result of 'the successful working of the union label provisions, there is every reason why we. should not introduce them into our legislation. The Attorney-General quoted the case of the cigar- makers of America, and stated 'that they were working under conditions which were conducive to disease and dirt. I doubt, however, whether the same thing could be said with regard to the cigarmakers of Australia. Unless the Attorney-General can show that similar conditions exist here, there seems to be no point in his use of the American illustration. </para>

                        <para>- I challenge the Attorney-General to show a parallel in Australia to the instance he has quoted from America of cigar-makers sweltering in disease, living in rookeries, and under conditions of moral and social degradation. If he cannot do so, it is idle for him to quote such illustrations as indicating the necessity for union label legislation in Australia. Our cigar-makers have tribunals operating all over Australia, to which they can represent their grievances. </para>

                        <para>- That has nothing whatever to do with my point. I apprehend that when this law is passed it will be evaded. My point is that we have already established a special tribunal to look after the cigar-makers, the hatters, and the clothiers, and in that respect those trades differ entirely from similar trades in America. We were assured by the Attorney-General that so popular is this legislation in America that forty States and Territories, representing 68,000,000 people, have adopted it. But what are the relations between labour and capital which obtain in those States. </para>

My point is that in the forty States to which I have referred, the relations which exist between capital and labour are infinitely worse than they are in Australia.

                        <para>-I did not. I challenge the honorable member to show that I did. If he will look up my record - of which he is always talking - he will find that I consistently advocated the adoption of conciliatory measures. I believe in the worker getting a fair share of his product. The honorable member says that the true view is to make this class war as keen as possible, in order to force the workers to insist upon their rights. If I could see any chance of improving the relations which exist in Australia between capital and labour by means of the union label, I would hold up both hands for it to-morrow. It is because I recognise that to bring it into operation will only intensify that class bitterness, which the honorable member for Barrier so earnestly seeks, that I am opposed to it, root and branch. I believe that it will accentuate that bitterness, and increase that friction. It has done so everywhere else, and it will do so here. Its compensating advantages are small indeed when weighed alongside that bitter class feeling which it has begotten in other portions of the globe. It has always been my strong desire to bring capital and labour closer together. When I had something to do with the coal miners and coal proprietors in the place where I was. brought up, I had access to every manager's office, and I settled all disputes which arose over the office table, and I left the miners with better wages and conditions than they have since enjoyed. </para>

                        <para>- It has everything to do with it. All these later developments, of which the trade union label forms a part, can have no result other than to further embitter the relations which exist between the worker and his employer. For that reason I am very much opposed to them ever taking root in Australian soil. Whatever objects trades organizations in America may hope to achieve by means of the union label, we have other means of securing them in Australia. There is no need for this mischievous, meddlesome legislation. We have been .led to believe by some honorable members that the States Legislatures in America are all more or less under the thumb of corrupt persons - that they are invariably subject to corrupt influences. I think we may fairly be suspicious of the laws which are enacted by those Legislatures to which we hear such constant reference in terms of opprobrium and reproach. Whilst honorable members have nothing but evil to say of them in respect of other matters, they single out their action in connexion with the adoption of the union label as a pattern for Australia. Is it not just possible that these labels are manipulated for trust purposes? </para>

                        <para>- Everything in those States is supposed to be under the thumb of trusts. Is it unreasonable to suppose that in some way the trusts have prompted this legislation for their own advantage? To-day the Attorney-General ranged1 over the whole of those forty States, and he could not find in any one of them such a tribunal as a compulsory Arbitration Court. He could not point to one in which Wages Boards had been established by statutory authority. I see no reason why we should adopt this Yankee idea here. In my opinion, if this legislation be passed the unionists will suffer in another way. Honorable members, I presume, do not imagine that there will not be retaliation on the part of the capitalists. Before today we have seen labour circumvented by the machinations of capitalists. We have known this sort of legislation to turn out nothing but dead sea apples, as the result of the pressure that is applied from without. Do honorable members imagine that there will not be retaliation upon the other side? Judging by the feeling which exists outside this House, I am of opinion that class bitterness will be intensified by these proposals to a very great degree. The final result will certainly not be to the advantage of those who are most earnestly seeking to place this legislation upon, the statute-book. That is the view which I hold very strongly. Time alone will show whether my fears in that respect are well founded. During the course of this debate frequent reference has been made to boycotting. I maintain that there will be boycotting upon both sides. Two can always play at that game, and it. is a bad business at the best. I was more than surprised to hear the honorable member for Bland deliberately defend the boycotting of capitalists the other night. I have never made any pretence of defending boycotting by the capitalists, and I never shall. </para>

                <para class="block">The result of a boycott is always to stir up further strife In my opinion, when it comes to boycotting, the capitalist in every case gains an advantage, because he has the means of carrying on the war, whereas the worker has not. In another portion of his argument, the Attorney-General said that this was not a case of union as against non-union labour, and could not be argued in that way. He said it was the case of a great body of workers who were asking that the same rights should be extended to them as were given to other trade-mark owners. If that be so, there must have been a strange modification of feeling amongst members of the Labour Party since this matter was introduced into the Senate.

                <para>I am sure that I could' draft a better clause than that myself. However, its meaning can, with a little trouble, be discerned. It is intended to apply the benefits of the union label to non-union shops which have observed good conditions as to employment and wages. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. I take it that the main purpose of the union label is to insure good conditions so far as the employes are concerned. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> drew a very sharp distinction between unionists and non-unionists. In that respect, he differed entirely from the position taken up by the Attorney-General this afternoon. Of course, that is a minor point, and I do not press it. One of my main contentions against this legislation is1 that it is a further attempt to " political ize " the trade unions of Australia. I am a strong believer in the value of voluntary trade unionism, and I hold that all the good which is being derived by trade unions to-day is due to their organization as such, quite apart from their political aims. I would further point out that in America the workers will not hear of such a tribunal as a Compulsory Arbitration Court. They will not allow the State to interfere" in the settlement of their disputes. Neither will the great body of British unionists. The great body of unionists in Great Britain and America would reprobate a man if he dared to stand up for this tinkering with politics, as we know it in Australia. But here a man who does not subscribe to the full extent to the political influence which is exercised by unionists is branded as a traitor, a renegade, and a "rat." That' is the great distinction between myself and members of the Labour corner. </para>

                        <para>- It does not. It coerces them into one union before they can operate a common label. In other words, one union, by means of this label, may form itself into a close corporation. The Attorney-General cannot deny the accuracy of my statement. If there are three separate unions in a State running their own local' organizations, and if one of them registers a label, the other two - whose members may be working under precisely similar conditions, which may be prescribed by the Arbitration Court - are debarred from using it. Why? </para>

                        <para>- The inference is, as we said at the time, that these provisions were temporarily withdrawn for the purpose of enacting the "gag" to force them through, and yet after a scandalous waste of the time of this Parliament for a fortnight in enacting the ' 1 gag, " it is to be hung up as a useless thing. The public will now understand the farcical nature of the business before us during the past fortnight. They will have an opportunity to see that the whole thing is make-believe,, and that those who have been engaged in it are political frauds, hypocrites and pretenders. </para>

                    <para>- It is very, regrettable that we should be still discussing these clauses at this hour. The first question we have to ask is whether there is anything in the circumstances existing in Australia to-day to warrant the introduction of this legislation. The operation of union label provisions in the United States of America has not been so successful as to lead us to introduce them in Australia. The Attorney-General in his very able speech pointed out that union label legislation had been adopted in some forty of the States of the American Union, but I have heard no argument to show that there is any necessity for the introduction of such legislation in Australia at the present time. Since the inauguration of the Commonwealth the various Federal Governments, instead of dealing with, the important matters for which the Federal Parliament was created, have introduced legislation which has caused dissension and dissatisfaction throughout Australia. This is class legislation, and, as such, is sure to cause further dissension. All the precedents quoted by the Attorney-General were American precedents, and the state of affairs existing between employers and employes in that country is not such as to induce us to place our people in a similar position. This is really an attempt to establish trade unions of a political character, and we are justified in opposing it on that ground. I should like to 'hear the Attorney-General on. the constitutionality of the proposal now made, because I have heard very strong opinions expressed, not only by lawyers in this House, but bv lawyers occupying prominent positions in New South Wales, to the effect that these union labour provisions are unconstitutional. I do not know whether the Attorney-General expressed any views in regard to that matter. </para>

                        <para>- -Then I regret that I missed that part of the honorable and learned gentleman's speech, but I can assume that he looks upon these provisions as constitutional, or he would not be proceeding with them. In my opinion, it is very doubtful whether, under the powers conferred on this Parliament by the Constitution, we have any right to interfere with the industrial legislation of Australia. In dealing with "the American legislation on this subject, it should be borne in mind that it is a matter of common report that bribery and corruption goes on in American Legislatures, and the mere fact that this legislation has been passed bv the Legislatures of forty States of the American Union is not a sufficient reason for adopting it here. It has resulted in America in the introduction and establishment of a regular system of boycott in trade. </para>

                        <para>- I am sorry that 1 have mislaid a reference to such a case; but I shall bring it under the notice of the Attorney-General. The honorable and learned gentleman made the point that there has not been one non-unionist in Australia who has raised his voice in opposition to these proposals. That is easily understood when we remember that although non-unionists form by far the largest proportion of the workers of Australia, they are not organized. But if the voice of the individual non-unionist is not heard in opposition to these proposals, many members of this Committee, who represent large bodies of non-unionists, raise their voices in opposition to these clauses on their behalf. </para>

                        <para>- I am aware that they do, and it is strange that the Government should be forcing this Bill through under the whip of the Labour Party, who are keeping them in power. The Attorney-General has said that in these clauses he is trying to hold the scales evenly between unionists and non-unionists, but I think that the honorable and learned gentleman has failed to do so. It is to my mind a matter for extreme regret that members of the Ministry, who are notoriously in opposition to legislation of this character, should be prepared to sink their strong convictions and assist the Attorney-General in carrying it. How they can. reconcile their consciences in this matter, I am unable to say. If I thought that legislation of this character was necessary, that industrial conditions in Australia warranted its introduction, that it would benefit the workers, that it would not set class against class, would not establish an industrial boycott in Australia- and would insure the manufacture of goods under proper conditions, I should be disposed to support it. But I believe that it will not do what is claimed for it, and that it will bring about the evils which have been suggested. These union label clauses are an excrescence upon a Trade Marks Bill; they should never have been introduced into such a measure. They have been so introduced under pressure, and the Government are resorting to pressure to have them passed. The Prime Minister said al few days ago, "The task must be done," and it appears that this is part of the task to which the honorable and learned gentleman referred. I need only add that I shall be prepared to resist the passing of the clauses proposed by the Attorney-General as strongly as I possibly can. </para>

                    <para>- Before continuing my speech I should like to appeal to the Government to permit those who are in attendance upon honorable members to secure some rest, even though we should ourselves be compelled by tyrannical action on the part of the Government to remain here. When speaking before, I regarded a remark made by the Vice-President of the Executive Council as a promise that we should adjourn at about 11 o'clock, but had I known that there would be an all-night sitting, I should not have condensed my. remarks as I did. I was dealing with some decisions given in American Courts bearing on the union label. I showed that this legislation in America had led to such abuses that frequent appeals had to be made to the Courts for protection against the tyranny, coercion and intimidation of the boycott,, which had assumed such alarming proportions in the United States as to institute virtually a reign of terror in that country. I quoted American judgments to show that these boycotts were considered illegal, and that the union label was illegal. </para>

                        <para>- That quotation is a patchwork quotation. If the full report of the case is looked at it will be found that the Judge decided that he could on equitable grounds do it, and he did. I can assure the honorable member that these quotations, from whatever source they come, are garbled. I do not say that the words are not correctly set down, but if the honorable member read the cases throughout he would form a different idea of the decisions from that which he has gained from these garbled reports. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable and learned gentleman has a later volume than the one in my hand. Even if it is referred to as a trade mark, the union label cannot be dealt with or treated as a trade mark in the same way as an ordinary merchandise trade mark is treated. What gives value to a trade mark is the fact that there is ownership, and the right to dispose of the article to which it is applied. But that right does not extend to a union of employes who are simply engaged in the production of the article, and have no proprietary rights therein. Although a manufacturer puts the union label on the article, it does not as a commercial asset have any value. On the contrary, it has the effect of depreciating the value of a trade mark. In one case, although the cigar manufacturers were willing to, and did employ, all union labour in the production of their cigars, still they did not wish to use the union label, because they found that if depreciated the value of their trade mark, and' their goods. The honorable member for Bland has frequently suggested by interjection that the union label is required for the purpose of putting a stop to the depredations of pirates or piracy ; that the work of the trades unionists in Australia was being continually pirated. But when honorable members on the other side are asked to state any case of piracy they are silent. I do not believe that there is any piracy of that kind going on here. Nor do I think that there is any possibility of its taking place. </para>

                        <para>- Recently the deputy leader of the Labour Party paid a. visit to my electorate, and in the course of a speech he justified this legislation on the score that it was needed to secure for the people pure food and sound clothing. One of my constituents informed me that after listening to the speech he thought that the union label must be all right, because he had been told that it was intended to protect the people against being supplied with improper food and clothing. There is no provision in this Bill to warrant such a statement being made. </para>

The Bill does not pretend to secure to the people pure food or sound clothing. As a matter of fact, the worst possible food and clothing may bear the union label. For instance, boots have been manufactured in Melbourne with leather, which chemical analysis has shown to be loaded with a poisonous substance. </para>

If the union label is intended to insure that the people shall get sound goods, I submit that it will not attain that end. It will be utterly powerless to protect the public against cases of imposition, and when honorable members say that it will, they are only misleading their constituents.

I should like to know how some honorable members who have most trenchantly denounced that principle are now to be found in a Government which is not only supporting, but putting forward, proposals for its enactment.

                        <para>- I assure you, sir, that I have made the statement only once. Whilst the enactment of the union label may be justified in countries which do not possess industrial legislation, such as these States possess, for the special protection of workers in various ways, there is no justification for its enactment in Australia. Our Wages Boards, Arbitration Courts, and factories laws are designed expressly to insure to the workers those very conditions, which it is urged the enactment of the union label will secure. It will introduce what are known in the United States as "closed shops." On that subject, I propose to read a short extract from an article which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Atlantic Monthly,</inline> of October, j 904. It is from the pen of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charles</inline> J. Bullock, and is entitled " The Closed Shop." The concluding paragraph reads as follows: - </para>

                <para>A little reflection should convince any one that the conditions under which a man shall dispose of his labour are of such exceeding importance to society that, if freedom is to be denied, the restrictions imposed should be determined by the. Government, and not by any other agency. Such regulations should be just, uniform, and certain ; they should not be subject to the possible caprice, selfishness, or special exigencies of a labour organization. Here, as elsewhere, we should apply the principle that when it is necessary to restrict the freedom of labour or. capital to enter any industry, the matter becomes the subject of public concern and public regulation. If membership in a labour organization is to be a condition precedent to the right of securing employment, it will be necessary for the Government to control the constitution, policy, and management of such associations, so far as may be requisite for the purpose in view. Only upon these terms would the compulsory unionization of industry be conceivable. Of course, before such legislation could be enacted, a change in the organic law of the States and the nation would need to be effected, for we now have numerous constitutional guarantees of the right of property in labour. These guarantees include the right to make lawful contracts, and the individual freedom so ordained can be restricted by the Legislature only when the restraint can be justified as a proper exercise of the police power. Time and effort might be required for securing such constitutional amendments; but ov.r instruments of Government provide a lawful and reasonable method of accomplishing this result. </para>

                <para>A Bill to legalize the union label was first introduced in 1895, and has been reintroduced almost every year since. It does not appear at any time to have been a Government measure, but was in the hands of private members, its latest sponsor being <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ralph</inline> Smith, M.F. </para>
                <para>In Canada, as in Australia, the union label cannot be registered as a trade mark under the existing law. Therefore, special legislation is required to legalize it. Up to and including 1903 the Bill to effect this purpose was introduced as an amendment of the Trade Marks and Designs Act. When the Bill of that year was discussed in the Upper House (where it was first brought in), the principle involved in' recognising the label as a trade mark was declared to be unsafe and undesirable, and the measure was thrown out. </para>
                <para>In this year's Bill all reference to the Trade Marks Act was dropped, and it was styled " The Union Label Bill." It was introduced in the Canadian House of Commons on 30th January, 1905. </para>

                <para>The Bill seemed harmless, and the reasons urged for its adoption looked specious enough on the surface and at a first glance. Its promoters claimed that its intention was to prevent the use of bogus labels, and to protect' the community from the products of prison labour and the sweat-shop, and to legalize a guarantee that all goods bearing the label represent fair wages, reasonable working hours, and good sanitary conditions. </para>
                <para>The Case against the Label. . </para>
                <para>The case against the label was presented to members by the Canadian Manufacturers' Association. While offering numerous and weighty argument's against the label and its use, as shown, in the United States and in Canada, the employers really rested their case on the principle involved.

I hope that before the Bill is accepted, some such action will be taken with a view to the recommendations of the Select Committee being embodied in a separate Bill. </para>

But upon close examination, I find that the divergences are considerable and well worthy of the attention of serious-minded men. The first proposition with which we had to deal was one for trade union marks ; the next was for union trade marks, whilst the third and last is a proposal to provide for workers' trade marks. What is the difference between a trade union mark and a union trade mark if it be not a mere juggle in terms ? </para>

                        <para>- I have dealt with the proposition in order that we may gauge the accuracy of the Attorney-General's judgment that there is no material difference between the first and second list of amendments circulated by him. Honorable members have framed their judgment on the original proposition made bv him, and the moment I begin to show that there is a vital difference between the two, the Attorney-General would stifle discussion. I am surprised at that omission of a definition of a vital provision, since simple words like "production" and "produced" are defined at length. We can only regard those definitions as padding designed to cover up the deficiency to which I have referred. There is also a difference between the original proposition as to registration and that now under consideration. This appears to indicate that the Attorney-General's first proposal was loosely-drafted, because it did not protect the unions. In his second proposal he has corrected a number of his errors of omission. Another point is that in the original proposition there was a proper differentiation made between individual workers' marks and association workers' marks. That difference was a very real one. I think that there is a flaw in the present proposition, and that the two proposals ought to be properly separated. Although there is a pretence of similarity between the two, they have really nothing in common. The one deals with associations registering labels for definite purposes, and the other with individual workers' marks which can be of no value to the individual, since no article is the product pf one man. This is an indication of the need for further consideration of these matters on the part of the Attorney-General. Some days ago I quoted a statement from an American journal that the union label was typical of American industrial conditions - conditions which did not exist outside that country. But I heard last night that an honorable member of this House was instrumental in introducing the principle of the union label in one of the greatest unions in the mother country. We know what has been the effect of the union label in the United States and the honorable member in question ought certainly to tell us what has been the experience in England in this regard. We can only assume, in the absence of any explanation, that it has been still more unfortunate than has been that of the United States. The honorable member for Darling said that these provisions would be exceptionally beneficial to non-unionists. He proceeds on the assumption that whenever the union label is used, higher wages will prevail. I contest that assumption. It is clear that, so far as the majority of the workers in the Commonwealth are concerned one tribunal settles all questions of wages. But if the honorable member's original assumption be right - and we know that it is not - he is still wrong when, he proceeds further with his line of argument. He says that if non-unionists are forced to join unions because of the union label, they are forced into improved conditions. In that respect he is egregiously wrong. There is only a certain yearly amount of national production. All wages, whether of capital or of labour, have to be paid out of that yearly production, and if all men have to be driven into unions, does it not necessarily follow that there will be a levelling down as well as a levelling up of wages. The amount of wages to be paid practically remains stationary within narrow limits. If men are forced into unions the result will be, not to bring all wages up to union rates,, but to. draw a mean between the lower wages which the honorable member claims are paid outside the unions, and the higher wages that are paid inside. I trust that the Attorney-General will seriously consider the points that I have endeavoured to put before him. </para>

                    SMITH (Macquarie).In the course of an able speech, the honorable member for Parramatta has dealt with this question from the unionist standpoint, and has shown that to pass the proposals now before us would be to make a serious mistake. The honorable member for Wide Bay recently visited the electorate of Lang and sought to show that the union label was designed to protect the people from adulterated goods. That was an unfair position to take up. I hold that the Labour Party should be ready to deal with this matter without any attempt to introduce considerations that must tend to confuse the public mind. The union label was introduced in America to meet special conditions. The- people there had no such industrial legislation as we have in Australia to enable the workers to secure fair treatment, and it is because we do not desire an injustice to be inflicted upon any section of the community that we feel it our dutv to point out that these provisions will not confer upon the workers the benefits which some honorable members claim will flow from them. The Labour Party, when in power, failed to pass any law designed to improve the position of the workers. All the great reforms that have led to the improvement of their conditions were brought about by the very men whom the Labour Party declare to be their enemies. No one can say that I have not the interests of the workers at heart. In the United States labour has greater difficulty in securing the recognition of its rights than it has in any other part of the world. The union label laws of that country have not prevented the formation of huge trusts, and we know that the workers have complained again and again that these trusts exercise a serious influence upon them. The United States is the home of trusts, and it has not been shown that the union label has helped the workers there. It was introduced because of the absence of factories and arbitration laws, such as have been enacted in Australia. When compulsory arbitration was first proposed in New South Wales, the Labour members were among its strongest opponents; and yet, because the Opposition point out that, in their opinion, the proposals now before the Committee will be injurious to the workers, we are said to be enemies of labour.

Last session a great fight took place on the question of preference to unionists, and the present Prime Minister, the Treasurer, and the Vice-President of the Executive Council, supported our contention that preference should not be granted unless the Court were satisfied that the applicants represented a majority of those affected by the award. They urged then that all worker's should be treated alike. Why have they changed their views? I do not think that any one would accuse the Treasurer of being a great friend of the workers. </para>

                        <para>- The right honorable member for Swan is now being strongly supported by the Labour Party, and may be regarded practically as the Labour representative of Western Australia. Why has he changed his views? The Prime Minister, too, has gone back on the opinions which he once expressed. We should knew the reason for these changes. Perhaps the next we shall hear will be that they have both joined the caucus parry. Honorable members on this side of the Chamber have always shown a readiness to support legislation which will benefit the worker. We have passed an arbitration law, which, in my opinion, will do more for labour than the adoption of the proposed trade union label provisions. Of course, every honorable member would like to put an end to all fraudulent dealings with goods. </para>

                        <para>- Such practices could be prevented without the enactment of these provisions. I have always been in favour of unionism, but the action of men in joining unions should be purely voluntary, and the unions, instead of being political organizations, should devote their energies to the improvement of industrial conditions. The clauses which the Attorney-General wishes to insert in the Bill wilt do injustice to the hundreds of thousands of non-unionists in Australia. Why should a factory in which fair rates of wages are paid, and proper conditions of labour observed, be boycotted because it employs others than unionists? It may, be that many of the non-unionists in such a factory have not joined unions because of their political convictions. Such men have been referred to as " blacklegs " ; but no honest worker should be so stigmatized. </para>

                        <para>- It is not properly recognised. The clauses which honorable members opposite are supporting will work injustice to the thousands of non-unionists in Australia to whom, largely, they owe their positions. While giving credit to the unions for the work they have accomplished, I contend that the concessions they have won could not have been secured had it not been for the support of the non-unionists. My great desire is that class shall not be set against class, but that capital and labour shall work amicably together. Therefore, I am opposed to any class distinctions of the nature created by the proposals of the Attorney-General. We know what has been the effect of the union label in America, though I shall not occupy time in reading the voluminous evidence with which I could support the statement that that effect has been very bad. In conclusion. I would point out to the Ministry that they would have gained more by showing a little tact last night, and consenting to an adjournment at a reasonable hour, on the promise that the measure would be dealt with before the dinner adjournment on Tuesday next, than they have gained by forcing honorable members to sit all night. I would only remind them of the fortnight's loss of time which ensued from a similar want of fact only recently, when the consideration of the Bill in Committee began. </para>

                        <para>- I do, and I feel that our discussions would proceed much more smoothly if there were a more general recognition of the desire to achieve only the public good, which actuates honorable members in every part of the Chamber. But each of us must endeavour to mould the laws of the country as we think will best serve the interests, not of our individual constituents only, but of the whole Commonwealth, and it seems to me, and to those whom I represent, that the provisions which it is proposed to place in the Bill will be detrimental to the interests of the people as a whole, and will recoil upon those who are bringing them forward. I took very full notes of the clear and lucid exposition of his position delivered by the Attorney-General last night, though I entirely dissent from many of his conclusions. But before proceeding to deal with them at length, I should like to express regret at the practice of some honorable member in removing from the Library books of common reference. There are several books in the catalogue - blue-books of the States, and the records of the Philadelphia Bureau of Labour, together with other works dealing with the labour conditions of the United States, which should be available to every honorable member who wishes to refer to them, but which, having been taken from the custody of the Librarian, cannot be consulted. The Attorney-General told us that the opposition which has been shown to the principle underlying the clauses which he seeks to have inserted in the Bill is due to a misconception of their intention and probable effect, but as I shall show, it is based on the results of the careful and thoughtful consideration which it has received, not only from honorable members, but from various public bodies outside. The honorable gentleman claimed that the whole object of these provisions is to prevent fraud. We must all agree that that is an eminently proper object; but his subsequent statements showed that he is introducing a new principle in connexion with trade marks law. I shall not presume to express an opinion about the constitutionality of these proposals, because I know that even the most distinguished lawyers are at variance on the subject, and the question can be determined only by the High Court ; but I think I shall be able to show that it is undesirable to introduce this new principle into our trade marks law. The Attorney-General supported his proposals on the ground that they would give to the workers advantages which are now enjoyed only by the capitalists. But do honorable members opposite imagine - and there are many of them who are owners of property and employers of labour - that it is possible to place on all-fours those who are responsible for the control and management of property, and the men who come to them for a day's, or a week's, or a month's work? </para>

                        <para>- I am basing my remarks on his exact words, and I say that it is impossible to place employers and employes in exactly the same position. I admit that the proposals of the Government are a considerable modification of the provisions which were first inserted in the Bill at the instance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce,</inline> and the Government deserve credit for recognising the possibility that the trade union label may be improperly used, and for thus curtailing the aspirations of the Labour Party. But, although the Attorney-General contends tHat no discrimination must be made between the various sections of the community, he forgot to point out that men are not all possessed of the same mental and physical capacity, and it is impossible to disregard the social difference created by this inequality. Uniformity is absolutely impossible under present conditions, though many Labour members seem to cherish the idea that all grades of society can be levelled up or levelled down, until there is no inequality. </para>

                        <para>- If the honorable member will read his Milton, or even a higher authority, he will find that in Heaven there are gradations of rank - that there are angels and arch-angels there. It was not proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> that the trade union label should be affixed to goods only with the consent of the manufacturer. That is a modification of the original proposal, for which the Government are responsible. But we are justified in fearing that the Labour Party have agreed to it only to secure an instalment of what they desire, and that, later on, they will press for more. Of course, the law must be no respecter of persons ; every man must have the same legal rights and responsibilities. But it is impossible, as I have said, to remove all social inequalities. There could be no objection <inline font-style="italic">-per se</inline> to the attachment to goods of a label indicating that they have been made by certain associations of men, but we know that such labels have been very improperly used.

                        <para>- I think that it will be generally admitted that I have no capacity for " stone-walling." It is an art in which I do not excel. Reference has been made to the introduction of the union label in the cigar trade of the United States. Every well-thinking person should be in accord with honorable members opposite in endeavouring to secure the abolition of conditions of labour and of manufacture such as originated the union label in America. I happened' to be in San Francisco when the subject was inflaming the public mind there. Some years later, strange to say, I happened to be in Chicago when the union label was the cause of an active agitation, and' was able to see its effects upon industry. In two or three instances which came under my personal notice, the unionists had absolutely sold themselves to employers, who had no consideration for human life, and the label was being used purely for capitalistic and monopolistic purposes. </para>

                        <para>- It could have been done under the union label clauses as they came from the Senate. If we were satisfied that the label would only be used for the purpose of securing humane conditions for the workers, there would be no reasonable objection to it. But that is not the object. I should say God-speed to the honorable members opposite if it were. The object is to use the label as a means of coercion. </para>

                        <para>- If capital cannot secure a fair profit it will leave the country; and the supporters of the Labour Party cannot exist without capital. The Attorney-General has argued that this is not a question of union as against non-union labour, but merely a recognition of the rights of workers. Let me point out that the workers are to be divided into three classes. There are the unionists, and there are those who are indifferent to unionism. But there is a third class of workers who are opposed to trade unionism altogether, and object to its methods. I have always held that there is some strength in the contention of the unionists that they are struggling for. the benefit of their class, and have secured advantages for it at the cost of personal sacrifice. There is, on their part, a feeling of resentment against workers who will not join them. But while one can sympathize with that feeling, it is quite another matter to use coercive measures with the object of compelling non-unionists to join the labour organizations. </para>

                        <para>- Honorable members opposite are not the persons who will suffer most from a dislocation of industrial conditions. It is the employes who will suffer. If any part of our industrial legislation is injuriously affected, the workers must suffer proportionately. If there had been a sincere desire on the part of the Government to ascertain public opinion on these proposals, they might have allowed them to be the subject of reference to the electors on a proper occasion. The Legislatures of the United States and Great Britain do not permit; (new principles to be introduced without careful and thoughtful consideration by Committees. It has been my privilege to meet <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Burns, the honorable member for Battersea, in the Imperial Parliament, and other trade union leaders in Great Britain. I honestly believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Burns</inline> would never have countenanced the passage of such a measure as this with out inquiry by a Committee or Commission. There is no more considerate man than he is in reference to the proper investigation of great public questions. His success is largely owing to the fact that he has never forgotten that legislation must not be ahead of public opinion. The unfortunate fact is that many honorable members who will vote for this proposal are really opposed to its principle. </para>

                        <para>- I recognise that their present masters have given them their directions, and that the honorable members ir&gt;- question are obeying them. I desire to read some protests which have been made by important public bodies against the trade union label clauses. The representations of the Employers' Federation justify the fullest consideration, as being the result of practical experience and careful thought. Certainly an assertion made with reference to the action, of banks upon their creditors is not warranted, but the worst construction has been put upon it. I have been an employe of a bank, and <inline font-style="italic">am</inline> now a bank director. I am associated with several banks in the city of Melbourne. The statement used by the Attorney-General that any bank would interfere in such a question as this for the purpose of putting the screw on any customer, as one which I am sure that honorable members, on both sides of the House, will characterize as ridiculous. I am entitled to say, speaking on behalf of the banks, that such a statement is without justification. </para>

                        <para>- There are several bank directors in this House, and every one, I am convinced, will support the statement I am making. I have before me the document to which the Attorney-General alluded. He urges that it contains the statement that in extreme cases pressure might be brought to bear upon a manufacturer through his creditors or his bank. I do not know what individual creditors might do, but ordinary business people look to legitimate methods of increasing their trade, rather than to methods of coercion or obstruction. It is absolutely wrong to say that any banker would use coercive methods, such as have been suggested. I intend to submit the objections to this Bill made by representative bodies in various parts of the Commonwealth. I ask the indulgence of the Committee while I read these documents, because I happen to hold a position of honour which I appreciate very highly as the representative of the Chambers of Commerce of Australia, and other important associations which have asked me to express their views. </para>

                    <para>- By permission of the honorable member for Kooyong, I wish to take the opportunity of directing attention to a few of the statements contained in the letter from the Chamber of Commerce, which he has quoted. I want to say straight away that the statement in the letter concerning myself is absolutely untrue. The third paragraph in the letter states that - </para>

                    <para>The Bill if passed will, by the admission of the labour leader in the House of Representatives, be made a weapon of boycott to the serious detriment of the free workman, of the manufacturers and producers, and of the community generally. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>That is a direct statement that I said in the House that this Bill, if passed, would be made a weapon of boycott. I was not aware of this correspondence until the present moment ; but I gather from it that the secretary of the Chamber of Commerce was asked by the Attorney-General where the statement alleged to have been made by me was made. The Attorney-General had never heard of such a statement. In reply to that question, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hallett</inline> relies upon a statement published in a leading article in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper, to the following effect : - </para>

                <para>There is not a word even in that quotation to justify the statement contained in the first letter from the Chamber of Commerce which the honorable member for Kooyong quoted. The statement there is that I had admitted that the trade union label would be made a weapon of boycott. I made no such statement. </para>

                        <para>- Under the circumstances, I take a pride in making the statement. The members of the union to which I belonged found it necessary to boycott certain persons who were sweating their employes, and competing unjustly against fair employers. I was not at the time working for any of those affected. I was in a newspaper office, and it was only in jobbing offices that sweating occurred. What other weapon had the members of the union against the sweating and improper employment of children which was then taking place in such offices? There was no Arbitration Court in existence, no wages board, and no legal means of remedying the evils to which I have alluded. </para>

                        <para>- Quite so. The main point of my contention is that there is no word in the quotation from the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper which would justify the statement that I had admitted that these union label clauses would be used as a weapon for a boycott. I say that that is a gross and palpable piece of misrepresentation on the part of the secretary of the Chamber of Commerce. It is, however, on a par with the whole campaign of mendacity that has been entered upon with regard to these proposals. It appears to me as being the most unfair thing possible that people who are opposed to this policy should endeavour to bolster up their case in the fashion that they have done, and that I have exposed. </para>

If the honorable member will allow me to have a few proof-slips of the speech which he has just made, I shall be happy to see that the Chambers of Commerce in Australia are made aware of his contradiction. If a wrong has been done to him he should have an opportunity of making a correction. I am surprised to learn that some of the protests against the trades union labour clauses, which I desire to read, were read during the night by the honorable member for Corangamite. I understand that he quoted them from newspapers. I have here only the original documents. I need not weary, the Committee by going through the various telegrams and letters that have come to me on the question; but I wish to put on record a digest of the objections urged by the various Chambers of Commerce - </para>

That such unjust and injurious legislation is intended to afford the means of boycotting the workers and distributers outside the unions, and the wares they may produce, is demonstrated by the text of the proposed clauses. This council protests against legislation at once dangerous and unjust as subversive of liberty and the well-being and peace of the community. It is also resolved that this council heartily approves of the Opposition members' energetic and patriotic efforts to prevent the inclusion of the Trades Union Label provisions in the Trades Marks Bill, and hopes that those efforts will be continued unflinchingly until successful. </para>

That such legislation cannot fail to bring about an improper and unjustifiable invasion of the rights of the individual, whether he be an employer or an employe.

Those of us who are opposed to these clauses have done our utmost to protest against them. Probably we shall not be able to resist much longer. The weight of numbers may be against us, owing to the unfortunate combination in favour of the provisions. There are honorable members who intend to vote for the trade union label' clauses who do not sincerely believe in them. Surely that is a serious position. </para>

The clauses will be carried, but I believe by a very narrow majority indeed. The responsibility will rest on two or three honorable members, who, to-day, are probably going to record a vote against their own sincere and deliberate convictions.

                    <para>- I regret that the discussion is not taking place under more favorable conditions. I also regret that honorable members - even the honorable member for "Kooyong - have thought fit to impute motives to other representatives in this House from whom they may happen to differ. When we have that c condition of affairs within Parliament, it is not surprising that misconceptions should prevail amongst the general public, 'who have not the same opportunity as ourselves to obtain accurate information, and thus become fully seized of the import of the particular provisions with which we are dealing. As to the charges of "bludgeoning," "sand-bagging," and so forth, i't is pleasing to know that up to the present time there has been applied no "gag" or restriction, but that, on the contrary, those who are opposed to the measure have had ample opportunity 4o express their opinions. Those who sup port the Bill will have every facility to make their defence when they go to their masters - the electors. I therefore see no justification whatever for the imputation of improper motives. </para>

                        <para>- I deeply regret the circumstances and conditions under which the Bill is being discussed. My little experience in business and in the affairs of the world, teaches me that men can generally deal with matters of material concern to themselves, without incurring any undue physical or mental strain. Honorable members have now been out of their beds for the last twenty-eight or thirty hours, engaged, under abnormal circumstances, in discussing a question of grave importance. I am inclined to believe that there is a great deal of misconception and misrepresentation in regard to the proposal now before the Committee. Within this Chamber we hear these clauses described as union label clauses, whereas in the Bill itself there is no restriction whatever as to the persons who may desire to use this label. I may be permitted to give an illustration of the misconception which prevails outside this Chamber. In a remote part of the country a public meeting was convened in order to obtain an expression of opinion on the merits of the proposal. When the meeting assembled a gentleman present, who had not seen the measure, asked the chairman the exact nature of the provisions. After inquiry amongst those present, it was found that no one was in a position to give any definite information. A little common sense was brought to bear, and a member of this House was written to, and asked to supply a copy of the Bill, and the meeting was adjourned until that should be received. That illustration does not convey an extreme idea of the condition of affairs prevailing throughout some of the rural districts of Victoria. Some few months ago a deputation interviewed me in regard to my attitude towards what are designated as the union label provisions of the Bill. As I stated when speaking on the second reading, I was prepared to approach the question with an open mind ; and I told the deputation that I would be delighted to hear what they had to say. They submitted their view of the case, and then I asked them ito state clearly and distinctly to which statements they were opposed - whether they were opposed to the proposal which was sent on from the Senate to this House, or to the proposal which was first formulated by the Attorney-General and submitted to us, or to the last proposal of the Attorney-General. Strange to say, not one of the deputation was in a position to distinguish between these different proposals. When we hear this label continually referred to in this Chamber as a union trade mark proposal, designed to carry with it preference to unionists, it is not to be wondered at that misconception should prevail in the minds of the public, who have not the same opportunity to inform themselves as have the members of this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- I am not going to speak at length, because I do not think there is any necessity to do so. I desire, however, to clearly state my position, and to show what my attitude has been on the general question. I have been amongst the workers all my life, and I am rather proud of the fact that I am a worker today. I may not at all times have seen eye to eye with those who worked beside me as manual labourers many years ago. I have been an advocate of unionism, but there has been no stronger critic than myself of many of the actions taken by unionism. In my opinion, unionists have been as wrong and as extreme on many occasions as have the capitalists or employers, whom unionists are prone to denounce at all times. </para>

                        <para>- Human nature is the same in all classes and conditions of society. There may be a little more veneer and polish in one section of society than another, but that veneer has only to be rubbed to show that nature is the same in ail men. Environment may alter views, but, at bottom, we are all alike. However, let me return to the principles which have always governed my actions in matters of this sort. Whenever an enactment, legislative or otherwise, will tend to the peaceful adjustment of disputes between employer and employed, I shall be prepared to give it my support, no matter how far that enactment may go. But if any proposed enactment will, to my mind, cause friction in matters industrial, as between employer and employee, then my support must be withheld. I have had no experience of industrial troubles beyond Australia, but I have been an eye-witness of much that has happened in Australia in this connexion. The advice tendered, more particularly by employers and capitalists, has always been to adopt peaceful means of settling these industrial disputes - to set aside the old barbarous methods of brute force, such as the boycott, and to get on speaking terms one side with the other. Twenty years ago it was within the reach of the most vivid imagination that industrial disputes would be submitted to a judicial tribunal? That, however, has been brought about ; and still we have capitalists and the employers to-day expressing a dread of something which the industrial population propose to do. I do not in the least share that dread; but I do say that a legislative body cannot be too careful about placing in the Hands of any section of the community a power that may prove a source of friction in the future. This is where I join issue with those who are advocating the label proposal, even in its present form. </para>

                    I am not so hidebound as to be afraid to change my mind if I am shown to be wrong. I remember clearly and distinctly what I did say when speaking on the second reading. I then directed my attention particularly to the remarks of the honorable member for Corangamite, when I expressed the opinion that I did not think it at all necessary to go to the United States for illustrations of the effects of this particular class of legislation. I added that I intended to approach the question with an
                    <inline font-style="italic">open</inline>
                    mind ; and no further commitment Bid I make then, nor have I made up to the present' time. To return to the merits of the proposal, what do we find? It is of no use talking about this as a trade union mark : that is done with. The original proposal which emanated from the Senate, was for a trade union mark pure and simple, and it was provided that none but trade unionists, or trade union organizations, should obtain registration. Under the present proposal, however, there is no restriction in the slightest degree. Even the honorable member for Kooyong, who is regarded as an extreme opponent of the measure, stated this morning thai: the present proposal of the Attorney-General, with the modifications which have been formulated, would be acceptable to him. Consequently there is not that great divergence of opinion to-day amongst members of this House that there appears to be amongst the public outside. The first question that occurs to my mind is whether there is any necessity at the present time in Australia for the workers to have the right to register trade marks? Then, if there is a necessity, is the Federal Parliament the proper authority to confer that right?

                <para>Mr.KENNEDY.- The right to use a label gives practically no advantage; and that is the whole difficulty. The workers of the United States have been chiefly cited in illustration; and some honorable members have gone so far as to say there are no industrial enactments there. In that, however, I think those honorable members are wrong, because there are a considerable number of industrial enactments in the United States to the advantage of the workers. </para>

                        <para>- It is a comfort at times to have a mind to change. I was saying that the conditions in America and the conditions in Australia are not at all analogous. In Australia, the tendency - although, unfortunately, it does not apply throughout - is to legislate with a view to hold the balance fairly between employer and employed. Apart from New Zealand; I venture to say that, in this respect, Australia is in the forefront of all industrial, communities. We have laid aside the old barbarous methods ; and the tendency is to work on improved lines. In Victoria there are Wages Boards, and in some of the other States, Courts of Conciliation and Arbitration. Will the proposal before us supersede or come into conflict with this States legislation ? </para>

                        <para>- I think that the States legislation will be most seriously affected. Will the Bill before us give to independent workers, or associations of workers outside trade unions, the right to register a trade mark? Will there be a separate and distinctive trade mark for trade unionists, as distinguished from others engaged in precisely the same industries? I should also like to know whether apart from factories laws and the Arbitration Courts, those who work in factories where there is no competent authority to prescribe the conditions of labour, will be prevented from obtaining a registered trade mark? So far as I can see, there is nothing in the Bill to that effect. There is not a line or word in the clause under discussion, to prevent any employe, under a Factories Act, or otherwise, from registering a trade mark. Is that so., or is it not? </para>

                        <para>- There is no such provision as that in the Bill. I say without hesitation that if any provision could be devised by which a mark might be applied to goods. made under fair conditions - under factories laws, or arbitration laws - and so distinguish goods made under sweated conditions, I should be prepared to support it. The proposal before us does not, in my humble judgment, attain that end. </para>

                        <para>- None whatever. The only value that a trade mark of the kind could have to the purchaser, would be to show that the goods had been manufactured under fair conditions. So far as I can understand, however, the proposal gives neither the worker nor the purchaser any such protection ; and that in my mind is a sufficient reason for opposing the clause. As I have already said, if some provision could be made by which the purchaser would be enabled to distinguish between the two classes of goods, I should be prepared to consider it on its merits. I do not think it necessary to argue the proposal from the point of view of preference to unionists. On this score, I am not alarmed in the slightest degree, seeing that the proposal does not give any preference to unionists. I desire, however, to put the position as it presents itself to my mind. It is admitted. I think, by those who make special claim to represent labour, that in large centres of population there are greater advantages arising from the membership of trades union and similar organizations, than there are in sparsely-populated centres throughout the rural districts. Iron-workers engaged in the manufacture of agricultural implements furnish a typical illustration. In the largest centres there is greater stability in reference to employment than, for instance, in the small towns of the Murray districts. In the latter, the employes change to a greater extent than in the city, and, for the reason I have just given, they are not unionists to the same extent as in the cities. But, so far as my inquiries go, the rate of pay is generally better in the country, while the conditions are equally good, if not better, than in the city </para>

                        <para>- I am speaking now of instances in regard to which I have made specific inquiries ; and I have in mv mind workshops in Shepparton, Numurkah, and similar towns. Assuming that effect were given to the proposal before us, the city workmen would naturally register their mark, and apply it to their goods; but in the country districts, for the reason I have already stated, the men would not, perhaps, take advantage of the Bill. Consequently, if, prompted by any motive whatever, a desire arose on the part of the public for goods marked with a label which was regarded as a guarantee of fair conditions of labour, the country workers would be placed at a disadvantage. The onus of proof would -lie upon them to show that their goods were also manufactured under fair conditions. </para>

                        <para>- Is the position I have described, a fair one in which to place a section of the workmen? The fear uppermost' in my mind is that unwittingly a grave in justice may be done by one section of workers as compared with another in the same trade. The reasons I have advanced are, in my opinion, fair and legitimate for opposing this proposal. But apart from these considerations - apart from the active use of such a label as a weapon of coercion - there is another phase of the question which deserves serious consideration. When I spoke on the second reading, I said that I did not think it necessary for the honorable member for Corangamite, or the honorable and learned member for Wannon to go to America for illustrations as to how the boycott may be used. Illustrations may be found in Australia, where, in circles in which the social veneer is most conspicuous, and in which the highest ethics might be expected, we find the boycott made an effective weapon of coercion. I refer to the learned professions - the very class who so strongly denounce the proposal now under discussion.

                        <para>- Is it not reasonable to assume that the masses will ape those who are designated as their betters, and use similar weapons for similar purposes ? I refer to the action of the legal profession, because it has been prominently brought under notice during the last few days. It is not generally known to honorable members from outside Victoria that in. this State there is an Act which amalgamates the two branches of the legal profession, and confers on solicitors the right to a]&gt; pear in Court as counsel. That law has been rendered inoperative by the action of a section of the legal fraternity. The rules of the barristers' union have been used as a means to boycott any member of that branch of the profession who acts as a solicitor, or appears as a solicitor. At the annual meeting of the Law Institute of Victoria, held recently, the President said - </para>

                        <para>- And the question of expediency arises in connexion with the proposal before us. Is that proposal expedient or otherwise? Similar conditions to those I have described prevail in the medical profession. A person might die of the toothache if he happened to call upon two members of the profession who were not members of the same union. Yet, strange to say, the two classes whom I have just mentioned are those who continuously denounce the labour and industrial sections of the community if they take any steps towards using their organizations as a means of coercion. The two instances mentioned are sufficient to justify me in exercising great caution about arming any section of the community with a weapon which may be used detrimentally towards another section. </para>

In my opinion, it is more incumbent on the States Legislatures to deal with a matter of this sort than on the Federal Parliament. What is the burden of the song of the advocates of this proposal, including even the Attorney-General ? We are told on all hands that in every instance in America in which legislation of this kind exists it has' been enacted and is administered by the States. </para>

                        <para>- I am not prepared to argue that point. In Australia, internal industrial legislation is, up to the present, a matter for the States; and the whole movement is, as I say, towards the promotion of the welfare of the whole community. Is it desirable or expedient for the Federal Parliament to introduce legislation which may cause friction,, and, to some extent, supersede or contravene the legislation of the States? Broadly speaking, the grounds I have stated are those on which I intend to vote against the proposal before us. It is not for honorable members to say that I have committed myself in this, that, or the other direction. When I spoke . on the second reading, I stated distinctly that I would approach the question with an open mind ; and I have already told honorable members that never since I entered public life have I given such attention to a question as I have given to this. As a worker myself, I differ from those who regard this as class legislation. No legislation is, to my mind, class legislation, more particularly legislation dealing with industrial matters. The relations of life are so interwoven and inter-dependent that not a single cog can be stopped without affecting the whole industrial machine. This has been proved times out of number, particularly in the maritime strike of 1890,, the shearers' strike, and the Victorian railways strike. If a section of industrial workers were specially dealt with in an Act, that might be called' class legislation; bue in the ultimate it would affect every section of the community. It has been said in this Chamber that in times of industrial trouble the unionists are the only persons who suffer. In my opinion, that statement is made unthinkingly. Who suffered when the shearers were called out? As I have stated previously here, in many cases the employers were supporting the unionists; and then it was the employers who were the "black- legs." If a section of workers, for reasons of their own, saw fit to offer, not active, but passive resistance, to another section, and cease work, within a week the result of that action would permeate the whole industrial community. </para>

                        <para>- The number of workers would have to be very limited, and their product not much in demand, if the result of their ceasing work was not felt throughout the industrial community within a very short time. For instance, if the agricultural implement workers were to cease work at a particular time of the year, what would be the effect? Our time might be better spent than in providing for a trade mark on goods in the manufacture of which our working men cannot find employment. A great many workers are not fully employed in Australia to-day, and it would be more to the purpose if we could do something to help them in this connexion. When they were fully employed, we might be fairly asked to legislate to assist them in marking the goods which they manufacture. I have no desire to take up further time, except to say. that, for the reasons I have stated, I shall vote against the proposal. </para>

The importance which the Government attach to the matter is quite evident from the fact that, with the object of limiting discussion, they have introduced some of the most drastic rules to be found in any Parliament in the world, and that on the very day the proposal is introduced recourse is had to an all-night sitting. </para>

                        <para>- Of most of the legislation introduced by the Government I can approve ; but the question before us is one which divides the whole community, and excites a deep and absorbing interest. Under the circumstances, the Committee ought to be allowed time for discussion, and I do not think that a couple of sittings, or even three, would be an unreasonable period to occupy. I do not go as far as the honorable member for Moira in the assumption that there is any serious misunderstanding in the country as to the intention and meaning of this clause ; I believe the object and effect are very generally known. I do not attach the slightest importance to the alterations that have been made in the verbiage or form of the proposal. The Attorney-General himself, in the paper he has issued to honorable members, draws special attention to the fact that the intention of the original clause is not in any way affected by the recent alterations. To call this a workers' label is, in my opinion, simply ridiculous. Can any one conceive a commodity produced without work? Of course we know that the intention and effect will be to limit this label strictly to the organized unions. I am sorry the Attorney-General is not present, because it is impossible to avoid direct references to the arguments he used in that powerful speech to which we listened yesterday. However, I may say at once that I listened with great pleasure to that speech, which was one of the cleverest of the many clever speeches I have heard the honorable and learned member deliver. And yet, with all my long knowledge of the Attorney-General's' great ability, and of his manner of dealing with cases, I must say that, if I had no previous knowledge of the question, I should not require anything further than that speech to utterly condemn the proposal in my mind. When the Attorney-General has a good case, he throws aside trivialities, and all that is not thoroughly pertinent to the issue. Yesterday, however, he contrived to avoid all the salient issues, and to labour the minor issues almost to straining point. The honorable and learned member even succeeded in using the same set of facts to prove two absolutely contrary contentions. He did not attempt to urge any necessity for this legislation in Australia, but referred us to some distant State in America, where the labour conditions were so bad that, in the absence of any effective industrial laws, it was absolutely necessary to devise some measure of protection, which took the form of a union label. It has been pointed out over and over again by public bodies, and at public meetings, that there is no necessity for legislation of this kind in Australia, seeing that we already have effective industrial legislation. </para>

                        <para>- The Attorney-General, although he had previously pointed out that .the utter absence of any effective industrial laws in the American States had rendered a union label necessary, quoted every Statute that had the remotest bearing upon the question to prove that in America there are such industrial laws. To prove this point the honorable and learned member used the same set of facts that he had used to show that there was no effective industrial law in operation. The Statutes quoted by the Attorney-General referred to sanitation and everything under the sun, except to the vital principles of the Bill before us. As an example of the cleverness of the speech, I mention the fact that the heartiest cheers from the labour comer were elicited by the Attorney-General's contention that the late Government were not unfriendly to this proposal. But, as a matter of fact, all that 'the Attorney-General succeeded in showing was that only one member of :the late Government, namely, the late Attorney-General, had referred to the proposal, and that he had expressed his intention to oppose it, either as part of the Trade Marks Bill or as separate legislation. </para>

                        <para>- That was because the late Government decided not to introduce the Bill. The honorable member for Grey need not be under any misapprehension as to the attitude of the late Government. The Trade Marks Bill and the Fraudulent Trade Marks Bill were both intrusted to me as a member of that Government, and the latter measure was carried to the Committee stage before Parliament prorogued. But, knowing the interminable discussion that would ensue on the union label provisions of the Trade Marks Bill, I did not introduce the. latter, and therefore it was not necessary for any member of- the late Government to refer to it. Moreover, it was my intention to embody the most essential clauses of the Trade Marks Bill in another measure which is now known as the Commerce Bill, so as to enable us to dispense with a Trade Marks Bill until the matter could be referred to the country. The Attorney-General strained every trivial argument to strengthen his case. If he had bad a good case he would have put the most salient and important features in the forefront, and would have represented them with all the clearness and -force of which he is capable. Yesterday, however, he dwelt altogether upon minor matters, and used the same set of facts to support two absolutely contrary conclusions. He asserted, among other things, that the late Government were not unfriendly to the union label, but in support of his statement could quote the utterances of only one member of that Administration who had announced his intention to oppose it. In combating the contention that the trade union label would be used for the purpose of boycotting non-unionists, he denied that it would have any effect of that kind, but he admitted - and thus gave away his whole case - that in America the unions appealed to the public to support them, and that the same results would ensue in Australia. The only thing he denied was that compulsion would be used. He claimed that any influence brought to bear to induce the public to refrain from buying certain goods would not amount to a boycott, unless force was used. If the Attorney-General were a non-unionist worker, he would regard any attempt to rob him of his employment as a boycott. He would certainly look upon the matter in that light, if 150,000 men constituted themselves canvassers with the object of inducing the public not to purchase the produce of his labour. The boycott would be equally effective, whether coercion or persuasion were used. The Attorney General stated that no serious objection had been raised to these proposals. If his experience has been anything like my own, he must have received a large number of protests. I have received some very strong ones. </para>

                        <para>- Yes; and from shire councils, and public meetings. The last protest which' reached me took the form of a resolution passed at a public meeting called by advertisement by the president of the shire of Maffra, to consider the question of the proposed union label. I forwarded the resolution to the Prime Minister, and presumably the Attorney-General was aware of it. That meeting, which was free of access to every one, was held at Maffra, where there is a large number of non-union workmen. Throughout the country districts nearly all the workers are non-unionists. The resolution strongly condemned the proposed legislation, and, so far as I have been able to ascertain, not a single voice was raised in favour of the trade union label. That took place at one of a number of similar meetings throughout the country. </para>

They have given me their confidence from the beginning, and I should be false to them if I did anything which I thought would prove pre.judical to them. The Attorney-General also urged, as a proof that non-unionists were in favour of the proposed legislation, that their representatives in this House were the strongest advocates of it. Surely my honorable friends in the Labour corner do not profess to represent non-union labour. </para>

                        <para>- That is the only conclusion I can draw from the action of the members of the Labour Party. I was one of those who voted against the Government led by the honorable member for Bland, upon the occasion that they decided to quit the Treasury bench. Why did they adopt that course? I voted for the same principle that I shall support in this case. I was always opposed to creating distinctions between unionists and non-unionists. The honorable member for Bland left office because we insisted that where non-unionists were not in a majority in any particular industry They should be placed upon the same footing as non-unionists. The Watson Government objected to that condition. Was that an act of friendliness to the non-unionists? They discarded the principle of majority rule, and insisted that whether unionists were in the majority or in the minority they should have the preference in all cases. </para>

                        <para>- If this were a proposal to benefit The workers generally I should, on this occasion, as on every other, be found supporting it. If it were a proposal to benefit unionists alone, without inflicting any material injury on other sections of the community I should still support it, because, although I have beer compelled on this and one or two points in connexion with the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to oppose unionists, I am very strongly in favour of unionism. I believe that the unions have done a great deal to improve the conditions of labour, both for unionists and non-unionists, and to that extent they deserve every reasonable recognition. </para>

                        <para>- I think so. I would be the last to deny that' great benefits have been conferred upon labour by unionists, but when they go so far as to ask Parliament to constitute itself a partisan body, and to enter with them upon an industrial war against their fellow-workers, who have no fault beyond that they have elected to remain outside the unions, I cannot go with them. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know what the honorable member regards as a fair basis. If our industrial laws are not sufficient to insure fair conditions of labour, they should be amended ; but what I object to is the attempt to sneak in clauses which are altogether foreign to the purpose of the Bill. I contend that the union label proposals are not only unnecessary,, but would be most mischievous in their operation. They are not intended to effect the legitimate purpose of a trade mark. It is not proposed to guarantee the quality or ownership of the goods, but merely to indicate that union labour has been employed in their production. At the . outset of his speech yesterday, the Attorney-General laid it down very clearly that it was the duty of Parliament to legislate in the interests, not of any particular class or section, but of the whole of the people. That is a sound doctrine, but I should be prepared to go a little further. I should be willing to legislate in the interests of a class if it could be shown that no material injury would be inflicted on other sections of the community. My objection to the trade union label proposals is that their obvious intention is to benefit the union worker at the expense of the non-unionists. They can only benefit the union workers to the extent to which they deprive non-unionists of employment or reasonable wages. </para>

                        <para>- No doubt that is the object of these provisions. The trade union, labels will not indicate the ownership of the goods, but merely the particular class of labour that has been employed in their production. The object of the union.ists is, by persuasion or coercion, or both, to boycott the products of non-union labour. I do not regard it as any part of the duty of Parliament to take sides in a matter of this kind, or to assist unionists to prevent non-unionists from earning an honest living. According to <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan,</inline> the total number of bread-winners in the Commonwealth is 1,642,000. There are only about 100,000 registered unionists, but I understand that <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan</inline> estimates that the total number of unionists, registered and unregistered, is about 150,000. </para>

That is the. reason why my honorable friends are now assisting the unions to take the further step contemplated. They have already induced us to go so far as to give preference to unionists wherever they are in "a majority . in any trade or industry, and to provide that, where they are in a minority, they shall occupy the same footing as others. That is of material advantage' to unionists ; "but . honorable members want to go further. They want Parliament to assist them to reduce the value of the earnings of non-unionists in the limited fields of employment they now have open to them. </para>

                        <para>- I have always held the same views. I have supported legislation in the interests of the whole of the workers and of the masses ; but I have always opposed legislation, in favour of one class, which I thought would have the effect of injuring other sections of the community. The propertied classes who were asking for undue political power never went so far as to propose measures that would inflict direct injury upon other classes. I have been consistent in opposing class legislation that would be inimical to the interests of the community. There is another phase of this matter "which, so far, has not been referred to. Hitherto we have agreed to limit the operation of out industrial legislation to those areas in which strikes and locks-out have occurred in the past. We have excluded from the scope of such measures rural industries which have never been marked by industrial strife. It is now proposed to do away with all such distinctions. I believe that the operation ot the proposals now before us would be extended to the rural industries as well as to others. To my mind it is conceivable, and I think even probable, that the warehouse employes, the members of the Carriers' Union, and of the water-side unions, would refuse to handle a bale of wool, a bag of wheat, or a box of butter, unless the union label were attached to it. </para>

                        <para>- If they had recourse to such extreme measures the honorable member would help them, and I very much fear that the Government which is placing this weapon in their hands would also be ranged on their side. It is difficult to foresee what would happen under these proposals ; they might lead to the creation of antiunion leagues. But whether they did or not, they must create strife and dissension between unionists and non-unionists which would extend to the whole community. I think we have already done quite enough harm in that direction, without' conferring benefits upon any class. We have passed some very useful legislation, but a few of the provisions embodied init. will prove most mischievous. </para>

                        <para>- Friends and relatives of mine who have been living in England for some years told me that when the Federal Parliament first met, Australia stood high in the estimation of the old world, and if a man announced that he was an Australian he was assured of a hearty welcome. I am now told that the name of Australia is scarcely ever mentioned except with a sneer. I believe that the proposed legislation will do a great deal of injury, and that our reputation will suffer more than ever it has done. If, with a full knowledge of the intention underlying them, and of their probable effects, I supported these proposals, I should betray the interests of those who sent me here. I should be abusing the power which they had conferred upon me if, when I knew that it was our undoubted duty to' do the best we could to promote peace, harmony, and good feeling, I assisted in placing upon the statute-book provisions which I believed would have the effect of creating strife, discord, and dissension amongst the people, of Australia. </para>

                    <para>- I do not wish to detain the Committee at any undue length, but, in view of some of the statements made within the last hour or so, it seems necessary to make a few remarks. I may say, first of all, in regard to the contention that sufficient time has not been allowed for the discussion of this proposal, that the honorable member for Gippsland seems to have forgotten that this measure has been under discussion for a considerable time. It is true that the Committee stage was not entered upon until about three weeks ago, but prior to that at least a week had been devoted to the debate on the motion for the second reading. Therefore the Bill has been under discussion for about four weeks. During the whole of that time, the debate has turned practically upon the union label provisions. When the second reading debate was proceeding nothing but the union label was talked about The leader of the Opposition spoke solely on that subject, and every other honorable member practically confined his remarks to that issue. When we reached the stage at which the closure resolutions were submitted, almost every remark made bv Opposition members was addressed to the question of the union label. From first to last we have debated these provisions, and no others - that is, if the term debate can be appropriately applied to a great deal of the talk that we have heard on. the subject. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member must be possessed of a high degree of temerity when he says that. Surely sufficient time has been devoted to the discussion of this subject. The principle is a simple one, namely, whether trade unionists or any other workers shall be protected in the use and enjoyment of something which is their own property, or whether they shall be exposed to the roguery and thievery of pirates. I adopt the words of one of the Kentucky Judges, who stated that the object of the union label provisions was to protect the worker from piracy.. The honorable member for Gippsland traced a resemblance between this proposal, and preference to unionists. It seems to me that there is a material difference. The union label provisions do not pretend to give unionists a preference over others. It is left open to every worker - and so far as I am concerned, I am prepared to follow the spirit of the 'amendment proposed by the honorable and learned member for Corio, and include employers and every one else - to take advantage of them. The principle involved in this matter is that of affording every man protection - no matter whether he be a unionist, a non-unionist, or an employer. I want to put all on the same footing before the law, and to give them equal protection against those who seek to rob them of the fruits of their labour. The statement of the honorable member for Gippsland that the Government of which I was the head, were prepared to deprive non-unionists of employment was an absolute misrepresentation. It was all of a piece with the kind of treatment to which we have been subjected in this Parliament. </para>

                        <para>- We did not propose to do that. The honorable member exhibits an ingenious mind when he resorts to arguments of that kind, and ignores the facts. What were the facts? We proposed to allow the Court to specify that preference should be given to unionists, if it saw fit to do so, after having heard the evidence, and having considered the surroundings of the case. If was purely a matter of authorizing a tribunal equal to the highest in the land, to say whether the circumstances would justify it in giving preference to unionists. It was not proposed to confine the work to unionists. We contended from first to last that the matter was one for the Court to decide. </para>

                        <para>- I say the Court must be the judge. I do not propose at this stage to argue whether or not preference is justifiable, because that would be foreign to this discussion. I am merely stating the facts. I contend that no proposal was made by the Government of which I was the head to prevent non-unionists from obtaining employment. I owe my place in this Parliament to the votes of non-unionists as much as, if not more than, to those of any other persons. I do not suppose that there are 1,000 unionists among the 20,000 electors in my constituency. </para>

                        <para>- My opponents can always find canvassers as energetic as those who are working in ray interests. The honorable member for Gippsland, in common with a number of others, seems to confuse non-unionists with those who are anti-unionists. In the great majority of cases, those who are outside the unions honestly sympathize with every legitimate effort made by unionists to advance their status, and to improve their material conditions. The great majority of non-unionists are fully sympathetic with the work of the unions, and I trust that honorable members will always draw a clear distinction between those who are merely non-unionists and those who, like the honorable member for Gippsland, are anti-unionists, and who manifest their ill-will on every occasion that presents itself. The honorable member was also good enough to say that throughout his political life he had been a consistent opponent of class legislation. I have no means of judging whether or not that statement is correct. Assuming it to be correct, however, a strange falling away from grace is shown on the present occasion. It has always been claimed by the antagonists of the Labour Party that they are opposing class interests. </para>

                        <para>- I claim that we are broad-minded also, but we are not Liberals in the sense in- which the honorable member uses that term. There is strange irony in the situation, when those who have always protested against class legislation - although our efforts have been mainly directed to the repeal of class legislation, or to remedying the conditions that class legislation has brought into existence - are found to be banded together, and using 'every persuasion, and every artifice that parliamentary rules will permit, for the purpose of insisting upon a class distinction. The honorable member for Gippsland is prepared to devote the whole of the machinery of the State to the assistance and protection of employers who have trade marks. If a man forges or colourably imitates the trade mark of an ordinary manufacturer, the honorable member says that the wrong-doer must be punished ; but when another man, who is not an employer, arranges to put a certain mark on the goods produced bv his labour, the honorable member says : " We shall not give him any protection for his trade mark. He shall be exposed to all the wiles of the forger and the defrauder. The pirate shall have a free run, so far as the union label is concerned.''1 This is a fine example of the opposition which is being, directed by some honorable members,, to class legislation. This Parliament should extend equal privileges to all classes of the community. And I claim protection for those who are not fortunate enough to be employers, and who are condemned by their circumstances to remain wage-slaves. I ask that they shall receive the same protection at the hands of the Government acting for the people that is extended freely to-day without let or hindrance, and without objection so far as we are concerned, to every manufacturer or trader who cares to take' advantage of it. </para>

                        <para>- Nor indirectly, except, of course, the honorable member pursues his argument to its absolute conclusion, and contends that everything produced originally comes from the land. I have not read of any case in which a primary industry has been brought under the operation of the union label. As a matter of fact, although no restriction is placed on the use of the label in America, its operation has been confined to a very few lines of manufacture. Therefore, I do not believe that there will be the slightest chance of its being applied to the rural industries in this country. It would be manifestly impossible to affix a union label to some classes of goods.'. For instance, a coal cargo could not have a union label attached to it. </para>

I was very much surprised when I heard the speech of the honorable member. The honorable member stated to-day that' he saw grave danger in adopting the proposals now before the House. In the previous case he informed the House that he possessed an open mind, and I wish to read a few extracts from his utterances, which seem to me to indicate that he approved of the principle of the Bill.

                        <para>- Their votes, I understand, will be given in accordance with their views. I now wish to deal with one or two of the arguments presented by the honorable member for Moira as a reason why he has arrived at the conclusion which he announced to-day. He stated that there is nothing in this Bill to prevent any organization working at rates or under conditions opposed to the award of a Wages Board from adopting a label that would be likely to mislead the public into believing that fair conditions were being observed. If that were so, it would be a perfectly legitimate objection to urge against the measure ; but I contend that it is not so. and for this reason : although, under this clause, a union or an association, can adopt a trade mark, it cannot adopt a trade mark that has been registered by some other association. Therefore if a union or other body, working under conditions recognised by the public to be fair, registered a label, the people, if they were in favour of assisting it, would naturally ask for goods bearing that! particular trade mark, and any attempt by an organization which was not observing those conditions to imitate that mark in such a way as to mislead the public would be punishable according to law. </para>

                        <para>- That is exactly what the Bill proposes. I do not want to extend any special privileges to unionists. Let us punish the wrongdoer, and allow the union label to work its own way. The honorable member for Moira also alluded to the probability of country men being placed at a disadvantage, as compared with city nien, because they were not members of a union, and therefore would not use a label. But I would point out to him that country men are just as free to join an association as are city men. They are just as free to register a label of their own - if they decide to work independently - and to advertise it to the public as conveying a certain certificate of quality in respect of their goods, or of the conditions governing their production, and to reap any benefit that may flow from such registration or advertisement. The man in the country district is placed upon -an absolute equality with the city worker, and surely he cannot ask for a preference. Perhaps1 the most important objection put forward by the Honorable member, and a number of others, in opposition to these clauses, has reference to the boycott. As, however, an amendment is to be submitted by the honorable member for Kooyong, which will give us an opportunity of discussing that question in detail, I do not propose to debate it at length now. The honorable member for Moira was at least fair In placing before the Committee the fact that boycotting was not confined to any one section of the community. It is indulged in bv all sections at various times, and under different conditions. I do not say that it is always justifiable, but I have known cases in which it has been absolutely justifiable. What most honorable members who have spoken in opposition to this proposal appear to overlook is that boycotting has been indulged in by trade unions in America independently of any question of the union label. All the great labour struggles which have led to boycotting there have been quite apart from any question connected with the use of the union label. All the boycotts which have occurred in Australia - and there have been a great number of them - have occurred in the absence of a clause of this description and of the union label. Consequently,, it must be admitted that boycotting will continue in some instances irrespective of whether we have a union label or not. No boycott can be successful unless public sympathy is behind it. In Ireland, where the term originated, we know that the boycott was successful because "the people in the locality where it was enforced sympathized with its object. Wherever it has been attempted it has been successful only temporarily - that is, when public sympathy has been behind it. As a safeguard against the possible developments of boycotting, which some honorable members seem to fear under this proposal, I am content to accept the fact that, fortunately for our civilization, the public can always be relied upon to take the side of justice. For a time a wrong may be tolerated by the community, but it will never be for long. The latent instinct df justice in the breasts of the people is easily appealed "to when once they know the facts, and in Australia, the press, which is almost invariably found upon the side of the big battalions., can be relied upon to place the facts before the public if they are adverse to any labour agitation. I do not think that our friends opposite can complain that their views have not been given every publicity in this controversy. But whilst that is so, exactly the reverse has been the position of those who have argued in favour of the measure. </para>

                        <para>- Both newspapers have treated this question in a most unfair way. Day after day they have loaded their columns with statements in opposition to this proposal - statements which were largely composed of misrepresentation. They have endeavoured to prove to the public, who are eventually the arbiters in this matter, that the union label has been responsible for this bit of boycotting, for that decision of the Supreme Court of a State, and for the other injunction by the Supreme Court of the United States, when upon analysis it will be found that not one of the cases which they have cited, rests upon the union label at all. That is the kind of matter which has been put before the public as argument. However, I do not wish to deal with that aspect of the question any further. </para>

                        <para>- The Honorable member may be speaking of his own speeches, but I can assure him that they have been filled with columns of so-called arguments against the proposal1. There is only one other point to which I desire to refer. It has been urged that there is no need for any label which will be a guarantee to the public of the quality of goods or of the conditions under which they are produced. It is said that we have factory legislation and arbitration laws for that purpose. I say that honorable members should know that in only some of the States are there any laws of that description, and that in a number of them evasions of the awards given by both Arbitration Courts and Wages Boards are so common as to provoke comment from every person who takes an interest in the subject. Innumerable cases of these evasions have occurred. In New South Wales one manufacturer who was supposed to be working under an award of the Arbitration Court was proved upon evidence taken before a Royal Commission to have paid 30 per cent. less in wages than the award specified. In Victoria it is the commonest thing possible to hear of persons being fined for evasions of the Act, and to learn of its non-observance in factories in shires to which it does not apply. I say that that kind of thing shows that it is necessary to have something supplementary to these laws if they are to be absolutely effective. To my mind, the surest way to make them effective in the interests of the fair employer, as well as of the workmen, is to have a strong union which will report any attempt at evasion, and sheet it home to the offender. I now wish to quote one or two lines from the reports of some of the inspectors of factories in Adelaide. In South Australia there is no legislation of this description. A few days ago the deputy leader of the Opposition pointed out that a Labour Government was in power in that State. Need I remind him that only two out of every seven adult electors there possess a vote for the second Chamber, which is the dominant House, and which is in a position to snap its fingers at the people? </para>

                        <para>- It will be a long and tedious process. It will require the sanction of the Imperial Government, and also of the House whose franchise will have to be altered. The report of one of the inspectors of factories there reveals a most appalling state of things. It is really heart-breaking to read that document, and to realize the horrifying conditions under which' some people work for wages which are barely sufficient to keep body and soul together. Amongst other things, it relates the case of a woman who makes shirts for 2s. 6d. a dozen, at which rate she earns 9s. per week. </para>

                        <para>- That is a high price compared with some of the rates mentioned in this report. For example, I find that butcher's aprons are made at Jd. each, and sold for 3s. 6d. That is sweating with a vengeance. Trousers are made for 6d. a piece. Some of the rates paid are as follow : - Trousers, 6d. ; vests, 7d. ; sac coats, is. 9d. : beaufort coats, 2s. 9d. ; chesterfield coats, 3s. 4d. ; working shirts, 1 3/4d.; flannel undershirts, 2 1/2d. ; women's underskirts, aid. ; flannelette underskirts, fd. ; aprons, £d. I do not deny that some establishments pay higher rates. Those which I have quoted are the lowest. One of the inspectors instances a case in which women are working under the most insanitary conditions for Afghans, Assyrians, and other aliens in the suburbs of Adelaide. Frequently there are eight or ten of them crowded in a single room. The writer asks, " Are not cases like the above enough to make the very stones of our streets cry, ' Oh, God, that bread should be so dear, and flesh and blood so cheap !' " ? </para>

                        <para>- But what power is there to amend them in a State like South Australia, where there is an immovable Legislative Council ? Surely the conditions which I have outlined show that there is need for some kind of guarantee to the public other than that which present legislation affords. In conclusion. I trust that honorable members upon the other side of the Chamber will see- that this case has a number of aspects other than those to which we have already given our attention. I particularly appeal to the honorable member for Gippsland, who boasts of his consistency in opposing class legislation, not to turn back after so many years of political life, and put the seal of class legislation upon his action at the present time in the Parliament of the Commonwealth. Those who have all along denounced class legislation should be the first to rally to the support of those who are pressing these provisions forward. I am quite prepared to admit that some modifications may be found to be necessary to give effect to the principle, but this Parliament should insist that every man shall be protected in the enjoyment of what he has created. </para>

But can we accomplish that by legislation? In my opinion, any step in the direction of freedom is of assistance to the great mass of the community. One point that particularly struck me in the address of the honorable member was his statement that he only desired to insure that men who have registered a certain label' or mark shall have the right to prevent anybody else from using it. Not a single individual in this House objects to that. I can further assure the honorable member that at the present time it is open to any individual to register a mark of his own and to get from the user- . </para>

Just as any corporation can do so, any assembly of citizens banding themselves together ought to be able to register their label or mark. Unfortunately, however, the whole argument turns upon the question, "To what use will this label be put?" If a mark may be used for the purpose of establishing a boycott, it is clear that we </para>

                        <para>-The honorable and learned member is not entitled to say, " Don't von buy so-and-so's goods ; I intend to ruin his business, because there is a quarrel between us." We are now asked to support the introduction of the union label to enable members of unions to refuse to purchase the goods of anybody else. It has been represented that this i's the first step towards elevating the great mass of the people. So far from that being the case, the proposal is almost the oldest of old laws. In <inline font-style="italic">The First of Empires</inline> it is shown that over 5,000 years ago a law was passed providing that a man should follow only one trade, and each particular product should have a certain mark upon it. That condition of affairs obtained in the time of the Roman Empire. In England in the eighth and ninth centuries, after a family had developed into the frith guild, and from that into . the merchant guild, we find its members putting their marks upon their products. These guilds were merely the forerunners of trade unions. No one could earn his living unless he belonged to one of them. But did that law tend to elevate the great mass of the people? It is very clear that it did not. I say, therefore, that all this wild talk on the part of the members of the Labour corner is entirely beside the mark. This legislation is opposed by me because it has already been tried and found wanting. Honorable members of the Labour Party do not appear to be aware that the power of the guilds was so strong in the time of Edward </para>

                        <para>- Does the honorable member mean fo suggest that the conditions of life are not very much better now than they were half a century ago? If so, I cannot debate with him, because he will first require to study the children's history books. I find that an Act passed during the reign of Edward III. decreed " That all artificers and people of mysteries shall each choose his own mystery before the next Candlemass ; and that, having so chosen it, he shall henceforth use no other." In Parliament after Parliament, some of the little unions in England were so strong that they secured an absolute control of these matters. As evidencing how my illustration tells against the pet belief of honorable members in the Labour corner, I have only to draw attention to the fact that they have nearly deserted the Chamber. The same condition of affairs existed up till the seventeenth century. The reason why these laws have been abandoned is that they were found to injure the very class whom they were designed to benefit. If we were asked to allow goods to be labelled " Made only by Protestants," or " Made only by Catholics," does not every honorable member see that it would be our duty to step in and prevent such a thing? So far from such a practice promoting, peace among the community, it would be a source of injury to its members. We ought not to allow any body to use a label practically for the purpose of boycotting their fellow citizens. So much was 'it recognised that men ought to belong to one guild only that I find in <inline font-style="italic">Brentano, on Guilds and Trades Unions,</inline> the following, in reference to a period as late as 1434: - </para>

                <para class="block">I repeat that this kind of legislation has been tried in the past and has utterly failed. It has been abandoned because it has been proved to be injurious to the community. A reversion to it must result in greater evil to the class whom it is designed to benefit than to any other. I have no hesitation, therefore, in voting against this clause. If, however, it is accepted, I shall at least give my assent to the amendment of the honorable and learned member for Corinella. If the honorable member for Bland is sincere in his desire to limit its application to the cases which he has indicated he will support that proposal. </para>

                    <para>-Iamsorry that the honorable member for Bland is not in the Chamber, because there are one or two matters upon which he dwelt to which I desire to refer. In the first place, I have to congratulate the honorable member for Moira and the honorable member for Gippsland upon at last having secured a breach in the obstinate silence that prevailed upon the opposite side of the House. After twenty-four hours of close debate, that silence was broken, not by a Minister, but by the present champion, guide, , protector, and friend of the Ministry - the leader of the Labour Party. I have heard most of the debate which has taken place during the past twenty-four hours, and I think it was due to those who have criticised the Government proposal that some reply to their representations should have been made earlier. However, that is a matter for the determination of honorable members concerned, although it is open to criticism by others. The honorable member for Moira and the honorable member for Gippsland have at last succeeded in forcing one honorable member opposite to attempt some defence of the position which is taken up by those who sit upon the right of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline> Isay "attempt" some defence, because I regret that the honorable member for Bland avoided the real questions at issue in connexion with this amendment, just as did the speech which he delivered a week or two back. Unfortunately, too,hefell into some serious errors of fact. Early in his speech he stated that the Trade Marks' Bill had been debated for something like four weeks, and that most of the discussion upon it had been directed against its union label provisions. As a matter of fact, up till the present moment the Bill has been debated just eight and a half days, and out of that time two days were spent in discussing the other portions of the measure. </para>

But, unfortunately, under a misapprehension, so far as we are_ concerned, the announcement was made -a-t the wrong tin-ie-and in the wrong way. That is not a matter for which honorable members opposite are responsible. I was approached suddenly, gave a hasty answer, and before any time for the consideration I expected was allowed the announcement was prematurely made to the Committee. The proposal is a fair one, and, so far as the Government are concerned, we are willing to accept it. I am sure that honorable members will realize the great difference it makes in the progress of the measure. If "The proposition submitted last night had been accepted, we should have closed" this debate on Tuesday, and after that there would have followed the other stages of the Bill, which would require to be taken in order, and so as the amendments promised by the Attorney-General could be made. In ordinary circumstances it would be a sanguine anticipation to expect that they could all have been dealt with before Wednesday. </para>

                    <para>. - The 'Senate amended clause 3 of this Bill by including in the definition of " dwelling " " any ship or vessel registered in Australia on a passage between any two Commonwealth ports." We disagreed with that amendment, and, in the absence of the Minister in charge, I suppose it is necessary that we should insist on that disagreement. The question involved is whether people on board ship shall be counted at the time of the census. The Senate has claimed that people on board ship at sea shall be counted, but whether in the State which the ship has left, or in the State to which it is going, is not determined. The Statisticians, agree that the Senate's proposal will create difficulty in the compilation of the statistics. To save time, I, therefore, venture to move - </para>

                    <para>- If the amendment is lost, the result will be that a very large number of sea-faring persons will be disfranchised. Under present arrangements, a Customs officer goes on board a ship, and ascertains how many persons are on board, but no schedules are filled up, we are not even able to- ascertain the nationality of those persons, and they have no means of getting their names on the rolls, unless when they arrive at their destination, they make special application. The same facilities should be afforded to people on board ships to secure the inclusion of their names on the electoral rolls as are afforded to others. I think that the amendment made by the Senate proposes only what is fair. I point out that our statistics cannot possibly be accurately compiled, unless we can ascertain the nationality of every person on board ships. I hope that the House will not insist on its disagreement with the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - This is not a vital matter, as the census is not likely to be taken for some five or six years. The report made to me showed that the Senate's amendment would involve administrative difficulties, and that the object sought to be accomplished by it might possibly have been achieved under another clause of the Bill. For these reasons we asked the Senate to reconsider the matter. I do not know whether we shall be able to accomplish what the honorable member for Hindmarsh desires, but on making further inquiries, I think that the amendment might be agreed to- When the Statistician is appointed under the Bill, he will go through its provisions, and will probably be. able to offer suggestions for the taking of a complete census of Australia. In the meantime, T would ask the House not to insist on its disagreement with the Senate's amendment. </para>
