                    <para>- Last year the late Treasurer, acting on my suggestion, saw that the Appropriation (Works and Buildings) Bill was pushed forward independently of the ordinary Appropriation Bill, and it became law at a much earlier date than did that Bill. In view of the delay which always occurs in getting work started,, and of the need for finding employment for the people in connexion with the construction of necessary public works, I ask the Treasurer if he will consider the advisability of taking similar action this year? </para>

                    <para>- The Government propose to commence with the 'Manufactures Encouragement Bill, and then to proceed with the second reading debates on the Trade Marks Bill, the Commerce Bill, and the Secret Commissions Bill - probably in that order. The further consideration of the message on the Papua Bill may be resumed if opportunity offers, but we have been much pressed to afford an early opportunity for the consideration of the Public Service Classification. Until the classification has been adopted,, it will cost the Government about ;51,000 a month. </para>

The Conference did not consider the establishment of one central Meteorological Bureau to supplant existing institutions and to singly carry out the Australian weather services as practicable, but made certain recommendations. The Government will again communicate with (he Premiers of the various States to see to what extent it is practicable to establish a Federal Meteorological Department. The draft of a Bill is in preparation with a view to its introduction if possible this session. </para>

                    <para class="block">I moved the second reading of a Bill somewhat similar to the measure now before us on two previous occasions - on the 23 rd March, 1904, and 9 th December, 1904, and as the statements I then made are on record in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> I hope that I shall not be called upon to repeat the whole of them. I am very glad to have an opportunity to again bring forward this measure, because, in my humble opinion, it deals with perhaps the most important question that can engage our attention - a question which, to my mind, almost overshadows every other affecting the interests of the Commonwealth. At present, we are completely dependent upon importations for all our war material, iron, steel, and other things. If, unfortunately, an outbreak of hostilities involving Great Britain should occur, our position would be most critical. I consider that it is a disgrace to us that we have not already taken active measures for the development of our known large deposits of iron ore. No attempt has yet been successfully made to utilize them. On looking over the division lists when a similar measure was last before us, I was very much surprised to find that one or two of the representatives of Tasmania, in which State our largest and most valuable iron deposits exist, voted against the Bill. If they regard the welfare of Tasmania as important, they should be the first to declare in favour of the introduction of a Bill of this character. </para>

                            <para>- I shall please myself as to what I introduce. I did not refer to the representatives of Tasmania in any disagreeable spirit. My remark was prompted solely by the interests of that State, in which the Blythe River iron deposits exist. I say that the development of that vast deposit would materially influence the progress and the financial position alike of Tasmania and of Australia. That, however, is not the only deposit of iron ore in the Commonwealth. We know that there are others. For example, I am in receipt of further information concerning a place in South Australia, which is known as the Iron Knob. That deposit of ore is not quite so accessible as is the Blythe River deposit in Tasmania. It is more remote from a port of shipment, but nevertheless it 'is of a very valuable character. </para>

Further, nearly all over New South Wales large deposits of iron ore are known to exist. They are to be found in the north, south, east, and west of that State. I cannot speak so confidently of the resources of Queensland, because I am not familiar with them. </para>

                            <para>- I merely mention these facts to show what great latent wealth we have in Australia - wealth which should be, but is not, developed. Every honorable member must acknowledge that deposits of coal and iron constitute the greatest wealth which a country can possess, and we have been endowed by Nature with an abundance of each of these minerals in every State. This Bill represents an earnest attempt to solve the difficulty attaching to the development of our iron resources in this way ; if the States do not embark upon the undertaking - and up to the present time the;}} have declined to do so - private enterprise might step in and establish the industry, subject to a provision that at a certain period the State, or States, can demand the transfer of the property for a fair consideration. That seems to me to be the wisest course we can adopt at present. I am in receipt of a communication from some of those persons who are prospectively interested in this work, and I am in a position to say that if the Bill be carried private capital will be invested in the industry. When I tabled the motion relating to the introduction, of this measure a few days ago, it was alleged that its provisions were of a character that would prevent private enterprise from establishing the industry. I am now in a position to say that if the Bill becomes law private capital will be invested in it. </para>

                            <para>- That depends upon the size of the company and the quantity of ore that is smelted. I know that in the largest concerns of the kind in the world, perhaps £.1,500.000 or more has been invested. I happen to know that one company was, and still is, prepared to spend something like <inline font-style="italic">£1,</inline> 000,000 in the development of this industry. But there is more than one company willing to engage in the undertaking. There are two or three others. </para>

It may be amended slightly, but it will become the law of the land. I fully recognise that all those who are in favour of the foreigner, and opposed to the interests of our own people, will use their utmost endeavours to block the Bill. Those who believe in providing our own people with work, and in supplying Australian needs with Australian articles, will support the measure. </para>

Unless he is prepared to sell the railways of Australia, and to part with the tramways, waterworks, and other services of that character, I brand him as a Socialist. That is the sort of Socialist that I am. I have frequently stated that I am in favour of the State carrying on certain services, such as the railways, the tramways, and waterworks. Let the honorable member contrast the tramway system of Sydney with that of Melbourne, and say which serves the people the better. However, I have no desire to discuss the question of Socialism at the present moment, though I am prepared to say at once that in regard to the services to which I have alluded, I am a State Socialist. </para>

                    <para class="block">A vote has already been wrongly taken upon this Bill, inasmuch as it was not put in Committee, where the Bill ought to have originated. I submit that, following precedents going back almost to the infancy of parliamentary institutions, the Bill, as now before us, is out of order. It should have originated in the Committee to which the Governor-General's message was transmitted as soon as it was received. The Constitution is silent in the matter of procedure, but all our parliamentary precedents are in favour of my contention, that there should have been an appropriation in Committee before leave was given to bring in the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Parramatta was good enough a few moments ago to call my attention to the point that he was about to raise in order that I should have an opportunity to con- side it. On a previous occasion a similar Bill was introduced in Committee, the Committee originating from the reception of a message from His Excellency the Governor-General. The Manufactures Encouragement Bill that was brought before the House last year was introduced, however, in the same way as that now before us has been. On examining this Bill I recognise that it is undoubtedly a measure for a public aid or charge upon the people, because clause. 3 provides that the Governor-General may authorize the payment out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund of bounties according to rates set out in the schedule. Standing order No. 243, which the honorable member for Parramatta has read, expressly declares that the consideration of a motion for any public aid or charge upon the people shall not be entered upon in the House until it has been referred to a Committee of the whole. I, therefore, think that there can be no doubt that it is impossible for the House to deal with this Bill until the subject-matter has been recommended by resolution in Committee of the whole House. </para>

                            <para>- Whether boycotted or not, I am satisfied to fight the battle of the non-unionists. I have also withdrawn from the Pastoralists' Association - the only other association of which I was a member - so that I stand here to-day as a non-unionist fighting the battle of the non-unionists, and with a determination to prevent the Government and their supporters in the Ministerial corner from robbing the non-unionists of their rights. I fight for the liberty of the people - for the liberty of the poorest man in the State to earn his living where and when and how he may. Let us apply the trade union label principle to the production of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper. </para>

It must be admitted that in days gone by the workmen of this and other countries have suffered under many disabilities. But from time to time legislation has been passed by this and other Parliaments to prevent the continuance of those abuses. </para>

All that I say is that the newspaper could not be used1 by certain people unless produced under these conditions. That to which I and those who are with me in this matter object is not voluntary, but compulsory unionism - a compulsory system of unionism that is forced upon the people contrary to their rights under the famous Magna Charta and Bill of Rights - a system by which one section of the community takes advantage of another section. In this very newspaper of Monday last we have another paragraph which shows what union conditions are, and may be in connexion with various industries.

                            <para>- In this connexion I should like to call the attention of honorable members to a recent decision by the Minister of Trade and Customs with regard to the labour to be employed for producing sugar in Queensland. Recently he was waited upon, or written to, in regard to the labour of a half-bred kanaka on a sugar plantation in the northern part of that State, and, by his decision he has created a new industry. In the first instance, the mother of the half-bred  kanaka had married a kanaka, and this son was the result of the union. After wards she married a white planter, who applied to be registered as a planter working under white labour conditions. The Minister ruled, and justly so, I think, that this young half-bred kanaka should 'be allowed to work on the plantation of his step-father, who should be permitted to have a bonus for the production of sugar under white labour conditions. But the Minister has gone still further, and has ruled that half-bred aborigines shall be allowed to work on sugar plantations, and that the planter shall be able to draw the bonus under the white labour conditions. Has the honorable gentleman anything to say in regard to that matter? </para>

                            <para>- It appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> two or three days ago. In this connexion the Minister is practical iv putting a premium on the production of these half-castes, and solving this question, so far as Northern Queensland is concerned, so that in the future all sugar will have to be produced under union conditions. I should like to sketch what is likely to occur under those conditions in 1909, in, say, the Herbert River district. A half-caste of this description has to be brought up from his birth as a unionist. In the first place, it is necessary that a union doctor shall be employed. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; I should have no opportunity of attending at the interesting event. In order to further carry out the union label conditions, it is necessary that this interesting youth who is to play such a great part in the sugar industry should be received into the world by a nurse who is a member of the Affiliated Union of Monthly Nurses of Northern Queensland. If, unfortunately, the mother is unable to give the child the necessary nourishment, a wet nurse has to be called in to assist his development, and she must be a member of the Federated Union of Wet Nurses of Northern Queensland. Then, as the growth of the child develops, it is necessary to find him with extra bottles, and the milk has to be drawn from animals <inline font-style="italic">b,y\</inline> milkers who are members of the Milkers' Union of the district. Of course the bottles have to be branded with the union label. </para>

                            <para>- It may be annoying to the honorable member to listen in the form of a farce to my statement of what this label business means for the workers of Australia in the future; but I cannot help that. This is simply an accentuation of what has been carried out in the United States, and when the honorable member suggests that I am not serious in my remarks, it shows that his friends are fully seized of the fact that the whole business is a farce so far as the majority of the people in Australia are. concerned. I do not wish, however, to be drawn off by interjections from the history of this half-caste child. Going a step further, we find that his linen has to be washed by the members of the Baby Linen Washers' Union of Northern Queensland, and that all food, including bread, has to be supplied by union men. This, of course, will interest the honorable member for Yarra, because he has recently been through the fire, so to speak, with regard to non-union bakers ; and he has proved abundantly the difficulty that will be created. Before we have had any of this compulsory legislation with regard to union labels, the honorable member has virtually been forced into the position of having to insure that everything that he uses is produced under absolutely unionist conditions. With regard to the further development of my imaginary youth, he has to be sent to a State school in which all the teachers have to be members of the Teachers Union. His clothes have to be branded with the union label. This is no exaggerated idea, because the branding of clothes with the union label has been insisted upon in Chicago and San Francisco; and there is evidence that the walking delegates have actually stopped members of the unions to see whether their clothes were branded with the label. If they were not, the unionists have been fined five, twenty, and fifty dollars, and for a fifth offence have been dismissed from membership. </para>

                            <para>- There is nothing fabricated about my statements. The whole history of recent trades unionism in America goes to show that they are absolute facts. If my kanaka youth happened to be fond of bananas, he would have to be careful that his bananas were all grown by the members of the Chinese Union of Banana Growers of Queensland. In clue course he "would go to work, and would be duly admitted to membership of the Union of Half-caste Sugar Growers. If, in later years, he developed a habit of smoking and drinking, he would have to be careful that he smoked union tobacco and drank union beer. We will suppose that at last he dies from the effects of smoking union cigars and tobacco and drinking union beer. And here is the point where the whole scheme fails absolutely. When he wakes up he will find that he is in a non-union heaven. The whole of his training in this world will have been absolutely lost when he reaches a place where there is no question of considering whether a man is a unionist or a non-unionist. But even that would not finish his experience of unionism. We know that instances have occurred in Chicago - and no doubt they will occur in Australia - where members of unions have had to be buried under union conditions, in a coffin made by union coffin-makers, be carried to the grave bv union undertakers and - here is a fact which will be of interest to the honorable member for Wide Bay - the Requiem may have to be sung over the grave of the deceased by the Half-bred Kanaka Hymn Singers' Union. </para>

He rejoices in the fact that he is a good and true unionist, though it pays him to forget that there are others who are not unionists. He should never forget that it is one of the primary instincts of men born and bred under British conditions that they shall have a perfect right to work freely for their own living, whether they are members of unions or not. With regard to the matter which I mentioned a few minutes ago, the honorable member for Oxley has just put into my hand the newspaper cut-' ting to which I referred. I should like to draw the attention of the Minister of Trade and Customs to a paragraph which appeared with regard to half-bred kanakas and aboriginals in the <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of Thursday last : - </para>

                        <para>Towards the end of 1903 a Queensland cane planter applied for registration as a "white" grower. His wife, prior to marrying him, had a son by a former husband, a kanaka. This boy was adopted and brought up by the cane-planter, and he wished to employ the lad on the farm. But the regulations under the Sugar Bounty Act provide that the expression "white labour" shall be used to the exclusion of all forms of coloured labour, "whether aborigines of Australia or not." The matter was submitted to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, the then Minister of Customs, and he, after first refusing the application, wrote a minute, In which he said : - " In this case the circumstances are exceptional - this being the only case of the kind, <inline font-style="italic">i.e.,</inline> where a white man marries a white woman who has a half-caste kanaka child. The lad, presumably, has to live upon the farm, and will on occasions do some work. It would be a most extreme thing to make the stepfather forfeit his sugar bounty in consequence. I will not do so, and shall, if necessary, submit a short measure next session - if I have the opportunity - to deal with this question, and also to deal with the question of half-caste aborigines. I scarcely think it was intended to deprive these latter of the chance of obtaining work in their own country. It is quite different with the coloured people who come here from their homes elsewhere. We know, too, that the Australian native is not a menace to labour, and that in a few years he will be extinct." </para>

                    <para class="block">That proves that my statement was accurate, and that the Minister did, in 1903, write a minute and promise to bring in a Bill to amend the Act. But the Bill is not yet forthcoming. I should like to know when he intends to give effect to his undertaking. To resume my argument with regard to the union label, I should like to carry the matter still further. Whilst honorable members of the Labour Party do not admit it, yet it is a fact that the effect of insisting upon these union conditions in America has been simply to produce a reaction in another direction; and I firmly believe that a very great deal of the difficulty that has occurred there in regard to the formation of trusts and monopolies has been caused by the principle underlying union label conditions. The same thing was attempted in Melbourne a short time ago, but fortunately the effort was nipped in the bud. There was a certain brewery which pretended that it was about to introduce, for the consumption of the people, beer which was manufactured under strict union conditions. I have seen a copy of the union label which was to be placed upon every cask issued from this brewery. It was a beer barrel marked with some such device as "XXX," to denote the quality of the beer. There was a little lid on the device which could be lifted up, and inside there was a picture of a "beerchewer " about to consume a glass of the ale produced under union conditions. The brewery attempted to capture the trade in Melbourne by using the union label. This brewery intended, if possible, to have it enacted by the Trades Hall Council that all unionists should consume nothing but union beer ; and this threatened to be a serious menace to the trade. The other breweries had a consultation, and they approached this one brewery ; and the end was a decision that it would not be to the interests of the trade to carry the scheme into effect. Eventually the one brewery agreed not to produce beer under the conditions contemplated, and so the matter fell through. But if the proposal had been carried out - and it must be remembered that this was a voluntary matter - and the union label had been made compulsory, what would have been the position ? As I have previously said, the sugar in Queensland would have had to be produced, under union conditions, and so would the barrels and hoops. The beer would have had to be produced in union breweries, the drivers would have had to be union drivers, and the hotels would have been tied down to union beer, whether that beer was good, bad, or indifferent. And, further, unionists would have had to drink that beer, whether it was good, bad, or indifferent. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member may say "Good gracious"; but would it not be a serious matter if in a brewery 700 non-unionists out of 1,000 men employed should be faced with the alternative of losing their employment or joining the union, although they might have solid objections to the latter course? Moreover, if those men joined the union, they might have to drink the beer which they had brewed themselves. Under such circumstances, the brewers would resolve to combine and form a monopoly. I have shown honorable members that this is one of the means whereby trusts and monopolies are brought about - combinations we all deprecate, and would like to see extinguished. Honorable members in the Ministerial corner, by their legislation, and by their actions outside Parliament, force people into trusts and monopolies, and the result is that we have combinations which exploit the public, and act detrimentally to the commercial interests, not only of Australia, but of other parts of the world, where they have assumed large dimensions. In this way, both unionists and non-unionists suffer. Such combinations under our present arrangement of competition seriously affect the interests of men who work for their daily bread. If the brewers, for instance, combined, they would find that, by using two or three establishments, and concentrating their efforts, they could brew all the beer required. What I want to point out is that all the beer required could be brewed in two or three establishments, instead of nine or ten as at present. What would be the result ? </para>

                            <para>- No doubt a good deal of the beer brewed under union conditions would very often be equally effective as physic. The combination I have indicated would mean that instead of, say, ten establishments, there would be three, with a corresponding reduction of staffs, and a consequent loss of employment. Those results would not be confined to the brewing industry, but would extend to every other industry in Australia. Instead of business enterprise being encouraged, it would be discouraged, and, by means of combinations, the unemployed difficulty would be accentuated. We all agree that trust's and monopolies should be kept down ; but I think that the ideas of some honorable members go beyond that result. Their desire is to force trade into such conditions that finally the industries I have mentioned will have to be nationalized. This is one way of bringing about the nationalization of industries. I have in my hand a newspaper called <inline font-style="italic">American Industries,</inline> published in New York, on December 15th, 1904; and from that I should like to give the House an idea of the manner in which the principle of the union label has been carried out to the detriment of trade, and of the working men generally in the United States. </para>

                    <para>North of San Francisco, in the great city of Portland, one of the most conservative and solid cities on the Pacific coast, where they were facing the problem which St. Louis has so successfully carried through with many inconveniences, and the harassing industrial conditions there existing, the Citizens' Alliance solved the problem for the first time, perhaps, in the history of the United States, of building a great exposition under the open shop, and the Lewis, and Clarke exposition, from top to bottom, from the meanest to the grandest building that stands upon the exposition grounds, is the product of open-shop labour. Some two or three years ago a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wehner,</inline> of San Jose:, undertook to. build a panorama structure in San Francisco. He made a contract for the work. He did not specify therein the character of the labour, and the contractor began the exterior work with non-union labour. A delegate to the Building Trades Council protested against this, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wehner,</inline> discovering that he was going to involve himself in difficulties, explained that he had no means of controlling the labour employed by his contractor, but that he would promise that all the interior work should be done by union labour. This was not satisfactory. A boycott was laid upon the structure, and upon the amusement that was to take place in it. Six carpenters who remained at work, despite the strike that followed, were expelled from the Carpenters' Union of the Building Trades Council of San Francisco. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wehner</inline> was a man of limited capital. He was faced by the most terrible industrial conditions that have ever disheartened an employer, and threatened with the loss of his means. Through the manager, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harry</inline> Gilmour, he endeavoured to treat with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. P.</inline> H. McCarthy to learn the terms upon which the strike could be calledoff. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCarthy</inline> wrote in reply a short letter, which is a photograph of industrial conditions there as they then existed - </para>

And we had the Sandwich Men's Union demanding of the union that employed them an increase of wages from a dollar and a half to two dollars a day. And when they did not get it they struck, and we had upon the streets of San Francisco the ridiculous spectacle of one sandwich man parading up and down in front of a place of business declaring it unfair, and another sandwich man parading up and down in front of him, declaring that when he declared the business unfair he unfairly declared it unfair. </para>

                    <para class="block">This sort of thing had been going on for a very considerable time in San Francisco, and the evil had increased to such an extent that 85 per cent, of the businesses in that city were terrorized by the system. The condition of things described had existed for three years, and when the people could stand it no longer they rose to defend themselves, and brought it under the notice of the legal authorities, in the form of a case submitted to the Court. Judge Hebbard, of the Superior Court of San Francisco, gave a decision in connexion with the matter which is of very considerable importance. I quote the following reference to it: - </para>

The question was one of law, whether an action in boycott could be maintained. The Court, in overruling the demurrer, said, " There are not, and there cannot be any authorities to sustain the defendant's contention. There is no law, human or divine, to support their argument. To proclaim a business or the proprietors unfair in this manner, is as infamous as to proclaim before a private dwelling that the inmates thereof are prostitutes. The acts complained of are breaches of the peace, and it is safe to say that if the one boycotted had met it by personal violence, instead of appealing to the law, he would have been justified by a jury under his constitutional right of self-defence." </para>

                            <para>- I presume that the honorable member will vote in the direction I have indicated. He is such a faithful follower of the Ministry that I assume they have only to issue an order to him as to the way in which he shall vote to induce him to vote accordingly. The same thing applies to the honorable member for Melbourne Ports. </para>

It was, fortunately, discovered that, according to one of the amendments of the Constitution of the United States, it was absolutely illegal for any of these conditions to be imposed on labour. The honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne has said, on one or two occasions, that the Constitution of the United States is defective in that it is not elastic enough. In the Commonwealth we have a Constitution which is elastic enough ; but it does not absolutely protect the . rights of every citizen, even those conferred under the magnificent Magna Charta and the Bill of Rights. </para>

We have read in the daily newspapers from time to time within the last few weeks that in New South Wales men are being brought by the unions before the Court for not paying their fees. A poor washerwoman has been sued for fees she owed to the union, and it has been ruled by the Judge of the Court that, so long as a union has a dispute pending in the Arbitration Court, those who have joined it remain members of it. Even if a dispute remains unsettled for ten years, those who have joined the union concerned in it remain members of it, and slaves to it. Honorable members here tried to introduce into our Conciliation and Arbitration Bill a principle which, having been carried into effect by the New South Wales Act, has established a tyranny far worse than any form of slavery which has existed in any other part of the world. </para>

                            <para>- It is according to fact. In New South Wales, men join the unions, and then, as the leaders of the unions take good care that there shall always be disputes pending in the Arbitration Court, they are unable to leave them again. But the leaders of the unions have pushed matters too far. Men of liberal mind were disposed to assist them so long as they thought that they were asking for a fair thing; but they are now causing reasonable men to turn against them, because they are saying in effect to those who are non-unionists and free men, " You are not slaves now, but immediately you become members of our organization, you will be so. You' will be bound hand and foot," just as the members of the Labour Party in this House are bound with regard to their votes, and almost with regard to what they say in this Chamber </para>

                    <para>An opinion of Judge Shackleford Miller, of the Chancery Branch of the Jefferson Circuit Court, at Louisville, in the suit lately brought by the Courier-Journal Job Printing Company, and its president and vice-president, as citizens, to test validity of the "union label" ordinance under which the city has been awarding the contracts for public printing, is of the utmost interest and importance. It renders an unqualified judgment for the plaintiffs. Some of the points in the brief of the attorney for the plaintiff, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alfred</inline> Seligman, were as follow : - That the ordinance is unconstitutional and void, being in conflict with the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, in this : that citizens not a member of the Allied Printing Trades Council of Louisville, and not employing members thereof, are abridged in their privileges and immunities as citizens of the United States and deprived of liberty and property without due process of law, and denied the equal protection of the law. That it is unconstitutional under section 3 of the Bill of Rights of the Constitution of the State of Kentucky, in this : that the said ordinance constitutes the grant of exclusive separate public emoluments and privileges to persons, members of said Allied Printing Trades Council of Louisville, or employing members of said council, and that such separate public emoluments and privileges are not in consideration of any public services rendered. </para>
                    <para class="block">That it is a violation of the inherent equality of all men before the law. Moneys raised by public taxes constitute a trust fund for the benefit of all taxpayers, to be administered and spent only for public municipal purposes; that municipal officers are trustees, and have no right to divert such trust funds to any other than municipal governmental purposes; that the city buyer is undertaking under the direction of said ordinance, to pay $260 more for the public printing than the same can be done without the operation of said ordinance, and to that extent there is a diversion of public funds to private uses, and a breach of trust that will be enjoined by the Court. The injunction is not an interference with the discretion vested in this public officer. The legislative department of the city of Louisville has no right to impose upon the discretion of the city buyer or limit it by an unconstitutional ordinance, nor has he a right to accept or bind his discretion with the terms of such an ordinance. The appropriate remedy is by injunction. Judge Miller's opinion was as follows : - This action is brought bv L. T. Davidson and August Straus, in their capacities as residents and taxpayers in the city of Louisville, and by the Courier-Journal Job Printing Company, as plaintiffs, against the City of Louisville, Charles F. Grainger, mayor of the said city ; Fred. R. Bishop, city buyer of said city ; the Globe Printing Company, and Charles T. Den ring, as defendants, for an injunction to prevent the awarding of a contract for printing of the reports of the city of Louisville for 1903, under a letting of June 1904, to either the Globe Printing Company or to C. T. Dearing. By an ordinance of the city of Louisville, approved January 24, 189S, it is provided in substance that all printing, bookmaking, and work of like character used or ordered by the city of Louisville, "shall bear the imprint of the recognised union label of the Allied Printing Trades Council of Louisville, Kentucky, as registered with the Secretary of State " ; and that the city buyer, when advertising for printed matter, shall insert a notice in the advertisement that all bids shall be submitted in accordance with said ordinance. In advertising for these bids, the defendant, Bishop, followed the requirements of the ordinance by giving notice that " all bids must be subject to ordinance approved by the mayor, January 24, 1898." The plaintiff, the Courier-Journal Job Printing Company, filed a bid by which it proposed to do the work for $2*20 per page, while the defendants, the Globe Printing Company and C. T. Dearing, each offered to do it for $2'6o per page, there being a difference of $240 in the cost of the entire work under the respective bids. There is no question raised as to the regularity, sufficiency, or validity of any of the bids. This motion for an injunction is based upon the single ground that City Buyer Bishop is threatening to and will award the contract to the Globe Printing Company or C. T. Dearing at $2'6o per page, under and as required by said ordinance of January 24, 1898, because said Globe Printing Company and said Dearing can comply with the ordinance bv using the label of the Allied Printing Trades Council - commonly called the " Union Label " - while the Courier-Journal Job Printing Company, being an " open shop," cannot use said label upon its work, and cannot therefore comply with the requirements of the ordinance. The ordinance is attacked as being unconstitutional, in that it undertakes to make a discrimination between different classes of citizens similarly situated ; that it restricts competition in public work, and tends to increase its cost and creates a monopoly thereof ; that it attempts to confer an exclusive privilege upon certain persons, in violation of the Kentucky Bill of Rights, and that in awarding said contract to the Globe Printing Company or to C. T. Dearing said city buyer and the mayor (who must approve the same) will not act in the full exercise of their judgment, or discretion, or <inline font-style="italic">bond fide,</inline> but will do so only under the alleged constraint of the said ordinance, which will require them to so award the contract. That the ordinance is clearly unconstitutional is conceded by the city attorney and by the counsel for the other defendants. Indeed, when the ordinance was presented to the city attorney for examination before it became effective, that official made the following indorsement thereon : - " The ordinance is unconstitutional. Examined "and approved. H. L. Stone, City Attorney." The legal objection to the ordinance has been well expressed in the following language : - " Manifestly, if the General Council has the right to restrict competition, so far as the public supplies and public contracts are concerned, to those only who employ union labour, it would have the same right to pass the same character of ordinance for the benefit of non-union labour, if at any time the friends of non-union labour should gain control of the General Council. And if at any time the majority of the members of the General Council should be members of the Presbyterian Church, or the Methodist Church, or the Baptist Church, or the Catholic Church, or of any other church, or if the majority of them should belong to the Masons, or the Oddfellows, or the Elks, or any other order, they would have the same right to pass a like ordinance for the benefit of those employing members of their particular church, denomination, or order. The result would be that the laws of the city, instead of being enacted for the benefit of all the inhabitants of the municipality equally and impartially, would favour only that class of our citizens who happened to be in political power at the particular time." </para>
                    <para>As I said in the first place, the Judge declared the use of the union label in connexion with the printing trade to be unconstitutional. Another case is mentioned in the same newspaper of the 15th June, 1904, as follows: - </para>

It obtained a preliminary injunction, but the picketing continued. It made an application to the Superior Court to punish the ringleaders for con tempt. The union denied all conspiracy, and claimed that the men who were engaged in picketing only used peaceable means by persuasion. The Court, however, fined a number of the officers of the unions, and directed two of them to be imprisoned. The unions appealed, and the Appellate Court has now sustained the injunction unanimously. </para>
                        <para>Judge Adams' opinion says - </para>
                        <para>Appellants denied that they used force, threats, or intimidation of any sort, and say they were peaceful and mildly persuasive. But the very presence of a large number of pickets, with the avowed purpose of preventing plaintiffs' employes from remaining in its employ, and of preventing those seeking employment from entering it, was in itself intimidation. When a thousand labourers gather around a railroad track and say to those who seek employment they had better not, and that advice is supplemented every little while by a terrible assault upon one who. disregards it, every one knows that something more than advice is intended. lt is coercion, force ; it is the effort of many by the mere weight of numbers to compel the one to do their bidding. </para>
                        <para>The affidavits show that the defendants picketed and patrolled around and about complainants' place of business, watching the streets, alleys, and approaches thereto, daily shifting their positions; that they so stationed themselves that the complainants' employes were obliged <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> pass through their picket line ; that their attitude was ugly <inline font-style="italic">and</inline> menacing, such as to cause fear in the mind of an ordinary person. Complainants' employes and persons seeking employment were waylaid on their way to and from the factory ; they were insulted and threatened, and in numerous instances assaulted and beaten by the strikers' pickets and pat rollers, and complainants' business was seriously and injuriously interrupted. All teaming and haulage of merchandise to and from complainants' factory was stopped. </para>
                        <para>Thepurpose of the strike by complainants' employes and their prosecution of it, as described, was to compel the complainant to execute the agreement referred to and made a part of the Bill. The drafts of agreements, three in number, purport to be with the different unions, whose members were in complainants' employ. </para>

                    <para>That the purpose of the strike was to compel the execution of the drafts of agreement is clear. It is averred in the sworn Bill, and deposed to in the affidavits of De Wolf, complainant's president; Kellogg, its secretary and treasurer; and Edwards, its superintendent, that business agents of the different unions, called on complainant, and insisted on its executing the agreements, and that, when complainant's president refused, on the ground that the proposed agreements were unreasonable, it was threatened by one of the said business agents that unless complainant would sign the agreements a strike would be called, and that said business agents called a strike, in response to which about 500 of complainant's employes quit its employ. </para>
                    <para class="block">As I endeavoured to show a few minutes ago, the attempts to force all men into the unions are intended to create a monopoly for a certain class of labour. If the efforts of the Labour Party are successful, they will have the effect of bringing about monopolies amongst those who are conducting commercial enterprises. Therefore, the very conditions which honorable members are always condemning, are likely to be brought about by their own action. They are setting up monopolies and trusts, and are at the same time contemplating the nationalization of our industries. They are thus setting up certain conditions in order that they may knock them down again. </para>

It is an indispensable condition of the enjoyment by each citizen of the liberty and rights guaranteed by the Constitution and laws that he shall respect, and not unlawfully infringe upon the liberty or rights of any other citizen. This cannot be done with impunity...... The fact that labourers have the right to refuse to work for a man who does not employ union labour, or in order to better their condition or advance their wages, does not authorize the making of a contract under which the employer is compelled to employ only union labour, and to discharge nonunion labour. The rights of the employer and employe are, and should be, synonymous, but employes cannot, by combination or union, without committing the crime of conspiracy, force employers to agree to employ only union labour. When employers do become parties to such an agreement they are equally guilty of conspiracy. </para>

Upon a recent occasion, he even went so far as to refuse to travel upon a steamer which carried a black stoker. I am quite sure that most members of labour organizations will not hesitate to push matters to an extreme in every possible way. Under the proposal which I, am discussing, what will be the position so far as shearing is concerned ? It will be necessary that every bale of wool shall bear the union label. What conditions will require to be fulfilled in order to bring about that result? Every man employed upon a station will need to become a member of the Australian Workers' Union. </para>

                            <para>- No. I left that body in order that I might be an absolutely free agent in regard to these matters, and in order that I might be able to fight the battle of the non-unionists without any prejudice. I do not wish to fight the battle of the big man, but, so far as I possibly can, I intend to fight the battle of the poor man. The former will not be seriously affected by this proposal, but the latter will be. Under the operation of the Bill in its present form, hundreds and thousands of men who are now outside the Australian Workers' Union - men who are engaged in the Western District of Victoria, and in the pastoral industry in New South Wales - will be compelled either to join that organization or to starve. </para>

                            <para>- I may have been soft so far as the honorable member is concerned, because upon one occasion I allowed my feelings of friendship to get the better of my judgment. I repeat that all the non-unionists who are at present engaged in the pastoral industry throughout the Commonwealth will - if this Bill becomes law - be compelled to join the Australian Workers' Union. Then the implements which they use - the shears - will have to be produced by union labour. As a matter of fact they have to be so produced at the present time, when a system of voluntary unionism obtains. Union shearers must use union-made shears. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, there is a label on them. Under existing conditions, unionists insist upon using only union shears. What will happen under a compulsory system of unionism? The bales will all require to be made by union labour, and every sale will need to be branded. If not, what will happen? If the bales and the wool do not bear the union label the members of the Wharf Labourers' Union will be instructed not to handle the goods, and the members of the Seamen's Union will be directed not to carry them. </para>

                            <para>- I thank the honorable member for his interjection. I have not the slightest doubt that the members of the Labour Party are putting brakes upon the wheels of progress in Australia. They have been doing so ever since they gained great power in this Parliament, and they will continue to do so. It will be their constant aim to apply brakes to the wheels of progress, in order to prevent the proper development of the commercial and industrial life of this country. I thank the honorable member for Hindmarsh for his interjection. Unfortunately, not only for the people who conduct business enterprises in Australia, but also for the workmen of this country, our commercial world is stopping. Then in the butter industry an attempt will be made to force all the men who are engaged in producing milk, and all the farm hands, to become members of the Milkers' Union. If they refuse to do so they will be discharged. So far as I am concerned, every one of the men at present in my employ is a non-unionist. Under the provisions of this Bill, those men will either be forced into a union or I shall have to discharge them. If I do not employ unionists my milk will not be received at the factory, because the hands engaged there will be members of the Butter Workers' Union. All the butter boxes will have to be produced by members of the Butter Box Makers' Union, and will require to be branded with the union label. I presume that that brand will be put inside the box, because the brand upon the finished article will have to be placed upon the outside, otherwise the stevedores will not handle it, and the seamen will not carry it. That is how legislation of this character will <inline font-style="italic">affect the</inline> pastoral and agricultural industries, in common with every other enterprise that is being carried on in Australia. I maintain that it will strike one of the most severe blows at commercial enterprise that have ever been struck in the history of this country, or of any other part of the civilized world. It will apply also to the manufacture of boots and, indeed, to every other business undertaking in Australia. Trade union propositions of this kind have gone beyond the voluntary stage, and we are now asked to force them upon the people by legal enactment. We know the members of the Labour Party and of the Trades Hall Council well enough to realize that they will see that the trade union label provisions of the Bill, if they be passed, are pushed home, and that industry is further crippled in this way. The history of the system in the United States shows that the union label is used simply as an instrument of torture so far as industry and commerce are concerned. Shop assistants who are members of unions are invariably instructed to introduce to customers goods bearing the union label, and it is in this way that pressure is brought to bear by the unions. As soon as the unionists have obtained control of industries by means of this system, it is open to them to absolutely dictate their own terms and conditions to employers in every line of business, and to push them so far that in the end those employers may have to say, "I cannot comply with these conditions any longer; I shall have to close down." If this system be allowed to prevail in Australia, we cannot possibly look for the opening up of new undertakings. The proposal will strike one of the most severe blows that has yet been aimed at the industrial life of Australia, and means the introduction of a form of tyranny and slavery in relation to non-unionists, the like of which has never been experienced in any part of the world. </para>

                            <para>- I read nothing of the kind. I simply read a statement showing that it was necessary in Chicago that the wives and children of unionists should wear clothes bearing the imprint of a union, but I never suggested that a walking delegate - even of the union to which the honorable member belongs - would be guilty of critically examining the clothes worn by the wives or children of unionists. The idea that a union delegate could sink so low has never occurred to my mind; my impression has always been that only a superficial examination of the clothing is made. The provisions of the Bill relating to the union label will strike a blow at the liberty of the poorest class of workmen in Australia. We have to fight the battle of the non-unionists as against the unionists, and I can promise honorable members of the Labour Party that in the end they will suffer very seriously from the enactment of such provisions. The result of the attitude taken up by the party will be that those who are outside the unions will be driven into a combination to fight them. At the outset, their organizations were formed with a laudable object, but having felt their strength, they have done as many others have done in similar circumstances - they have gone too far. It is because of this that a reaction has set in, which must eventually cripple organizations that have served a very useful purpose. But above all other considerations, the desire of honorable members of this Parliament should be to conserve the liberties of the very poorest of our citizens, in so far as the avenues of employment open to them are concerned. </para>

                        <para>- I listened with some attention to the remarks of the honorable member for Corangamite, being, led to assume from his opening statement that he would deal with the more important: features of the Bill. I naturally considered that he would enlighten the House as to the results that would possibly accrue from the passing of the union label provisions of the Bill, but have come to the conclusion that he dealt with the question, not of the union label, but of unionism generally, and the injurious effects of unionism upon the industrial life of the United States, where strikes constitute one of the chief engines of warfare employed by trade unions. The honorable member treated us to a disquisition upon many learned judgments pronounced by the Courts of the United States which had had the effect of preventing people from doing something that was not in accordance with law ; but I would remind him that it is unnecessary for us to go so far for illustrations in that regard. What happens in Victoria, not only to those who break our industrial laws, but to company promotors who violate the Companies Act, or <inline font-style="italic">evento</inline> members of the medical profession who break the law? Law-breakers in all these classes generally find themselves in the end, in Pentridge, or thereabouts. It should be our endeavour to deal with the question of trade marks solely from the point of view of Australia - we should strive to show what may be the effect of the passing of this Bill upon the trading and industrial welfare of the Commonwealth. No less an authority than the leader of the Opposition has told us that unionism, in its essential principle, is a splendid thing. </para>

                            <para>- I am dealing first of all with the question of unionism. Unionism is a splendid thing for any body of men who wish I  to secure the best results of their labour, jio matter what avocation they may follow. As an evidence of that, take the profession of which the honorable member is an ornament - the medical profession. Practically every worker, no matter what his calling may be, sooner or later realizes the enormous advantages to be gained from unionism. Notwithstanding what the honorable member has said to the contrary, he has seen fit to leave the ranks of the unionists, to leave the association of which he was such a conspicuous member. </para>

                            <para>- The House is well aware of my opinions in regard to the basic principles of unionism. I believe that a union when constituted for a particular purpose should not abuse its privileges as a union to achieve some other object. I stated my position very clearly to the House on a previous Bill, and I have seen no reason to alter my mind. I desire to approach the discussion of the present measure from a fair basis, without raising any little side issues. What is the use of dealing with the question from the standpoint of strikes which originated in America, or of the effect of strikes, and some law points which have been raised, when we know that in Australia to-day strikes are practically prohibited by law? </para>

                            <para>- Let me get back to the original position. The Government were subjected by the leader of the Opposition to some criticism for introducing this proposal for a trade union label, and a previous Government, some of whose members are supporting the present Government, were twitted with not having placed it in the original Bill. What queer positions we find ourselves in at times ! Had the right honorable member forgotten at that time what position he occupied, when he asked the Crown to assent to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill ? Although the leading feature of that Bill which had caused the downfall of one Government, and subsequently caused the downfall of a second Government, was opposed by the right honorable member, yet he, as leader of the Government, advised the Crown to assent to that principle. So far as I know, honorable members constituting the present Government did not formulate this Bill in the first instance. It was originated in the Senate by the Labour Government, without a provision for a union label, which, by the way, was introduced there by the representatives of the Labour Party. The present Government accepted the Bill with some modifications. </para>

Of course, it remains for the House to say what will be the effect. To those who declaim against the provision, and point to the tyranny and injustice which will accrue to non-union labourers through its enactment let me put this question, " Where is compulsion, within the four corners of the measure, to compel any employer or manufacturer to put the union label on his goods?" </para>

Is not power still left in the hands of the manufacturer to .prevent any terrorism, or even coercion, from unionists? </para>

                            <para>- I am prepared to act as I did on a previous occasion. I am prepared to prohibit the making of any rule that would debar any fair or reasonable minded man from entering a union. I raised my voice against the existence of such rules before. Not only have the unions of industrial workers transgressed in that respect, but even the union to which the honorable member for Corangamite belonged has had some extraordinary provisions in its rules. The body to which I belong, the farmers, also have an organization that has done some extraordinary things with which I have no sympathy, and which, indeed, are, from my point of view, absolutely absurd - as, for instance, putting provisions in their rules which are repugnant to any fair-minded man. The position which I take up is that there is nothing, obligatory upon any employer or upon any manufacturer, even if the whole of his employes are union men, to use the union label. No trader, commercial man, or manufacturer will use a trade mark unless; there is some advantage from so doing. </para>

There is this advantage, from the industrial worker's stand-point - that the union label puts him on an equality with any corporation or individual manufacturer in the community who has a right to register a trade mark. It gives to the industrial worker, through his organization, a right to register a trade mark, showing that the goods which he makes are produced entirely by union labour. </para>

                            <para>- There is no coercion whatever. Generally speaking, if an employer finds it to be to his advantage to discharge non-unionists, and to put in other men, on account of their better workmanship or their better services generally, he will not hesitate for a moment to do so. I do not follow the argument that any power- of coercion is given to the unions by means of this principle. The object which I have in view, before the Bill is finally disposed of, is this : We have had many complaints in Australia - some have been voiced on the floor of this House - as to the injurious effects upon the community generally of monopolies, combines, and trusts. To my mind there is splendid opportunity in connexion with this Bill - as there was in connexion with the Patents Act, although advantage was not taken of it - to do something to restrain monopolists or those individuals who wish to create a monopoly in any particular article. I intend to propose an amendment to the effect that any individual or corporation who becomes the proprietor of a registered trade mark, and who does anything whatever in restraint of trade in the article to which that trade mark is applied, shall have the registration cancelled forthwith. </para>

                            <para>- They are engaged in labour; that is their trade for the time lifting. The leader of the Opposition told us that this Bill was an instance of the effects of a shuffle of the political cards, and he went on to argue that if it was possible by combinations of parties to bring about such a state of things, we should never know exactly where we were. Stress was laid on the fact that the Labour Party in this House were the determining factors in this class of legislation. I should like to direct the right honorable member's attention to the fact that the industrial classes in Australia are above the level of serfs to-day. They are citizens ; they are constituted such by Act of Parliament. They have the franchise. We have thrown aside in Australia the old barbaric system of resorting to road metal and brute force to achieve what a particular class may think to be for its welfare. The working classes have come into the political arena. The members of the Labour Party are here as representatives of the citizens of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- It is not for the leader of the Opposition to quarrel with the members of the Labour Party or with those who send them here. It will be better to recognise that they represent one of the forces at work in this community, and to endeavour to direct that force into proper channels than to be interminably in antagonism to it. The whole industrial and economic life of Australia is to-day represented in Parliament. The party which is designated the Labour Party, represents, if honorable members choose to say so, a class. But we have had class representation' in the past. Those who complain of it to-day did not complain of it then. This force being at work to-day, is it not better to recognise it, and to endeavour to direct and govern it in the best interests of the community, than to be eternally abusing it? It has been recognised in some of the States, and it is being recognised in this Parliament, that it is our duty so to control the affairs of the nation that no section of its people - even the poorest of our' industrial classes - shall have to sacrifice their life-blood, so to speak, for the benefit of their employers. So far as I can understand the situation,, it is admitted by all that the efforts of trade unions have been directed towards the uplifting of the industrial elements in Australia, and to placing them on an equality with other classes. That is the sole object of this trade union proposal. Consequently, I approach the question with an open mind. Up to the present, however, I have not heard of anything to prevent me from supporting the Bill. I trust that when we get into Committee, if any provision is found to be necessary to safeguard the interests of all, we shall be found perfectly willing to insert it in the Bill. </para>

                        <para>- If honorable members desire to have additional evidence of the fact that the present Government does not possess a sufficient majority in this House to enable them to introduce useful legislation, they have it in this attempt to bring forward a Bill embodying provisions which afford clear proof of pressure from another party. The Ministry speak with the voice of Jacob, but the hand is the hand of Esau. I venture to say that if the party really responsible for the introduction of the trade union label provisions of this Bill were occupying the Treasury bench, they would not have had the temerity to bring forward a provision of the kind. They would have exercised that caution which was so characteristic of their brief reign of office only a little while ago. But, occupying positions in which' they are able to control legislation without responsibility for that legislation, they evidently have been able to prevail on another Ministry to do what they themselves would probably never have attempted. I object to provisions of this character for reasons which I have always given for my objection to the creation of special privileges for any one section of the community. I hold that the Legislature exists for the purpose of preserving the equal rights of every citizen, and not for the purpose of creating laws which advantage one section at the expense or inconvenience of the, rest of the community. -That is exactly what measures of this kind are designed to do. Here, the obvious intention and purpose is to enable one section to obtain special privileges at the expense of the rest of the community, bv the use of a union label, which will have the effe'ct of bringing pressure to bear on employers and employes alike - -on one to employ only certain members of the community, who are associated with unions, and on the other to purchase goods only from those who employ union labour. Whatever may be the rights of unions to draft rules in an endeavour to bring about such a state of affairs, the Legislature has no moral right to lend itself to any scheme for enabling such things to be done under the sanction of legal authority ; and it is that aspect of the question to which I propose, mainly, to address myself. </para>

                            <para>- I see no objection to a union registering a label, provided it is clear that it is not the intention to use that label for the purposes of intimidation, coercion, or conspiracy, for the purposes of a boycott, or by any other means of combination to prevent freedom of choice on the part of members of unions to purchase wherever they please, or to prevent freedom on the part of manufacturers or dealers to employ whom they choose, and sell what goods they choose, whether or not of union manufacture. If it is not the intention of the framers of this Bill to afford such facilities the provisions of the part relating to trades unions certainly seem to me to lead in that direction. If we are to take the experience of other countries where similar provisions have been adopted, not bv Legislatures, but by the unions themselves, we have reason to believe that there is room, for great doubt and fear as to the consequences of passing such a measure with the full force of law behind it. Looking through' a list of cases, which is supplied in a pamphlet recently distributed, we see the following statement. </para>

                            <para>- It is an argument only against what is designed by the provisions of the Bill before us, provisions which are the immediate object of our consideration. For this reason, the statements I am reading have value, as bearing on what is likely to result from the legalizing of a union label in Australia. If those have been the effects where a union label has not been legalized, we are within reason in assuming that something of the kind' will certainly happen in Australia under an Act which affords special facilities for coercion and intimidation on the part of unions. We, therefore, ought to consider the possibility of such events, and, as far as possible, guard against them. </para>

                    <para>The words " union label " are distinctly used - while they hold back, as far as possible, competitive goods not bearing it. They have great influence in support of the label. An unconscious employer, finding that certain goods sell better than others of the same class, naturally orders them in preference. Recently the General Council of Lexington passed an ordinance requiring contracts for supplies to be given only to firms employing union labour. This was vetoed by the Mayor, on the ground that it violated a section of the Constitution, which reads : - " No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law ; nor deny any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of its laws." </para>

                            <para>- I do not pose as an authority on the subject, but the Mayor of Lexington, after the adoption of this course, vetoed the resolution on the ground that it was <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires</inline> of the Constitution. I take it that he was more familiar with the Constitution of America than I can profess to be. These provisions of the Bill before us form really an attempt to revive the preference provisions sought to be included in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill but in another form. Those preference provisions were distinctly objected to by this House, and yet by the provisions of the Bill before us, it is proposed to sneak in preference to unionists, under the guise of provision for a union label. That has already been declared against in this House. </para>

                            <para>- - The clauses as originally proposed were not carried, but amended, so that preference should be given only under certain prescribed conditions which the honorable member for Bland declared could not be given effect to. The arguments which were used against the introduction of preference to unionists in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill apply with equal force to these clauses. </para>

                            <para>- That is not so. If the honorable member for Bland recollects aright, I moved an amendment, when we were discussing the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, to delete the preference clauses, and it was only after that amendment had been lost that I voted for an amendment, which hedged those provisions round with certain safeguards. The honorable member' for Bland must admit that that is a correct statement of my attitude on that occasion. I take up the same attitude on this Bill. I do not object to unions having a label or trade mark, provided it is not used for coercive or tyrannical purposes, in order to prevent members of unions buying goods where they like, and whether they are made by union labour or otherwise; or to prevent employers, manufacturers of goods, or dealers in goods from employing such labour as they like, or from making or selling goods the manufacture of union or non-union labour. I do not object to a union being permitted to register a distinctive mark or label, provided that the right to do so does not carry with it the power to interfere with the liberties of the citizens of the Commonwealth in any direction. I believe that all citizens should have equal rights before the law. So far from making any attempt bv legislation to enable one section of the community to coerce any other sections into the sacrifice of their' rights, I believe it should be the object of our legislation to prevent and punish such coercion. I should like to know from honorable members opposite whether it is the intent and purpose of these particular provisions in the Bill to prevent the members of unions buying goods which have not been made by union labour, or to prevent manufacturers and dealers from selling such goods ? Honorable members are silent on that point. </para>

                            <para>- No. The object of the preference clause which it was sought to introduce into the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill and the object of the proposed union label is to secure, not equal rights for all, but special privileges for some at the expense of the rest. The object of the preference clause was to prevent non-unionists from getting employment until all unionists were employed, and the object of the Bill is to serve a similar purpose. </para>

                            <para>- The obvious object. If the Bill is carried, we may easily have such a state of things as this : A man, attempting to hang a picture in his own house, with the assistance of his wife, might find that they were unequal to the task, and call in the coachman to their service. Under orders from his union, however, the coachman might refuse to have anything to do with the matter, unless the picture bore a union label, to show that it had been painted by a union artist; and he might also demand that the canvas should be labelled to show that it had been manufactured under union conditions, and that the very tacks used to secure it to the frame bore a union stamp. He might also refuse to handle the picture unless the nail from which it was to be suspended could be shown to be of union manufacture, and might raise similar questions in regard to the wall paper, plaster, and everything else connected with the building. There is no limit to the objections which could be raised, and, if I remember rightly, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, in a famous speech on the Arbitration Bill, spoke very forcibly on this subject. Therefore, although the measure at first sight appears to be such a simple one, it may prove one of the most powerful engines of tyranny, unless its provisions are carefully safeguarded, and I ask those who support it to assist us in obtaining such safeguards from abuse. I shall oppose the measure unless its provisions are so safeguarded, because, as they stand, they are calculated to establish a labour monopoly. One of the most cruel forms of monopoly exists when labour unions attempt to exclude from employment all who are not unionists, and resort to devices of this kind to obtain the support of law for their coercive actions. </para>

But the proposed label is to be used by the unions to give a preference to goods manufactured by them over goods manufactured by non-unionists. </para>

                            <para>- That is the object of the measure. The Attorney-General, in moving the second reading, said that the Bill provides a guarantee to the general public that the labour employed in manufacturing goods has been employed under conditions in which sweating could not prevail, and the whole argument last week was that the great philanthropists of the day say that such a measure is necessary to prevent the public from purchasing goods manufactured under unfair and insanitary conditions. An appeal is thereby being made to persons with a conscience to purchase goods which are manufactured by those who pay their workmen a fair wage. What is the real object of the proposal for the use of union labels? Is it not that workmen may purchase goods which have been manufactured by union labour, and so encourage the employment of unionists? </para>

                            <para>- They have also been in operation in the United States. We have heard a good deal with regard to the experience in that country, and I judge that what has happened there will probably be repeated here, namely, that the unions will endeavour to make it imperative that manufacturers shall employ only union labour. I am not prepared to say that the unions would go to the same extremes as their <inline font-style="italic">confreres</inline> in America have done. I do not propose to follow that line of argument. My point is that the chief object of the provisions relating to the use of union labels, is to force men into the unions. We know from what has been written by Tom Mann, Webb, and others, who have dealt with the unionist side of the labour problem, that their aim is to force all artisans into the unions, and to then organize their forces in such a way as to accomplish their political ends. Since this debate was commenced, I have endeavoured to obtain a copy of the last pamphlet written by Tom Mann, in order to ascertain whether he has repeated what he stated in a former publication, to the effect that at the last International Labour Convention, the members agreed bv resolution to do their best as Socialists to force men into the unions, and then use the unions for the purpose of promoting the adoption of extreme socialistic principles. The Australian Labour Party have decided to be represented at the International Labour Convention which takes place nextyear. </para>

                            <para>- Whether the unionists are Socialists or otherwise, they will have to further the objects of the Socialists. That is the real object of the present movement. The Socialists have no very great regard for unionism pure and simple, because that is only a means to an end. That statement is made by all the modern writers on the socialistic side. That is the objective of the present movement in England and upon the Continent, and honorable members of the Labour Party in Australia are working most assiduously in the same direction. The Attorney-General proposes to make provision whereby non-unionists shall be able to work with unionists. Whilst the Minister is, no doubt, sincere, I am inclined to think that he will fail to accomplish his purpose. The honorable member for Bland has mentioned certain instances in which unionists and non-unionists might be employed in the same factory. He mentioned the case of clickers in a boot factory. Let us imagine that a non-union clicker is employed in a boot factory. A clicker is an operative who cuts out uppers, and one man is capable of cutting out thousands of uppers, and of keeping a whole factory going. Therefore, the manufacturer who employed a non-unionist clicker could not affix the union label to his goods unless he also attached a tag to show that some of the men employed by him were non-unionists. It could not be' expected that those whose sympathies were with the unions would purchase goods bearing a tag of the non-unionist. Otherwise, the union label would possess no advantage. The honorable member for Lang has described what has taken place in San Francisco, and I have no doubt that the same condition of affairs is sought to be brought about here. I have no sympathy with coercion or tyranny. and I contend' that the object of the Socialists, if approved by unionists, should be attained by evolutionary methods, not by coercion. </para>

                        <para>- It has been urged in justification of the union label proposals, that the affixing of such labels to goods would afford a guarantee that they had been produced under conditions fair to the workers. No man, I suppose, wishes to see labour employed in any place under unfair conditions. But I claim that the means which it is proposed to adopt to secure that end are not such as ought to commend themselves to the House. This Bill marks a very important departure in our legislation, and I exceedingly regret that there is such a small attendance of honorable members who take any interest in it. If it is merely desired that a man engaged in producing any article shall work under fair conditions, obviously these clauses should not apply to any industry which is working under a Wages Board,' or under an award of the Arbitration Court, because those tribunals guarantee fair conditions to the men engaged in such industries. If the contention urged in support of this proposition is correct, no attempt- should be made to apply the principle of the union label to goods which are produced in industries working under an award of the Arbitration Court or under a Wages Board. </para>

                            <para>- That is really what is aimed at. The proposal to adopt the union label is another attempt to secure a preference to unionists. We debated that principle <inline font-style="italic">ad nauseam</inline> last year, we deposed two or three Governments whilst it was under discussion, and honorable members generally derived a good education in regard to it. The proposal contained in this Bill constitutes another attempt to secure a preference to unionists, because the idea underlying it is that by the use of ' the union label we shall create a demand for union goods, so that any employer of nonunion labour will be forced bv the competition of those who put the union label upon their products, either to urge his men to join the union - a course which they may not desire to adopt - or to dismiss them. </para>

                            <para>- If a man who makes goods, say in the district of Collingwood, finds that in and around that district an increasing number of persons purchase goods with the union label upon them, and he cannot affix that label because he employs two or three dozen non-unionists, then he will be forced either to induce the non-unionists to join the union, or to supplant them with unionists. Notwithstanding the ingenious sophistries interjected by the Attorney-General, while the leader of the Opposition was speaking the other night, I maintain that it is quite possible for a man to be debarred from using the union label if he employs only the smallest proportion of non-unionists in a very large factory. </para>

                    <para>Mr.ROBINSON.- That is the fair inference to be drawn from the Attorney-General' s remarks. The leader of the Opposition pointed out that there might be a factory in which 1,000 men were employed, only twenty or thirty of whom were non-uni©nists, and as a result the owner of the factory would not be entitled to use the union label upon his goods. Take the case of a boot factory, for example, and it will be seen that the statement of the right honorable member for East Sydney was absolutely fair. As we all knew, in that industry, the work of manufacture is distributed among a number of hands. One man does a certain portion of the work, a second confines his attention to another operation, and so forth. No single individual manufactures a pair of boots in their entirety. The employes include putters, clickers, and numerous other operatives. If one non-union clicker be employed in a factory, it will be impossible to distinguish which particular boot has been worked upon by the non-unionist and which has not been so worked upon; and consequently that factory will be precluded from using the union label. Thus, in an establishment employing a small minority of non-unionists, the latter will either be driven to join the union or will be dismissed. I have no objections to unions in any shape or form, but I object to legislative enactments which will have the effect of compelling men to join a particular association when they may be reluctant to do so. It appears to rae that' this is a matter which the workers ought to decide for themselves. If they neglect or refuse to join a union, that is their own affair. We should not endeavour to force men into a body to which, for various reasons, they may not desire to belong. It has been said that this project has been put forward with the most noble object, and I have no doubt that the vast majority of honorable members who support the proposal only wish to see it carried out in a reasonable way. In Victoria, however, we have had some instances in which more than fair conditions have been asked. An attempt has been made in this city to apply the principles of the union label for purposes of oppression. I hold in my hand some cuttings from the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of March last. They are headed. " The Butchering Trade. - Listing Union Shops." From these clippings I find that the Victorian Amalgamated Butchers' Union, in February of this year, took steps for the purpose of forcing men engaged in the various butchering establishments throughout the city of Melbourne to join the Butchers' Union. It must not be forgotten that that trade is under the operation of a Wages Board, that the hours of its employes are not undulv long, and. that their wages are not low. They receive a fair remuneration. Despite these facts, however, an attempt was made by the Amalgamated Butchers' Union to force men to join that organization. That union endeavoured to achieve its object bv what was called "Listing Union Shops," and the circular which was issued by the secretary to various master butchers reads as follows : - </para>

                    <para class="block">Honorable members will recollect, in this connexion, that every master butcher in the metropolis has to pay the same rate of wages to his employes, and to work them for the same number of hours. The circular continues - </para>

                    <para class="block">As honorable members will readily see, that was an attempt to use the master butchers for the purpose of forcing their employes to join the Butchers' Union, whether they desired to do so or not. This was done in relation to a trade in which a Wages Board has fixed the hours of labour and the rate of wages. It is not a trade in which sweating can be said to be rampant. The men work under fair conditions, and yet an attempt has been made to force those engaged in such a trade to join unions. That is the very principle which underlies the union label clauses. The object is not to secure that men shall work under fair conditions - because that is a matter for which provision is already made in the Federal Conciliation and Arbitration Act, as well as by State factory legislation - but to force or persuade men, or to make it to their interests, to join certain trade unions whether they desire to do so or not. A good deal of comment took place upon this action on the part of the employes' association, and the Master Butchers' Union, .in a letter which they addressed to the press, used very strong terms. In this letter it was stated - </para>

                        <para>The conditions of labour in the trade are regulated by law, and no other authority is recognised. If in any case unfair or illegal conditions are imposed, there is ample remedy under the Shops and Factories Act. Further comment is unnecessary. </para>

                    <para class="block">Under this pressure the Amalgamated Butchers' Union practically "'threw- up the sponge " because they saw that the public considered that the issuing of the circular was an attempt to compel the workmen to join their organization.

                    <para class="block">It is true that they wished to give any man who was employed an opportunity to become a member of the union, but they also desired to give the master butchers an opportunity to dismiss any employe who would not join that union. These letters clearly show the object of " listing " union shops in this way or of issuing union labels. The object is not to secure fair conditions for the workers, which no one would deny to them, but to force them to form a union. </para>

                            <para>- In the majority of cases the object is to improve their conditions; but I think that it was conclusively shown, last year, in this House, that there were some unions which desired to get men into their ranks for political purposes just as much as for industrial objects. It was stated by the honorable member for Bland that union label provisions were in force in a great many States in America. It is a fact that a large number of the Legislatures of the States have passed what we may designate as union label provisions ; but it must not be forgotten that those provisions have been held to be unconstitutional bv every Supreme Court in the United States in which they have been challenged. They have been held to be unconstitutional because, in almost every case, I believe, they infringe not only the Constitution of the States concerned, but a very vital amendment known as " The Fourteenth " in the Federal Constitution of the United States. I have before me a book entitled <inline font-style="italic">The Corporations Auxiliary Company Bulletin,</inline> which gives a full statement of what is described as a union label case, heard bv the Jefferson Circuit Court, Chancery Branch. First Division, the plaintiff being one L. T. Davidson, and the defendant the City of Louisville. In that case the union label was held to be unconstitutional, because it infringed the State constitution of Kentucky, as well as that grand declaration of rights known as the American Constitution. I should like to make one or two quotations from the report, in order to show the opinions upon which the learned judges acted in this case. In support of the contention that the provisions in question were unconstitutional quotations were made from a decision by one of the Justices of the Court of Appeal of New York - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> O'Brien - as we'l as from decisions given in the Supreme  Courts of Illinois - the State in which, as honorable members are aware, Chicago is  situate,  and which is the second most- populous State in the Union - New York, Kentucky, and other States. The Supreme Courts of these States had all held that the union label provisions were an infringement of the guarantees of fundamental personal liberty contained in the Constitution of the Union. Although our Constitution does not contain the same guarantees, the principles upon which the </para>

A law that restricts freedom of contract on the part of both the master and servant cannot, in the end, operate to the benefit of either. The law forbids the contractor from paying a rate of wages other than what is called " the prevailing Tate," although the labourer is willing to accept it. It calls for the payment practically on all occasions of the highest market price, and hence must compel the contractor to employ only such workmen as aTe competent to earn the very highest rate of compensation. </para>

A union workman has all the rights before the law that the non-union workman has, and the General Council cannot, constitutionally, deprive the union workman of that equality. </para>
                    <para class="block">In the United States the authorities are abundant and uniform to the effect that ordinances and laws restricting the right of work to a class are unconstitutional, and therefore void. The American decisions are based upon sections in the Constitutions of the individual States, as well as in that of the Union, which guarantee to all individuals there the right to pursue their avocation in the way which seems best to themselves. The trade union provisions in this Bill have not been inserted with a view to secure fair working conditions, because, ns I have shown, in trades in respect of which the State Parliament has insisted that fair conditions shall prevail - trades in which, to the knowledge of every householder in- Melbourne, fair conditions are observed - an attempt has been made to blacklist those who do not employ union labour. The object of that is, of course, to strengthen the unions in every way, to force men into them. I do not think that Parliament can too strongly reprobate conduct of that kind. The privilege of joining a union is one of which I think most men ought to avail themselves. But if they do not, it seems to me to be a very great infringement of personal liberty for this Parliament, by enactment, to say to a man, " We shall make it to your advantage to join a union, and very greatly to your disadvantage to keep outside the ranks of a union." Last year that position was debated at great length here on a proposal for preference to unionists, and, although a majority of the House were in favour of the principle of preference to unionists, yet we succeeded after some struggle, in cutting down the provision very materially. </para>

                            <para>- Two wrongs do not make a right. If men do these things voluntarily, they are guilty, it seems to me, of an act which is wrong in a court of morals. But if we, by law, give men the power to so act, we shall do something which is much more immoral, because we shall put men in a position where they can do something which offends against morality, but which they will be able to justify by an Act of Parliament. Undoubtedly, the greatest objection to the enactment of preference to unionists, or the union label, is that it gives a justification in courts of law for an action which is not consistent with the highest code of morality, which is not consistent with fair protection to all classes, but which is based upon this underlying assumption - </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to hear from the honorable member that the condition of those outside the unions is not so bad as I thought it was. But even if there are only a few persons who do not join a union because they are not financially strong enough to do so, we should not make their burden any greater than it is. We know that in these States, where friendly societies are largely in vogue, many men find great difficulty in keeping up the payments which, when the necessity arises, would entitle them to sick pay, and so on. If, on top of that, they are forced into a union, where they would have to pay an entrance fee and make another payment, the calls upon them get too severe, and those who are dependent upon them suffer very much in the long run. In conclusion, I can only reiterate what I have said against this provision, because I feel that it is another attempt to extend the principle of preference to unionists, which I believe should not be enacted, it being, in my opinion,, contrary to any high moral code. </para>

                        <para>- I deeply regret that, when a measure of such far reaching importance is under discussion, honorable members who are responsible for its original and extraneous phases, have not seen fit to explain what they really mean. We have had honorable members sitting in the corner as if they were without that gift of loquacity which we all know them to possess, as if they were under the Government whip, instead of holding the whip over the Government. This is a measure which previously had a vast amount of opprobrium heaped upon it, because it was what is known as a non contentious measure. I do not think it can be said any longer that it is non contentious. The House recently expressed its desire to proceed with useful business, but all along it has shown that it is incapable of dealing with contentious legislation. I appeal to the House, as the Attorney-General did, to proceed with useful business. The only way in which we can do useful business is to express clearly what we mean to do, and not to try to crowd contentious proposals into non-contentious measures. If this provision for a union label be germane to the character of this measure generally, why was it not proposed in the first instance ? The original measure was drafted by the Deakin Government, I think, during the previous recess, or immediately after the House met last session, and it contained no union label provision. The succeeding Government - a Government representing militant unionism in the Commonwealth - did not submit any . union label proposal. The Reid-McLean Government then came into power, and it also did not propose to insert this foreign proposition. We had to wait until the Bill was introduced into the Senate before a member of the party that is now so silent in this Chamber submitted a provision for a union label. It is only fair, in trying to gain an estimation of what the proposal really means, to ask honorable members why, when they had their own party in power, they did not see fit to introduce the proposal in an honest, straightforward way? We know that for a long; time the Labour Party were intensely anxious about a Federal arbitration measure. We know that they devoted all their energies to the preparation of a measure which was to secure industrial peace throughout the Commonwealth so far as an industrial dispute trespassed beyond the boundaries of any one State. It was of no use to point out to honorable members; that for a considerable time there had been no industrial warfare of a Federal nature, and that there was no likelihood of industrial strife of a Federal nature occurring for a considerable time to come. They said, " Such a thing may happen, and we wish to prepare against it." Well, we prepared <inline font-style="italic">against its</inline> occurrence, but the House saw that that measure, which was to induce industrial peace, would also conduce to the immense strength of the labour organizations - to the political strength of each member of the Labour Party ! One of the incidents of the measure was co-operative bargaining. Honorable members said that, for the convenience of the Court, men should be induced to form organizations of employers and of employes. We found that this incident of the measure was to be used to force men, under the preference proposal, into unions which might have - and some of which did have - political rules, which could devote their funds and subscriptions to political objects, and which could and .did go far to return some honorable members to their places here. We found that the great fight was not about the large question of industrial peace or war, but as to whether these unions, which were to be recruited through the agencies of this Chamber, should have absolute latitude for compelling men to vote how they pleased, and to devote men's subscriptions to whatever purpose they thought necessary. This House very properly refused to support that conspiracy of honorable members on the cross benches. The House, as we know, inserted definite safeguards in that Bill. It laid down the principle that when a man in pursuit of his livelihood was compelled by legislation which this House had passed to join a union, that union should have no oppressive rules, and should in no way interpose in politics or interfere with the liberty of that man outside the legitimate objects of the union. There are other similar safeguards which. I intend to ask the House to insert in this measure also. The Labour Party may naturally be keen to further its organization by crowding these foreign proposals into ordinary machinery Bills. They may hold themselves justified in turning what are meant to be Bills to facilitate the machinery of the Commonwealth, into Bills to further the machinery of their own organizations. But there are two ways to do these things. There is an open honest way, and there is a surreptitious secret way. There is a way of candour and there is a way of hyprocrisy. I do say that it is surreptitious and hypocritical for honorable members opposite to insert proposals of the immensely far-reaching character of that which is contained in this Bill, into Bills which were never designed to contain such provisions. The Labour Party may hold that they are the best judges of what best befits them. Very probably they, who carry on their deliberations somewhere in the vaults of this building- </para>

                            <para>- Yes, and we will blow up the honorable member's party some day. I am told that the Labour Part , carry on their deliberations somewhere near the heavens, since they have arrived at the important position in the House that they have now reached. I am glad to know that the party to which my honorable friend belongs is openly and frankly occupying the chamber which we all know as the Ministerial room - that the Ministerial tail has had the frankness and candour to take possession of a room ordinarily reserved for the Ministerial party. The Labour Party, however, do carry on. their deliberations in secret, and consequently it is not to be wondered at that they prefer to carry on legislation in secret, and to spring secret proposals on the country. But the moment the country begins to see that the Labour Party is utilizing endeavours to carry useful legislation for the purpose of crowding what ought to be non-contentious measures with contentious legislation, it will have no more of them. Why should a trade union have a trade mark? What is a trade mark for? A trade mark is a guarantee of value to the consumer. Do honorable members on the cross benches mean to tell me that anything made by a union would be a guarantee of the value of that article to the consumer. Surely the public are the only judges of what is good, in their eyes. </para>

                            <para>- It would certainly have no value to the consumer. I am glad that the honorable member has helped me with my argument, which is that this union label would be no guarantee of value to the consumer. A manufacturer establishes a reputation for manufacturing a certain article well. Naturally the public wish to get their goods from that manufacturer. He puts a trade mark on his goods to protect the public, and to give them a chance to defend themselves against piracy. It also gives him a chance of protecting his own reputation. The original idea of the trade union mark has been described several times, but I may, perhaps, be pardoned for repeating it, for the purpose of illustrating my argument. The original idea was to afford some guarantee that the goods in question were made under healthy conditions of manufacture. In San Francisco the union label was used to show that only unionists - who were not Chinese, possibly suffering from the ailments peculiar to Asiatic people - had been concerned in the manufacture of the goods. In other words, the mark was a guarantee that the goods were1 made under healthy conditions. Do honorable members opposite mean to say that that argument applies to-day in Australia - that all our Factories Acts, our Early Closing Acts, and our Acts governing and controlling the manufacture of various articles of commerce do not govern alike unionists and non-unionists? Obviously, then, this proposal to enable a trade union mark to be placed upon goods is not one to enable the consumer to tell whether the articles have been manufactured under healthy surroundings. </para>

That would give the consumer a chance to know whether the goods were manufactured by Chinese or not.

                            <para>- I am glad that some other honorable member remembers the circumstance. In that article the consumer was referred to, not in so many words, but in a spirit as if he were a person of very small importance - as though the only people to be considered were the manufacturer and his employes. In a newspaper like the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> that is very natural, because that journal has a contempt for the gullibility of its own consumers, and no one, I think, would be inclined to contend that such contempt was unjustifiable. Nevertheless, the consumer is a person of immense importance, representing, as he does, the whole community. Only a few of us are manufacturers, or manufacturers' employes, and the consumer is of supreme importance ; and the fact that this proposal does not benefit the consumer, and was not originally intended to benefit him. should govern all our considerations. But I ask whether this union label is in the interests of the manufacturer. Will it give him any guarantee of value? Obviously not ! But I say that the measure will not hurt the manufacturer, but only the consumer. Under the Bill a prejudice will be sought to be set up in favour of only the union-made article, and that prejudice will enable the manufacturer, if he so wishes, to deteriorate the value of his goods, and to throw on the consumer a loss that the latter otherwise would not have to bear. If the manufacturer is able to escape the results of this legislation, and visit it on another and unoffending and innocent party, I hold that the manufacturer will not particularly object to the measure. </para>

                            <para>- That is why I wish the measure had been introduced in a plain and straightforward way, and not disguised as a non-contentious measure. As a proof that the manufacturer, or person in trade, is always able to visit on the consumer the increased loss caused by this type of legislation, I have only to point to the anxiety manifested amongst the extreme members of the Socialistic Party, who favour it, to fix values and assess everything by statute. Honorable members know that the Queensland <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> has recently been tackling this question, which has also arisen in New Zealand. In the latter Colony it has been found that the increased cost of production, owing to the present proceedings of the Arbitration Courts and to the consequent general rise of wages, has been passed on to the consumer, and the worker himself has to pay the enhanced price of the articles produced. </para>

                            <para>- The increase applies not only to house rent, but to all goods and all phases of trade; and the cry now is to settle everything by Act of Parliament, even the price of food. Will honorable members deny the truth of that statement ? Do they deny that, as a result of the increased cost of production in New Zealand, the articles produced are charged more to the persons who produce them, and that there is now a cry raised to have prices fixed by statute? I can understand that neither the consumers, who constitute the people of this country, nor, perhaps, the manufacturers, who are a very small element, wish for legislation of this character. I can understand honorable members on the cross benches, who are of the Socialistic Party, sedulously urging on this measure under any guise in which they can secure it. Those gentlemen represent political trade unionism; and they hope to affiliate to their political organization all trades unions and the members thereof. They have already succeeded in affiliating a considerable number of the trades unions of Australia, and from those trades unions their electoral subscriptions are met. </para>

                            <para>- It is quite true, and if honorable members listen I shall prove the facts. In South Australia, as all honorable members should know, if they do not, the members of the affiliated unions support the Labour Party by yearly subscription. I am, therefore, absolutely cor rect when I say that the affiliated unions pay for the organization work of labour members of this House. </para>

                            <para>- If the affiliated unions of South Australia give their subscriptions to all sides of politics, I still think it is a very false system. In New South Wales, the trades unions support only one side of politics. At the recent Labour Conference in New South Wales, there was a proposal to levy 6d. per head on every member of every affiliated union. The delegate who brought forward the proposition told the conference that the suggested levy would realize from £1,500 to £2,000 per annum for the Labour Party's fighting fund. There is direct proof of the interestedness of the Labour Party in this measure ! If men can be forced into unions, and those unions forced to become affiliated, and the proposition to which I have referred, is made universal, this 6d. per head per compulsory recruit will become available for the organization and political expenses of honorable members who are now supporting this Bill. </para>

                    <para>Mr.KELLY. - As I was saying, the inclination of the Labour Party received a check during the course of the Arbitration Bill.Honorable members saw that if, as a result of that measure, men were forced into unions, at least their individual liberty should be safeguarded - that no man should be compelled to join a union, the rules of which were oppressive, or made him sacrifice his political opinions or contribute to funds to be devoted to objects outside those of an ordinary trades union. These were the two points to which this House subscribed its signature. That Act provides that a union, the rules of which are burdensome or oppressive, or do not provide reasonable conditions for admission to and continuance in membership, shall not be entitled to ask for preference, and further that no organization shall be entitled to appear before the Court, so long as its rules, or other binding decisions, . permit the application of its funds to political purposes, or require its members to do anything of a political character. That was laid down as a definite principle by this House. Honorable members discovered that, even though that were not its object, the main result of that Bill would be to force men into unions, and the House insisted that at least the unions, which men would be forced to join, should not contain in their rules any of those objectionable provisions. </para>

We know that the result of this measure will be the same as that which it was contended would be the result of the provisions proposed in the Arbitration and Conciliation Bill. We know that the result of this measure will be to force men into unions. There is no use. trying to disguise the fact, or to burke the issue - men will be forced into unions under the provisions of this Bill. This House knew that, as the result of the preference clauses of the Arbitration and Conciliation Bill, men would be forced into unions, and it took definite action with regard to that Bill, and laid down the definite principle to which I have just referred. Will not the House apply the same principle to this measure ? </para>

                            <para>- I am referring to every applicant for a union trade mark. No honorable member will contend that the object of an ordinary trade mark is to effect a boycott. It is only to give a value to the consumer. I have proved that the object of the proposed union label provisions in this Bill is not to give a value to the consumer, and that their effect would be to force men into unions. That being the case, why should we not say that these unions shall be governed by the same rules as those which we have already laid clown in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act? </para>

                            <para>- I would regulate that by an ordinary anti-trust Bill, which I hope will be introduced in this Chamber. But this sort of -business, introducing legislation providing for interference with trade in a measure which has nothing whatever to do with such proposals, is not honest, as it does not give people outside an opportunity to know what those who propose such legislation have really in view. If honorable members would bring such a measure forward, to be dealt with on its own merits, the case would be different. Of course, I should be against it then, as I am against anything that would provide for a boycott. But if, on the other hand, Ministers would bring forward measures to prevent undue interference with or hindrance to trade, I should be prepared to support those measures, provided they are not drafted in a way which is calculated to defeat the object I desire to attain. Honorable members have told us, during the course of the debate, that it is essential that some such provision as the one which I have just outlined should be included as a safeguard in this measure. The honorable member for Bland made art interjection during the course of the debate, and I should like the attention of the honorable member while I refer to it.  </para>

                            <para>- Now the honorable gentleman can go on with his conversation. During the honorable gentleman's speech he made that statement in reply to an interjection. The . honorable gentleman has admitted the necessity of keeping the unions free from any outside object. The object of legitimate trade unionism is not necessarily political, and these unions should be kept free from political objects. The honorable member for Moira also again reiterated his determination to in no way depart from the principle laid down by this House. Honorable members have already voted on a somewhat similar provision, and, according to the official division lists of this Chamber, I find that the honorable and learned member for Ballarat voted for the principle I have just announced. The honorable member for Richmond, at present Vice-President of the Executive Council, also affixed his signature to that principle. The right honorable member for Swan also adopted that principle. The honorable members for Mernda, Moira, Echuca, Wimmera, and the honorable and learned member for Bendigo, also affixed their signatures to that principle, as well as honorable members on this side of the House. I think I am justified in asking, what 1 think their constituents and the people of Australia will ask, whether, if it is necessary to regulate these things in one Bill, it is not necessary to regulate them in another similar one? Honorable members may say that matters have now changed, and they are under the whip, and cannot help themselves. </para>

                            <para>- It is the only explanation there can possibly be for any change of opinion on so vital a question. Honorable members may urge that that would be some reason for a change of opinion, but I put it to them that in this House, from its very inception, it has always been understood that, if an honorable member once gives a vote in a certain direction, no new arrangement of parties is to be considered a sufficient reason for departure from the vote previously recorded. Certain questions are always treated as non-party questions. We know that in the present Ministry there are several gentlemen who voted, on the occasion to which I referred, against the insertion of any safeguard, and those honorable gentlemen cannot be expected to go back on their original position. But the honorable gentlemen I have mentioned have put their signature to the expression of a principle, and in the pages of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> they are wedded to that principle; and if they now depart from it, there can be absolutely no reason advanced except a most ignoble love of office, and a most ignoble fear of the whip which is constantly held over them. </para>

                            <para>- I have a lot to learn yet if I must learn that I must stand in this House and refrain from expressing my contempt for such departures from principle. I know that some of the honorable members I have enumerated will not. vote with the Government upon this matter, but I hope that all of them will stand firm to the votes they previously gave, and agree that -these provisions are opposed to the principle which they have approved. I have endeavoured to show that there is a similarity between the situation brought about by the present proposal and that evolved by the discussion on the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. I have shown, further, that the anxiety to introduce the union label by means of this measure was not evinced until in another place provisions had been inserted in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill for the regulation of unions. I now propose <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> show that unless Parliament again stands to the principle it has already laid down, and makes sure that no union which may be formed, as the result of this union label proposal, shall transgress the rules sanctioned by the Arbitration Court, new unions of a political character will spring into existence to do the recruiting for my honorable friends on the cross-benches. If non-unionists are to be compelled by means of the boycott to join unions, I think it will be admitted, even by those on the cross-benches, that entrance to and membership of unions should be made as easy as possible. Unless non-unionists are to be compelled to enter unions for the benefit of the socialistic leagues, these provisions, which allow non-unionists to be coerced by being forced into unions to adopt politics which may be foreign to their views, should surely be safeguarded. The rules of unions may very easily be made offensive to men who treasure the liberty of the subject. 1 do not propose to go far and wide in search of anomalies, but I should like to read three of the rules of the Sydney Wharf Labourers' Union, which is one of the largest unions in the city from which I have the honour to come. The entrance-fee to be paid on joining that union is 10s., and the annual subscription another ios., so that a man who sought to enter it to earn a day's work would be compelled to pay <inline font-style="italic">j£i</inline> for the privilege. That, however, is not the point which I wish to make by quoting these rules. This is the first rule to which I wish to direct attention : - </para>

                        <para>If any member shall at any meeting bring :t forward a proposition tending to destroy or break the aforesaid union, or should any member persuade or seduce others to join a conspiracy for such purpose, those who are thus tempted shall report the same to the committee of management, who shall investigate the matter, and on proof to their satisfaction of such conspiracy, they shall award such punishment as they may consider necessary. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That rule obviously places an enormous power in the hands of the committee of management, because they are the final and absolute arbiters. If they choose to say that anything that has been done has been done against the interests of the union, the offender may be dealt with as they think fit. To illustrate the effect of such a rule, let me ask honorable members to consider what would have been a similar position if, at the beginning of this session, the late Government had been in the position of this committee of management. Any member bringing forward " a proposition tending to destroy or break the" late coalition - the "aforesaid union " - or to " persuade or seduce others to join a conspiracy for such purpose " would at once have been liable to be dealt with at the absolute discretion of the late Administration ! Another rule, which might very easily militate against the joining of unions by non-unionists - because non-unionists probably have friends who are also non-unionists, and do not wish to join unions - is this : - </para>

                        <para>If any member shall at any meeting bring fortion which may lend to injure the union, or conveying information, or causing to be conveyed any information, either verbally or otherwise, or acting as an accessory, if found guilty by a majority of the committee of management, such person or persons shall be expelled for all time from the union. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">In other words, a man is to have no opportunity to earn a livelihood if, in the opinion of the committee of management, he has been guilty of the rather slight offence of " imparting information." That is a rule which is oppressive, and Parliament should not pass a law which would have the effect of compelling men to join a union governed by such a rule. To give other instances of union oppression, it is well known that the Australian Workers' Union runs a strong and influential newspaper. This union, as every one knows, supports a distinct part\ in politics, and the newspaper is a partisan organ of the most pronounced type. The offices in Sydney into which it has just moved are such as the most capitalistic press might envy, and, if we pass the legislation now proposed, it may obtain compulsory subscriptions from men who maybe definitely opposed to the views published by it. Before passing a measure which will inevitably have the effect of compelling men to join unions, we should endeavour to insure that the unions shall not use these compulsory recruits oppressively. There will be no difficulty about the enforcement of such limitations. Honorable members know that the Arbitration Court has power to enforce the provisions in the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act governing unions. Honorable members on the cross-benches told us while that Bill was under discussion ]that ;the difficulty of forming new unions is almost insurmountable. If that statement was correct, no new unions will be formed, and the limitations which I should like to see placed on the existing unions, which will benefit by this legislation, will not press hardly upon any one, since they already weigh on every existing union. But, if honorable members on the cross-benches were only characteristically specious on the occasion to which I refer, it will be clear that, unless we insert the provision which I wish to see inserted in this Bill, the measure will be used in opposition to the provisions of the </para>
                    <para>Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, and I do not think that Parliament should stultify itself by allowing such a position to arise. - </para>

                            <para>- I prove it in this way : The agitation for the registration of union labels did not arise until the unions, which honorable members opposite hoped to see augmented by the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act, were made politically non-oppressive to those compelled to join them. That provision did away with the Labour Party conspiracy in regard to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. Now, under that Act, a unionist cannot be compelled to vote for a member of the Labour Party, or to subscribe funds for the organization or propaganda of the party. Therefore it has become necessary to introduce a new measure compelling people into new unions, and this measure is being used for the purpose. I prophesy that under it new unions will be formed outside the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, having political objects, advocating" definite political principles, and supporting definite political parties. New subscriptions will flow into the exchequer of the Labour Party, and honorable members will have been hoodwinked into making paramount the Labour Party, which will then be able to get along without the assistance of their present allies. Since these proposals are not made in the interests of the consumers, or in order to forward the legitimate objects of the manufacturers, we should inquire closely into the uses to which militant unionists might put them. They would refuse to buy any article unless it bore the union label. They would next refuse to deal with any one unless all the articles he sold were similarly marked. I would ask, first, whether that would be possible, and, secondly, how it would affect trade? In the first place it is clear that the vast majority of articles cannot be guaranteed as completely made by union labour alone. Honorable members of the Labour Party seem to think that a coat or any article of clothing or food, or any commodity of ordinary use, can be so guaranteed. Take the average article that is made from a raw product. It would not be possible to guarantee that the raw product was produced by union labour, because even the members of the Labour Party are not sufficiently versed in the mysteries of creation to permit of their doing any such thing. I think we may safely say that no one could guarantee that a coat .was 'madethroughout by union labour. In this connexion, I desire to quote from an excellent publication by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Max</inline> Hirsch called <inline font-style="italic">An Exposure of Socialism,</inline> which is one of the best contributions on the subject I have read. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Max</inline> Hirsch takes the case of the coat, mentioned earlier in this debate, and says - </para>

                        <para>Take, for instance, this coat which I am wearing. In order to produce -it, some men had tc« clear land and rear sheep; another group of men had to .shear the sheep ; another group had to clean the wool; still another group had to dye the yarn ; yet another had to weave the yarn, into cloth ; and still another group had to fashion, the cloth into a coat. Simultaneously with these activities, another group of men had to collect horns, and another had to fashion these into buttons; another group had to plant and tend cotton bushes ; still another had to collect the cotton ;. another had to spin the cotton into yarn; another had to weave the yarn into cloth; and: still another had to dye the cloth, in order that, there should be lining for the coat. At the same time another group of men had to plant and' tend mulberry trees; another had to rear silkworms, collect the cocoons and unravel them; another group had to spin the silk into thread ; and still another had to dye the thread in order that the coat may be sewn together. Antecedent to all the activities so far mentioned, other groups of men had each to mine ore, coal, and flux, in order that another group might smelt these materials into iron ; while other groups, spread all over the earth, and far too numerous to number, had to fashion the iron into all the many tools and machines which were required' for the many different activities mentioned. Also antecedently, other groups of men had to cut down trees, and still others had to cut the trees into planks; others had to quarry slate, and still others had to cut it into shape; still others had to dig clay, and' still others had to bake the clay into bricks, in order that yet other groups of men might form these materials into factories, warehouses, and' dwelling houses. Even this does not exhaust the process. In order that all these various materials, originating in different parts of the world, might be brought to the places where they could be most conveniently transformed, many different groups of nien had to act as carters, sailors, and railway men. Antecedent again to their rendering these services, thousands of different groups had to perform the manifold processes which resulted in the production of carts, ships, and railways. Yet other groups of men, intervening at every stage of all these processes, had, as bankers, brokers, merchants, and storekeepers, to co-ordinate all these activities. And' finally, in order that all these many thousand' different groups of men could direct their energies each to his special task, thousands upon thousands of other groups, also spread over the whole earth, had to direct their energies to the production of the many different kinds of food? and other things which the former wanted. </para>

                    <para class="block">J would ask honorable members on the Ministerial cross benches how it would be possible to insure, as must be insured in -order to comply with the provisions of the Bill, that every part of a coat which was decorated with a union label was made wholly by union labour ? If that were difficult would not the obstacles be even greater in the case of an ordinary article of merchandise? That brings me to another point, namely, how the proposed provision would affect trade. It is obvious that even if we were able, in a rough and ready way, without carrying out the letter of the Bill,' to affix union labels to certain articles made in Australia, it would be absolutely impossible to guarantee that an imported article had been made by union labour in that part of the world from which it was imported. This would have the effect of at once placing the imported goods at a serious disadvantage. </para>

                            <para>- Now I come "to a point to which the remark of the honorable member has given me the cue. We know that in Chicago a conspiracy was entered into between employers and employes, at the instance of a walking delegate named Sam Parkes, to defraud the consumers. The employes were to be paid certain1 rates ot wages, and the employers were to recoup themselves by charging more to the consumers. There was to be a definite combine amongst the employers as well as : amongst the employes, and the two were to co-operate to defraud the consumers. Does the honorable member for Melbourne Ports mean to tell me that such an argument will be secretly used with manufacturers, in order to secure their support for this proposal ? Does he mean to say that "the manufacturers will willingly support this scheme, which they know will have a bad effect, and lead to a depreciation of the standard of value, because it will militate against the import trade. </para>

                            <para>- I have been waiting to hear words of wisdom from the corner in which the honorable member sits for a long time, but I have waited in vain. Honorable members will at once recognise that a man in my position - returned as I was by a free-trade constituency - must definitely oppose this principle upon that issue alone. At the same time, I do not think that the protectionist members of this House need necessarily support it, because I credit them with a desire merely to regulate the import trade. They do not Wish absolutely to kill it. I believe that they wish to regulate it in an honest open way. </para>

                            <para>- So would everybody else, if those articles could be made here at a profit to Australia. In conclusion, I should like to remind honorable members opposite that they will be asked at the next general election to explain - if the votes they will shortly give will call for any explanation - why they have changed their opinions, why they have dishonoured a bond which they signed in this Chamber when they subscribed their signatures to the principle which has been embodied in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The principle contained in this Bill is identical with that which has been laid down in the statute to which I have referred, and for that reason when we reach the Committee stage I shall ask honorable members to again affirm that no union shall be allowed to register a label unless its rules are such that it cannot be said of them that they are burdensome or oppressive, or that they do not provide reasonable conditions for the admission to or continuance of membership, or that they permit of the application of their funds to political purposes, or require their members to do anything of a political character. Nine honorable members who support the present Government have appended their signatures to that principle, as recorded upon the pages of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I say that, not only this House, but the country, will expect them to stand to the convictions which they then expressed. </para>

                            <para>- I dare say that it is, judged by the statements which have been made upon this subject by the honorable member's leader. I have been at some trouble to try and understand what is the justification in Australia, at any rate, for legislation of this character. I have not heard one honorable member declare that it: is intended to meet any shocking state of things which obtains here. Neither have I heard anybody allege  that unless this Bill be passed, some dire consequences will ensue to trade unionism - consequences of a character calculated to undermine it or to bring injury to its organization in any shape or form. In fact, there has been no tittle of justification for the measure, except a general statement by the leader of the Labour Party. </para>

                            <para>- I should have thought that the Attorney-General, who proposes to amend the whole of these provisions - and who, therefore, approves of their principles - would have been the first to attempt some defence of them, and that he would have been followed by the leader of the Labour Party. Instead of that, both of the honorable gentlemen to whom I have referred confine themselves to criticising any utterances which may be made from this side of the Chamber. The result is that, after a long debate, no attempt has been made to show that the condition of things obtaining in Australia justifies the adoption of these proposals. In reply to that argument, I am. told by the leader of the Labour Party that it is not for them to justify such proposals - that they have merely to throw them on the table of the House, and that it is for those who are opposed to them to advance reasons for their opposition. I venture to sa.v that that is a new doctrine in regard to legislation. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member must be very ignorant of the past or he would not have made that remark. The justification of these proposals so far is that they will stop sweating, and will insure that fair wages and good sanitary conditions obtain in the manufacture of goods to which the union label is attached. I wish to say that that label of itself will furnish not the slightest guarantee against sweating. The fact that an article is made by a trade union is not necessarily a guarantee against sweating. If the honorable member knows anything about trade unionism, he will be aware that, in spite of all that trade unions can do, a great deal of sweating unfortunately goes on in many of the industrial occupations of Australia. That is to be regretted. I take it that no honorable member believes in sweating, and I tell the honorable member for Bland that I am afraid the trade union label provisions of the Bill will not abolish that evil. I hardly think they will even touch the fringe of the great question as to the conditions which make sweating seemingly an institution of our time. If I could believe that they would abolish sweating in the manufacture of goods, I should hold up both hands for them, notwithstanding what other consequences might arise from such legislation. </para>

                            <para>- I am open to conviction, if the honorable member will bring forward his facts ; but mere statements are not necessarily proofs. In a matter of this kind we need proof of an irrefragable character, rather than the mere utterance of shibboleths. I am tired of hearing honorable members of the Labour Party asserting what this, that, or other proposals will do. I wish them to show how the reforms of which they speak have been brought about where legislation of this kind is in vogue, and how such legislation will abolish sweating, or otherwise improve the conditions of the workers. </para>

                            <para>- There is no reason why a trade union should not put any mark on its products that it pleases ; but I do not know that that presupposes the right to compel the Legislature to deal in its statutes with the possibilities which inhere to a trade union label. I intend to show that the proposal is totally unnecessary, and may prove an injury instead of a benefit to the people for whom it is intended. I take it that a trade mark is first and foremost a guarantee of quality, and as such we have surrounded it with legislative authority and protection, so as to encourage the production of quality in articles of merchandise. In other words, we give a. man this protection because we believe it will be on the one hand a guarantee to the people that they are getting the good articles for which they pay, and that on the other it may encourage the maker of those articles for consumption to acquire a reputation for a good instead of an indifferent product. By this means we are doing that which we do in many other ways, and that which I think should be the guiding principle of all our legislation - we are seeking to make it easier for people to do the right thing than it is to do the wrong. Trade marks, therefore, are in their very essence a guarantee of the quality of the goods on which they are placed. But no guarantee of quality is conveyed by the mere placing of a trade union label on an article. </para>

                            <para>- I am speaking, not of the abuses which occur, but of the intention of the legislation relating to trade marks, and of that for which it stands. A trade union label gives no guarantee of the quality of the goods or the -product on which it is placed. It may stand for reasonable working conditions - I firmly believe that it is intended to give that guarantee - but that is quite a different object from that of a trade mark. A trade mark gives no certificate as to the conditions under which goods are produced. It does not show whether goods are produced under sweating or wholesome sanitary conditions, but merely sets up a standard of quality and protects that standard to the benefit of the consumer, as well as of those who observe it. At "the best the only guarantee that a trade union label affords is that the goods on which it is placed have been made under trade union conditions as to wages and hours of employment. I wish to say as plainly as I can that, unless a trade union label gives some guarantee of the quality of the product on which it is placed, we ought not to go to the extent of enshrining a provision of this kind in the statute-book of the' Commonwealth. I 'think that the honorable member for Newcastle has already said, by way of interjection, that the working classes would be more likely than others to buy goods that bore a trade union label. I very much question whether they would, if higher prices were charged, particularly if there were no such coercion in the matter as has taken place in the United States. </para>

                            <para>- I take it that we are bound to accept the statements to which I have referred as having been written by purely impartial writers. The honorable member for Bland said a day or two ago that there were twenty-eight States in the Union in which the trade union label system obtained. I read only to-day, however, that that statement was quite wide of the mark, and mat the system was not in operation in anything like that number of States. Thus, if authorities quoted from time to time are to be impeached, I do not think we shall get any nearer a solution of our difficulties ; the only result will be to perpetuate the debate, and make it all the more indefinite. So far as I am aware, there is no guarantee that the people would prefer to buy goods at \i higher price, bearing a trade union label, particularly in the absence of a guarantee of quality. I go further, and say that I do not think that a trade unionist, or any other free man, ought to be coerced to purchase goods of an inferior quality, no matter how or by what means they have been produced. Once you apply any kind of coercion, either through a union, or in any other way, to enforce the purchase of goods of a less value than can be got in the open market, that moment you reduce wages. </para>

The honorable member for Newcastle 'says that union people will be bound to buy labelled goods, rather than others, even if they be inferior goods. If you, by any sort of coercion, compel unionists to buy inferior goods, no matter how they are made, that means a reduction of their purchasing power j_ in other words, it is equivalent to a reduction of their wages. </para>

An honorable member on the other side questioned my remark that there is a conflict of opinion on almost every statement made here, and I quoted that as an instance in point. Really, the honorable member need not go to all this trouble. I want more than a mere statement from honorable members who support this legislation that it will be of a beneficial character. </para>

                            <para>- At any rate, the argument has not been advanced here. From that fact, Ave may infer that it cannot be brought forward. But if it can be adduced, the proof to the contrary is irrefragable and abundant. My point is, that in Australia there is no need for "legislation of this kind, and that if it be enacted very likely it will hit the very people whom honorable members are trying to shield from the competition of the world. </para>

It would be much better for honorable members to do that than to sit on a bench and interject objections to what I am saying. If these proofs are abundant, why are they not supplied? So far as I know, no argument has been advanced here to-night, or at any time to show that this legislation will be of a beneficial character. I am free <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> admit, however, that, if it can be shown to me that it will advantage the workers of the country in any way, I shall be very glad to give it mv best support. I was pointing out when interrupted that if you legalize the labelling of goods which may be inferior in quality, for the purpose of inducing trade unionists to buy them in preference to others, by the very fact that they are inferior you will force a reduction of wages upon those who have only a certain amount of money to spend. </para>

                            <para>- It was made up by factory labour, I presume. The cost of making up was the same in each case, but the article produced was very much inferior in one case, because an inferior cloth had been supplied. In other words, it cost the same to make up bad cloth as good cloth. </para>

                            <para>- I apprehend that it would apply to the whole product, if the cloth had passed through union hands in the making up. But, supposing that the label applied to only the working up of the cloth, I presume that there would be another label for the cloth itself. Cloth may be made by union labour, and yet be of inferior quality. I have no doubt that, in this instance, the cloth was made by union labour, that is by labour working under the aegis of factory laws. </para>

Will the honorable member for Bland deny that the bulk of the trade organizations of the world to-day are non-political? The best trade organizations on the face of the globe refuse to associate themselves with leagues of this kind. </para>

                            <para>- It is political action, but it is keeping the power of politics outside of union matters; because they say that they can secure more by voluntary co-operation than by preference, or com- pulsoriness of any kind - certainly more than by means of the legislative machine. </para>

                            <para>- They are saying it to-day. The honorable member will find, moreover, that the unions in the old country are quite divided as yet as to the advisableness of going into the political arena ; I mean, of course, in any such sense as they have done here. And surely a man can express sympathy with trade unionism even though he does not believe in the Poli.ticalization of the unions to the extent that has taken place here. I am one of those who do not hesitate to say that I believe that the making of these labour leagues political in Australia has not done them any good. </para>

                            <para>- Of course; they vote for the honorable member for Newcastle, not because he is a political labour leaguer, but because they believe that he is in sympathy with their aims. But he is aware that his organizations will not allow themselves to be dominated in any case from Sydney. It is very different with the union represented by the honorable member for Darling. That is a political organization. But the miners in New South Wales for the most part decline to make their unions political organizations. When that is the case, even in Australia, and over a very much wider area of the world outside, I think that a man may express his opinion in favour of trade unions and yet disbelieve in their being made political organizations. That, I understand, is the attitude of the right honorable member for East Sydney. It is mine, and always has been. I have yet to see what good has come to any of the trade organizations in Australia since they have been made into political machines. I do not think, either, that trade unions in their proper character are merely machines for getting better wages, or for making better sanitary conditions. They have a very much wider import even than that. My impression of trade unionism properly conducted on a voluntary basis, is that it displays many of those qualities of character which conduce to the wellbeing of the State, and are in every way good as applied to the industrial activities, and to the socialities of life. I do not believe in political trade organizations, because, in my opinion, no good has come from them up to date. </para>

                            <para>- Did they? If so, they did an unnecessary thing.' I do not know that the granting of that principle by any Statute will add one iota to the power they already possess. It is quite unnecessary for' them' to ask any one for the power which they have been exercising for hundreds of years in the coal mining operations of the old country. That is my point. I say that those unions could be made to work on a voluntary basis ; and the best results are achieved by them when they are so worked. That is' easily provable to-day, in hard cash if need be, should the test be made. Since trade unionists began to make trade unions political labour leagues, they have concurrently developed the idea that the capitalist is necessarily the enemy of labour, and must be abolished; and that is where I take leave of my friends who believe in the new unionism. My idea of a trade union is that it should aim as far as possible at the adjustment of labour and capital, which are the two halves of the same sphere. But, on the other hand, politicians are developing the doctrine more and more every day that capital is the natural enemy of labour, and must be abolished before labour can be said to have its rights. I do not take that view at all, and that is where I part company with my friends, who believe in developing unions on those lines, instead of developing them on a basis of voluntarism, which aims at the adjustment of the differences, between the two essential factors in our industrial production. Are the conditions of labour any better to-day than they were when this kind of political trade unionism began? Are wages higher? </para>

                            <para>- On the other hand, I think that in some respects things are very much worse than before. There is worse feeling between capital and labour today than I have ever known in all my experience; and my honorable friends opposite may develop that class feeling as much as they like, but it is going to bring no good to either of the factors engaged in industrial activity. We want less of class feeling instead of more; but it is the very aim and purpose of the labour league propaganda to cultivate what is called " class consciousness, ' ' which is only another name for class hatred, aiming at abolishing the capitalist and sweeping him altogether from the industrial arena. A bitter reckoning is in store for people who undertake that kind of propaganda. It prevents the settlement of many of those troubles which arise in the relationship of the two factors, and instead of settling them in a way which leads to amicability of feeling - which leads to mutual sympathy, mutual trust, mutual co-operation - it is separating further and further those two factors which are the very essence of the well-being of the community. </para>

                            <para>- And how that strong feeling can bode any good to the industrial workers of Australia, I have yet to learn. The new unionists say that "class consciousness ' ' must go on until capital has been eliminated from the industrial sphere. All I can say is that those who support that view have " a big contract on ' ' - a contract which I venture to say will only re-act on the worker, and cause intense suffering before this folly is knocked on the head. I remember voting for, the Arbitration Bill in New South Wales - a Bill for which I not only voted, but worked. First of all, we did not believe in compulsory arbitration, and tried voluntary methods. It was deemed, however, that there should be a compulsory Bill, and in voting for that measure I honestly believed that I was doing something to establish amicable relations between the contending parties, and said so. But what has been our experience of the New South Wales Arbitration Act ? Instead of bringing the two parties nearer, it has driven a wedge in between them; and feeling to-day in New South Wales, under that Act, is much more intense than it has ever been before in the industrial history of that State. These are facts which cannot be denied, though I presume my honorable friends opposite would regard this estrangement as a good sign, </para>

                            <para>- I am pointing out a case in which voluntary action was taken, over some years, and I say, without fear of contradiction, that the results of that system, as applied to the coal trade, were very much better than the results of the Arbitration Court. If trade unionism wants to advertise its wares in the direction indicated by this label it has abundance of opportunity to do so. Trade unions to-day have newspapers; and other means of thorough organization such as they never had before. When I take up the industrial newspapers of the Commonwealth I find them filled with advertisements of one kind and another. To-day, I was looking at the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Worker</inline> - an organ in which the honorable member for Darling is very keenly interested - and I find that there is not the slightest difficulty in advertising unionistic wares and unionistic conditions. The signature of that honorable member is appended to an agreement showing the conditions which obtain in the industry he particularly represents, and I also find advertisements relating to unionist hotelkeepers who are scattered throughout the country. I was very much surprised to find on one page of that newspaper about 120 advertisements of hotels, showing where the union hotels were, where union liquor was to be obtained, and where unionist accommodation was to be found. So that there appears to be no reason why we should come to Parliament to ask for these privileges, seeing that unionists have all the opportunities for self-advertisement that they can possibly desire. I contend that we ought not to come here to ask for special powers by legislation, without making out a case showing the absolute necessity for doing so. The honorable member for Bland, when arguing these matters, has acquired the knack lately - and it is a very cunning thing to do - of quoting the opinions of clerics in various parts of the world in favour of the theory he may happen to be propounding. The honorable gentleman never by any mischance stumbles upon a quotation which is against him, but he is very fond of quoting clergymen in support of his socialistic propaganda. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member may doubt it, if it pleases him to do so. I do not want his certificate anyhow, so that he can keep his doubts to himself, and allow me to proceed. I say that I doubt the wisdom of the means which some trade unionists are pursuing in Australia in turning unions into political camps. I say that, in my judgment, the condition of affairs to date furnishes no warrant for the new departure, but rather furnishes reasons for getting back to the sound, sane, and healthy conditions of the past in this respect. The honorable member for Bland the other night quoted Canon Scott Holland, who happened to say that it would be to our advantage if we made greater inquiry into the conditions under which the articles we purchased were produced. The honorable member quoted the Canon with a very great deal of approval, but if equally eminent clerics happen to say a word against Socialism, honorable members of the Labour Party are down upon them in fine style. They denounce them hip and thigh for what they believe to be everything that is bad. I could not help casting my mind back to a diatribe uttered the other day by a great friend of the honorable member's against the Bishop of Goulburn, and all because he dared to have an opinion as to the methods of the labour leagues of to-day. The Bishop of Goulburn is a gentleman whose sympathy with all that makes for our social welfare no one will attempt to question. But the trouble with this propaganda today is that it is an unreasoning propaganda. One must not only believe in the ultimate aims and objects of the Labour Party, but also in their methods. If you dare to have a different opinion, if you dare to exercise the liberty to differ from them, you are a traitor and everything( else that is bad. I suppose that is the kind of liberty we shall have when we get into that glorious socialistic state into which some honorable members wish to hurry us. I am not taking any of that kind of liberty. I prefer the liberty I have rather than to be dragooned in such a way as to destroy the value of my private intellect and judgment to me. But the honorable member for Bland quoted that merely harmless statement from Canon Scott-Holland, and it is a statement with which any one might agree; . 1 subscribe to it to the full, and I say that we ought to inquire as to where goods are made, and, as far as possible, purchase goods that are made under fair conditions. Every man ought to do that. </para>

The honorable member for Bland admitted that the trade unionism of America is of a totally different type from the trade unionism of Australia. They have not gone into the political arena there yet, and they are doing by other means in America, what we already have the means of doing throughout the length and breadth of Australia. For instance, John Graham Brooks says that the trade union label "means or aims to mean that the work is done under wholesome conditions." What are our Arbitration Acts or our Wages Boards for, but to give this verv guarantee. Is that not what they aim at? </para>

                            <para>- I rise to a point of order. I have no desire to interrupt the honorable member for Parramatta, but it appears to me that his remarks are hardly in order. I understand that the matter before the House is the consideration of the second reading of the Trade Marks Bill, but the honorable member is branching off into several interesting dissertations on the methods of the Labour Party, and particularly on those of the Labour Party in South Australia, and is' lamenting that the Government or the Labour Party have or have not done this, that, or the other. In my opinion, such remarks are not in order. If they are, I do not see what limitations are to be imposed on the debate. If we are to follow the methods of the honorable gentleman's party and other parties - there are very many parties here ; nothing but parties, in fact - the debate will have no natural limitations at all. </para>

                            <para>- The point which the honorable and learned member has asked me to determine is whether the honorable member for Parramatta is in order in discussing the existence or non-existence of Wages Boards in the various States. As the honorable member has set up the argument that the existence of Wages Boards enables the discrimination to be exercised which is sought in the Bill by providing for the registration of the union trade mark, I think his observations are perfectly in order. Whilst I ask him not to enter into a dialogue with other honorable members, and ask them not to inaugurate such a dialogue, I cannot rule him out of order, so long as he follows his present line of discussion. </para>

                            <para>- I am pointing out that the condition of things here is totally different from the condition of things in America. The object which was first sought to be attained by the use of union labels in America, namely, the getting of work done under wholesome conditions, can be guaranteed by the various tribunals which have been set up in all the States of Australia except two. There is nothing to prevent those States from setting up such tribunals, and in Queensland the Government have made it part of their policy to pass such' legislation. Other objects are to insure the payment of reasonable wages and the enforcement of reasonable hours of work, both of which come within the province of our Arbitration Courts and Wages Boards. The honorable and learned member for West Sydney on almost every day that he is absent from this House, is engaged in arguing om behalf of such things, and making money out of it, more power to him, in the New South Wales Arbitration Court. He is engaged in seeking for the Court the aid which, it is alleged, can be secured in America only by the use of trade union labels. If, then, we already have legislative machinery which compasses all the ends which are set out as the objective of the trade union label in America, the provisions of the Bill, though perhaps necessary in that' country, are not necessary here. We have taken other means to get rid of our labour difficulties, and to set up and proclaim to the world the conditions under which our goods must be made. If my honorable friends wish to guarantee to the public that the goods which it buys are made under fair conditions, all they have to do is to remind it that they have been made by the members of the unions registered in the various States. I have yet to learn what advantages, in addition to those which they already enjoy, would come to our industrial toilers if the proposed legislation were passed. At the best it would overlap other legislation already on the statute-book, and I believe that its ultimate result would be detrimental to those who are now asking for it. If I understand the proposals of the Minister aright, he intends to throw upon the&gt; trade organizations the obligation and responsibility of policing this legislation; that is to say, if action is to be taken to defend! these trade union labels, it must be taken by the unions. Will any one tell me that this legislation will not provoke great bitterness between 'employers and employes? The position is already bad enough, but it will become much worse. There will be constant attempts at the infraction of the law, and the unions will find it a much- more costly proceeding to defend the labels than is the litigation in "the Arbitration) Courts of the various States, which, as is well known, has depleted their funds. Whatever advantages may have accrued from the setting up of these Courts, no one will deny that they are costly pieces of legal machinery.. </para>

                    <para class="block">To pass the Bill is to multiply Statutes without giving any advantage in the process. I presume that the measure is part of the socialistic propaganda, the uttering of a socialistic shibboleth ; but, instead of bringing gain to the workers, it will land them in further difficulties, and will still more estrange them from the employing section of the community. The leader of the Government said at Ballarat that every socialistic proposal must be treated by itself as a business proposition. I suppose that we may regard this proposal in that way, and that the Bonus Bill, which is now turned into a socialistic measure, may also be considered by itself as a business proposition. Then there is the Commerce Bill, which proposes to control in great part, and to limit the trade operations of Australia. That must also be treated by itself as a different proposition. On our business-paper, we have also two proposals of a socialistic character - one for an inquiry as to the advisability of running socialistic ships to carry our mails to the older countries of the world, and the other, in the name of the honorable member for Melbourne, for socializing the iron industry of Australia. According to the Prime Minister, each of these proposals must be treated by itself as a business proposition. </para>

We have a right to consider these proposals together, as well as separately. The proposals in themselves are of the very essence of Socialism, and, taken together, I venture to say make a very serious inroad upon our industrial situation, and go very far towards bringing about that co-operative Commonwealth which it is the aim of the Socialists to. inaugurate. In the meantime there is no hurry. The policy is a gradual one. We are asked to treat each proposal by itself, and not as inter-related to the industrial situation in which we find ourselves. We are to detach it and to discuss it by itself, and pay no regard to its tendencies, or to the fact that, it is a step leading us anywhere. We are to treat it merely as a business proposal. That is the sinister suggestion of the Prime Minister. </para>

                            <para>- It may be, from the honorable member's point of view, but not from mine. The more I read, and the more I observe that which is around me, the more difficult it becomes for me to believe that Socialism is going to bring about the millennium that its devotees expect. If I could believe that, I should hold up both hands for Socialism, as readily and as cordially as its supporters do. I believe it will develop into an engine of tyranny, and that the people who will suffer most will be those who are loudest in the expression of a desire to hurry into it. I believe that the toilers of Australia will eventually suffer most from these rash proposals, and therefore I have to take my stand in opposition to the socialistic propaganda as a whole. I say that these proposals, taken together, mark a very formidable socialistic advance, and that this House should pause before it treats them in a detached and isolated fashion as has been insinuatingly suggested by the Prime Minister. In the meantime, there is no hurry. I am reminded of the man who went to buy a horse, and said that he was not particular about the speed of the animal, but that it must be gentle. In the same way, the Prime Minister and those joined with him in bringing about this socialistic <inline font-style="italic">regime</inline> are in no particular hurry ; they do not expect to see the full results of their efforts during their lifetime. They are simply building another rung into the ladder. </para>

What labour members are seeking is already to their hand in the agencies which exist in the various </para>

The multiplication of such agencies will involve over-lapping legislation and costly litigation, but no good result to the trade unionists of Australia. In the meantime, it will help to destroy that confidence which is becoming more and more necessary in the complexities of our modern civilization and. industrialism - that confidence which is the very basis of a prosperous social state. It will destroy that confidence, and in its place create a stronger class prejudice, which will deal a blow at that good feeling which ought to subsist between capital and labour, and, I believe, will make more solid the forces which are directed to disintegration and decay. </para></speech>

                            <para>- That is a matter of opinion. We were asked exactly the same questions as those submitted by the honorable member for Parramatta when the Wages Boards, regarding which my honorable friend had so much to say, were proposed. We were asked to give some guarantee of their usefulness, and to indicate what they were going to accomplish. We were told that they would cause increased class feeling, that they would widen the breach between employer and employe, that they would fail to bring about an increase of wages, and that the great natural law of supply and demand alone could accomplish the latter result. Even that extreme conservative, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Irvine,</inline> has, however, admitted in the Victorian Legislature that in this respect he was mistaken, that the Wages Boards have raised wages, and have considerably improved the lot of the industrial worker. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that any such statement has been made. Unfortunately, a large number of men are out of work, but the honorable member will find that the vast majority of them do not belong to those trades in which Wages Boards operate, but to trades where the unions, if they exist at all, are very weak, and where the men are enjoying that freedom of which we have heard so much from honorable members opposite - the freedom to be unemployed and to starve. </para>

                            <para>- I am sure .that fully two-thirds of the unemployed belong to the building trades or the labouring classes. They do not come from the industrial classes, except in the case of trades which are in open competition with the outside world, and in which the wages are not regulated by Wages Boards. I was remarking that exactly the same arguments as those employed by the honorable member for Parramatta were used when we proposed to adopt the system embodied in the Factories and Shops Act of Victoria. The honorable member for Parramatta has asked whether the conditions of labour are better than they were prior to the time at which the trade unions assumed a political character, and exercised influence in the direction of having their desires expressed in our legislation. So far as Victoria is concerned, I say that; the conditions to-day are better than 'they were at the period indicated. I go further, and I say that there is not a single Wages Board in Victoria which was not in the first place backed up by a trade union. Take the case of the down-, trodden tailoresses as an example. Before we could secure anything like protection to that branch of the trade in the way of a Wages Board, the operatives had to be organized into a union. It was the force of the trade union making itself felt politically that impelled the Government to take action. </para>

They had to do so, in order to retain their seats upon the Ministerial bench. The findings of these boards are infinitely more successful and infinitely more uniformly applied where they are eternally watched by the members and officers of trade unions. </para>

                            <para>- That is not absolutely correct. It is not accurate to say either that the Prime Minister made that declaration or that the statement itself is correct. In the first place, there can be no doubt that the Prime Minister did a very great deal to help forward this class of legislation. He did much more than he has been credited with. I know well that behind the scenes, and in a quiet way, he did a very great deal to helD the Peacock Government to pass the legislation to which I am referring. </para>

                            <para>- Yes; that was prior to the advent of the Labour Party in the Victorian Legislative Assembly. But I would point out that the practical part of that legislation - I mean the portion which relates to the regulation of wages - is of comparatively recent date. It has only been in existence for about ten years. That legislation was passed bv the Turner Government, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Alexander</inline> Peacock was the Chief Secretary. There were only six Wages Boards appointed in the first instance - now there are thirty-one boards in existence. Every one of the trades which were brought under the operation of those boards was backed up by a vigilant trade union, and by officers who were continually watching and working in the interests of its members. The honorable member for Parramatta has asked, " Have these unions improved the status of the operatives. Have they raised their wages"? In reply, I say, " yes." My honorable friend has asked for proof of my assertion. </para>

                            <para>- None of the unions of which I am speaking actually convert themselves into political labour leagues, but every one of them has political aims and aspirations. I say that before trade unions made their influence felt in the Legislative Assembly of Victoria their members were hopeless and helpless. I also claim that the application of their principles has raised wages, shortened hours, and improved conditions generally. I will prove that by quoting from a paper which was read by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pratt,</inline> representing the Employers' Union, before the conference to which I have alluded.

                            <para>- It is the result of organization and agitation on the part of those who were most deeply interested in labour or trade unions. Of course it was not wholly due to them, but it was largely the result of their work and agitation. If they had not organized and appealed to the Legislature - and, indeed, if they did not remain well organized - those findings would not be half as effective as they are at the present moment. </para>

If I had quoted a trade unionist or a Socialist, no doubt he would have questioned the reliability of my authority. Instead, I have quoted the opinion of a gentleman who has always opposed the Factories Act, but who accepts it now as being better than an Arbitration Act - a gentleman who would wipe it off the statute-book to-morrow if he had his way. </para>

                    <para class="block">We never professed that Wages Boards would increase employment beyond the measure in which they reduced the hours of labour. The application of the system to the bakery trade has caused two men to be employed where one was previously engaged. But the fact that wages have risen, that employment has increased, that conditions are infinitely better, disproves the assertion of my honorable friend that trade unions working under political pressure have done no good to the working classes of Victoria. </para>

                            <para>- I am well acquainted with the industrial affairs of Victoria, and rejoice to think that the relations between the vast majority of employers and employed are of the most cordial character. The only cases in which misunderstandings occur and bad feeling exists are those in which the employer is enabled to grind down wages and compel his men to work long hours. Dissatisfaction and discontent are rampant in those cases, and there is naturally a feeling, of bitter hatred ; but where good conditions are observed, fair wages paid, and the employe feels that he is receiving a fair share of the results of his labour, an excellent feeling prevails. I am quite confident that as the Wages Board system is more understood and more widely applied, a still better feeling will prevail. Let me read another remark by the employer from whose evidence I have already quoted : - </para>

                        <para>The members of the board are all experts in their trade. AH intricate questions and technicalities are easily understood ; mistakes and delays are avoided; fresh avenues of trade easily and quickly provided for. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>That is the testimony of a representative employer, and certainly it does not suggest that there is a feeling of discontent or a state of revolution prevailing among those in the trades to which the Wages Boards have been applied. On the contrary, it suggests something like a satisfactory situation. </para>

                            <para>- How are the boards composed? They comprise an equal number of employers and employe's. These men sit round the same table, are fully acquainted with all the wants and disabilities of their trade, readily understand the points that are raised, and trust one another so well that in many cases they come to a unanimous decision. And yet the honorable member for Parramatta has painted as dark a picture as could be painted ; he has advertised that relations between employer and employed in Australia are in a deplorable condition ; that anarchy and bloodshed are looming in the distance ; and that everything relating to industry is in a state of chaos. Where are the indications of anything of the kind ? I believe the honorable member painted the picture in more vivid colours than he intended, and no doubt the enemies of Australia have already dispatched cablegrams to England to the effect that the sub-leader of the Opposition has painted' this picture of confusion, although it is quite contrary to fact. </para>

                            <para>- I assert that they have improved, and have proved that assertion by quoting from the evidence of a representative employer. If they have become worse, where is the evidence? There is certainly none to be obtained in Victoria, and I do not know of any in relation to the other States. We do not hear now of lockouts and strikes, and of innocent women and children being brought by these means to the verge of starvation, wretchedness, and ruin. Such a state of affairs, however, is not unknown in Australian history. </para>

                            <para>- I wish to know what the honorable member means by voluntary trade unions. Unless a voluntary trade union is sufficiently effective to do what he says the Miners' Union has done - to compel every worker to be a trade unionist - of what value is it? If it is strong enough to do that, is it not as valuable as any legislation on the subject could be? It is only the powerless ineffective unions that require legislation. A powerful union which, according to the honorable member, can do exactly the same work and secure the same results as are to be derived from legislation of this kind may be of a voluntary character, but it is doing work that we desire, by means of legislation, to enable unions that are not so powerful to carry out. Take an illustration near to hand. In Victoria there is no Wages Board in the felt hatting trade; but there is something which is just as effectual and good for the purpose of keeping up wages and raising them, and maintaining the supremacy of trade union conditions, and that is voluntary trade unions, sufficiently powerful to compel every worker in the trade to be a trade unionist, and to have the conditions of trade unionism carried out. That is all that is wanted. Legislative enactment is not wanted where voluntary effort is powerful, and can be focussed. When my honorable friend talks about no compulsion, I take it that he means that, from the legislative side, there is no compulsion. From the organization side, there is compulsion which is just as effectual as any legislation could be. </para>

                            <para>- We are told 'that in America, there is not compulsory but voluntary arbitration; but what are the facts? Take the anthracite coal strike. When the President of the United States sent out his ultimatum that unless the trade unionists on the one hand, and the mine owners on the other, went to arbitration within seven days, he would, under the protection of the Federal Army, take possession of the mines, and work them in the interests of the people. Was that voluntary or compulsory arbitration? My honorable friend can call it voluntary arbitration if he likes, but unquestionably it was compulsion of an effective and drastic character which brought about the desired end, compelled arbitration, raised wages, bettered the condition of workers, and gave to the coal-miners of America all that we ask through the political arena should be given to the workers of Australia. Then my honorable friend asks, "As we have Wages Boards in Australia, why do we want a trade union label registered and protected ?" The first answer to his question is that a trade union has as much right to protection for its label and trade mark as any employer or capitalist has to protection for his trade union and trade mark. The answer to the second question is that the Wages Boards and the Arbitration Court have not vet touched the fringe. of our industrial life. They have not yet covered the whole of the industrial sphere, even in </para>

                    <para class="block">Victoria. A large number of manufacturing industries desire to get the benefit of this protection, but they have not yet been able to do so. In Tasmania, Queensland, South' Australia, and Western Australia, there is a large number of industries which are not protected by Wages Boards and industrial legislation, and we wish to apply the union label to their products. We are also asked, what benefit can it do? May I ask in reply, what harm can it do? A very striking illustration of the value of a label - a label not registered, but essentially serving the same purpose as a trade union label - was brought under my notice in Brisbane about two years ago. An enterprising tradesman there put on his slop clothing this label, " These goods are made in Victoria under the conditions prescribed by Wages Boards." He assured me that a large number of the workers in Queensland sent specially for this clothing, because, by the use of that label, they were assured that decent wages were received, and proper conditions enjoyed by those who were making them. </para>

                            <para>- There can be no question that the trade union label, designating as it will the important fact that clothing or footwear was made under proper conditions, in a sanitary building, and by men receiving proper wages, will, to a large extent, attract not only trade unionists but philanthropic men and women, who are anxious to discriminate between sweaters and anarchists and those who work under proper conditions. To show that this proposal does not emanate entirely from trade unionists, let me say that when this agitation was first started in Victoria, the Christian Social Union - a socialistic institution allied to the Church of England - endeavoured, as it was not legal to prepare a black list, to prepare a list of what they called the " white traders " for the purpose of urging on all whom they could influence that it was their duty to go to the shops where they had ascertained that wages and conditions compatible with proper living prevailed. It was only because the movement was not backed up by law that it was not eminently successful. It is being carried out to some extent in the old country, where Canon Scott-Holland, Canon Gore, and other eminent men in the Church of England are continually doing their best to provide some means by which men and women can discriminate as to the wages paid to the workers and the conditions under which they work. It is useful in another respect. A lady has no assurance, when she pays even the highest price for her clothing, that it was made under proper and humane conditions. I know of instances where ladies in this community have paid the highest prices for ready-made mantles, which, unknown to them, had been made under the very worst sweating conditions. Ladies would naturally prefer to go to the shops which placed beyond1 doubt the fact that the goods had been made under proper conditions by men receiving proper wages. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Bland, in an interjection while the honorable member for Parramatta was making his speech, indicated that, in his opinion, the honorable member for Parramatta had changed his views in keeping with his company. In perusing this Bill I have asked myself, what is it that is colouring the views of honorable members on the Government side of the House, especially those on the right of the gangway ? How is it that some of them who were responsible for this Bill in its original condition, never saw the necessity for clauses providing for a trade union label? How is it that in spite of the remarks of some of the members' of the Ministry in connexion with this and analogous questions, we find such clauses inserted in this Bill, and every member of the Government Party supporting it? I think that the colouring of opinion from whatever cause is exceedingly marked in connexion with the measure. The honorable member who has just resumed his seat ventured to call the trade union label provisions progressive. The Attorney-General, who is in charge of the Bill, indicated that they were provisions that had been in existence in England many years back - I think he said hundreds of years ; that there was power then to try to preserve to the guilds qf England the work of England by the registration of similar marks. But that expedient had not the' effect that was anticipated, and is now anticipated, and the guild marks of Britain became absolutely of no value. </para>

                    <para class="block">The honorable member devoted the last portion of his speech to-night to defending that political influence in trade unionism which he formerly denounced. The fact that the criticism pf honorable members has been confined practically to one portion of the Bill is because it is generally recognised that there is a necessity for a measure of this sort, and that most of its provisions are such as have been tested by experience in our own land, and in other countries. Consequently there has been a general acceptance of the remainder of the clauses. Any difference of opinion is left to the Committee stage. But there is one very grave departure that has attracted almost the entire criticism of honorable members, and, looking at the Attorney-General's speech in moving the second reading, I find that he gives some reasons for this departure. So far as my reading of the Bill goes, in all other portions it is supposed that the person who applies a trade mark shall be the owner of the goods to which that trade mark is applied. That, I think, is a proper limitation. It would safeguard the Bill from many difficulties if it had been adhered to throughout. Once you step beyond that safe limitation, enormous complications and difficulties may arise. But the Attorney-General, in his speech, stated that this was no novel proposal; that in Great Britain there is a law on the subject. I will read his words, so that they may be correctly quoted. The honorable and learned member said that a mark- may be applied in various ways, and in some companies each member of the company or guild or trade has had his own special mark to identify his workmanship. In various Acts of Parliament - I do not wish to occupy time by enumerating the details of them - the principle has been recognised in England for centuries back of having the goods stamped with the workers' mark. </para>

                        <para class="block">In the existing Act of New South Wales there will be found words to which I invite the attention of honorable members. In that Act a "trade mark" is denned as follows : - "Trade mark" includes any mark lawfully used by any person to denote any goods to be goods of the manufacture or merchandise of such person, or to be goods of any particular description made or sold by such person. </para>

                    <para class="block">Having quoted those provisions, apparently with approval, it might have been anticipated that he would follow them in his Bill; but such is not the case. The Attorney-General does not give every person the right to register a trade mark, but gives that right, first of all, to the owner of the goods, and, secondly, to a special section of the community, and that section only. Everybody else is excluded, though they may be workmen getting higher pay,, and employed under better conditions than are union workmen. There may be a single individual who cannot form a union, and yet such an individual under British law,, as quoted by the Attorney-General, would have power to apply his mark. None but those who are members of trade unions, no matter how well paid they may be, or how good the conditions are under which they work, can take advantage of this measure. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think the honorable member for Bland was present when I dealt with that point. Only the owner of the goods is allowed by this measure, except as to trade union marks, to register a trade mark ; that is my reading of the provision, substantiated by legal opinion. I did not pay for that opinion, but I do not suppose it is any the worse for that; at any rate, it is much better to have a wrong legal opinion for which you have not paid, than to have a wrong opinion for which you have paid. However, my opinion was substantiated by a competent legal opinion, namely, that in other parts of this measure, only the owner of the goods is entitled to apply a registered trade mark. </para>

The second distinction is that, whilst an association of workmen may register a trade mark, an association of employers cannot do so. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister and members of this House must look further than what is asked for. They must' ' consider the interests not only of those who make requests, but of those who may be affected by a measure, in which the requests of those who ask are granted. I have already explained that unless the intention is to assist the formation of unions by a method which should not be adopted for that purpose, then any body legitimately forming an association that might be as closely connected with the manufacture of an article as is a trade union should have the same opportunity to register a trade mark as is here given to a trade union. I think that this proposal really has the same political object as the unrestricted preference to unionists that was sought to be embodied in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. It is to increase political power. It is to make the joining of unions almost compulsory, and to give the political Labour Party, of which the honorable member for Melbourne Ports spoke so harshly and so eloquently, additional power, by adding to the strength of the unions which they partially control now, but which they hope to control entirely in the future. That, to my mind, is the evident object of these provisions. It is said that registration of a label is not compulsory, and that it need not be used by employers. I consider that one of the worst features in the Bill is that the measure, as brought in by the Government, does not say what shall or ought to be compulsory, but leaves the compulsion to the members of the unions. That creates a cause of bitterness at once. The measure says, " You can have what you ask for, but if you want to enforce it, it must be by your own compulsion." That creates at once a burning cause of bitterness between employers and employes. </para>

                            <para>- Of course, and the trade unions mean to compel the employers to use their labels. What will be the means resorted to? Do honorable members think that we are simpletons ? Do we not know what will be the means? It will be the boycott of the goods of those who do not use the trade union labels. Honorable members should not come here with such exaggerated innocence as to say that, that will not be the means. It will be the means, and it will be another cause of difficulty and bitterness. I may allude to a remark made by the honorable member for Moira, who said there could not be strife because unions cannot strike. That is not accurate. The honorable member was alluding, of course, to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, but as a matter of fact, we know that under that Act, unions can strike to any extent. The reason the honorable member saw for the introduction of this provision, is a reason which, in the opinion of other honorable members, as well as in my opinion, proves that it is not necessary. I shall not labour that point, as it has already been dealt with by other speakers. When we have already provided means which we were assured by those who supported the proposals under consideration would have the effect of introducing good conditions of employment in the Commonwealth, why we should pile condition upon condition, and provision upon provision to effect what we were assured by those supporting other measures would be effected by those measures, passes my comprehension. Yet that is what we are doing here. The Attorney-General argued that this proposal was desirable because it would encourage trade union conditions in employment. I ask, Are we, the Legislature of the country, to deliberately make the trade unions the arbiters of the conditions of employment ? Trade unions have, in many respects, done good work in introducing improved conditions. I am quite with the workers as to their right to form these unions, and the desirability in their own interests of forming them. I believe they are entitled to anything they can get fairly by their own organization. But we are asked to step in here and allow the trade unions to fix absolutely the conditions of labour and the rates of wages. We know that the members of trade unions are only human. In some circumstances they will accept conditions, even sanitary conditions - to which the Attorney-General alluded as one of the things to be effected by this proposal - that are not desirable. In other cases, they will insist, in the natural selfishness found in us all, and found in organizations more fully developed perhaps than in individuals, on things that are by no means desirable in the interest of the community. We know many instances of that. Are we then to make them the arbiters of the conditions, or have we not said by our previous legislation, that Parliament has provided measures which are intended to decide the conditions of employment? The difficulties to which such accumulated conditions and provisions must give rise, in the conduct of commerce, cannot be in the interest of the workers in our industries. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports eulogized the effect of the Victorian Wages Boards. I, myself, when speaking on the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, recognised the desirability of some measure to stop the unnecessary reduction of wages. There is, not merely a necessary reduction of wages, but also a very unnecessary reduction, which, without some provision for interference, would lead to industrial conditions which are not desirable. I said then that I believed far more in the Victorian Wages Board system for that purpose than in Arbitration legislation, and I think that the experience of New South Wales is beginning to bring it home to both' workmen and employers that my belief is justified. The constant, costly, and irritating litigation which has been going on in the New South Wales Arbitration Court is infinitely more troublesome, more disastrous, and less beneficial to those engaged in the industries of the State than the action of the Wages Boards would be. </para>

                            <para>- I know that; and if the Wages Board system has proved successful, if it has increased wages without destroying the industries in which those wages are paid, I should not object to its extension to trades whose employes do not now benefit by it. My objection to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill was founded on the expectation that the results which have followed would follow. I allude to the measure now only to point out' that that is the proper direction in which to move to secure the improvement of industrial conditions. Why pile on top of that legislation such a cause of dissension as this union label system will be? If the system is adopted, it will not produce the good results which are anticipated. I shall avoid dealing with the matter more fully now, however, because I do not wish to go over ground which other honorable members have traversed. This Parliament is getting a reputation - and not an undeserved one - for such an unnecessary, unreasonable, duplicated, and triplicated interference with commerce that many persons in the community - not employers only, but employes also ask us to leave Australian industries alone for a little, so that those engaged in them may settle down to the present conditions, and may have some distance of time in front of them in which to devote their attention, not to the changes caused in their affairs by our legislation, but to the successful advancement of their businesses. We have placed many enormous difficulties in the way of the conduct of the industries of the country, and we add to them when we single out a special section of the community, as we do in this Bill, give it the right to register trade marks, and intend that it shall bring sufficient pressure to bear to successfully enforce the powers given to it. But before we increase that legislation by this measure and by the other far-reaching and greatly disturbing measures now before us, some of their provisions being based on good reasons, but containing many proposals which are extreme, affecting all the industries and commerce of the country, we should be careful of two things - first, that we propose nothing but what is necessary and desirable, and, secondly, that we make sure that what we propose will be effective, and not merely destructive. That is my attitude on this measure. When the committee stage is reached, I shall take steps, or assist others in taking steps, to effect improvements, although I recognise that, owing to the strange change in the opinions of honorable members opposite since they took possession of the Treasury benches - a change due to the association to which the honorable member for Bland has alluded - I fear that that portion of the measure which is aggressive, and, as I believe, injurious, will be accepted by the House. </para>

                            <para>- Ido not care for that. I am against any interference with personal liberty which can be avoided. Parliament placed certain limitations upon unions in the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill, which" were accepted by the Labour Party, and, unless similar limitations are inserted in this Bill, I shall do all I can to prevent it from coming into force. I do not see why a trade union should be allowed to interfere in any man's business, or should be given special privileges in connexion with trade marks. Of course, when a union enters into a business for its own profit, as a co-operative concern, it is entitled, like any other manufacturer, to place its trade mark on its productions. The sole object of the special provisions inserted in this Bill is to enable the unionists to force men into their ranks, and to deprive non-unionists of their freedom of action and thought. I strongly oppose any such proposals. I am sick and tired of all the talk that we have heard about democracy. These proposals are absolutely foreign to the principles of democracy. If honorable members opposite admitted that they were Tories in principle, and ceased to boast of their liberalism, and their democratic proclivities, I should have no quarrel with them. If the provisions relating to trade union labels are carried, manufacturers will have to use such labels, or submit to being boycotted by the members of the unions. Why should any man be compelled to employ unionists? What would be said by honorable members opposite if we proposed that the use of only non-union labels should be permitted, with the object of driving men out of the unions? Would they not declare that we were proposing to exercise the greatest tyranny ? No one for a moment would tolerate such a proposal. I am not opposed to trade unions in any way. I believe that they have done some good, and that they have also done a great deal of harm. I would not say that they are perfect, or that the working classes occupy their present position as the result of the good work achieved by the unions. As I have said, I am not opposed to the unions, but I do not intend to give them any advantage by law. If by combination, and by proving themselves to be better than non-unionists, or by co-operation, the members of trade unions can improve their positions, well and good, but we are here to guard the rights, not of one set of persons, but of the whole of the people of the Commonwealth. I am astonished to see Ministers who were strongly opposed to all such proposals a short time ago now supporting the Bill in its entirety. The lion is now lying down with the lamb. The Treasurer, for instance, was very strong in his opposition to special labour legislation before he took office, and yet to-day, on account of his fondness for the sweets of office, or owing to some other consideration, we find him calmly accepting proposals which are potent for mischief. It is outrageous that some honorable members should swallow their principles as they have done in connexion with this Bill. I shall do all I can to prevent this measure, or any other framed on the same lines, from being passed. I quite realize how the provisions relating to union labels could be used to boycott tradesmen, or even workmen. If, for instance, a storekeeper did not sell goods bearing the union label, he would probably be called a blackleg, and would be told that he was not taking the proper course to conserve the interests of the working classes. I quite agree with the necessity of protecting the rights of the traders and others in trade marks, and only in so far as the Bill proceeds in that direction will it receive my support. </para>

                            <para>- None whatever. Non-unionists are in many cases just as good workmen as are unionists. The fact that a man belongs to a union does not carry with it any guarantee of efficiency. Only the other day I met a man in Melbourne who told me that the best men in the unions did not .care whether there were unions or not. He stated that a great number of the unionists were not up to the mark, and that the best men in those organizations had to carry the incapables on their backs. There are plenty of good men in) the unions and plenty of bad ones. The same remarks apply to the men outside the unions. </para>

                            <para>- I think that is very likely. We have rendered it impossible for the unions formed under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to play the part of political organizations, and no doubt the present proposal is intended to permit of unions with political objects being formed, and thus overcoming the obstacles which are imposed in connexion with the Act just mentioned. My desire is to leave men free to take whatever stand they please, and to follow whatever course in life seems best to them, so long as they do not run counter to the best interests of the community. We have heard a great deal of talk about democracy. I conceive that in order to be true democrats we must not only look after our own rights, but also those of other people, and on broad principles, I am absolutely opposed to the union trade mark provisions in the Bill. I trust that those provisions will be eliminated. If that be done. I shall not have very much objection l;i the Bill. Those honorable members. whO call themselves liberals are doing all they can to place restrictions upon every member of the community. If their action is in strict accordance with the doctrines of liberalism I do not know what liberalism is. We should do as little as we possibly can to interfere with the freedom of individuals, so long as they do not act in a manner inimical to the best interests of the people as a whole. I think that the Government might very well consent to an adjournment at this stage. We have now reached the usual time for adjourning - half-past 10 o'clock. </para>

                    <para>- I protest against the adjournment of the debate upon the Trade Marks Bill. Some honorable members, who have travelled hundreds of miles from distant States, have been compelled to sit here all day and witness the erection of a "stone wall " by members of the Opposition. I would warn the Government that if they allow these tactics to be repeated, we shall get no work done this session. It is quite apparent that there is an organized attempt to prevent anything being accomplished. </para>

                        <para>- It is not. We have done nothing during the past two years. We shall accomplish nothing this session unless the Ministry stiffen their backs. I say that as a friend of the Government. We know that there is urgent work to be done, but unless we make more rapid progress, we shall achieve nothing. It is well known that the last session in any Parliament is chiefly occupied in talking to constituents. No useful work is ever done then. I protest against being brought here merely to gratify the Opposition, whose members are incensed because there has been a change of Ministry. </para>

                        <para>- Will it not save time if the speeches which are made now are not repeated in Committee ? Is the honorable member to come forward and say when honorable members shall deliver their speeches. This is quite a new <inline font-style="italic">role</inline> for him to play. I can recall to mind occasions when he has insisted upon his right of speech ; but he now desires the suppression of the right of free speech, when it is not unduly exercised. There has been no undue discussion. I was one of the last to speak on the motion for the second reading of the Trade Marks Bill, refraining from taking part in the discussion at an earlier stage- because I had been absent for some days ; but the remarks which I had to offer were curtailed as much as possible, and were made, not with the bad object which the honorable member has suggested, but with the best of purposes in view. </para>

                        <para>- I am not complaining, bus my suggestion is that, if we are to have lengthy debates, we must either have longer sittings or meet on a greater number of days than we do. I am" greatly in sympathy with the honorable member for Grey, because during the first Parliament the representatives of Queensland had often to attend here under even greater disadvantages than those suffered by the representatives of South Australia, and we keenly felt any delay that took place. </para>

                        <para>- We have had tonight a foretaste of what is to come. No doubt we shall have these protests repeated every week - perhaps every night - during the remainder of the session. The Labour Party are, of course. responsible. They have the power to turn out the Government at any moment, and if any one expects that they are going to submit quietly to the ordinary process of government he makes a very great mistake. The Labour Party have the power, and we see to-night how they are beginning to utilize it. They are going to flog the Ministry into carrying out theireverv wish, and we shall look on, with the greatest possible anxiety for the reputation of constitutional government, to see how far the Labour Party will proceed with this kind of flagellation. I am glad that the Opposition are free to protest against impertinence of the kind of which the honorable member for Grey has been guilty. We are not compelled, even if the Ministry are, to sit dumb under it. The Labour Party are not our masters. We <inline font-style="italic">h:-</inline> snot submitted our programme to the. caucus. </para>

                    <para>. - When I was young, it was the practice in places of public entertainment to follow a serious drama with a farce, and we owe our thanks to one or two honorable members for having furnished us with relief of that kind this evening. Although anxious to push on with business, I thought that a request by an ex-Minister for the adjournment of a debate on a matter of such importance as the Trade Marks Bill was, at this stage, one to which the House was. entitled to listen. We are pressing on with two or three very important measures, and as soon as the second reading of the Trade Marks Bill has been agreed to, shall be prepared to move their second reading. I can promise the honorable member for Grey, whose reproaches, so far from affecting me, are such as I hope often to hear, unless better progress be made, that he will find the Government anxious for the House to sit often and long in order that the business of the country may be transacted. </para>
