                        <para>- I wish to ask the Prime Minister, without notice, if he can ascertain whether the reports of outrages on Jews in Russia are true. If they are, is he prepared to move in this House a motion of abhorrence of the actions of the authors of the outrages, and expressing sympathy for the sufferers? I do not think that any expression of opinion will affect the perpetrators of the massacres, or those who administer affairs in Russia, but, if conveyed to the Chief Rabbi- </para>

                        <para>- I hesitate to believe that such incredible atrocities as have been reported can have been perpetrated by any Christian people. The state of affairs in Russia is, at the present time, so chaotic that I suspect that the means of obtaining intelligence as to what is proceeding there is even less trustworthy than usual. Therefore, until satisfied of the substantial truth of the statements which have been made, we might, by carrying such a resolution as the honorable and learned member has referred to, place an undeserved imputation upon a great people who are in the throes of profound political and social change. I am sure that the whole Australian community wishes well to the Russian people in their struggles for constitutional liberty and freedom, and that the civilized world would join in reprobation of such horrible outrages as have been reported in the columns of the press. If the newspaper statements are established on some foundation making them sufficiently credible, I shall be prepared to consider whether anything said or done in Australia will help to bring to bear upon those who have been guilty of these fearful offences, the whole weight of civilized public opinion throughout the world. </para>

On 28th October a statement was published in the Ministerialist organ in Melbourne to the effect that the Prime Minister had announced that no Tariff amendment was possible this session. This has rendered it necessary for the Commission to reconsider its resolution of 26th October, and the following decision has been arrived at :  - ' That in view of the announcement in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of 28th ult., namely, the Prime Minister says that no Tariff amendment is possible this session, it will be neither necessary nor desirable to suspend the sittings of the Commission in Adelaide on 10th inst., in order to meet in Melbourne on nth inst., to consider the question of progress' reports, and the resolution passed on 2nd October is hereby rescinded.'

                        <para>- By an oversight, I did not see until ten minutes ago the statement which the honorable member has read, which, I am informed, appears in both morning newspapers. I have hurriedly endeavoured to discover what authority there is for the statement attributed to me, but the only article in which reference is made to the Tariff upon which I have been able to place my hands is one appearing in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of the 28th October, in which the remarks about the possibility of dealing with it this session are general, and in no way attributed to myself. I have no recollection of having made the statement attributed to me, or any statement which could be construed as affecting the reports of the Tariff Commission. On the contrary, when addressing this House on the Appropriation Bill, no later than last night, I pointed out that the Government must keep an open door in regard to this matter on the chance that the Tariff Commission may make a recommendation of an. urgent character, requiring to be and capable of being dealt with this session. I have no recollection of having said anything to justify the remarks of the Chairman of the Tariff Commission, who is under a misapprehension. That misapprehension I will endeavour to remove. </para>

                SMITH (Macquarie).I think that the honorable member should be prepared to go on with the debate upon this motion. I understand that this is the last time that the House will have an opportunity to deal with private business, and, as a very important principle is involved in the motion, it is desirable that honorable members should be permitted to discuss it this afternoon.

                    <para>- I understand that the honorable member for Darwin is prepared to withdraw the motion if any other honorable member is prepared to speak on the main question.. I think that it would be a pity to prevent honorable members from having an opportunity to refute the very able arguments of the honorable member for Barrier, so that as much light as possible may be thrown on the subject. While his speech appears on the pages of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> no really prepared statement in reply has been published. The honorable member for Werriwa dealt with the matter historically, but he was necessarily speaking in an emergency, and without preparation. If the honorable member for Darwin will allow the discussion on the main question to proceed, I am willing, unprepared as I am, to address myself to it. </para>

                    <para>- It is highly undesirable that the Order of the Day, should be postponed, because there .are good reasons why a decision should be arrived at with regard to the policy outlined in the motion of the honorable member for Barrier. It is proposed to make such an. important departure from the policy that has hitherto been followed by the Commonwealth that a decision should not be delayed any longer than is necessary. Whilst the motion stands on the business-paper, it may have the effect of hindering the development of wireless telegraphy, because, until persons outside are satisfied as to the intentions of this House, they cannot go forward with any enterprise. If any company were formed for the purpose of introducing a system of wireless telegraphy, they would at once be met by the objection that a proposal was now being considered by this House for acquiring control over the principal means of communication between Australia and the United Kingdom. The application of wireless telegraphy to the requirements of the people is being so rapidly extended that only yesterday we noticed a statement in the newspapers that wireless telegraphic communication was being established between different points of the dense forests of Brazil. For the reasons I have stated, I have no hesitation in opposing the proposed postponement. </para>

                    <para>- I presume that the honorable member for Barrier did not move his motion with the Object of humbugging the House or the country. I believe that the honorable member is sincere in his desire that the motion shall be carried to a practical conclusion, and I think it is important that it should be discussed at the earliest opportunity. Recently a conference met in London for the purpose of discussing the affairs of the Pacific Cable Company and its relation to the Eastern Extension Company ; and a recommendation was made that the businesses of the two companies shoul*d be 1 pooled. </para>

                        <para>- I look upon the main question as a matter well worth discussion. A great deal of correspondence has been published in the daily newspapers during the last few days with reference to me proposal to pool the businesses of the Eastern Extension Company and the Pacific Cable Company, and before anything is done in that direction, -honorable members should have an opportunity to express, their opinion. Personally, I think that it would be a mistake to enter upon any pooling arrangement upon the basis 0/ the present revenues of the respective companies, because it is well known that the Pacific' Cable has not been worked in the past on the same business lines that have been adopted by the Eastern Extension Company. </para>

                    <para>- I regret very much that the Treasurer has not seen fit to make some attempt to answer the socialistic arguments nut forward bv the honorable member for Brisbane. We know that the right honorable gentleman is at heart bitterly opposed to the proposed scheme, but he has shown intense anxiety to avoid addressing himself to the question. An exceptionally good opportunity presents itself this afternoon for a discussion of the motion, with regard to which the intentions of the Government should be declared without delay. I venture to say that if the Order of the Day is postponed, the motion will not be dealt with this session ; and it appears to me that the Treasurer either regards it with contempt or is unable to answer the arguments advanced in support of it. I can conceive of no adequate reason for postponement. Personally, I think the motion should be struck off the business-paper, and I would support any movement in that direction. Under present conditions it will appear 10 the outside world that the anti-socialistic Treasurer is unable to answer the socialistic arguments put forward by the honorable member for Brisbane, or is averse to discussing them lest he may alienate the sympathies either of his masters in the Labour Corner, or of his masters in Bunbury. </para>

                    <para>- When the honorable member for Brisbane submitted this proposal, I at once intimated that I could not support it. One of the most cogent reasons for refusing to adjourn the consideration of any item which appears upon the business-paper is that it is unfair, after honorable members have spent days in preparing themselves to discuss that subject, to suddenly proceed with the consideration of some other matter. That practice, I contend1, is a distinct breach of the privileges of honorable members, and if it be encouraged the incentive to study any question which may demand our consideration will be weakened, if it be not entirely removed. Therefore all motions of this character should be resisted. The honorable member for Brisbane, who submitted the proposal in regard to a Commonwealth note issue, has not asked for an adjournment of the debate upon it. The first portion of his motion reads - </para>

The honorable member for Brisbane should have been the first to rise and resist the proposed adjournment. Honorable members cannot properly deal with a new. subject at a moment's notice. No man in the world is qualified to do that. Surely the Treasurer should have been to-day prepared to discuss the proposal to establish a Commonwealth note issue. </para>

                    <para>- I do not think that the consideration of the proposal of the honorable member for Brisbane should be adjourned'. The Treasurer ought to have been prepared to discuss it. It is strange that the Government who profess to be so anxious to assist the workers should desire to shelve this motion. The sooner .the motion be passed the better. Every one will then have plenty of money, and we shall all' be able to ride in motor cars and lead a life of comfort. The honorable member for Brisbane tells us that the adoption of his proposal will enable us to set up a printing press and work off millions of pounds worth of paper money. And yet the Treasurer asks that the consideration of the motion be postponed ! He is prepared, apparently, to allow many of the people of the Commonwealth to continue in a state of poverty and distress, although by the adoption of the proposal made by the honorable member for Brisbane, we might make every one in the Commonwealth prosperous and happy. </para>

The honorable member for Brisbane, in introducing his motion, showed that it was of far-reaching importance. He declared that it was unnecessary, for us to borrow money, that all that we had to do was to print, paper money for ourselves, and so secure a remedy for nearly all our social ills. </para>

                        <para>- But he could not have taken that action without the consent of the honorable member for Brisbane. I venture to say that if we called for a division on this question all in the Ministerial corner would vote with the Government. I am inclined to test them. I should like the honorable member for Brisbane to say whether he considers that the proposal which he has been incubating for many months, and which he professes to regard as being of supreme importance, should be set aside to allow of the consideration of mere questions as to the census and collection of Commonwealth statistics. Does he regard his motion as of more importance than the Copyright Bill? Has his enthusiasm for his motion died away since he introduced it? It appears to me that the honorable member has been trifling with the programme to which he professes to adhere; that he has-been trifling with large questions of social concern.. It seems that these are matters to be played with upon the hustings, but are not for serious treatment in this House. I was surprised to find on entering the House this afternoon that in order to allow the trumpery programme put forward by the Government to be proceeded with, honorable members were voluntarily surrendering their right to proceed with motions that are supposed to be of first-rate importance. Is there a solitary proposal in the Government programme which would give the great toiling masses whom they are supposed by them to represent an additional crust ? What is there in the Government programme that would better their social conditions ? I can only conclude that honorable members in the Ministerial Corner, including the mover of this motion, are acting treacherously to the people who sent them here as well as to the programme which they profess to have so much at heart when they airily consent to motions standing in their name being set aside in order that trumpery Government measures, may be deal .with. The proposals which honorable members of the Labour Party, when on the hustings, declared to be of the very essence of reform are now being set aside by them, in order that they may take their places behind a Government for whom, as such, they have no respect, and facilitate the carrying out of a programme that will not be productive of any good either to themselves or to the people whom they represent. That is my criticism of the attitude of those honorable members in regard to these proposals. This afternoon, two big socialistic motions are being set aside by the Labour Party in the interests of the Government programme, which, to say .the least of it, is of no practical concern to the toiling masses of the country. </para>

                    <para>- On coming into this Chamber, I was absolutely staggered to find that the Government had asked the honorable member for Brisbane to drop his motion providing for the issue of Commonwealth Treasury notes. Considerable time has already been occupied in the discussion of the motion, at a cost to the country, according to Ihe <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> of ^200 an hour-, and now, at the end of the session, it is to be thrown aside without any determination being come to in respect to the proposals which it embodies. The Labour Party and the Ministry have a great deal to answer for in this action. I could understand postponement of the motion, with a view to allowing the Copyright Bill to be proceeded with, because of the necessity for copyrighting the shin plasters, or greenbacks, which the honorable member for Brisbane - perhaps prompted thereto by his medical training - proposes to substitute for coin of the realm. The right honorable member for Swan, in moving the postponement of the Order of the Day, has hurled another insult at the Labour Party, who apparently have not yet had their fill of such treatment, and are ready to vote for the postponement. The honorable member for Brisbane has devoted a large amount of time to this question. His motion embodies what is the distinct policy of the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin,</inline> which is the Bible or the Koran of the Labour Party. Yet, notwithstanding the fact that his proposals are so strongly advocated by these honorable members outside the Chamber, the motion is to . go for nought. The Home Rule motion was treated very differently. It was a motion which did not affect the interests of Australia at all, and could have' only the result of disturbing the public mind. There was not even a whisper about its postponement, yet the members of the Labour Party, whilst supporting that motion, are prepared to postpone this, which they allege to be part of their socialistic programme, and of vital concern to the community. It is time that the House made a protest against such action. The members of the Opposition, who attend religiously to their parliamentary duties, have carefully watched the business paper, and came here prepared to discuss the motion. If you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> knew how many hours some of us have given to preparing ourselves to discuss the motion, you would understand our present grievance. Personally, I have been too busy to occupy myself much with questions of finance, about which I know as little as the subject knows about me; but there are those on this side, such as the honorable members for Kooyong and Grampians, who hold exalted positions in the Australian financial world, and are prepared to give the House the benefit of their experience and training. </para>

                        <para>- He has not said anything on the subject yet, but, judging by his facial expression, he is disgusted at what, has taken place, and I should not be surprised if he stood up, and declared himself no longer a supporter of the Government which is subjecting him to this treatment. The issue of Treasury notes is a pet scheme of his. He has thought deeply on the subject, and spoken upon it exhaustively, and, as he is a man of determined character, and of independence of thought and action, I cannot understand why he submits to this absolute insult. </para>

                        <para>- He is not only a hero, but a martyr. No doubt he would rise to his feet to express his indignation were it not that the great power of the caucus has silenced him. I cannot understand such servility. The Labour Party, above all others, should be opposed to the postponement of this motion, because they profess to believe that the scheme which it embodies provides a panacea for all financial evil?,. Personally I do not so regard it, because my training has been so deficient that I am unable to see that shin plasters would be better for currency than the ordinary coin of the realm. But I again emphasize the sorry treatment which is being shown to the honorable member for. Brisbane, and to honorable members like the honorable members for Kooyong and Grampians., who, no doubt, are chin-deep in the notes which they have prepared to enable them to refute the arguments which have been advanced. I offer my heartfelt sympathy to them. The Opposition would be only too glad to give every facility for the discussion of the motion, which we are prevented by the diabolic action of the Government from dealing with. Certainly the honorable member for Grey, who is an ardent Socialist, should be willing to allow to come on as soon as possible a motion which provides for making all of us rich. That would certainly be a novel position for me, and I think for him, to be in. I am afraid, however, that, unless the notes which the honorable member for Brisbane proposes to issue are copyrighted, they will be imitated by every printing press in the country, and many will be accommodated with free board and lodging at His Majesty's expense through endeavouring to make themselves rich by following the example set by him. Those who have thought much on this; subject are of opinion that Australia, like America, will do herself injury if she substitutes paper money for coin of the realm. </para>

                    <para>- I can understand the righteous indignation of the honorable member "for Wentworth at the presumption of the honorable member for Canobolas. But it seems to me that it is incumbent upon the former honorable member to explain the absence of the honorable and learned member for Parkes. It is quite within the province of the House to say what shall be done with regard to any motion, irrespective of the wish of the mover. In my humble judgment, the action taken1 by the Opposition to-day amounts to a deliberate waste of time. </para>

                        <para>- I withdraw my remark. In view of the fact that it is futile, at this stage of the session, to discuss motions of a contentious character standing in the names of private members, the Prime Minister was justified in asking honorable members to give up the time previously devoted to private members' business. Yet honorable members opposite are expressing their indignation at the action of the Government. We have had afforded to us another illustration of the objects whch honorable members of the Opposition have in view. </para>

                        <para>- It is a matter of surprise to me that any opposition should be offered to the proposed postponement, because it must be recognised that it would be absolutely impossible to reach any finality in regard to the main question. In fact, it is absolutely impossible, within the time devoted to private business, to attain practical results in regard to any contentious questions submitted by honorable members. It is a well-established practice for the leader of the Government to ask honorable members, towards the close__of the session, to forego the time allotted to private business, and I hope that we shall get on with the practical work of the country. </para>

                    <para>- I desire to again place on record my opinion that the time devoted to the discussion) of private members' business is wasted, and I am glad to find the honorable member for Moira agreeing with me. Let me remind the honorable member, however, that every care was taken to see that finality was reached in regard to the Home Rule question., and that there is no reason why we should not also arrive at some decision with regard to the motion of the honorable and learned member for Parkes, which is one of great international importance. The Government have, within the last three weeks, indicated that they are willing to agree to a modification of the Immigration Restriction Act. </para>

                        <para>- We have not yet discussed it once, and perhaps, if the discussion of the main question were now proceeded with, less time would be occupied in dealing with the Government proposal. I venture to say that, unless we arrive at a decision with regard to the motion of the honorable and learned member for Parkes, we shall before very long be compelled to direct our attention to the subject therein dealt with. If honorable members opposite are content to allow motions to be introduced and partly discussed, and then struck off the business-paper, the charge of waste of time should be preferred against them rather that against members of the Opposition. </para>

                    <para>- The conscience of every honorable member is, I believe, in his own keeping. No honorable member should, pass strictures upon another for taking the course which he thinks it necessary to follow in the best interests of the country. Those who talk so glibly about their political consciences will have to explain their actions outside this House. The proposal of the honorable and learned member for Parkes is one of the most important matters that we can discuss. As the honorable member for Grampians has suggested, the course which has been fol lowed this afternoon is the first step towards clearing the notice-paper of private members' business. Personally, I do not think that we can debate anything more important than a proposal to amend our legislation in regard to alien immigration. When honorable members reflect upon the relations which exist between England and Japan, they must recognise the necessity of taking some steps to remove the friction which has been engendered by our legislation. </para>

                    <para>- I have no desire to delay the transaction of business in any way. I was very much surprised to hear the remarks of the honorable member for Moira, who practically accused the Opposition of attempting to waste time. I was not present when the division was taken this afternoon, but the vote by the Opposition was cast for two reasons. The first was a desire to emphasize the uselessness of the discussions which sometimes occur on Thursday afternoons, and the second was a desire to protest against the action of honorable members in parading as champions of a certain section of the people, and, after wasting the time of the country, deliberately setting their proposals aside in favour of others, which they do not regard as of the slightest possible consequence. The vote recorded this afternoon was cast not because we are in favour of " shin plasters," or any such quack nostrums, but because we are opposed to the time of the House being occupied in purposeless discussion by certain honorable members, who afterwards abjectly surrender all those proposals which they themselves have declared to be of vital importance to the community. I hope that we shall proceed with the transaction of business without delay. </para>

                    COOK (Parramatta).Before this Bill finally passes, I desire to make one or two observations, although without any intention to delay it, because I am just as anxious as are the Government to send it to the Senate, so that it may receive that fair consideration to which it is entitled at the hands of that Chamber. My desire to see the measure passed at this apparently early stage of the session - I say "apparently early" because of the announcement which was made bv the Prime Minister last evening - does not spring from any wish to serve the Government. I think that, in view of the Ministerial deliverance last night, they are entitled to no consideration whatever. I have no hesitation in saying that the Prime Minister's speech - having regard to the professed eagerness of all sections of the House to get into recess - was neither more nor less than a deliberate insult to this Chamber. The strange" feature about that deliverance was that, whereas it occupied nearly an hour and a quarter, the speech in which the Prime Minister forecasted the whole business programme for the session absorbed only a quarter of an hour. In view of all that we have been led to believe by Ministers themselves, and by the Government Whip, I say that the outline of proposals which the Prime Minister laid before us was neither more nor less than an insult to this House. It is quite clear that the only result of his action will be the undue prolongation of the session. Certainly, his speech will not make for those harmonious relations which ought to exist between all sections of the House when the end of the session is in view, and when the closing of Parliament would. seem to become a public duty. Personally, I regard the programme which the Government put before us last night as the veriest pretence. I do not believe that it is seriously intended to push through all the measures which were outlined by the Prime Minister. I say that the honorable and learned gentleman paid the House a very poor compliment when he put before us such a stuffed and inflated programme. It would have been far more in keeping with the dignity of the Ministry, supposing they had any honest desire to transact the public business, had they - as is customary at this stage of the session - jettisoned the political cargo which they believed they could not carry, and invited the cooperation of all sections of the House in an effort to close Parliament. That is what every other Commonwealth Government has done, and what is being done in the States Parliaments today. There is no State in which the Premier has not, ere this, sought the cooperation of honorable members in an effort to close the session. After the reference of the Prime Minister last evening to, a conversation which I had with him, I should like to tell honorable members exactly what took place between us. I told the Prime Minister that, so far as I was concerned, he could have the Appropriation Bill at once, if he would declare what business the Government proposed to proceed with, and if he would only put before us a reasonable programme. When I made that proposal I did not imagine that he intended to outline a programme which is even fuller than that set out in the business-paper. Who expected to hear a declaration that the Government were about to withdraw the Manufactures Encouragement Bill, and to introduce an entirely new measure at this period of the session? Who believed that we were to Be kept here, if need be, tilt Christmas, to pass the union label proposals in the Trade Marks Bill ? The opinion generally held was that the further consideration of these matters was to be deferred till next session.

                            <para>- The honorablemember's remarks were directed to the Government. He urged that an earnest effort should be made to bring the session to a close, and no one could take exception on the score of party fealty to his attitude. He had every right to speak as he did ; but what was the answer he received? Instead of indicating that the Government intended to bring the session to a close as soon as possible, the Prime Minister proceeded to load up the business-paper with measures which have not the slightest chance of being passed before Christmas by both Houses of the Legislature. </para>

With that fluency with which he is specially gifted he reeled off first one measure and then another, and his comment upon each of them was, " This should not take long, if honorable members do not discuss it too fully." Does the honorable and learned gentleman expect us to discuss the union label provisions of the Trade Marks Bill, and also the Sugar Bounties Bill? </para>

                            <para>- I am. not aware of that, and it is not, I think, correct. My point is that the Prime Minister, instead of jettisoning some of his political cargo, as is customary towards the close of a session, has submitted a programme which is for the most part entirely new. All the talk which we have heard as to speedily concluding the business of the session and getting into recess is therefore so much moonshine. The proposals outlined last night by the Prime Minister are of first importance to the people of Australia. The honorable and learned member has a way that is unequalled of making out a case for the passing of an innocent-looking little measure when it is really one of a party character. We all remember in what dire and ominous tones he spoke before he came into office of the position of the defences of Australia; but it would appear that the matter is now of no concern. </para>

                            <para>- We have seen the Harvester Trust of Australia endeavouring to manipulate honorable members of this House in a way that is most undesirable. One day they are with the Prime Minister, and another day are closeted with the leader of the Labour Party. There may be some excuse for the Prime Minister, however, because a large harvester manufactory is situated within his electorate. Then, again, we see these men closeted with certain honorable senators ; and so the lobbying goes on. The whole thing is nothing more than a scare headed movement, and an attempt to try to rush the Government off its feet. There is absolutely no justification at present for the action which they propose to take. I am not here to say that there is no inherent danger in the operations of a trust. I should be very sorry to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> might not be injured by the International Harvester Trust. If such, a thing did occur, I should be prepared, like other honorable members, to consider it,, and to deal with it in the interests of Australia in the broadest possible way. But a mere threat 'of competition between trade rivals should not be a justification for our passing hasty legislation upon the <inline font-style="italic">ipse dixit</inline> of one of the interested parties. Moreover, there is a Commission sitting at the present time which ought to investigate this matter, just as it has investigated various other questions relating to the Tariff. One of the parties to the dispute is anxious to go before the Commission, and to have the facts thoroughly sifted. I therefore hope that the Government will not ask the Parliament to pass hasty legislation on the ground that some of the people concerned in this matter are living in Australia, while others are residing in other parts of the Empire. </para>

                            <para>- I regret that we should be getting into our heads the notion that as long as we are passing Bills, regardless of whether or not they are designed to meet a real peril, we are rendering good service to Australia. I honestly believe that if we could shut every Parliament in Australia for the next twelve months, the affairs of the country would proceed quite smoothly. The burden of seven Parliaments, which the handful of people living in Australia have to <inline font-style="italic">carry,</inline> is causing at the present time infinitely more mischief than it cures. I am raising my protest as strongly as I can against the passing of hasty legislation, and certainly am not prepared, when the House ought to be in recess, to remain here to consider measures designed to meet an imaginary peril. If the peril in regard to the Harvester Trust were real, it could be verified, and verified by means of the Tariff Commission, which is now sitting. Let <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> go before that Commission, and1, prove that he is being injured by an outside trust. Even in that event, the House would have to consider very seriously how it should discriminate between a trust that is outside Australia and one that is within it. The whole of this trouble has arisen from the action of the Minister of Trade and Customs. Things would have gone on as they were but for his pettifogging interference, and his arbitrary action in. raising the valuation placed upon imported harvesters. His action was taken apparently without any justification. At all events, he has never justified it in this House. The procedure which he adopted was a challenge to outside firms, if they had resources at their disposal, to enter the engagement l which he so foolishly precipitated, i The menace which is supposed to be hanging over Australia is due to the de- | liberate and wilful action of the Minister 1 of Trade and Customs, and it would be unreasonable to ask Parliament to remain in session until Christmas to pass measures which have been provoked in this way. Even yet there is no evidence of any injury having; been done. I am desirous of seeing the Appropriation Bill sent to the other Chamber, because there is a body of men there who will give some consideration to the finances of the country, al- ; though a large number of honorable! members here on the Government side have 1 been absolutely dumb on the subject. </para>

                            <para>- No Government ever brings down Estimates, and says, " We "will stand by every line." Once the House gets into Committee of Supply, the Estimates are the property of the Committee. Honorable members opposite, if they had wished to consider the finances of the country, should not have been dumb, as they were during the consideration of the Estimates. Those who claim to be the watch-dogs of the people were dumb while millions of pounds were being voted away. As to the other measures on "the Government programme, we, on this side, will try to give them our best consideration, in order to meet, as far as possible, the public interest, and to make them as little harmful as we can to the various interests of Australia. Whether this will occupy a long or a short time will depend on the nature of the proposals. I have already indicated that they are highly controversial, and I hope that the1 Government will not complain if they are debated at length. Nothing more will be attempted on this side than to give them reasonable consideration.. But the fact that the notice-paper is being choked at the end of the session will not deter us from doing what other sections of the House seem to have lost all thought of doing - paying attention to the needs and interests of the community. </para>

                        <para>- It is not my intention to delay the passing of the Bill more than a few minutes,, but I. wish to emphasize some of the remarks made by the deputy leader of the Opposition in regard to the programme outlined by the Prime Minister last night. I had not the pleasure, being otherwise engaged, of hearing, what he said, but I read a report of his speech this morning. I consider it evidence of the demoralization of this Parliament that the leader of the House can, at this period of the session, come forward with such a programme for this and next session. He must know that if proper and reasonable debate takes place on some of the measurer on his programme, they cannot be carried before </para>

                    <para class="block">Christmas, even if we sit five days a week. The discussion of the principle of pre.ference to unionists occupied the best part of three months last session, and many of us consider the union label provision a much more dangerous proposal. I intend to debate it to the utmost of my power, and to employ all the forms of the House to prevent it from becoming law. The Prime Minister's programme for next session is marked by the most flagrant breach of faith ever committed by an Australian political leader. All sections of the Protectionist Party, and one section of the Free-trade Party, in this Parliament, are committed, to fiscal peace. </para>

                            <para>- Who can see the Treasurer in his present position without feeling, if not anger, great contempt ? Did not I hear him in the Masonic HaU last year, arrayed in an immaculate dress suit ind snowy shirt front. lay it down as a principle that to give a preference to one worker over another would be to perform an immoral and degrading action? Now however, he is a member, of a Government which is swallowing, as if it liked it, that principle to which he was so much opposed. He is now obeying the dictates of the Labour Party - more power to them if they can retain his support - and must vote for the principle which he has denounced, and which is from his point of view immoral. I do not blame the members of the Labour Party for supporting that principle, because it is a plank in their platform, but those who have stated their conviction against it should not, for the sake of the temporary retention of office, turn round and swallow their views. Had the late Government remained in office, the Treasurer and the Vice-President of the Executive Council could have been relied upon to vote against the union label provision. </para>

                            <para>- I desired to discuss the programme of business put before the House by the Prime Minister last night, but as I presume that another opportunity will be provided for doing so, I shall not deal with the matter further now, beyond saying that' if there is to be reasonable discussion of the Government proposals they cannot be carried into effect between now and Christmas. If we are to be called upon to deal with any of these proposals, I shall insist, as far as possible, upon the attendance of the Ministers in charge of them. The Trade Marks Bill contains a number of technical and important clauses, and yet the Minister in charge of the measure was absent for the greater part of 'the time that at was under discussion. If that course is persisted in, it cannot be regarded as other than a flagrant insult to members of the Opposition. </para>

I think that it is distinctly improper for a Minister, who is in receipt of the emoluments of office, not to attend this House whilst a Bill of which he has charge is under discussion. </para>

Something could be done in that direction before the session closes, but I shall be very much surprised if any earnest effort is made by the Government. No doubt a strong endeavour will be made to pass into law the provision in the Trade Marks Bill relating to union labels, but I do not expect to see anything like the same anxiety manifested with regard to the amendment of the Immigration Restriction Act. The masters of the Government want the union label, but they do not care to encourage the immigration of reputable British citizens, unless they have money in their pockets. </para>

I have been endeavouring for a week past to bring under the notice of Ministers a most important matter, but whilst honorable members of the Opposition speak at such length, it almost becomes the duty of honorable members, who desire to see the business of the country transacted, to remain silent. In the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of 7th November, an article was published relating to the new examination system which is being adopted in connexion with Australian Artillery commissions. It is alleged that this change has been made in consequence of the discussion which took place in this House upon my motion for the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into the Defence Regulations. The Army Administration Board, after having laboured for several weeks, have produced a scheme which is said to be intended to remedy the evils complained of, and to give effect to the desire expressed by honorable members that every reasonable opportunity shall be afforded to rankers to obtain commissions. The Prime Minister, upon the 14th September, expressed the opinion that it was only right that professional as well as literary qualifications should have full weight attached to them in the examination. Now I desire to direct attention to the new proposals. The articles, after referring to existing anomalies, states that - </para>

                    <para>Therefore, a candidate is to be examined in ten subjects, five of which are to be voluntary, and five obligatory, and the candidate who obtains the highest total in both classes of subjects will come out at the top of the tree. It was distinctly promised that the whole system should be revolutionized, and upon that understanding the proposal for the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into the Regulations was defeated. I was certainly under the impression that an honest attempt would be made to give full effect to the intentions of honorable members, but 1 am sadly disappointed with the new system of examination. It is necessary for candidates to obtain five marks in each of the compulsory subjects, which include mathematics, English, geography, and English history. Any ordinary college man would be able to pass in those subjects. The voluntary subjects include French, of which the ordinary artilleryman could scarcely be expected to know anything; German, with which they would be equally unfamiliar; and logarithms, with which it is extremely unlikely they would have any acquaintance. The whole of the voluntary subjects are not mentioned, but I imagine that they would include Latin and Greek, and I would ask whether the test proposed to be applied can be considered a fair one, so far as artillerymen are concerned. I do not propose to delay the passing of the Appropriation Bill, but I think that it is time that action was taken to secure fulfilment of the promises made by the Vice-President of the Executive Council. The only concession that seems to have been made is the abolition of the confidential board, before whom the men formerly had to appear. That is something gained, and possibly I may, by persistent effort, be able to improve the conditions for rankers of merit who desire to obtain commissions. Unfortunately, I am afraid that, instead of having effected a change for the better, I have placed the men in a less favorable position than previously, because, instead of some of the subjects being purely voluntary, as was previously the case, the marks gained in connexion with such subjects are now to count in the total, and will go a long way towards securing preference to candidates, other than men who are now rankers. I wish to direct attention to another matter of urgency in connexion with the military review to be held on Monday next. It appears to me that some of the military officers are deceiving the Minister. On 31st October I asked the Minister, in reference to the consecration of banners and the holding of a military religious service, whether he would state - </para>

In the prayer which it is proposed to use at the consecration of the banners, constant reference is made to " Jesus Christ our Lord." Can such a prayer be acceptable to Jewish members of the Forces, or should we compel them to stay away ? Upon the 26th October last, the statement was made in this House that the prayer to be used would be acceptable to all denominations. Upon the 31st October, I asked if it would be acceptable to non-Christian members by reason of the constant references which it contained to " Jesus Christ our Lord." The Minister's reply was that he was not in a position to judge. I do not think that that statement is true. I then asked - </para>

                    <para class="block">I would point out that when a similar matter was discussed last year, the then Minister of Defence stated that he would permit members of the Permanent Forces to be absent from the ceremony if they had any objection to it. I regret that the present Minister does not intend to adopt an equally liberal attitude upon this matter. Last year, in consequence of the protests which were made by some of the churches, the members of the militia and volunteer forces were informed, immediately prior to the service, that if they did not choose to attend it, they were at liberty, during its progress, to parade in some other portion of the ground. Yet, despite what was 'done upon that occasion, the Minister has supplied incomplete and inaccurate answers to my questions. In order to be classed as efficient, a man in the militia has to attend a certain number of parades each year. If he does not, he is classed as non-efficient, and cannot draw his pay. It may be that some members of the Forces - if they cannot attend next Monday's parade - will be classed as inefficient. Last year three dominations made a public protest against the use of a similar prayer. Archbishop Carr publicly warned the Roman Catholic members of the Forces not to attend the service if this form of prayer were adopted. Of my own knowledge, some men absented themselves from that parade on account of the prayer which was used, although they might have required to attend it in order to be classed as efficient. I do not think that we should create such a position as that. We ought not to make the duty of any member of the Forces conflict with his religious principles. </para>

That is another matter into which the Minister might with advantage inquire. Although a promise was made by the Minister of Defence in the Watson Government that the practice would be discontinued, a volunteer who wishes to enrol in the Forces is still asked, "What is your religion?" I omit the reply to that question in every enlistment form that I am called upon to fill up. Why should any man be asked to state his religion ?

Last evening, as well as upon several previous occasions, when referring to the question of the Federal Capital Site and the relations of the late Minister of Home Affairs with the Government of New South Wales, the accuracy of my statements has been questioned. For instance, I have told the House that the late Minister of Home Affairs, when conducting negotiations with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers,</inline> the Premier of New South Wales, made a definite promise that He would submit the proposals of that gentleman to this Parliament.

The matter which he has brought forward is an important one, especially in view of the fact that in Australia we have no State religion. I do not think that we ought to permit anything to be done which will tend to create ill-feeling between the members of our Defence Force, owing to their religiousviews. </para>

                        <para>- In deference to the wishes of honorable members who desired to catch their trains, I brought my speech on. the motion for the second reading of this Bill to a somewhat abrupt termination last night, reserving the further observations that 1 wish to offer until the third-reading stage had been reached. I pointed out last night that in less than five years special appropriations to the extent of£454,500 had been put beyond the reach of our criticism, and I wish to emphasize the point that in this way we are seriously interfering with the parliamentary control of the public funds. If we are not careful we shall find that there will be practically nothing to discuss in connexion with the annual Appropriation Bill. One of the matters in respect of which I think the Government are deserving of condemnation is that they are allowing a state of affairs to exist in connexion with the Customs Department that is fraught with great danger to the Commonwealth. Under the Customs Act the Minister for the time being is placed absolutely above the law, and is given powers which should be absolutely repugnant to that sense of justice which ought to obtain in an Anglo-Saxon community. Nevertheless, this matter is so lightly regarded by most honorable members that an attempt to discuss it is practically resented by them. My objection to this state of affairs is not a new one. When the Customs Bill was under consideration I pointed out that under certain clauses there would be absolutely no appeal from the decision of the Minister. At the time the full force of my objection was not recognised by the House. Many honorable members inquired what harm could result from such a system, and urged that no Minister would dream of so exercising his powers as to inflict injustice upon any person having relations with the Department. But many cases have arisen sunder these provisions, in which the parties concerned would have appealed again and again from the arbitrary decision of the Minister had that course been open to them. We have placed in the hands of the Minister a power that must lead to very serious results. When the Customs Bill was before us the scandals connected with the Lands Department of New South Wales had not been brought to light, but I pointed to the unsatisfactory results which had attended the placing of arbitrary powers in the hand's of the Minister of Lands in that State, and urged that the absence of the right to appeal from the -decision of the Minister of Trade and Customs in regard to various questions would give rise to trouble. I appealed to the House not to pass clauses that would open the door to fraud and corruption of the worst kind. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hassell,</inline> whose name has been mentioned in the course of the investigation by the Lands Commission of New South Wales, was Minister of Lands in the State Government of which the present Minister of Trade and Customs was the head, and the force of public opinion in respect to his corrupt acts was such that he fled to South Africa. </para>

                            <para>- I am condemning the Minister of Trade and Customs for his neglect to 'bring forward an amending Customs Bill. The honorable gentleman must realize the danger arising from the exercise of these arbitrary, powers; but he seems to take a pleasure in availing himself of them. A sound administrator would not apply these far-reaching powers except to cases in which the complaint of his officers had been proved up to the hilt. One of the first principles of law is that here should be a remedy for every wrong; but that is a principle which we have largely overlooked. I do not feel inclined to continue, </para>

                        I object to the Minister having power to prevent a person who feels aggrieved by his decision from appealing to" the law courts. Such a state of affairs is little short of a public scandal, and the sooner we amend the Act in this regard the better it will be for every one. It is, to say the least, remarkable that when a manufacturer makes to the Minister substantial representations as to an alleged grievance, the honorable gentleman, without any inquiry as to the real facts, is prepared to induce the Cabinet to at once take action. Without considering whether the farmers or any one else except

The man must have made them with the knowledge of the falsehood, but in the hope that they would be acted on before the falsehood was found out.

Not satisfied with having done that, directly a Ministry comes into power which he thinks:, he can turn to his sweet will, arid! when he thinks that members will accept every representation of his as absolutely true, he comes here and interviews, first the Prime Minister, and then the leader of the Labour Party, while we have article after article appearing in. the newspapers. I a do not say that no man should ever wait upon a member of Parliament, but the evil effect of what' has happened is that it has become apparent to the country that a thousand and one persons may suffer without redress, whereas if a manufacturer with wealth at his back, and understanding how to address members, approaches them in a certain manner, his representations will be listened; to - that all he has to do to get full attention paid to his case is to go through a course of successful lobbying. </para>

I understand that at the present time he enjoys under the Tariff, and by reason of the distance of Australia, from other parts of the world, a protection which is in value more than the amount which he pays in wages, and yet it is proposed to hold him up to the country as a sufferer from some combination against him.

The honorable gentleman was no sooner in office than a higher valuation was put on imported harvesters, and in such a way as to prevent an appeal from the decision of the Department. That is my point against the Minister. If he had taken advantage of another section of the Customs Act, and compelled the importers to pay a higher duty, giving them the right to appeal against his action, the position would have been different. </para>

                            <para>- I was led aside by interjections, which I wished to answer, so that the impression might not be created that I was not prepared for them. Some years ago, when a provision similar to that in the Custom's Act was proposed to N» put into a New South Wales Mining Bill, placing the Minister above, the law, I pointed out the danger of such a course, although I was not at the time a member of Parliament. My prophecy in regard to the effect of the section in the Customs Act has proved correct. I object to the action of the Minister in preventing men from getting their cases tried in the Law Courts. If such action does not open the door to fraud, what action will do so? Does it not seem most irregular and unfair to so frame our laws as to deprive injured persons of redress? The Minister of Trade and Customs has now control over ^40,000,000 worth of imports, and by the Commerce Bill is to be given control over another ^50,000,000 worth of exports, and we are making his decision in all matters one from which there shall be no appeal. By placing him thus above the law, we open the door to fraud and corruption, if not immediately, in the near future. The matter is an important one, which is not to be brushed lightly aside. If the Minister of Trade and Customs had so dealt with those concerned in the importation of harvesters, and with those concerned in the importation of the hats which were seized by the Department, that they could exercise a remedy, nothing would have been heard of their cases; but, at the present time, 'persons so aggrieved can appeal only to Parliament, which does not seem disposed to amend the law, so as to enable these cases to be tried in the Courts. Parliament is not the proper tribunal to try these matters. It is not so constituted as to be able to judge correctly men's actions. We are a legislative body, whilst the Executive is an administrative body, and we have no right whatever to exercise judicial functions. I beg to direct attention to the state of the House. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed.]</inline> It is no light matter to absolutely take away from hundreds of traders their power of appeal against the dictum of the Minister of Trade and Customs. If they do wrong, they should be brought before a Court, and no attempt should be made by officials to ride rough-shod over them. I must call attention to the fact that the Government are unable to maintain a quorum. <inline font-style="italic">[Quorum formed:]</inline></para>

                    <para class="block">I am always determined to have a quorum present when I am addressing the House. We are perfectly justified in delaying the passing of the Appropriation Bill, because apparently the Government are unable to command sufficient respect to insure an attendance of twenty-five members. At present absolutely no redress is afforded! to traders upon whom injury may be inflicted by an unjust decision on the part of the Customs authorities. We have placed the Minister entirely above the law, and <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> this way n"ave outraged one of the first principles of justice. the present position of affairs is a scandal and a reflection upon Parliament, and we should apply the remedy as soon as possible. The Customs Act is drawn up so stringently, and so many remedies are provided, that the law car* easily be set in motion in order to punish offenders ; but I object to the Minister making himself the sole arbiter, and preventing matters from being submitted to a Judge who would be entirely above suspicion. </para>

                            <para>- I do not know what the Minister means by referring to " one of my friends." I do not know that any of my friends have offended against the Customs Act. My contention is that a court of law is the proper place in which to settle all matters in dispute. Whilst the question is merely one of honest difference of opinion between the Department and a trader, civil proceedings only should be taken. But where an attempt has been made to evade the Customs Act, a criminal prosecution should be resorted to. If the Minister contends that he has instituted civil proceedings against some firm' which should have been criminally prosecuted, be has failed in his duty. If an importer of leather of a well-known quality called it by a different name for the purpose of evading the Act, he should be criminally prosecuted, but if he introduced an article which might be used as a substitute for leather, but which was not intended primarily to be devoted to that purpose, he might fairly claim that the article should not be subjected to the duty imposed upon leather. Any importer arguing in that way should not be proceeded against in a criminal court. Then again, take the case of traction-engines, which were placed upon the free list. When the Customs Act was framed, the majority of honorable members no doubt thought only of steam traction-engines. But of late years petroleum has been largely used as a motive power, and many traction-engines are so constructed that petroleum can be used in driving them. For a long time there was a difference of opinion between the Customs authorities and the importers as to whether petroleum traction-engines should be placed on the free list, or be regarded as dutiable under the head of " engines and machinery" at per cent. No one would dream of proceeding criminally against an importer of a petroleum traction-engine who claimed that it should be admitted free. He might be quite correct in his contention, and, as a matter of fact, the Customs authorities have agreed that petroleum traction-engines shall be admitted free. The Minister increased the valuation of imported harvesters to £60 upon the evidence of a man who swore that he had received a letter from a man who had received a letter from some one else, stating the prices of the machines in Italy at a certain figure. The same man swore that the price of harvesters was just double what it proved to be. Some of the very harvesters in question are being sold retail in Australia for the sum at which they are valued for Customs purposes, although, according to the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr, McKay,</inline> the cost of distribution represents 26 or 27 per cent, of the invoiced price of the machine. Although the Minister of Trade and Customs is aware that harvesters manufactured in this State are being sold for about <inline font-style="italic">£60</inline> he has, for Customs purposes, imposed a similar value upon the imported article at its port of shipment. I need scarcely remind honorable members of what happened in connexion with the recent seizure of Panama hats. The invoiced value of that shipment was, roughly speaking, about £53. The hats were brought here to test the market, and, because similar goods had been sold at double the value which had been placed upon this consignment for Customs purposes, the Minister at once jumped to the conclusion that there was evidence of fraud. In order to insure that my opinions upon this matter should not interfere with my judgment, I made it my business to interview a well-known protectionist manufacturer in this State. I put certain statements before him, and I asked him what was his view of the invoiced value of the hats. </para>

                            <para>- No, he is a Victorian manufacturer. He pointed out that, to meet all demands that are likely to be made upon an importer of hats, it is necessary for him to order a very large stock. As some of the season's goods are sure to be thrown upon his hands, it is imperative that he should make a higher profit upon certain lines. He also pointed out that the selling charges frequently totalled 16 or 17 per cent., and that these should be added to the initial cost of the goods. Taking all these things into consideration, he thought it extremely probable that the valuation given by Messrs. Henty and Company was a fair one. </para>

                            <para>- No, he is a manufacturer. Whilst I do not propose to give his name publicly, I shall be very glad to supply it to the honorable and learned member privately. Another manufacturer informed me that it would be preferable to allow all these cases to be taken to the Law Courts. That is my point. I am not concerned as to whether or not the administration of the «. Minister is perfectly sound. I object to him taking advantage of certain provisions in the Customs Act to prevent these cases from being heard in the Law Courts. Why have we constituted judicial offices? </para>

                            <para>- It is absolutely impossible for any Honorable member of this House to devote proper attention to his public duties, and, at the same time, to conduct his own business. I am very glad that the honorable member for Bland has interjected,' because his remark induces me to touch upon a question which ought to have been dealt with long ago. When the allowance to members of this Parliament was fixed at £400 a year, it was contemplated that the Houses would remain in session for only three or four months during that, period. Nobody ever imagined that our labours would extend over six or seven months each year. </para>

                            <para>- I intend to do so. By neglecting to make some provision to reimburse honorable members the travelling expenses which they are called upon to incur, Ministers have failed in their duty. I have always strongly held that the present parliamentary allowance is insufficient. The position occupied by the representatives of the other States is very different from that occupied by the representatives of Victoria. Many persons are under the impression that the allowance of ^400 a year made to honorable members is in addition to the reimbursement of their expenses. It is unnecessary to say that that idea is an utterly erroneous one. If we assume that our expenses in Melbourne are 15s. a day - and surely that cannot be regarded as an extravagant estimate - it will be seen that our allowance is diminished by weekly, quite apart from our travelling expenses. </para>

                            <para>- Because attendance to my parliamentary duties does not press so heavily upon me. Some honorable members have had to neglect their own business in order to be in attendance here from day to day, and in the event of their defeat, after three years' service, they would find that, by reason of that neglect, their private affairs had suffered severely. We have no guarantee that we shall be reelected, and yet we speak of our membership of this House as if its continuance were assured. Provision is rightly made in the Appropriation Bill for the travelling expenses of our officers, and the same allowances should at least be made in respect of the travelling expenses of members .of the Parliament. We all feel that the question is one that ought to be grappled with, and yet we allow it year after year to remain untouched. The result is that the representatives of Victoria - to view the matter from a somewhat -unworthy stand-point - are far more fortunately situated than are other honorable members. Our desire, at the inception of Federation, should have been to place all members of this Parliament on a footing of equality. This has not yet been done, and I claim that the matter should receive the attention, not only of the Ministry, but of the House itself. </para>

                            <para>- I have not asked the honorable member to remain in the House for even a day. I have always been anxious that the supporters of the Ministry should* recognise that,, after all, legislation ought to be a matter of compromise. There ought not to be an attempt on the part of the majority to force their opinions upon a considerable minority. When a numerical majority has been secured by devious means, it is doubly incumbent upon those in the minority to resist such attempts.

                            <para>- I am afraid, sir, that I have for the moment drifted away from the question immediately before the Chair. If the present Ministry had informed the electors that they intended to pass certain measures, and, indeed, to rush them through both Houses of the Parliament, my objection to their present procedure to a large extent would have vanished. In those circumstances, I should have endeavoured' to assist in so shaping those measures as to carry out what I believed to be the1wishes of the people. That was the attitude which I took up in- regard to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill. I did not attempt to delay the passing of the machinery clauses of that Bill, but. I certainly objected to the attempt on the part of the majority to force upon those in a minority questions of principle which had not been submitted to the people. When a party avails itself of its majority to thrust its opinions upon those in the minority, it might just as well resort to the use of a club. But the days of the club are past. </para>

                            <para>- Every one wishes to rule. But for such a desire the honorable member would not have sought a seat in this House. I would remind honorable members that might does not make right, and that every measure which we pass, unless it be based upon a solid foundation of justice, will be a fresh cause of discord in the community. Another point is that every Bill that we pass increases the Federal expenditure. That expenditure is gradually growing. Turning to the Appropriation Bill, we find that the surplus returned to the States for the financial year, 1902-3, was, in round figures, £8,200,000. I admit that the revenue for that year was largely swollen by reason of the returns received, as the result of the drought, from the fodder duties. The Government then in office allowed the interests of a few corn merchants and others to override those of the great bulk of the community, who were unquestionably the sufferers. The surplus returned to the States in 1903-4 was, in round figures, £7,382,000; and in 1904-5, £7,141,000, whilst it is estimated that in respect of the current' financial year we shall return to the States £6,783,000. Honorable members will see from these figures that the position is becoming somewhat serious;,. It is estimated that for the current financial year we shall return to the States £1,400,000 less than we paid over to them for the year 1902-3. </para>

                            <para>- Who is responsible for the fact that the Tariff is so framed that the receipts are not an index to the prosperity or otherwise of the people ? There is not a quorum present, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker.</inline><inline font-style="italic">{Quorum formed.']</inline> The honorable and learned member for Corio this afternoon drew attention to a matter which seems to call for explanation. Apparently, owing to some blunder, because it could not have been' wilfully done, the form of prayer drafted for a service held in connexion with the consecration of banners at Albert Park last year proved objectionable to the adherents of certain faiths. I am not concerned to know what faiths were referred to, but whether their adherents are few or many, no injury should be done to their religious susceptibilities, nor should they be forced to lose efficiency pay for non-attendance at a religious service of which they disapprove. In this House arte men of all faiths and beliefs, and yet no honorable member has yet taken exception to the prayers with which out proceedings are opened. Surely, then, it would not be hard for the military authorities to frame a form of prayer which would be acceptable to all members of the Defence Forces. However, I shall not deal with the matter further, because I am sure that now that attention has been directed to it, the grievance complained of will be remedied. Coming to another matter, I am one of those who think that it would have been possible for the Minister of Home Affairs to provide for a complete redistribution of the electorates under the Electoral Act. If the officers of the Electoral, Department have not instructed the Minister to that effect, it seems to me that they have not done what they should have done. I have already pointed out, in regard to the Census' and Statistics Bill,, and the Representation Bill, that, in my opinion, they are unnecessary for the purposes of a redistribution of electorates, and that the House is being- needlessly burdened with work by being asked to consider them. I do not doubt the sincerity of the Minister of Home Affairs, but, in my opinion, the Ministry do. not desire to have this matter settled. In deferring its settlement they will be denying proper representation to the people of some of the States. I refer to this matter, because New South Wales is already entitled to another representative. Of course, it is possible that, later on, the representation in this Chamber may be reduced to seventy-two, the minimum provided for by the Constitution, which says that the number of the members of the House of Representatives should be twice the number of the members of the Senate. Of course, where a State has more than half the quota entitling her to a representative, she is given a representative as if she had the full quota, and in this way three States hare extra representatives ; but it is possible that when Tasmania and Western Australia become entitled by their population, instead of by the special provision in the Constitution, to the representation of five members, the number of members in this House will be reduced to seventy-two. Once we have passed' the Appropriation Bill the House will have lost all control over the Ministry, and it will rest with them to say when they will close the session. The programme put before us by the Prime Minister would indicate that the session is not to close before this time next year; but after there have been one or two tests of strength, he will probably come to a calmer frame of mind, and will acknowledge that the legislation which he proposes cannot be passed without full and free discussion. The Ministry seem disposed to shirk both the representation question and the Capital Site question. If they do not deal with the former it will come to be thought that they are trying to prevent New South Wales from obtaining the further representative to which she is entitled ; while there is already a feeling that the determination of the Federal Capital Site is being trifled with. The effect of the high duties in the Tariff has been to impose extra taxation upon the State of New South Wales, to the amount of about £1, 500,000 a year, which has created great dissatisfaction there. No doubt most sensible people look upon the import duties as taxation. But while the Treasurer calls them taxation, the Minister of Trade and Customs thinks it makes them more acceptable to call them protection. </para>

                            <para>- I merely wish to refer to it incidentally, and to point out that it will involve still further expense. The very costly report prepared by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maxwell</inline> will have to be paid for by the Commonwealth, and our expenses are daily being added to. Some years ago I pointed out to Ministers that we should, probably within a very short time, experience difficulty in finding sufficient money to meet the cost of administering the affairs of the Commonwealth. That time has now arrived. There is no question that if we provided for the interest upon the expenditure incurred upon State properties taken over bv the Commonwealth we should scarcely have enough money left to provide for the administration of the Acts we have already passed. The Government are showing utter recklessness in calling upon us to pass laws which will impose a further tax upon our resources. Every Act which is passed, whether it be good or bad, will necessitate the expenditure of more money. Under the Commerce Bill ft is proposed to exercise control! over the exports of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. Only the other day a Bill was submitted to the New South" Wales Parliament, under which it is proposed to spend a million pounds at the Barren Jack weir, which will have the effect of conserving a sheet of water quite as large as Sydney harbor. Consequently, that district to-day is in an entirely different position from that which it occupied when its claims were considered by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver.</inline> I have always considered that one of these two sites ought, to be selected. The men who will be called upon to reside in the Federal Capital will be chiefly married men. They do not desire to settle in a place where there is no accommodation for their wives and families, and I am sure that none of us desire to create such a condition of things that the Government would be called- upon to provide accommodation for them. I am satisfied that if the Seat of Government be removed to Dalgety it will be quite impossible for them to obtain the necessary accommodation. Therefore it is our duty to select some site which is easily accessible either from the capital of New- South Wales, or from some large town. Dalgety does not even possess railway communication . </para>

We are absolutely disregarding the Constitution upon two important points. When the Government deny to New South Wales that consideration to which she is entitled they ought not to expect us to sanction the passing of this Appropriation Bill.

                            <para>- I wish the honorable member would exercise a little of the common sense with which I believe he has been endowed. His interruptions would then be more relevant. I object to the Government bringing forward these matters at such a late stage of the session. I thoroughly agree with the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone</inline> that a sound control of the finances is absolutely essential to the welfare and progress of the country. No provision has been made in the Estimates for administering the Trade Marks Bill which the Prime Minister has declared the Government intend to push through the Houses before the session closes. Measures of that "description' cannot be administered without some expenditure. The position into which we are now drifting is an insult to the common sense of the House. Unless we insist that the whole of the taxation collected shall find its way into the Treasury the hands of this Parliament will very soon be tied, because we shall not have the necessary funds with which to administer any Act that we may pass. Two years hence, unless some extraordinary expansion of revenue occurs in the meantime, we shall find ourselves unable to pay our way. </para>

                            <para>- That is a mere bagatelle. If the honorable member has any fears in this regard, I would suggest to him that, knowing the value of his speeches, he should move that they be not reported. To return to the question which I was discussing when the honorable member interrupted me, I would point out that, in the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone,</inline> the progress of a. country is bound up with its system of finance. With a bad system we can never hope to progress, and we are retarding the progress of Australia by our failure to recognise an evident fact. I shall oppose, not only the present, but every other Ministry which fails to recognise the situation which I have endeavoured to point out. We must grapple with it sooner or later, and as sensible men we ought at once to deal with it. If my charges were untrue, honorable members opposite would vigorously attack me ; but they know that they are well founded. Unfortunately, the Labour Party are supporting a Ministry who have not the capacity to recognise the true position of the affairs of the Commonweatlh, and I hope they will be fittingly rewarded when next they go before the electors. </para>

                        <para>-The honorable and learned member for Werriwa has briefly and dispassionately entered his protest against the third reading of the Appropriation Bill being taken at the present juncture. He recognised that if we allowed the Bill to pass, the Government would be able at once to put up the shutters. My .chief object in rising, however, was to draw your attention, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> to a distinct invasion, on the part of the Government, of the privileges! of this House. Under the Standing Orders honorable members are permitted on every third Thursday to .ventilate the grievances of their constituents, upon a formal motion that the House resolve itself into Committee of Supply. Almost from the inception of this Parliament orders of the day in relation to Supply and Ways and Means have appeared upon our business-paper; but by what seems to have been a piece of sharp practice, the Government succeeded yesterday in discharging those orders from the paper. They have thus prevented . honorable members from airing the grievances of those whom they represent, but it seems to me that their action1 will' tend to retard rather than to facilitate business. The Government will have to obtain supply at the end of the present month, and I am inclined to believe that the motion to restore these items to the, notice-paper will provoke considerable discussion. </para>

                            <para>- I do not wish at this stage to raise a point of order ; but I hold that the action of the Government in regard to the discharge of the orders of the day relating to Supply and Ways and Means amounts to a dangerous invasion of our parliamentary privileges. Even if we pass this Bill to-night, it does not follow that another place will deal finally with it before further Supply! is required. Before we agree to its being read a third time, certain anomalies should be rectified. The Prime Minister assured us a day or two ago that he would introduce a Bill to remedy the grievances of the people of New South Wales with respect to the establishment of the Federal Capital. I find on the notice-paper to-day no mention of any measure dealing with the Federal Capital Site. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad to have that assurance from the Minister. We on this side of the House who represent New South Wales are in earnest in this matter, and I cannot understand a representative of that State allowing the Appropriation Bill to pass until we have received some satisfactory statement in regard to it. Though some honorable members appear to take the view that the people of New South Wales are not much concerned about the matter, the attitude of the local Parliament is an index to the popular mind there. The people of the State think that the question has been fooled with for the last five years, and that it is no nearer settlement now than it was at the beginning of the Federation. It <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> a strange thing that representatives of the State, like certain members of the Labour Party and the Minister of Trade and Customs, the Postmaster-General, and the Vice-President of the Executive Council, who know the popular feeling there on this subject, should be ready, in order to meet party exigencies, to shut their eyes to the true state of affairs. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that the Prime Minister will go back on his word, but I have too much experience of parliamentary affairs not to know that once an Appropriation Bill becomes law a Government can snap its fingers at Parliament. The representatives of Queensland have secured the introduction of the Sugar Excise Bill and the Sugar Bounty Bill, and it is the duty of the representatives of New South Wales to see that a measure providing for the settlement of the Federal Capital Site question is placed on the business-paper. The programme of business announced by the Prime Minister last night seems to me only a placard, since there remain only five weeks in which to carry it out. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable member for Southern Melbourne were in Opposition, and represented a New South Wales constituency, he would be doing what I am doing. In any case, I am responsible to my constituents for what I do. I am not speaking for the mere sake of obstruction, because I know that the Ministry and its supporters are strong enough to wear down the members of the Opposition. I may be parochial in my views, but it is my duty to defend the interests of the State which I represent. It is a fact, as the honorable and learned member for Werriwa stated, that any prominent man there could lead the people of that State to vote for secession. I ask the House to assist in allaying the feeling of the people of New South Wales upon the Federal Capital question, for the ascertainment of which the State Parliament may be regarded as a barometer. Some of the members of that Parliament may be influenced by personal considerations, but, seeing how much a small matter like the printing of stamps irritated that House the other evening, there must be a great deal of feeling a gains the Commonwealth for its actions towards that State. The discharge of the orders of the day for Supply and Ways and Means has taken from honorable members an opportunity to discuss grievances. </para>

If I were viciously inclined, I 'could use such motions as an engine for obstruction. I wish it to be known, however, that we are speaking in the public interest, and hot for party purposes. If all the members of the Opposition were in the same frame of mind as I am, they would not allow the Appropriation Bill to leave this House until some satisfactory assurance has been given regarding the settlement of the Federal Capital Site question. I trust that when the measure reaches the Senate, the representatives of that State, whose special business it is to guard the rights of the State, will see that the measure does not become law until the important stages of a Bill for the settlement of the Federal Capital question have been dealt with in this House. </para>

                        <para>- It seems to me that there is not much inclination on the part of honorable members to view the Federal Capital Site question impartially and without reference to party considerations. The only way in which we can do so is to review the facts of the case. I was a member of the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales when this matter was being considered by the first Commonwealth Parliament, and I well remember that the first Commonwealth Government communicated with the Government of the State, asking that something might be done to carry out the provisions of the Constitution in regard to the determination of the Federal Capital Site. The matter was discussed time and again in the local Legislature, and as the members individually were not sufficiently well acquainted with the various proposed sites to recommend any one of them as suitable, they determined that an expert should be commissioned to deal with the matter. They did not travel round the country themselves, as the members of this Parliament did, but appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver,</inline> a very able man, to do so. He took great pains to examine the various proposed sites, and the New South Wales Government went to considerable expense in furnishing him with every opportunity to fully consider the matter, with the result that he furnished a report which, I think, did him great credit. That report was forwarded by the New South Wales Government for the information of the members of this Parliament. Subsequently, when the cost of its production was provided for in the Estimates, the New South </para>

Dalgety came out at the top of the list. </para>

                            <para>- But it is included in the Monaro site recommended by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver. Mr. Oliver's</inline> report was sent to the Federal Parliament as a guide to the territories within which a site could be selected. The action of the New South Wales Government amounted to that or nothing. I do not think, from what I know of the Government at that time, that they acted without a due sense of the responsibility attaching to their action. We inspected the sites, and considered the reports of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver</inline> and of various experts, and, on the understanding that New South Wales would be prepared to make us the necessary grant, we selected a site within one of the territories recommended by the State Commissioner. We were, therefore, acting fully within our rights under the Constitution. Whilst I disagree altogether with the choice of Dalgety, I do not consider that the New South Wales Parliament has a leg to stand on in its view of the constitutional position. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Lang laid great emphasis on that aspect of the case. We know very well that, as a matter of parliamentary practice, a Government is bound by the decisions of its predecessors, and I do not think that it is worthy of honorable members to resort to such tactics as they have done, in order to defend the action of the New South Wales Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- I am speaking only of matters regarding which I have a personal knowledge. What was done in the fi rst Federal Parliament has no bearing upon the present situation. New South Wales having indicated to us through the report of their special Commissioner that they were willing to grant us a site in the territory in which Dalgety is situated, it seems to me that it ill becomes the State Parliament to denounce the Commonwealth foi having proceeded to make a selection. I treat this question apart from considerations attaching to this Government or that. It is one that should not be dragged down into the gutter of party politics either in the State or in the Commonwealth. The New South Wales Parliament has absolutely reversed the decision of its predecessors, and has endeavoured to throw obstacles in the way of a selection - which was made by this Parliament after a great deal of careful consideration. We went to the trouble of inspecting the various sites, and I venture to say we have a greater knowledge of their suitability, or otherwise, than have three fourths of the members of the New South Wales Parliament. Nothing that has been done by this Parliament can reasonably be construed as putting an affront upon the New South Wales Parliament, but it appears to me that the objection now being raised by the State Legislature is designed, not so much to promote a satisfactory settlement of the question as to cause public irritation. I have spoken to many members of the New South Wales Legislature, and I, have found that in five cases out of six they have practically no knowledge as to the suitability or otherwise of the sites which they themselves have recommended. It appears to me that it will be impossible to arrive at any settlement without referring the matter to the High Court. I entirely disagree with the honorable and learned member for Werriwa in the view he takes, that a friendly consultation bet wen the two Governments will result in a solution of the difficulty, because that would involve a reversal of the decision arrived at by a large majority in the State Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- That is' because the matter has become one of merely State concern. Looking! to the day when we shall' have a Federation in fact, as well as in name, and when all State jealousies shall have ceased to exist, we should endeavour to discuss this question apart from narrow prejudices, and select a site which will be the very best, not .in the interests of any particular State, but of the whole of Australia. That is my view of this matter. If the question of the Seat of Government had been discussed from that stand-point, we should not have selected Dalgety. But, unfortunately, it frequently happens that questions of great importance are subordinated to party influences and party intrigues to such an extent that it is impossible to get a proper decision registered upon them. When we were discussing the merits of the respective sites, what did we find ? Certain honorable members opposite were so anxious to obtain a seat upon the Treasury Benches that, in order to placate their supporters, they were ready to give their tacit approval to the sites which those supporters favoured. On the night that this question was being considered, the then Government were anxious to secure an adjournment of the debate, in order to afford every honorable member an opportunity to express his views. The Opposition, however, refused to agree to that course. They said, in effect, " We cannot trust the majority which is behind us to-night." </para>

                            <para>- I take no notice the honorable member's interjection. When we requested an adjournment of the debate, the leader of the Opposition, knowing that we had not the numbers to give effect to our desire, forced us to a decision upon the Capital Site question. Hence, a question of first-rate consequence was practically strangled in the middle of an important discussion. As a result, Dalgety was selected, although not by a straight-out majority of this House. In my judgment, Welaregang was the best site. Out of twenty-six honorable members who inspected it, twenty-two were convinced of its superiority over all others. </para>

                            <para>- Under ordinary circumstances, honorable members opposite would be very pleased to hear me speak upon this matter. But the moment an honorable member rises for the purpose of enlightening the public and unravelling the tangled skein in which this question is involved, we hear a howl from them. I am satisfied that if as many honorable members had inspected the Welaregang site as visited the other sites, it would have been selected by a very large majority. Instead, the selection of a site degenerated into a wrangle between three sections of this House. The honorable member for Dalley was so anxious that the lost sheep, whom he had managed to get into the Opposition fold, and upon whose vote the result depended, should not be permitted to escape, that he was opposed to the debate being adjourned1 until the following day. When the history of this Capital Site question comes to be written, not by partisan politicians, or by a partisan press, but by impartial onlookers, the public will regard the Commonwealth Parliament which selected the Dalgety site as having been an utterly incapable legislative body. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Lang occupied three hours of the time of the House in discussing this Bill last night. The longer he talked the less honorable members understood what he was saying. He was at great pains to read the correspondence which has passed between the Premier of New South Wales and the Prime Minister on this subject. I am not, however, going to follow in his footsteps. I will not weary the House by reciting a lot of matter which can be read in the press from day to day. I repeat that when the history of this question comes to be written it will cause people to blush with shame for those who sold New South Wales. </para>

I required him to withdraw that remark. The observation which he has just made is not by any means so offensive, but at the same time I point out that the use of these harsh terms; is calculated not to promote good temper, but to divert attention from the main issue. </para>

                    <para>Mr.WEBSTER. - I bow to your ruling, sir, and I respect your desire to see this debate conducted with decorum. At the same time, there are occasions when one is compelled to use strong language to make an impression upon those who do not appear to be amenable to reason. Before concluding, there are one or two other matters to which I desire to direct attention. One of these affects every honorable member of this House. I refer to the condition of the rolls which have just been circulated. Those for my electorate have been compiled in such a w.ay as to justify the statement that the whole system is deserving of the careful consideration of honorable members. As the result of a short tour through the constituency which I represent, a friend of mine discovered that no less than 800 names had been left off the rolls. He succeeded in having the names of 243 electors added to them. </para>

                            <para>- My experience may be that of other honorable members. Many people who have been living in the district for years find that their names have been omitted from the new rolls. The work has been scandalously carried out. I have already drawn the attention of the Minister to the matter, believing that if is too serious to be overlooked. If as the result of inquiries honorable members find that the collection of the lists of voters: for other electorates has been carried out in an equally careless way, it will be incumbent upon us to demand a complete reform, both in regard to the collection and the revision of the rolls. This is a matter which affects the representation of the people in this House. We are supposed to be elected upon the basis of adult suffrage, and it is imperative that we should take care that no one is improperly disfranchised. Another matter to which I desire to refer was dealt with by the honorable and learned member for Werriwa. I think that few honorable members will dissent from the view that the time has arrived when the Government should have the courage to make some provision, in addition to the ordinary parliamentary allowance, in respect of the travelling expenses of honorable members. The position of the representatives of Victoria is altogether different from that of the representatives* of the other States ; their attendance here does not involve sacrifices so great as those which other honorable members have to make. No objection is offered to the payment of allowances to officers of the public service whose duties require them to travel from place to place, and yet no provision is made in respect of the expenses which honorable members must necessarily incur in attending here. The members of the State Parliament of New South Wales occupy a far more favorable position than we do. Their allowance of £300 per annum goes much further than does the allowance of £400 per annum which members of this Legislature receive. We are also at a disadvantage in other respects. Those who represent the distant States have necessarily to remain from their homes month after month, and to leave their children to maternal guidance, which is not at all times sufficient. </para>

                            <para>- It is in some cases, but we all know that there are times when it is necessary, for the well-being of the children, that the father should be at hand. Children need paternal, as well as maternal, guidance, to keep them on the right path. I would point out that representatives of this State have not to leave their homes for any length of time. Most of them reside in the city, and their attendance here inflicts no hardship upon them. On the other hand, representatives of the distant States have to remain from their homes for many weeks at a time. ' They are in attendance here day after day, and night after night, and often keep a quorum whilst those who reside in this city are with their families. </para>

                            <para>- That is a matter which I leave to the determination of those who have control of the Federal purse. I do not wish to relieve the Government of the performance of a duty which should afford them the highest degree of satisfaction. It is not only in travelling to and from the Seat of Government that honorable members of this Parliament incur expense. It must not be forgotten that the Federal electorates are far larger than are those of the States. As a member of the State Parliament of New South Wales, I represented an electorate 100 milesl square, but that which I represent in this House is about 340 miles long by . 300 miles wide. If an honorable member desires to go among his constituents, as he ought to do, in. order to learn their views, and to tell them what he is doing for them, he must necessarily incur heavy expense. My constituency com- prises no less than five State electorates, and in this respect alone I am at a disadvantage as. compared with a member of the State Parliament. In the early days it was the custom for members of Parliament to hold their seats by a system of patronage - by subscribing to football and cricket clubs, bazaars, tea meetings, and so forth. This practice has been banded down. </para>

                            <para>- Members of the State Parliament of New South Wales are granted free passes over the railways in order to enable them to attend to their duties, and they are also granted a free railway pass for their wives, which extends over a period of one month. If they desire it they may obtain two free passes' for their wives for a period of fourteen days each, so that after a long absence from home they may give their good ladies a little recreation. But although members of the Federal Parliament must necessarily remain away from home month after month, and practically alienate themselves from their wives and families, no such privilege is extended to them. When an honorable member asks for a railway pass for his wife in order that he may afford her some little recreation after the sacrifice she has made to enable him to attend to the business of the country, he is at once informed that he may have a return pass to Melbourne, but he is. not allowed a ticket that will entitle her to travel elsewhere. What change is it to bring a woman from Sydney to Melbourne in summer, which is the season when we are generally in recess ? It is about time that some one spoke about the inadequacy of. the railway concessions made to the members of this Parliament, compared with those made to the members of State Parliaments. There is not a man in this House who does not agree with me that the salary of £400 a year which we receive <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> not sufficient, and that we are unjustly treated in the matter of railway concessions. Honorable members should have the courage of their opinions, and should demand that justice be done in this matter, even at the risk of their future exclusion from politics. There are several other subjects to which I should like to refer, but with which I shall not deal now, because I expect to have an opportunity to speak on them on other occasions. Some of the statements of members of the Opposition appear tome to be hardly just, but, seeing that they are now in a magnanimous or patriotic frame of mind, and are willing to cease hostilities, with a view to allowing the third reading of the Appropriation Bill to pass, I shall not refer to those matters now. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member knows all about the intrigues which took place. Those on this side of the Chamber had nothing to intrigue about. We voted for the site which we considered best, and, when defeated, voted for Dalgety as being a better site than that supported by the honorable member for Gwydir. Because the honorable member happened to be defeated in that matter, he talks about intrigues, and then leaves the Chamber without waiting for any reply to. be made to his statements. He spoke of his national aspirations, but I think that there are others in the Chamber whose aspirations are nobler than his. He told us that he looks forward to the time when the divisions between the States will be non-existent. I opposed the acceptance of the draft Constitution Bill, because it did not make the Colonies one nation, but kept alive the provincial divisions. I am still of the opinion that that is a bad state of things. The nobleness of the honorable member's aspirations was made very evident by his remarks about wanting a little more money. He thinks that he should receive a larger payment for his services to the Commonwealth. If he were to be paid by their value, however, I think that his remuneration would be decreased rather than increased. His remarks, instead of showing a national spirit, indicated selfishness. Apparently he has no thought for the. community, which would have to be taxed to pay him a larger sum. According to the honorable member's reasoning, because the New South Wales Legislature paid for ' <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver's</inline> report, it therefore determined the Federal Capital Site. Such a statement might be expected from the intellect responsible for it. The expense of that report had to be borne by the New South Wales Parliament, because it commissioned <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver,</inline> but in voting a sum of money to defray the cost of the report, its members did not bind themselves to accept the conclusions arrived at in it. The report was obtained to enable them to form an opinion as to the suitability of the various proposed sites. Those sites were not proposed by the Government of the State, but were suggested to the Commissioner by outside persons. The statement of the honorable member for Gwydir that the Parliament of New South Wales has no right to interfere in the matter now is absurd. I have not attempted to push forward a site which is situated in my electorate, and which I think would be the best site to select. </para>

                            <para>- I think so. The tendency of population is to increase more rapidly in that part of Australia north of Sydney than in that part which is south of Sydney, and fifty years hence the site of which I speak will be practically the centre of the population of the Continent. The wish of the people of New South Wales is that effect shall be given to the provisions of the Constitution by the selection of a site for the Federal Capital as near as possible to the 100-mile limit. It is not for me to discuss now the wisdom of the constitutional provision. New South Wales having entered into Federation because of its insertion in the Constitution, it should be respected, and effect should be given to it as soon as possible.' However, I have no wish to detain the House, and will, therefore, content myself with this protest against the statements of the honorable member for Gwydir, who is such an authority upon what is good and courteous behaviour. </para>

                        <para>- It was like a return to old times to find one's self listening spellbound to the torrential eloquence of the honorable member for Gwydir. I think that this is the first instance that we have had during the present session of his capacity to interest honorable members. I congratulate him on the fearless length of his remarks, and the Government <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> possessing a supporter capable of constraining members of the Opposition to reply to the arguments whereby he placed a new construction on a very old question. He traced the history of the attempts to select the Federal Capital Site, and seemed to think that the strict letter of the law should be obeyed, and all legal technicalities taken advantage of by the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- His inaccuracy is always taken for granted, so that I do not refer to it. I think that he regards the matter from the wrong point of view in holding the opinion that this matter should be dealt with by the ordinary process of law that would be resorted to by litigants, and not by way of friendly consultation. It is expedient that it should be arranged upon a thoroughly amicable basis. </para>

                            <para>- If a little diplomacy had been exercised that position would never have arisen. When it was found that the people of New South Wales were strongly averse to doing what was required of them, it might have been expected that the Commonwealth, which is dependent for its very existence upon the good- will of the States, would have endeavoured to meet them half way. It is essential to the well-being of the Commonwealth that this question should be settled forthwith, and to the mutual satisfaction of the Commonwealth and the State. There is not the slightest doubt that New South Wales strongly resists the claims of the Commonwealth, and all the statements that have been made by the honorable member for Gwydir - many of them inaccurate - cannot obscure the fact that the voice of the people of that State is expressed in the attitude taken by the New South Wales Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- There is not the slightest doubt that the attitude of the late Minister of Home Affairs was very different from that assumed by the present Government. His intention was to submit to this House the representations of the New South Wales Government. They were such that he could not see <inline font-weight="bold">Ms way</inline> clear to deal with them without consulting this House ; but he proposed that the matter should be placed before honorable members as early as possible, in order that they might give their decision. The present Government, however, are apparently determined not to afford honorable members any such opportunity. </para>

Discontent ls general, and it is to 'the interests of honorable members of this House not to permit that feeling to develop into hatred of the Federal tie, otherwise they will probably find their occupation gone. I do not wish to say anything more on this question. I should not have felt constrained to speak again but for the attitude assumed by the honorable member for Gwydir, who apparently is under the impression that this question demands the exercise of legal agility such as that undoubtedly possessed by the Attorney-General. It demands rather the display of statesmanlike qualities, and I tr ust that the Attorney-General and his colleagues will rise to the occasion. </para>

                        <para>- I should not have spoken at this juncture but for the fact that the honorable member for Gwydir went out of his way to attack honorable members of the Opposition, and myself in particular, in a most unwarrantable fashion. No matter upon what subject the honorable member speaks, he seems to be unable to avoid imputing unworthy motives to, and casting unworthy reflections upon, members of the Opposition. There was not the slightest necessity to import personalities into the discussion of the Federal Capital question, or to challenge the right of the Opposition to criticise the Estimates. Every honorable member has a perfect right to express his views, and it certainly ill becomes the honorable member for Gwydir to take any exception to the action of honorable members on this side of the House. I protest against the charges made against the Opposition of having sold the people of New South Wales in regard to the Federal Capital Site, and of having engaged in intrigues to that end. No one is better versed in the art of intriguing than is the honorable member for Gwydir, and he should be the last person in the House to charge other honorable members with indulging in that practice. His peculiar tactics in connexion with the selection of the Federal Capital Site are a matter of notoriety. It is characteristic of the honorable member to hurl charges across the Chamber, and then to run away from any criticism which his remarks may evoke. I distinctly told him across the table that I intended to challenge the truth of his assertions. The honorable member asserted that I had spoken for three hou.cs on the Federal Capital question last evening. I did not occupy the attention of the House for that length of time, although I addressed myself to a number of subjects. I simply rise now for the purpose df entering my protest against the accusations of the honorable member, which no one knows better than himself were wholly without foundation. I intend to assert my right to criticise any measures which are placed before the House for its consideration, and I shall certainly not be influenced by the intimidating methods of the honorable member for Gwydir. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to know whether certain honorable members representing New South Wales are in order in continually talking about secession, and threatening that New South Wales will withdraw from the Union unless we decide to establish the Federal Capital in a site of which it thoroughly approves. All this talk amounts to treason. Her late Majesty Queen Victoria signed the charter of the Commonwealth, it forms a part of the Constitution of the Empire, and when honorable members talk of secession they are acting as treasonably as did Jeff Davis, when he declared that' the Southern States would secede unless the nigger was made the master of the United States. I think it is about time that some one called attention to the fact that some honorable members are continually threatening that New South Wales will secede, and thus dissolve the Union. It seems to me that some honorable members are acting as secession messenger boys from the New South Wales Parliament. I protest against these continual references to secession. The Commonwealth Parliament has selected a Capital Site, which the New South Wales Legislature declares that it will not grant us. Consequently, I hold that we should remain where we are. After all, New South Wales constitutes only one-sixth of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- It is an incorporated company. In the form in which the measure left this Chamber, if a person accepted a secret commission he was liable to a penalty not exceeding £500, and also to two years' imprisonment, either as alternative or as cumulative punishment. In the case of a corporation £500 was also fixed as the maximum pecuniary penalty. That amount has now been increased to £1,000. Evidently the Senate is of opinion that, as we cannot imprison a corporation we should impose a higher pecuniary penalty. Even in the case of a corporation, however, an individual who is a party to the offence is also liable to imprisonment. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that we shall imagine anything of the kind. 1 recognise that honorable members will probably desire to discuss two or three of its clauses which in their opinion are of a contentious character. It will be recollected that the present Sugar Bounty Act will terminate at the end of 1906. The bounty now payable upon sugar which is produced exclusively by white labour is £2 per ton. Under the provisions of this Bill it is proposed to increase it to £3 per ton, and also to increase the excise duty to £4 per ton. Before the Bill was framed the Cabinet deemed it wise to obtain all the information that they could in reference to the sugar industry. Accordingly, they induced the Premier of Queensland to permit <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maxwell</inline> - who understands this question perhaps better than does any other man in Australia - to visit Melbourne for the purpose of making a report to the Government. I shall presently read from his report, because it contains some very valuable information - information which has influenced members of the Cabinet in the framing of these proposals. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maxwell</inline> was strongly in favour of the existing Act being extended for a term of seven years. The Cabinet, however, could not see their way to grant that extension, because the 'Braddon section of the Constitution will expire in the <inline font-style="italic">interim,</inline> and when that provision terminates, a readjustment of the financial relations between the States and the Commonwealth will be rendered necessary. Consequently it would be unwise to extend the operation of the Act beyond the period provided for. Several provisions have been included in this Bill which I should not have embodied in it, but for the experience which I gained in administering the present Bounty Act when I was in office upon a former occasion and now. There are several things in the measure which may not have been expected - and perhaps in the estimation of some honorable members are a little dangerous. But I do not think that after they have heard my explanation, they will be of that opinion. Clause 2 contains a provision of a very exceptional character. It has come to my knowledge that a good many of the planters who have been employing black labour desire to substitute white labour at as early a date as possible. In the absence of this provision, if they wished to participate in the bounty, they would be required to destroy the cane at present in their plantations, and a delay of several years would elapse before they could secure any return from replanted cane, and by the employment of white labour. In the past, any cane planted by kanaka labour had to be destroyed, to the injury of the planter, and before he was able to participate in the bounty. </para>

The provision to which I refer reads - "White grown cue or beet" means, sugar cane or beet produced on a white plantation, and in the production of which white labour only has been employed after the first day of January one thousand nine hundred and seven, or for a period of twelve months immediately preceding the delivery thereof for manufacture..... </para>

                    <para class="block">That is to say that if advantage be not immediately taken of this measure, an interval of twelve months must afterwards elapse before registration can take place and the bounty become payable.

                    <para class="block">It will thus be seen that those who have planted their crops by black labour will nob be debarred from at once participating in the bounty, provided that they dispense with that labour immediately on the passing of thi&gt;s Bill, and register under it. But for this provision such persons would not be able to obtain, the bounty next year, and that would be an inducement to them to continue to employ black labour, at all events, until the middle of 1906. The object of our legislation in this direction has been by every possible means to secure the substitution of white for coloured labour, not only on the cane-fields, but in other branches of employment. </para>

                        <para class="block">This clause is designed to cope with the practice of subdividing and leasing estates to aliens - a practice which I am informed obtains in , Northern Queensland. These alien lessees do not actually work on the plantations, but employ white labour. In some cases aliens own sugar plantations, but although the word "owner" appeared in the draft clause, it has been struck out. Under this provision an alien who has leased land for sugar-growing purposes will be regarded as a coloured worker, and even if he has employed white labour in its cultivation, will not be able to obtain a bounty in respect of his crop. Strong representations have been made in regard to the desirability of such a provision as this, but the representatives of Queensland are more familiar with the intricacies of this phase of the question than I am. At this stage I propose to give merely an outline of the objects of the Bill. Clause 6 deals with the rates of bounty to which I have already referred ; while clause 7 relates to the sugar-giving contents of the cane or beet. </para>

                            <para>- I propose presently to quote a return showing" that our legislation has not increased the employment of black labour on the sugar-fields, but that, to a large extent, it has driven alien labour northwards. This Bill will enable us to deal, perhaps, more stringently with the position of affairs in the north than we have hitherto been able to do. Clause 9 will do a simple act of justice to the aboriginals of Australia. The effect of the original Act has been to prevent the employment of aboriginals in the cultivation of sugar-cane in their own country. I do not think that that was the intention of Parliament. We know that they are not likely to enter into serious competition with white workers ; but, under the original Act, the bounty is not payable in respect of sugar produced by means of their labour. I have had to deal with a number of cases in which the Act has not been complied with, although there has been no infringement of the principle involved, and I have, therefore, considered it wise to provide in clause 9 that - </para>

In one instance, I had really to disregard the law in order to do what I believed to be a simple act of justice. A white woman had a son by a kanaka, and was subsequently married to a white planter. ' I was then asked to say whether the fact that this half-caste lad was doing odd jobs on the plantation would prejudice the right of this planter to secure the bounty. According to a strict interpretation of the law, it would!; but after careful consideration, I decided that, in- the circumstances, the bounty should be paid. Matters of this kind render the administration of the Act somewhat difficult, and in order that the Minister for the time being may be able to exercise his discretion in dealing with .such cases, I have provided by clause 11 that - </para>

                            <para>- I think it is, and that a definition of the words' to which I have referred, will be necessary. I have therefore asked the Attorn*- General to draft an amendment that will overcome the objection. If a crop were suddenly threatened by fire it would be ridiculous to say that the employment of any black labour available to save it from destruction should prejudice the right of the owner to secure the bounty in respect of it. I have now briefly explained the alterations in the original Act, and I believe that they are essential to the successful carrying out of the object which we have in view in passing legislation of this kind. Honorable members will be interested to learn what has been the effect of our legislation in regard to this industry. There are many who say that it has not been that which was anticipated, and that the quantity of sugar still produced by black labour is much larger than might reasonably have been expected. The returns show, however, that the increase in the output of white-grown sugar is much Larger proportionately than is the increase in the quantity of sugar produced by black labour </para>

The full results of the operations of 1905 are not yet to hand, but the figures given under this year in the table indicate that these increases are steadily progressing. The table shows, further, that the increases in the number of White Growers, and of registered areas, have transpired mainly in the Southern and Central Districts, and that a small relative progress has been made in the tropical north. The total number of all cane-growers in Queensland at the beginning of this year was 3,422.

                            <para>- Yes. I cannot quite understand why the price of sugar grown in Australia should be practically the same as that of imported sugar. We are approaching the time when we shall produce enough sugar for our own demands, and I hope that when we do so the price of locally-grown sugar will be much less than the price of imported sugar. Of course, the excise duty helps to keep up the price of locally-grown sugar, but it should not be as high as it is. </para>

It is necessary that areas that have not been yet brought under white conditions shall not be at any time prevented from doing so by restrictive - regulations. It is also to be advised that provision shall be made for the re-registration of areas which were placed under white conditions, but which have lapsed, and become again ineligible for earning -bonus. These primary registrations were made in good faith, and the lapses have been due, in the most part, to the unripeness of the conditions necessary to the change from black to white production. Unless such modifications in the administration are made, the progress of the bonus legislation will be blocked by its own provisions. </para>

In the year 1901 there were 2,610 cane-growers in Queensland. At the beginning of the current year there were 3,422 growers, and 2,681 of this total, at this date, are registered to grow cane under the white conditions. These white growers have not registered all of their lands suitable for growing cane ; neither have they earned the bonus upon the whole that was registered. Nevertheless, 78 per cent. of the total number of cane-growers have placed themselves upon the lines which lead to an ultimate white basis of the industry. </para>

This will represent, by way of excise, a sum of £800,000 per annum. The estimated production of white-grown sugar in 1907 is set down at 107,000 tons; in 1908, at 122,500 tons; in 1909, at 138,000 tons ; in 1910, at 153,500 tons; and, in 1911, at 169,000 tons. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. I have no doubt that the importations of foreign sugar into New South Wales this year will not amount to much more than 5,000 tons. The total quantity of Australian grown sugar consumed in the Commonwealth last year was 121,817 tons, whilst 45,862 tons of foreign-grown sugar were imported. It is estimated that we shall grow nearly sufficient this year to satisfy our own requirements, and, whilst I cannot forecast what the actual importations will be, I am satisfied that they will be very small. I have endeavoured to place the fullest information before the House in regard to this question, and the preparation of the tables I have read has involved considerable labour. I feel that the amendments proposed to be made, by means of this Bill, in the original Act will be found to work beneficially, and that they will render it unnecessary for the Minister to resort to illegalities in order that justice may he done in cases where the spirit, if not the letter, of the law has been observed. </para>

                            <para>- It is true that I promised to consider that question, but the matter is one that could not be dealt with in the Bill now before us. The honorable member introduced a deputation from jam manufacturers and others, who put their complaints before me, and I may say that, although a determination has not yet been arrived at, the matter has been discussed by the Cabinet. One of the requests made by the deputation was that a drawback should be allowed in respect of the sugar used in jam for home consumption. That was a proposal which I could not at present entertain. </para>

                            <para>- I know that that is the claim made by the jam manufacturers. The officers of the Customs Department maintain, however, that the quantity of sugar used in the manufacture of jam is mot as large as the manufacturers assert, and' they hold that the granting of a drawback amounting to five-sixths of the duty is a fair compromise. 1 have discussed the matter with the Comptroller-General, as well as with some of my colleagues, and I fail to see why, if the sugar is used as claimed by the manufacturers, they should not be allowed the full rebate in respect of it. Instructions have been given for further tests to be made as to the sugar contents of the jam, and drawback will be allowed on the full quantity used. </para>

                            <para>- It would be rather a difficult matter to ascertain the quantity of preserves made by every housewife. At any rate, I do not think there is any occasion to discuss the subject at the present moment, because it is financially out of the question. If there is any point which I have not touched on, in regard to which honorable members wish for information, I should like to be reminded of it. I have rapidly gone through a mass of figures, showing the effect of our legislation up to the present, and honorable members will find the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maxwell</inline> a very valuable document, the perusal of which will, I think, cause them to come to the same conclusions as have prompted the proposals of the Government. </para>
