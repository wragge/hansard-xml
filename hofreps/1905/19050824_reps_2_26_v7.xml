                    <para>- In one of The Melbourne newspapers published this morning, it is stated that I voted last night for the amendment of the honorable member for Dalley, whereas I voted with the Noes, as I did not consider that the charge made against the Attorney-General &#39;haJ been substantiated. As the journal it&#62; question has a large circulation, I think it due to myself and my constituents to make this explanation. </para>

                        <para>- It would appear from the answers to questions asked in the Senate yesterday, published in one of this morning&#39;s newspapers, that a daily allowance of 25s. is paid to the members of the Royal Commission on the Tariff. The statement of the Government, through its mouthpiece in the Senate, is that this allowance is not to be paid to the members of the Commission who are also members of Parliament, rf the Commission is sitting in Melbourne while Parliament is &#39;in session, but if the Commission is sifting in Melbourne when Parliament is not in session, it is to be paid to such members of Parliament as do not reside in Melbourne. Further, when the Commission sits in a State other than Victoria during the session of Parliament, the allowance will be paid only to those members of Parliament who are members of the Commission who do not reside in that particular State. The answers would seem to indicate that if the Commission is sitting in Melbourne, the Chairman, who lives in Victoria, will be paid for attending its meetings, but that <inline font-style="italic">a&#62;</inline> member of Parliament residing in a State other than Victoria attending a meeting in that State will not be so paid.

Its Chairman has been from the first one of the causes of the Commission&#39;s barrenness. He had the direction of its efforts, and instead of taking such steps as would have made possible a progress report upon a few of the most urgent cases, he has dissipated his. inquiries over a wide range of comparatively useless investigation. He has made the mistake from the first of endeavouring to magnify his office rather than of making it useful. He has talked grandiloquently of a &#34; monumental report,&#34; when common sense pointed to a limited and specialized&#39; effort. It is a matter of common gossip in the lobbies of the House that he has entirely failed! to obtain the confidence of his fellow Commissioners. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, as the Ministry is ready, when necessary, to take action to defend itself. Not a day passes but criticism of the most hostile character appears in regard to the actions, not only of Ministers, but of Departments, and of public servants; but it is recognised that one of the conditions of free speech in a community like this is that the most opposite and antagonistic opinions shall be permitted to find expression. As one acquainted with the views of the Chairman of the Commission, I know that nothing is further from his wish than that delay should occur. He has been from the first most anxious to press forward the inquiry at all times, and having made great sacrifices in accepting the office of Chairman, is prepared to make even greater sacrifices to expedite the work of the Commission. What is implied by the &#39;article which has been read is that the newspaper in which it is published is, in accordance with its policy, pressing in the strongest fashion for the early consideration of certain specific industrial complaints. Because the Chairman of the Commission has not adopted the line of action which the writer considers best, he censures him, as public&#34; men are continually being censured, without what appears to me an adequate allowance for difference of views or consideration of all the facts surrounding his work. The task of the Commission is one of the most complex and intricate which could well be cast upon any body of men. The Commission having thought fit to approach the work in a judicial manner, the newspaper contends that another course should have been adopted. No doubt there are a number of persons outside injuriously affected by the existing Tariff who hold opinions similar to those expressed in the press, and who give utter - ance in the strongest language to the view that their cases - that is, the cases of special hardship - should be first considered. </para>

                            <para>- Order! I would point out that under the Standing Orders no question containing argument can be put, and that Ministers, in replying to questions, are not permitted to indulge in argument. The question was put in a proper form, and the Prime Minister was replying in perfect accordance with the requirements of the Standing Orders ; but by interjection he has been drawn into a discussion of the question, and I would remind him that he would not be in order in continuing to argue it. </para>

                            <para>- I confess that I was drawn aside from a direct reply to the question. I desire to say that such knowledge as I have of the proceedings of the Commission, and of the opinions and intentions of the chairman, do not justify the comment upon him to which reference has been made. At the same time, as every honorable member holds his own opinion on this subject, so the great journals of the State are entitled to express theirs. I wish, however, that a purely intellectual argument could be conducted without the introduction of feeling such as has been manifested both inside and outside of the House. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member for Hindmarsh was kind enough to move the adjournment of the debate a fortnight ago, in order to enable me to speak. I desire to thank the honorable member for Darling for having very kindly taken charge of this motion in my unavoidable absence from the House. I have read the discussion which has taken place, and I feel sure that it is not necessary for me to add anything to what has been stated by the mover, who has covered all the ground. I was pleased to notice that very little objection was urged to an inquiry into the subject. The Prime Minister has moved some amendments which I readily accept. I desire that this Committee shall obtain all possible information, with the idea of the Commonwealth Government ultimately becoming the owners of the steamers which carry the mails between Australia and England, because I feel sure that only when that change has been brought about shall we overcome the difficulties which beset us at present. I do not contemplate that the operations of such a line of steamers would be confined to the carrying of mails, but that it would also convey passengers and cargo. I am very strongly in favour of the Commonwealth acquiring a fleet of steamers which will be capable of carrying the mails between here and Great Britain, and also of entering into ordinary business, such as is conducted by the present mail companies. I am contented that the whole question should be inquired into by a Committee, even though my ultimate objective is not made the main subject of inquiry, because I believe that all the arguments that could be brought to bear against my proposal would not be sufficient to outweigh the evidence in favour of Commonwealth ownership of the mail steamers. I understand that some objection is raised, and possibly with some degree of fairness, to the personnel of the Committee. One of the reasons why the Committee as it now stands is not fairly representative of both sides of the House is that when my motion was first framed the Reid Government were still in office. Since then, of course, the disposition of parties has somewhat changed. The honorable member for Parramatta pointed out that too many members of the Labour Party had been nominated on the Committee. </para>

                                <para>- I originally nominated eleven members, but the Prime Minister suggested that the number should be reduced, and I agreed to the elimination of the names of the honorable member for Grampians and the honorable member for Bourke. The former honorable member consented to be nominated merely as a personal favour to myself, because he was busy in connexion with the Old-age Pensions Commission and in other ways, and afterwards the name of the honorable member for Bourke was withdrawn. Upon the withdrawal of these names five honorable members of the Labour Party and four other honorable members were left among those nominated. The honorable and learned member for Angas asked me to withdraw his name, as he was very busy, and the honorable and learned member for Wannon also desired that his name should be withdrawn. As that would leave upon the Committee too many members of the Labour Party. I now move - </para>

In the first place, it was proposed that the Committee should have a socialistic objective, but the modification suggested by the Prime Minister places it in quite a different category. If the. fullest possible information be obtained! with regard to the conditions under which mails, passengers, and freight are carried between Australia and the , old country, the very greatest benefit will be conferred upon our people. </para>

                            <para>- I take it that the honorable member feels that the amendment of the Prime Minister would preclude him from making the direct inquiries he first contemplated. Whilst certain honorable members might reasonably have declined to act on a Committee with an object such as that first proposed, it seems to me that no one need shirk the responsibility of assisting to conduct an inquiry such as that now contemplated. I am satisfied that if the matter is thoroughly investigated the very greatest benefit will result to the mercantile community, because excessive commissions have now to be paid by shippers who send cargo from Australia to the other end! of the world. The conditions that prevail in&#39; respect of the carriage of our mails are familiar to honorable members, and will require very careful investigation. I am sanguine that evidence elicited from witnesses who would appear before the Committee would prove of very great assistance to honorable members, and I venture to predict that the next mail contract which is entered into -with any&#39; of our large shipping companies would contain very much more favorable conditions to the Commonwealth than does the existing contract, owing to the information which would be derived from men who are thoroughly conversant with the conditions that obtain in the shipping circles of Austrafia. </para>

                                <para>- I believe that the honorable and learned member is correct in affirming that a Royal Commission could investigate this matter much more thoroughly than could a Select Committee; but I have not risen for the purpose of proposing any amendment to the motion. At the same time, I think that the honorable and learned member for Illawarra has made a very valuable suggestion. I am of opinion that the Committee proposed would accomplish much more good than is at present conceived by this House, and that its report would prove of a most valuable character. I support the amendments of the Prime Minister. </para>

It seems to me that if a return were prepared showing, the cost already incurred by the Commonwealth in Royal Commissions, the public would be staggered by the bills which have been paid by the Treasurer. </para>

                                <para>- The tendency to appoint Select Committees and Royal Commissions without rhyme or reason simply because some honorable member suggests a &#34; catchy &#34; question, is absolutely unjustified. To-day the honorable member for Barrier merely endorsed a bald resolution - he did not attempt to support it by any evidence showing that an inquiry into this matter is warranted. No man, I claim, can determine the limits to which an inquiry by this fossicking expedition would extend. If it is to be of any use at all, its members would have to visit, not only the centres of the -leading States of Australia, but probably the United Kingdom. </para>

                                <para>- The data submitted is not sufficient to warrant the House in countenancing the motion for one moment. If it can be shown that excessive charges are being made by .the mail companies, or that there is inefficient transport of the mails, there might be some justification for the proposal. But it is preposterous to institute a fossicking expedition simply upon a bald resolution, and no one should more keenly oppose the creation of such a body than the Prime Minister himself. If he wishes to husband the financial resources of the Commonwealth, now is his opportunity to do so. If he fails in his duty in that direction, what is to prevent any honorable member from tabling a seductive resolution in favour of the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into almost any matter coming within the purview of Federal legislation? Under such circumstances, it is easy to conceive of the whole House being busily employed in travelling round the country. The history of this Parliament has been characterized by the appointment of too many Select Committees and Royal Commissions. Only to-day we find one of the powerful Melbourne newspapers voicing its dissatisfaction with the work of the Tariff Commission. In the face of such an expression of opinion, are we to appoint another Committee of the character proposed ? Every honorable member must have heard the absolutely indecent wrangle, which took place in the Chamber this afternoon regarding the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the proposed Committee. In the blandest manner possible, we heard the honorable member for Barrier suggest the names of certain honorable members to serve on that  body,  four of whom are direct members of the Labour Party and two others in the closest sympathy with them - I refer to the honorable member for Riverina and the honorable member for Bass. </para>

                                <para>- I will not go so far as to say that ; but certainly those two honorable members have shown themselves in sympathy with the caucus movement, and caucus legislation, lt lias been proposed that six honorable members from the other side of the Chamber, -and two honorable members from the Opposition shall serve upon the Committee. What respect could the Commonwealth pay to the recommendations of a body of that character. In view of the fact that the Ministerial party number only nineteen all told, whereas the Opposition, excluding <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> totals twenty-eight members, it would be a lop-sided Committee. The balance of the House is represented by members of the Labour Party. Tested from the stand-point of those figures, not even proportional representation is proposed in regard to the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Committee. I say that before appointing any further Select Committees, we should tabulate the cost of Royal Commissions and Select Committees up-to-date, and let the public judge for themselves how little return they have received from the expenditure incurred in this direction. Moreover, the House has yet to decide that it is socialistically inclined. I could understand the Prime Minister declaring that it was the policy of the Government to introduce a system of State ownership of steamers; but for a private member to take that stand, and for this Chamber to indorse it, would be an admission that we are prepared to receive from a Committee a report of a socialistic character. Until more reliable data is forthcoming, I shall oppose the appointment of this or any other Select Committee. </para>

                        <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCaY</inline>(Corinella^.- When this motion was submitted, I must confess that I felt some surprise at finding that the Government concurred in the appointment of the Select Committee even with the modifications proposed by the Prime Minister. It is perfectly obvious from the honorable and learned gentleman&#39;s amendments, tha; the Government are not at present prepared to consider as within the pale of practical politics the suggestion of the honorable member for Barrier that a fleet of steamers should be purchased and controlled by the Commonwealth. But instead of taking up the bold position of declaring that they would not sanction the appointment of a Select Committee to inquire into that matter, the Government emasculated the resolution and were content to saddle the country with an unknown expense, notwithstanding that there was no hope of reward accruing to the community from such an investigation. I understand that the honorable member for Barrier has accepted the amendments of the Prime Minister. This i&#39;s a motion which came in like a lion, and is going out like a lamb of very poor quality - a lamb which certainly would not be graded under the Commerce Bill as fit for export. If there was any prospect of the inquiry proving of some benefit to the community, I should not stand in the way of the appointment of the Committee. But what is to be gained from such an investigation? It is proposed to appoint a Select Committee to make full inquiry as to the carriage of mails, passengers, and cargo, between Australia and the United Kingdom. Can such a body acquire from any source, information which cannot, and should not, be &#39;acquired by the Government in the course of its duty? What source of information will be open to the Committee which is not accessible to the Postmaster-General and his Department ? </para>

                                <para>- I beg the honorable and learned member&#39;s pardon. Committees are usually appointed only when it is reasonably clear that they can gain information which is not so readily available to the Departments of the Commonwealth. I say without hesitation that the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department can secure more, reliable information, and in a less space of time, than can possibly be acquired by the proposed Committee. The object of the motion is perfectly clear. The honorable member for Barrier and his friends in the Labour corner, would constitute a majority of the Committee, inasmuch as there would be five members of their party upon it, out of a total of nine members. In other words, there would be a majority of gentlemen serving upon it who have the reputation - deservedly or otherwise - of being Socialists, and who have no hesitation in affirming that Socialism is the proper form of government to adopt. They exhibit r.o lack of boldness in proposing the first big experiment- in the direction of nationalization - an experiment in which it would be quite impossible for the State to succeed. This proposal would mean more by a great deal than the nationalization of a monopoly. It would mean the nationalization of a service which could not be made a mono- , poly, except by subjecting the commercial community to such enormous inconvenience that even our socialistic friends would shrink (from tackling the job. That is the nature of the proposal in its original form, but though the Prime Minister has taken rill the heart out of it, these bold Socialist warriors are content to accept everything that has been proposed by way of amendment. I can understand a man holding a view, and standing up for it; but I must confess that I am surprised at the attitude of those who, having made a suggestion of this kind, and having resolved to institute a fishing inquiry, which cannot result in any good, have abandoned the whole principle concerning which they desired to nave an investigation. What does the honorable member for Barrier expect such a Committee to accomplish? I notice that the Postmaster-General in the Watson Administration is to be a member of it. What does he expect to find out as a member of the Committee that he could not ascertain as Postmaster-General ? </para>

                                <para>- We have seen witnesses giving evidence upon oath before Select Committees and before the Tariff Commission. I am not going to say that they are prepared to swear lies ; but I do say that sworn evidence is not always the best testimony which can be obtained. I do not wish the Commonwealth to incur further expense by the appointment of a body cf this character without some justification being shown for it. Not a word has been said to justify any such proposal. There has not been a suggestion that wrongs exist which can be righted by means of the information which would be furnished to this House and the community by a Select Committee, and, until that has been done, no case can be made out for its appointment. This is the first Select Committee whose appointment has been asked for without any justification being shown for its creation. The question of the carriage of mails, passengers, and cargo between Australia and the United Kingdom is undoubtedly a difficult one, but it is not one which can be settled by the sort of information which this Committee could elicit from the witnesses it is likely to examine. For example, would it call the representatives of shipping companies and force them to disclose all the secrets of their business - a power which I doubt very much whether it could exercise? If that is intended, I venture to think that its members are more sanguine than they are justified in being. No arrangements( are made between the Commonwealth and shipping companies other than by open bargaining in the ordinary course of business. If it be suggested that the Commonwealth is at present paying money for the carriage of its mails which it ought not to pay, no one knows better than the honorable member for Coolgardie that, as far as the existing arrangements are concerned, it could not have hoped to get its work done at a less cost. </para>

                                <para>- -That is the point. The honorable member ought to know that a contract for the carriage of mails between Australia and the United Kingdom is not to be undertaken by any one unless he can satisfy the Government that he is a man of substance. Speculative brokers who make&#62; offers to the Commonwealth to carry out large contracts, without giving any substantial guarantee of their ability to perform them, are not to .be seriously regarded. When the honorable member for Coolgardie interjects that if there were not a shipping ring in existence this, service might be carried out at a more reasonable cost, he betrays what, after all, may be the intention - although, perhaps, the unconscious intention - of the majority of the proposed Select Committee - that is, to find that no satisfactory arrangement can be made for this service in the absence of a nationalized system of steamers. In other words, those who are to be appointed to this Select Committee wish to deal with the whole question in a way that the amendment was designed to prevent. </para>

                                <para>- Even if the motion be passed as amended, the Select Committee, if it finds that the evidence justifies it, may report that the Commonwealth alone can properly carry out this system. The Prime Minister could not possibly have realized that fact when he moved the amendment, otherwise he would have opposed the motion. I am not going to be a party to inquiries that suggest that the Commonwealth is going to attempt to become a public owner in the very direction in which public ownership would be accompanied by difficulties - difficulties far greater than those which must naturally surround the ordinary assumption of such powers. A monopoly cannot be created in this direction. I should &#39;have thought that the socialistic party would begin with something less ambitious than a proposition of this kind. If, on the one hand, the motion, as amended, will mean nothing more than an inquiry into facts, with which every one is fairly well acquainted, and which certainly could be ascertained with verv little difficulty by the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department, I cannot support it ; and if, on the other hand, it will leave the Committee, with its majority of avowed Socialists, open to discuss the whole question as originally proposed, I must still vote against it. I should be very glad to hear some reason, good, bad, or indifferent, for the creation of this Select Committee, and as to why the Government should be ready to indulge so cheerfully in further expenditure in this direction. Public funds have apparently no useful purpose to serve. I am ready to be convinced of the justice of any case, but those who question the wisdom of appointing this Committee are entitled to expect its advocates to give some reason for its creation. We should .not vote for it merely because it has been submitted by a member of a party which controls the movements of the House, and has been agreed to by its obedient supporters in an altered form. Are we to support the motion simply because honorable members in the Ministerial corner say, &#34; We have the numbers, and are going to have this inquiry in some form or other.&#34; That seems to be the position, and until some good reasons are adduced for the appointment of the Committee, we shall do wrong in agreeing to the motion. </para>

I, for one, however, wish to know why the Commonwealth should have to pay so much for the carriage of its over-sea mails? </para>

                                <para>- That was the effect of the words which the late Postmaster-General used when dealing with the question. The honorable member for Parramatta is not always very careful in the choice of his words, but I am quite prepared to accept all responsibility for any statement I may make. It is well known that until quite recently we paid &#163;70,000 per annum for the carriage of our mails between Australia and the United Kingdom, and that the Orient Company endeavoured to extract &#163;150,000 a year from the Government in respect of this service. Those who are always ready to raise the socialistic bogey asserted that the demand for an increased subsidy was due to the trend of socialistic legislation -that it was practically the result of the provision in the Post and Telegraph Act that black labour shall not be employed on subsidized mail steamers. Much to their chagrin, however, they found that the company would not support them in that contention. The company itself admitted that the demand for an increased subsidy was not due to the white labour provisions of the Act. </para>

The honorable member for Grey can discuss the question of the mail contracts only in so far as it relates to the motion for the appointment of a Select Committee. </para>

                                <para>- I was not aware that I had exceeded my right in this respect, and I venture to submit that the whole question of the carriage of mails may be reviewed under cover of this motion. I do not intend, however, to assist the opponents of the proposal in their desire to delay the appointment of the Select Committee. The Orient Company now charge something like &#163;800 for the carriage of a ton of mail matter to England, although they will carry a ton of merchandise at from &#163;1 to &#163;3. As a matter of fact, the charge which they make for the carriage of frozen produce is only about &#163;4 per ton-- </para>

                                <para>- The honorable member will find that for some years very little saving of time has taken place. We have now entered into a contract with the Orient Company for the carriage of our mails from Australia to the United Kingdom at a cost of &#163;120,000 per annum. It is nothing to honorable members of the Opposition that we should throw away a large portion of that sum of money, and in their opinion it is monstrous that an honorable member sitting in the Ministerial corner should suggest an inquiry into the whole of the circumstances surrounding the carriage of our oversea mails. When such a proposal is made they urge that it is a socialistic one. Everything depends upon the brand of Socialism put forward. I am satisfied that if the question were put before the public they would indorse my contention, that it is only reasonable for us to inquire whether or not we ought to pay &#163;120,000 a year for this service. </para>

                                <para>- Honorable members of the Opposition profess to be against any kind of Socialism, but when a socialistic proposal like a mail contract is brought forward, they call it State control. I have very great pleasure in supporting the motion, though I do not bind myself to vote for the proposed <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Committee. I wish for are investigation into the arrangements for the carriage of our mails, because I think that it will show us how we may save, not the few paltry pounds that the inquiry will cost, but thousands of pounds, both in the present and in the future. </para>

                            <para>- Before the honorable member for Barrier adopted the amendment of the Prime Minister, there was something to be said for his motion as a straight-out socialistic proposal by one whom we all know to be one of the strongest Socialists in the House, if not in Australia. But, in deference to the Prime Minister, who, with his colleagues, are the servile members of the socialistic party which controls from the corner benches the destinies of Australia, he has agreed to throw on one side his socialistic principles. I have heard no reason from him for the appointment of the proposed Select Committee, though I have listened very carefully to what he had to say. </para>

                                <para>- I am speaking for myself, and I did not hear the honorable member give any solid reason for the appointment of the proposed Select Committee. The Committee, if appointed, is to inquire into the carriage of mails, passengers, and cargo between Australia and the United Kingdom. As has been suggested by the honorable member for North Sydney, we might fairly trust the Government to give us all the information available in regard to the carriage of mails. There is no possibility of a Committee obtaining information in regard to the question from any source which, is not available to the Government. So far as passengers are concerned, they may verv well be left to look after themselves. Those who travel on the mail boats between Australia and the old country are not the class of persons about whom honorable members like the socialistic member for Barrier concern themselves. What we are all concerned about, however, is the carriage of cargo. Seeing how much Australia is dependent upon. her. export trade, the carriage of cargo from Australia to England and other countries is a matter of very great concern to her producers. But I ask the honorable member for Barrier how the proposed Select Committee can obtain any information, on this subject which could not be obtained from Sussex-street Sydney, or from Flinders-street, Melbourne. Has he any idea as to the present rates of freight prevailing? I undertake to say that neither he nor six of the other proposed members of the committee, if they were questioned on the subject, would be able to inform the House what rates are paid now for the carriage of perishable produce from Australia to London. The only two members whom it is proposed to appoint to the committee who have acknowledge in connexion with the subject are the honorable members for Flinders and Macquarie. We can get from the Government all information about the carriage of mails, the passenger traffic does not concern us, and for an investigation into the carriage of cargo, the honorable member for Barrier should at least have procured the services of men who would properly represent the big producing interests of Australia. I object to the appointment of the Committee, because I think that the investigation proposed is not what is needed, and that the proposed <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> is unsuitable. </para>

We must necessarily have such information before we can indorse any new contracts with steam-ship companies. We wish to knowhow the increasing requirements of Australia are being met, and whether there is any truth in the statement which is continually being made by newspaper writers and public men, that Australia is suffering loss by her White Ocean policy. We wish also to know what is the effect on the cost of the mail service of requiring compliance with certain provisions in regard to carriage of perishable produce. We desire to know whether the best machinery available is being used, and why the subsidy has been increased. </para>

                                <para>- The people at large were made aware of them by the inquiries of the Commission. In the same way, the Old-Age Pensions Commission has brought to light valuable facts which would probably not have been generally known but for its inquiry. For instance, I understand that in New South Wales one of the banks receives &#163;10,000 per annum for performing work which is carried out in Victoria at a cost of &#163;150. Further, it is stated that the cost of management of the old-age pensions scheme in New South Wales amounts to &#163;20,000 per annum, as compared with &#163;1,800 in Victoria. </para>

                                <para>- Honorable members have not time to wade through the large number of publications which are distributed throughout Australia, and it is desirable that the salient facts in regard to matters of high public importance should be prominently brought before them by means of inquiry. At no time in our history have Commissions done more useful work than recently. Take, for instance, the Lands Commission in New South Wales ; that has performed most valuable service. I want to know something more in regard to the carriage of our products from Australia to the Home markets, and the conditions of our mail contracts, and I am not prepared, in the light of the information at present available to us, to trust even the present Government to enter into arrangements with the mail companies. </para>

                                <para>- I do not think that any section of the House should trust the Government without the fullest information being furnished with regard to their proposals. This is a matter in which the producers of Australia are most vitally interested. I have been told by a member of a State Government - not a member of the Labour Party - that the practice has arisen of buying up cargo, space in some of the ocean steamers, and retailing it to producers at higher rates; in fact, cornering cargo space. If the proposed Committee can show that it is possible to insert a clause in future contracts, which will overcome that difficulty, some good will have been accomplished. </para>

Honorable members who oppose the proposal because its original objective was socialistic in character are taking up a most illogical position. The motion does not now bear a socialistic complexion. </para>

I can assure the honorable member that if a committee were proposed to inquire into the matter, I should not be found opposing it - in fact, I should urge no objection to an inquiry into any action of the late Government. This, however, is an entirely different&#39; question. The motion has changed its aspect since it was first introduced.

                                <para>- Order. I must remind honorable members that interjections of such a character as will disturb the course of an honorable&#39; member&#39;s speech are absolutely disorderly. It seems impossible for the honorable member to make any progress on account of the repeated interjections to which he is being subjected. Honorable members will have an opportunity to address the House later on, and I would ask them for the present to be content to listen to the honorable member for North Sydney. </para>

                                <para>- I recognise that it is desirable to maintain order, but I do- not object to reasonable and proper interjections, which I am quite ready to answer. It astonishes me that the members of the Labour Party should claim that their party - I do not say every individual member of it - is not in favour of the ownership by the State of all the means of production, distribution, and exchange. </para>

                                <para>- But I did not repeat it. I said that the socialistic programme was the policy of the Labour Party generally, if it was not the policy of every member of it. At any rate, it is the policy announced by the leader of that Party in this House. The author of this motion has declared that he would not accept it in its amended form, unless he had an opportunity of carrying out what the resolution, in its original form, proposed. How can he achieve his object? Obviously through the <inline font-style="italic">personnel</inline> of the Committee. What is the proposed&#39; constitution of that body ? Its constitution is such as to make the result of its inquiry practically a foregone conclusion. I agree with other honorable members who have stated that we are incurring a great deal too much expense in connexion with the appointment of Select Committees and Royal Commissions, and that, in many cases, these bodies are finding out - as was mentioned by the honorable member for Boothby - what was thoroughly well-known and what had been published to the world prior to their creation. The honorable member for Boothby alluded to the discovery by the &#34;Old Age Pensions Commission that the cost of the old-age pension system in New South Wales was enormously in excess of that of Victoria. That was well-known previously. </para>

                                <para>- I have heard the right honorable member for Balaclava allude to it. Further, it has .been mentioned in the Parliament of New South Wales, and it will be found in the reports of the Statistician of that State. Yet the Commission apparently considers that it has made a discovery. &#39; I do not say that Select Committees which have been appointed have not accomplished useful work, but I do claim that if ever there was work for a- Government to do it is that which is outlined in the_ motion under consideration - assuming, of course, that the proposal is legitimate. If, on the&#39; other hand1, it is intended only as a means by whic&#39;h the purchase of a Commonwealth fleet of steamers may be recommended, that is an entirely different matter. The only opportunity that the House can have of ascertaining whether or not that is the object is by the constitution of the Committee. </para>

                                <para>- If the opinions of the five members suggested are identical, why appoint a Committee ? Why not send in the report ? It has been represented that it would assist the Government materially if this Committee could make ah inquiry and report. In that connexion, I say that its appointment would be likely to place the Government in a position similar to that which was occupied&#39; by the late Ministry. It would probably cause them to delay taking action for a renewal of the contract until they were very close to the period when the existing contract will expire. Under such circumstances, any Government must be, more or less, in the hands of the particular shipping line, running the service, and it is highly desirable - I am sure the late Postmaster-General will agree. with me - that efforts should be made to secure prices from tenderers at a far earlier date than was the case in connexion with the present contract. The Ministry ought to be setting about that work at once. They ought not to await the report of any Committee. If they do so they will again be placed in the unfortunate position of having to conclude a new contract with greater haste than should be necessary. That is not desirable. I am opposed to the appointment of the Committee, because I think that it will involve an unnecessary expense unless there is some charge attached to the motion. If a charge is attached to it. by all means let it be inquired into, but. if not, the appointment of the proposed&#39; body will constitute an unnecessary expense. It is not within the powers of a Committee to ascertain as effectively as a Government what can be done in the way of cheapening the mail subsidy. Such a body cannot open negotiations and ask prices from abroad. That must rest with the Government. </para>

                                <para>- Even if they visited the United Kingdom they would not have the powers of a Government to inquire from different firms the price at which they would accept the mail contract or to advertise for tenders or to bring firms into competition with one another. They have no such powers. How then could they handle the question better than could the Government? I believe that we should hold the Ministry responsible for entering into contracts for the conveyance of our mails. Let them use the powers which they have for that purpose - powers which are greater than those which any Select Committee can possess - and let them submit their proposals to the House. Of course, I recognise that that is not the object of the motion. The honorable member for Barrier has clearly stated that he desires to see a fleet of steamers owned r&#60;.nd controlled by the Commonwealth, and that he hopes to secure his object by the appointment of this Committee. That is an honest declaration. </para>

                                <para>- It occurred last week - I forget the exact occasion. However, I have no wish to waste time by referring to the matter at length. I do not think that the honorable member would wilfully mislead the House. I believe that he was sincerely mistaken, and that his mistake arose from not having acquainted himself with the facts. In order that there may be no further repetition cf the misstatement, or of the ill-feeling which may be aroused by it, I wish to quote from the proceedings of the recent Inter-State Labour Conference, to which the honorable member referred. He stated that that Conference decided in favour of nationalizing all the means of production, distribution, and exchange. </para>

An incidental reference to the fact that this proposal is, or is not, in accordance with a certain resolution is perfectly in order, but a detailed discussion of the proceedings of a certain Conference - which, so far as I know, had nothing whatever to do with the question of the mail contracts - is not. I have allowed the honorable member for Fremantle considerable latitude on account of the statements made by the Opposition; but ask him now to refrain from dealing further with the resolutions of the Conference. </para>

                                <para>- Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">b</inline> of the objective continues - and the extension of the industrial and economic functions of the State and municipality. 1 hope that, after this explanation, the honorable member for North Sydney will not be guilty of repeating the statement made by him on two occasions in the House, that a certain motion was passed by the Labour Conference, when, as a matter of fact, it was rejected by a very large majority. I was somewhat surprised at the objection raised a few minutes ago by the honorable and learned member for Illawarra with reference to this motion. He said, rightly enough, that the question of the carriage of cargo between Australia and Great Britain might, and possibly would be of greater importance to the people of Australia than would that of the carriage of mails and passengers. Although I am not going, to lose sight of the importance of the question in so far as it relates to the carrying of mails or passengers, I wish to emphasize the necessity for some such inquiry as suggested, in the interests, not only of our producers, but of all others concerned with the carriage of cargo between Australia and Great Britain. The honorable and learned member for Illawarra has stated that it would be impossible for a Select Committee to obtain information as to the terms and conditions upon which oversea cargo is carried. If that be so- if it be difficult to ascertain from the ship-owners, the brokers, or the merchants of Australia what these terms and conditions are - that fact in itself should make us the more determined to have an investigation. </para>

I am aware that there is a lack of knowledge on the part of the general public as to the manner in. which shipping companies conduct their business. We have all sorts of rumours as to rings and combines, but the shipping companies as a rule make such a close secret of the facts relating to their business that the people really do not know how they are being treated with regard to the carriage of goods to and from Australia. I wish to quote from a report recently presented to the Governor of Western Australia by a Royal Commission on Ocean Freights, which was appointed by the Government of that State. </para>

                                <para>- What this Commission has done for Western Australia should be done by us for the whole Commonwealth. It is remarkable that the Commission mentioned as one of the possible solutions of existing evils the ownership and control of a line of steamers by the Government of the Commonwealth. The situation has become so bad in Western Australia that traders in that State appear to be almost at their wits&#39; ends to know what to do in order to secure the carriage of their freights at a reasonable rate. Among the recommendations made by the Commission was the following: - </para>

If time permitted I could quote instances of oppression on the part of shipping combines - or the shipping ring, as it is called1 - that would open the eyes of honorable members. I shall not say that that which applies to Western Australia applies to the whole of the Commonwealth, but it cannot be gainsaid that the shipping trade between Australia and Great Britain is in the hands of a ring or combine of shipping brokers - not of ship-owners - who absolutely fix rates at their own sweet will. &#39; </para>

                                <para>- In view of these facts, it is time that an inquiry was made in the interests not only of the producers, but of the consumers of Australia. I need not remind honorable members that business men - merchants and shopkeepers who have to pay these additional freights - pass on the increased charges to the consumer ; they actually make a profit on the higher freight they pay. The consumer, therefore, is doubly hit every time he makes a purchase. When the Commonwealth took over the Postal Department, we discovered somewhat to the surprise of many people, that we had been paying a very large annual subsidy to the mail steamers for the carriage, not only of postal matter, but of produce. There was considerable friction when the Government attempted to differentiate between a contract for the conveyance of mails and one which also included provision for large cold storage space on board the mail steamers. I am not going to say that, in any contract we may make, we should not pay due regard to the necessity of securing cool storage on mail steamers, and every possible facility for the carriage of our produce to England; but I do say that, as a Commonwealth Parliament, we have no right, under the guise of entering into a mail contract, to pay a large sum for something which is really no part of such a contract.. Let us, if honorable members please, make an agreement with the shipping companies that the mail steamers shall be provided with cool chambers, but let us also know what is the exact cost of carrying our mail matter to and from England. </para>

                        <para class="block">I have been following this question ever since Queensland issued Treasury notes in 1893, and, in bringing forward my proposal, I am fully aware of the difficulties of the subject and its importance to the Commonwealth. The scheme has naturally been talked about. It has been discussed as if my object were merely to provide funds for the taking over of the transferred properties, and thereby the liquidating of the debts of the States ; but that is incidental only. The scheme aims, in the first place, at establishing a Commonwealth issue of paper money. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coghlan,</inline> at page 813 of the latest edition of his Australian statistics, speaking of the Australian note circulation, says that if the notes were guaranteed by the Commonwealth, and made a legal tender, their probable issue might be set down as &#163;6,750,000, the present note circulation of the Commonwealth being only &#163;3,800,000. The conference of bankers held in Sydney in 1895 made a proposal of a similar nature. If the Commonwealth chooses, it can set going &#163;3,000,000 more of currency, which will be as good as gold. My proposal was shaped in the form in which I now submit it, after I had read the proposal of the Treasurer, made at the Hobart Conference, and referred to in the Budget debate last session. He is reported, at page 6145 of Vol. XXII. of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> to have then said - </para>

                        <para>We ought never to forget that the Commonwealth and the States are composed of the same people, and that, therefore, if we have to pay any State a sum of money for buildings, not only has that State to contribute towards the payment for its own buildings, but that also it has to pay <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> for buildings taken over in every other State. I cannot look upon it as a sound business transaction, that we should borrow a large sum of money in order to pay for the buildings transferred from the States to the Commonwealth, in order to distribute that money amongst the States, thus placing upon them the obligation to pay interest, and to repay the capital borrowed within a certain time. It would mean that we -should be adding largely to the public debt of the Commonwealth, and doing no good to the States, either individually or collectively. </para>

                            <para>- I accept the right honorable gentleman&#39;s correction. I think that the proposal was first put forward by him. That proposal, however, makes no provision for the paying off of bond-holders. My proposal, on the other hand,, is this : That the three debtor States shall pay to&#39; the three creditor States, &#163;36,290 annually for a period of twenty-five years. It will therefore be seen that I would make the payments smaller, and the period shorter. Under this arrangement, Queensland will get ,&#163;321, 2^8 ; South Australia, ,&#163;358&#62;72i ; and Western Australia, .&#163;224,948, and the money, if used as I propose that it shall be used, will wipe out more than &#163;1,000,000 of the indebtedness of those States. This, in brief, is my scheme. I suggest the issue of Treasury notes to a value of, say, &#163;500,000, followed in three or more months by a second similar issue, and then by two other issues, until &#163;2, 000, 000 of paper currency have been issued. These notes are to be handed on a population basis to the Treasurers of the several States, and credited to the Commonwealth as being paid on account of the transferred properties, which are estimated to have a total value of &#163;0,000,000. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly. The States would use the notes at the earliest possible date, and, with the gold which they would thus have in hand - because the notes would take its place - they are to buy in the cheapest market some of their stock for cancellation. Three per cent, stock is to be bought on the London market, according to the <inline font-style="italic">Times,</inline> at ,&#163;87, and &#163;2,000,000 would purchase about &#163;2,300,000 worth of such stock, on which the interest would amount to ,&#163;69,000 annually. </para>

                            <para>- My motion sets forth that the note shall be payable on demand, and shall be legal tender. Thus ,&#163;69,000 will be at once saved to the States. The cancellation of notes will go on for twenty-five years, by which time they will all have disappeared, and new issues to buy &#34;further bonds, or for the carrying out of public works, will be made. Now for the balances to be paid by the three debtor to the three creditor States. There can be issued to the three creditor States, in a suitable number of issues, notes which the three debtor States will redeem - New South Wales to the extent of ,&#163;10,947 per annum; Victoria to the extent of &#163;20,906 per annum;&#39; and Tasmania to the extent of .&#163;4,345 per annum. This in twenty-five years will cancel the indebtedness of ,&#163;904,967, and Queensland will have received .&#163;321,378; South Australia, .&#163;358,721 ; and Western Australia, &#163;224,948 ; while the gold which the notes will enable them to use will allow them to buy back .&#163;1,042,500 worth of debentures, and the interest saved on the transaction will be &#163;31,275. The amount of debentures redeemed by these notes, and neither converted nor re-issued, will be &#163;3,333,333, with a saving of &#163;100, 000 in interest, while the note circulation will amount to only &#163;2,904,967. Thus the States which have paid more than their due share into the Federal partnership will be quite fairly, but only fairly, treated. Treasury notes in Queensland cost on the average &#163;2,000 per annum for expenses of issue and management ; but the Commonwealth, after the first year or two, could issue the notes which I propose shall be issued1, for an expenditure of &#163;5,000. When the States buy back their bonds and debentures, they will effect not only a saving in interest, but a saving in the expense of management now paid to the Bank of England, or some other financial institution. To show the need for something of this kind being done, I wish to quote from the speech delivered by the right honorable member for Balaclava, on &#93;oth June, 1902, when introducing his Loan Bill.

                    <para class="block">These statements did not induce this House to pass the Loan Bill ; but if they were justifiable then, they are justifiable now, for nothing has been done to remedy the sad position of affairs which he pictured. All the States, except perhaps Western Australia, have paid in interest more than the sum total of their borrowings, and yet they all owe, and are likely to continue to owe, the full amount borrowed. I come now to the bedrock of my motion - the Commonwealth Treasury note issue. In dealing with this subject, I shall not quote academic authorities for or against what I advocate. I shall rely upon accomplished facts, and the&#39; attempts to float loans which have failed, to show that there is good reason for my proposal. To put before the House the main facts on which I rely, I must go back to the financial crash of 1893. The financial institutions of Australia, with three notable exceptions - the Bank of New South Wales, the Bank of Australasia, and the Union Bank - were then largely assisted by the Governments of the day in rallying from that disaster. I shall not burden the House with an account of what was done in that direction in the five southern States, but shall refer only to the case of Queensland, where prompt and effective measures were adopted for relieving immediate difficulties. The steps taken were remarkable and bold, but not original. The Government of Queensland, by their Treasury notes scheme, have demonstrated to Australia that it is perfectly right and proper for the State to issue a paper currency. The Administration of the day were anxious to avert the threatened collapse and restore public confidence. It. was decided that public faith in paper money must be restored, and therefore the Government commenced their task by taking the issue of paper money into their own hands. It had been proved that such a public convenience as paper money ought not to be dependent upon the temporary financial condition of eight or ten banks, and the Government doubtless realized that, inasmuch as the Bank of England issued all the bank notes required in England, the State Treasury might appropriately fill the gap in Queensland. Arrangements were made for a Government note issue. The bank note duty of 4 per cent, was abolished, and a prohibitive duty of 10 per cent, was imposed on all banks wishing to continue their own note issues. Three Bills, were promptly introduced by the Government, and became law, viz., the Treasury Notes Advance Act, the Treasury Notes Act, and the Treasury Bills Act. Under the first measure, any bank which had stopped payment, or its manager or liquidator, could apply for an advance of Treasury notes to redeem from public circulation its own discredited notes, provision being made for ultimate repayment to the Queensland Treasurer. The Treasury Notes Act provided that the Treasurer should hold gold to the amount of one-fourth of the value of any notes issued, and should also issue Treasury Bills signed and ready for sale. The Bills were to be vested in trustees until required. Section 3 of the Treasury Notes Act reads as follows: - </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The Act also provided for departmental regulations being formulated whereby notes would be handed out to the banks requiring them, which had to deposit with the Treasurer gold representing one-third of the value of the notes issued, and to pay 2 per cent, interest on the remaining two-thirds of the value. The Treasury Bills Act authorized the issue of Treasury bills, to be vested in trustees, for the same amount as the proposed issue of notes. These bills have never been required, are still intact, and can be utilized to raise money if required. At the end of the first year&#39;s work the Auditor-General, in his report on the Treasury notes, said that ,&#163;240,600 of the reserved gold could be placed out at interest. This advice was unheeded by the Queensland Government. The next year the Auditor-General reported that ,&#163;250,000 of gold was unnecessarily idle. He also said that he realized that the Act was not intended to produce revenue. The Queensland Act was such a success that the money rolled in all the time, and the first impulse of the Queensland Government was to lend the surplus money to the banks. The accumulation of this gold had been brought about without expenditure on the part of the Government, excepting only the cost of the notes and office expenses, amounting to about ,&#163;2,000 per annum. The unused notes of the banks were bought by the Government&#39; and faced with the Treasurer&#39;s &#39;promise to pay, and for several months Queenslanders endured that makeshift. I propose to quote some particulars from the report of the Auditor-General of 1903 as to the revenue produced by the Treasury note system. The interest on Treasury notes, amounting to &#163;388,833, lent to the banks at 2 per cent., yielded <inline font-style="italic">&#163;li776</inline> 13s- <inline font-style="italic">&#62;</inline> the interest on Treasury notes gold, amounting to &#163;50,000, lent to the Royal Bank at 3 per cent., yielded &#163;1,500; the interest on Treasury notes gold, amounting to ,&#163;100,000, lent to the Bank of New South Wales for six months at <inline font-style="italic">z\</inline> per cent., yielded &#163;&#34;1,250; the interest on Treasury notes gold, amounting to .&#163;75,000, lent to the Bank of New South Wales for another six months at <inline font-style="italic">i\</inline> per cent., produced &#163;937 10s. ; and interest on Government debentures, amounting to ,&#163;300,400, at 3&#38; per cent., yielded <inline font-style="italic">&#163;10,514 i</inline> the total being .&#163;21,978 3s. 46!. In addition to these sums, there was- &#163;40,000 at current account, which produced no interest, and the reserve money, amounting to &#163;336,208. The next year an addition was made to the Government debentures bought with Treasury notes, and! the amount increased to &#163;386,522. With the exception of the ,&#163;388,833 of notes lent to banks at 2 per cent, interest, there has been sufficient money held to pay off every note with gold. The Government have very properly invested some of their surplus cash, and ,&#163;40,000 has been generously placed on current account without interest. <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan</inline> says that in 1893 the average bank note circulation in Australia was ,&#163;3,912,062, the Queensland share of this amount- being &#163;458,236. At present the note circulation of Australia amounts to ,&#163;3,844,866, of which Queensland is credited with .&#163;620,000. It would* appear from this that Treasury notes are more acceptable to Queenslanders than are bank notes to the people of the other States. The bank note duty realizes in Victoria &#163;18,434, in New South Wales ,&#163;28,743,. in South Australia .&#163;8,055, in Western Australia &#163;7,852, and in Tasmania &#163;3,262, the total for the five States being &#163;66,346. The revenue derived by Queensland from the Treasury note issue is equal to one-third of the total amount realized by the bank note tax in the other States, whereas the population of Queensland amounts to only one-eighth of that of the Commonwealth. I should like to say a few words with regard to the different note systems. The Bank of England practically has a monopoly of the note issue of Great Britain, and all the joint stock banks must go to that institution for their paper currency. This phase of the question is overlooked by bank advocates, who wish to retain paper money as a bank privilege. The Queensland Government have adopted the position of the Bank of England as an issuer of notes. In the United States the practice adopted is the reverse of that followed in England. In the United States a bank which deposits Government bonds can issue notes of an equal value. This is a case to which the oft-quoted text may be applied - </para>

It will be necessary to explain a simple phrase used by bankers, and applied to a great instrument of profit making. I refer to &#34;till money.&#34; This does not refer to money in the till, <inline font-style="italic">but</inline> to that great power which banks of issue exercise <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> create money on paper, namely, credit, when they can use it to advantage. The United States banks and the English joint stock banks have to pay for their &#34; till money.&#34; The Bankers&#39; Conference held in Sydney in 1895, at which the bankers of Victoria and&#39; New South Wales were represented, proposed to amend the Australian note issue, to obtain Government indorsement for their notes, and to pay the Government a better price for the privilege. They asked that &#163;2,250,009 worth of notes should be ranked as notes for circulation, and a further &#163;2,250,000 worth should be given to the banks to hold as &#34; till money.&#34; This would have given the banks notes to the value of &#163;4,500,000. So &#39;that the bankers themselves practically admit that we want more note issue. Every bank in England, except a remnant of privileged note issuers, wanting any form of till money can only get it by paying for It at Threadneedle-street. Morton Breckenridge, the champion of the Canadian banks, says in Volume X. of the publications of the American Economic Association, page 402 - </para>

                    <para>I quote these passages to show what till money means. Now, for the other side of the shield. When Treasury notes were first issued in Queensland, the three strong banks I have named, hoped, by refusing to touch State notes, that they would cause the scheme to fail. In doing so they deliberately deprived themselves of till money, or its substitute, Treasury notes, at 2 per cent., instead of their own bank notes at 4 per cent, and till money gratis. There is no till money in Queensland, but the bank-note rate was 4 per cent., and the banks were allowed to use an equal number of notes as till money upon which they paid no duty. Now, in Queensland, every note has to be accounted for, either in gold, or by paying 2 per cent, interest upon it. I take it that that rate of interest, which is an extremely low one, is equivalent to giving the banks till money. These banks imported gold, and for twelve years they have not taken any State notes at 2 per cent. </para>

                            <para>- I refer to the Bank of New South Wales, the Bank of Australasia, and the Union Bank. A champion of these banks, writing <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> the <inline font-style="italic">Brisbane Courier</inline> in April, 1903, complained that for every Treasury note they used, &#163;2 in gold had to be paid &#39; That seems to be a very curious statement, but from their point of view it is actually correct. They had been using a promise to pay &#163;1 on demand, so long that to do so they considered was their privileged right, and when they redeemed their promise by paying &#163;1, and then paid &#163;1 for a Treasury note, their innocent champion said that they were paying &#163;2 for a Treasury &#163;1 note. The Canadian system was referred to by our first Treasurer, the right honorable member for Balaclava, in introducing the Loan Bill, and last session my leader intimated that he favoured proposals in that direction. &#34;Confiscation&#34; was the epithet applied to his proposal.

                    <para>It is evident that the banks&#39; champion in Canada is - at one with some honorable members opposite upon that question. The Dominion notes are backed bv 15 per cent, of gold, and 10 per cent, of Dominion debentures guaranteed by the British Government. These notes throughout Canada are treated as the equivalent of gold just as Bank of England notes are in England. Morton Breckenridge gives equal value to them in the following passage which will be found upon page 430 of Vol. X of a publication by the American Economic Association - </para>

                        <para>For the four and a half years preceding 1st July, 1894, the amount of specie and Dominion notes held by all the Chartered banks at the end of each calendar month has averaged 9&#39;II per cent, of their total liabilities on corresponding days. The lowest percentage shown by the Bank statement was 8; the highest IO&#39;03 per cent. </para>
                        <para>This, it will be observed, is quite as high as the proportion of money kept on hand by the English Joint Stock Banks, although for most of them, gold, and its practical equivalent, Bank of England notes, are the only till money, aDd form part of their business machinery. </para>

                    <para class="block">I should like honorable members to notice that gold and Bank of England notes, as well as specie- and Dominion notes, are phrased together as of equal value. Again, banking return forms give one entry for specie and Dominion notes, and one sum only is quoted embracing both denominations. There is no tax on the note issue in Canada. A bank holding &#163;40 &#169;f Dominion notes can issue ,&#163;100 of its own notes&#39;. Honorable members opposite call that &#34;confiscation.&#34; What I wish to see is the whole of the ,&#163;100 issued by the Commonwealth. The amount of gold held in Queensland shows that a one-fourth gold reserve is unnecessarily high. I would allow the reserve to be one-fifth, which is 33&#39;3 per cent, higher than the reserve gold held for Dominion notes by the Canadian Government. I may add that in Canada there is what is called a bank redemption guarantee fund of <inline font-style="italic">z\</inline> per cent, for two years, making 5 per cent, upon the amount of bank notes issued. Yet the Maritime. Bank failed in 1887, and its dollar notes sold for 40 cents. This is not likely to occur to Dominion notes, Queensland notes, or to our notes when we get them. If the privilege of using our own notes is attached to the scheme, so that our Treasurer can pay them away, we can arrange a reserve without difficulty. We handle &#163;,I 1 ,000,000 each year, and 1 per cent, of that amount, replaced by a portion of our note issue, will give us our reserve. Morton Brecken ridge&#39;s statement in reference to banks applies to us. He says - </para>

                        <para>The only way for a bank to get its notes in circulation is to pay them over its counter in the ordinary course of business. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The Panama Canal trouble, which was referred to last week in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> is analogous to the position which we have here. The railway combine, realizing that the canal imperils their supremacy, by buying over the engineers, and slandering the canal, are doing their best to block its success. We have to recollect also that all practical men in finance are trained, employed, or interested in financial institutions, and we must expect difficulty in getting our side advocated by other than laymen like myself. Bank notes are used by bankers in the place of specie money, at the risk of the people, for the bankers&#39; benefit. If paper money is used by the people&#39;s Government, the risk borne carries a corresponding advantage. The Government reap the profit on behalf of the people. That the Commonwealth wants money is shown by the attempts which have been made to get a loan sanctioned. I have shown that, according to <inline font-style="italic">Coghlan,</inline> over &#163;3,000,000 more of note issue can be used if an absolutely reliable security is offered. Further, I have pointed out that in Queensland, where good, indefeasible paper alone is used, the profit therefrom to the Government - the profit from that one-eighth of Australia - is one-third as much as the other seven-eighths get from their paper money. The redemption of notes is a necessary feature of my scheme. A promise to pay is all the better if after one, ten. Or fifteen, or twenty years the amount involved must be paid. </para>

When we borrow we neglect to pay back our loans, but we must pay our interest, and this periodic cancellation is only equivalent in burden to that which we now pay in interest alone, although every penny we spent in that way would be a net reduction of our debt. The low price which our stock realizes in London would be a, cause for rejoicing - not for weeping. Our transactions -in stock for the future must be in buying - not in selling.

If the industry can stand on its own basis, it is deserving of our praise, but I should not ask the people to contribute to it any more than I should expect the people of Australia to contribute to any industry in which I was engaged. I should like to knowhow many men are employed in manufacturing, these machines, and of the conditions generally under which the industry is being carried on. </para>

                <para class="block">This amendment will give us an opportunity to discuss the general question. From a report lately presented to the House it would appear that &#39;one of the manufacturers of these machines made an untrue statement when before the Tariff Commission. While it was one of those statements to which the people have probably become accustomed, the fact remains that the Minister of Trade and Customs considered it of such importance that he acted upon it. The Minister took action on the oath of this man that he had positive evidence that &#163;60 was, charged for these harvesters in the Argentine, and representations were made to the British Consul there, with the result that it was found that they! were entered at &#163;41 each. The Tariff Commission was therefore deliberately misled by the person who gave that evidence. This gentleman has been moving in other directions, and it is highly desirable that steps should be taken to frustrate his efforts. Do the Government offer any opposition to the motion ? </para>

                    <para>- The honorable and learned member for Werriwa stated that the object of his amendment was to show that we are exporting harvesters from the Commonwealth, and I am glad, therefore, that the honorable member for Melbourne Ports has moved this amendment. Had he not done so, I should have moved an amendment to the same effect. The fact that harvesters are being made here shows that there is no necessity for their importation, and that there is room for a great expansion of the local industry, which, I hope, we shall see in the near future. </para>

                    <para>- I am glad that the return has been asked for. If the local makers of harvesters can send their machines abroad to compete with the manufactures of foreign makers, they can surely compete with those manufactures in Australia, where the foreign makers are at a disadvantage. They must, therefore, be getting a monopoly through the action of the Minister of Trade and Customs. The honorable member for Hindmarsh evidently believes in monopolies, because he would prevent the importation of harvesters into this market. </para>

The honorable and learned member for Wannon has recently been supplied with information, in connexion with a debate in this House, by the Massey Harris Company, a trade rival of McKay and Company,, which imports machines to Australia. </para>

                        <para>- Because it would give an advantage to the trade rivals of the local manufacturers of harvesters. I am sorry that I have not had an opportunity to consult Messrs. McKay and Company as to whether they think the publication of the information asked for will injure their export business. The honorable and learned member for Wannon would have an equal right to ask for the names of the consignees to whom they send their harvesters. Cannot honorable members see that that might injure the local manufacturers? Those of us who are interested in building up Australian manufactures should see that nothing is done to assist Canadian and American firms which are endeavouring to crush out local production. But, perhaps, as the time allowed for private business has nearly expired, I may be allowed to continue my remarks on another day. </para>

                        <para>. - We propose to ask honorable members to adopt a course somewhat different from that previously followed in regard to making provision for new works and. buildings. We desire to dispose of the works and buildings estimates before the general estimates are dealt with. Previous experience has shown us that generally it is very late in the year before the Estimates ;are passed, and that very little time then remains within which to proceed with works for which provision is made, and complete them before the end of the financial year. I think that the course we now propose is a good one, because it will enable us to place the works in hand at an early date, and probably obviate the necessity of coming to the House next year and asking honorable members to revote large sums of money. </para>

                            <para>- There is great difficulty in pushing on with the works. In the first place, plan&#39;s and specifications have to be prepared, and the Department is not in a position to incur even this initial expenditure until the works have been approved. Therefore, no work can be legally put in hand until the Appropriation Bill has been passed. Honorable members will see at once that if plans and specifications were prepared at considerable cost for the erection of buildings, and .Parliament afterwards refused to sanction the expenditure, no money would be available for the payment of even the preliminary expenses. </para>

                            <para>- If the discussion of the new works and buildings were involved in the debate on the general estimates, I could see the point of the right honorable gentleman&#39;s remark; but I consider that, in view of all the circumstances, ic is in the best interests of the country to put the proposed works in hand at once. Honorable members cannot say that they have not had notice of the intention of the Government in this direction, because I intimated about a fortnight ago that we intended to follow this course. There has been no whisper either from honorable members or from the press that any objection would be raised, and I trust that no technical objections will be brought forward to interfere with the passing of this appropriation. The works and buildings estimates, which are included in the schedule of the Bill, provide for an expenditure of ,&#163;418,911, as compared with&#39;-nearly &#163;12,000,000 provided for in the general estimates. I do not see why we should delay proceeding with the proposed works until honorable members have talked for two or three months. The change which we have made is, I think, in the right direction. </para>

                            <para>- I cannot say the exact amount, but necessarily a large sum will be spent in wages, because buildings can only be constructed by the employment of labour, which, df course, has to be paid for. I cannot see any practical objection fo the course we are adopting. Honorable members will see by reference to the schedule that under the Department of Trade and .Customs, provision is made for a revote of &#163;1,979, and for the expenditure of &#163;185 upon new services. Under the head of the Defence Department, it is proposed to revote &#163;26,245, and to appropriate for new services, ,&#163;40,271. In the Post and Telegraph Department, it is proposed to. revote &#163;23,565, and to devote to new services &#163;56,016; the total being ,&#163;148,261, of which revotes represent ,&#163;51,789. It is anticipated that ,&#163;20,000 of the total amount will not be expended during the year. It is proposed to appropriate for the construction of telegraph and telephone lines, &#163;169,150, but it is anticipated that &#163;20,000 of this amount will not be expended during the year. It is intended to place at the disposal of the Treasurer, &#163;1,500 for the purchase of machinery and plant for the Commonwealth Printing Office,1! whilst the Defence Department is to have an appropriation of &#163;181,060, of which it is expected that &#163;41,060 will not be expended during the year. In the Defence revotes provision is made for the construction of a stable and gun park at Brisbane, at a cost of &#163;1,250, whilst &#163;1,909 is to be revoted in connexion with the additions to the Customs House at Sydney. Provision is made for a revote of &#163;1,000 for the construction of a rifle range at Brisbane, &#163;4,900 is to be revoted for the construction of forts and quarters at Arthur&#39;s Head, at Fremantle, and &#163;5,996 is to be revoted in connexion with the construction of the fort, and the acquisition of the site at North Fremantle. I trust th-at we shall be able to spend this money during the current financial year. </para>

                            <para>- It is proposed to revote &#163;9,900 for post-offices in New South Wales, &#163;4,937 for post-offices in Victoria, &#163;1,299 for post-offices in Queensland, &#163;1,754 for post-offices in South Australia, and &#163;5,675 for post-offices in Western Australia. All these amounts were voted last year, but the works could not be completed because of the short time that elapsed between the passing of the Appropriation Act and the end of the financial year. I do not think it is desirable that we should repeat the same operation year after year. All these works for which these sums are to be appropriated have already been approved by the House, and still we have to come back and ask that the money shall be revoted. Under the head of new works, it will be seen that provision is made for fortifications and other defence works in New South Wales to the extent of &#163;9,922, an3 that it is proposed to spend in Victoria &#163;10,356 ; in Queensland, &#163;3,821 ; in South Australia, &#163;3,381 ; in Western Australia, &#163;11,247; and in Tasmania, &#163;1,544. The votes for new services in the Post-office Department are as follow: - New South&#39; Wales, &#163;11,350; Victoria, &#163;15,200; Queensland, <inline font-style="italic">-^^,84.6;</inline> South&#39; Australia, &#163;3,870;, and Western Australia, &#163;19,750. As I have already said, it is expected that &#163;20,000 of the total amount of &#163;169,150 will not be spent during the current&#39; .year. I may mention that provision is made in the amount voted for the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department for &#163;30,006 for the construction of a trunk telephone line from Sydney to Melbourne. It is proposed to expend &#163;15,000 upon telephone lines in Queensland, and &#163;10,000 upon similar works in South Australia, whilst &#163;6,000 is appropriated for telegraph lines, and &#163;17,000 for telephone lines in Western Australia. Under the heading of Defence, it is anticipated that there will be an expenditure of &#163;140,000, in accordance with the plan which is being carried out for providing special up-to-date armament and material, and for placing our land forces upon a war footing. It is expected that we shall spend that amount this year, although, if it is possible to obtain the requisite arms and armament within that period, the expenditure will be &#163;181,060. As I remarked the other evening, we are nearing the time when we shall have completed .the scheme for placing our land forces upon a war footing, so far as their equipment with arms and armament of the most approved type is concerned. My colleagues will be able to explain to honorable members any details in the Bill connected with their various Departments. The measure provides, I am sorry to say, only for the few works which the Commonwealth is able to carry out. Those works will be constructed out of revenue, and the expenditure upon them represents even less than the amount for which I have been accustomed to ask in a small State. Seeing that we are only asking the Committee to authorize an expenditure of &#163;413,911 upon works for the whole of the Commonwealth, I do not think that any one can charge us with extravagance. Nobody who was unacquainted with the facts, would credit the statement that this great Commonwealth, with 10.000 miles of seaboard, is confining itself to absolutely necessary works, involving an expenditure of only &#163;418,911 for the year. </para>

                        <para>- I should like to make one or two remarks upon these Estimates at the present stage. I am totally opposed to the course which the Government propose to take in connexion with them. I am not opposed to reasonable despatch in the voting of supplies for necessary works, and I deeply regret that I have to place myself in antagonism to the Government upon this matter, for the simple reason that I anticipate there will come, from some quarters of the House as reasons for the urgency of the course which the Government are adopting, the cry that people are out of work and want it. I submit that great and urgent as such considerations are, and deeply as we may sympathize with the unfortunates who are in need of employment, we have still a higher duty to perform - the duty of guarding to the fullest possible extent, all the constitutional rights which are provided as checks upon a possibly extravagant Government. The Treasurer has told us that the proposals which he has made are in the interests of the country. I venture to say that&#39; we shall best consult the interests of the country if we carefully dissect and discuss any proposals relating to finance which this or any other Government may bring forward, and if we observe all those checks and balances which the .Constitution has provided upon the extravagance of those who have charge of our Executive functions. </para>

I am altogether opposed to the suspension of the Standing Orders, until greater necessity has been shown for adopting such an extraordinary course. The Treasurer has told us that it is a convenient practice to bring down these large Estimates of works, and I submit that they are large, having in view the possibility of expenditure on the part of the Government - expenditure the limitations of which the Treasurer so deeply regrets. I am sure that he is sorry that he has not scores of millions of pounds to spend all over Australia. </para>

                            <para>- I am sure that the right honorable gentleman would. He would very soon make it fly, and I feel certain that his colleague, the Minister of Trade and Customs, would back him for all he knew when the question of the expenditure of public money came to be discussed in Cabinet. Everybody knows that the Treasurer likes to spend money. He has made himself extremely popular before to-day by the adoption&#39; of that very means. He regrets that he has not millions to scatter over a smiling Australia. He says that he is adopting this course because it is a convenient one. May I remind him that that reason has been urged for the most corrupt and extravagant proposals which have ever come before the Parliaments of the world. Before to-day kings have found it convenient to dispense with parliamentary control altogether on that account. I submit that there is no more urgent reason for -adopting the course proposed than is to be found in the general observations of the Treasurer. I have no hesitation in saying that the proposal&#39; of the Government, under all the circumstances of the case, is&#34; neither more nor less than an indecent one. </para>

                            <para>- I have no doubt that the right honorable gentleman does not take any account of precedent or custom, no matter how they may be sanctified by time. He has already shown a very decided disposition to make a new departure in connexion with the delivery of his Budget. Now he is endeavouring to remove the control of the finances from the House. No doubt that would be a very convenient practice, and the more a Government is inclined to be extravagant, the more convenient it would be. What are the facts of the case? The Treasurer submitted the whole of the financial policy of the Government to us two days ago. It has occupied a whole year in preparation. </para>

                            <para>- I am amplifying that statement a little. I say that from that stand-point the Treasurer&#39;s statement is the result of the year&#39;s operation of the Departments. If it has taken the Departments a whole year to formulate these proposals, is it fair to ask us at two days&#39; notice to vote huge sums of money, involving large matters of Government policy, in this hasty manner? We have had no time to peruse the various items contained in the Estimates. They have been placed before us, and we are asked, forsooth, to vote the money and to discuss any question of policy which may be concerned subsequently. The other night the Treasurer agreed to an adjournment of the Budget debate for a week to enable the ex-Treasurer - the right honorable member for Balaclava - to peruse the statement submitted to the House. </para>

                            <para>- I shall await with the greatest possible interest the statement of the right honorable member for Balaclava upon this matter. I am making my protest against voting, this money - involving, as it does, large matters of public policy - before there has been a thorough discussion of the Budget itself. Can we again discuss these matters after the money has been voted ? Will it be of any use for us to do so? I venture to say that we are wrongly discussing the whole matter now. We cannot possibly discuss these large questions of policy so hurriedly, and with the small amount of information that is now in our possession. I am not complaining of the wisdom of dealing with&#39; these works estimates at the earliest possible moment. I do not wish to be misunderstood upon that point. I agree that every expedition should be used, consistent with the duty cast upon us of thoroughly investigating the items. But I submit that they should only be dealt with after there has been a thorough discussion of the whole of the Budget proposals - immediately after that has taken place, if honorable members please, but certainly not before. That is the point I take in connexion with the whole matter. What was done last year? It is well known that the ex-Treasurer has always urged that we should pass the Works Estimates as speedily as possible, on the ground that more time is thus given for the expenditure of the votes so passed, and that the Treasurer feels that he has greater freedom in dealing with the money. The action taken last year by the Government may have suggested the course now proposed to be followed, but the two cases are altogether different. If the Government would pursue the policy that was adopted by the late Government, I should have no complaint whatever and no ground of quarrel with the Treasurer. I find that the Budget was not delivered last year until the 17 th or 1 8th of October. </para>

                            <para>- At all events, the Budget statement was not submitted until October, and, notwithstanding the lateness of its delivery, no proposal was made to deal with the Works Estimates until the 2&#39;4th November - six weeks later. I am not pleading for any delay, except that necessary to enable us to thoroughly discuss the Budget proposals covering the policy regulating the whole of the intended expenditure. The reason for urgency, which existed last year, is not forthcoming in this case. We are now only in the month of August, and the discussion of the Budget proposals will probably be nearing its conclusion soon after the beginning of next month. I submit that the Government should follow the policy adopted last year, shortening, if necessary, the interval between the discussion of the Budget, and the submission of these Estimates. The moment the Budget has been discussed, and dealt with, I shall be prepared ,to vote these supplies. We have a higher function than that of hastening a little temporary employment for those who are unfortunately out of work, and that function is to thoroughly test and scrutinize the expenditure of the Government, which seems, to be so large, extravagant, and stately in its notions. I have already said that these Estimates involve important questions of public policy, and we have to discuss those questions in view of the Ministerial declaration. Let us, for example, take the Estimates relating to the Department of Defence, under which we are asked to vote about ,&#163;140,000. In these Estimates we have the items, &#34; Field artillery, guns, harness, waggons, and ammunition, &#163;58,000 &#34; j &#34; machine guns, &#163;10,000&#34;; &#34;two 7.5 guns and ammunition, .&#163;24,000.&#34; I do not wish at this stage to discuss the question whether that expenditure ought to be- incurred. I am prepared to believe it is necessary, and that these are largely the Estimates of the preceding Government ; but, surely, there are questions of policy involved. We have been told by the Prime Minister that, in his opinion, the whole subject of the defence of Australia ought speedily be placed under review, with a view to a stable policy being decided upon. </para>

                            <para>- I shall come to that point. We spent large sums in perfecting the defences of New South Wales before the Department was taken over by the Commonwealth, and it is a question of moment whether we ought to expend this money in Western Australia until, at all events, the matter of the transfer of State properties has been settled, and their values determined. This is a matter that ought to be dealt with in the general discussion of the Budget before we are called upon to vote these huge sums of money. </para>

                            <para>- We certainly voted it last year, but there was much demur . to the proposed expenditure, objections being raised, on the initiative of the leader of the Labour Party, who pointed out how inequitable it would be to make this outlay in Western Australia until the question of the transfer of properties had been determined I do not wish to discuss these matters, and am referring to them only to show why we should&#39; delay the passing of these Estimates until the whole question of policy relating to them has been settled. The Treasurer told us last night that he was strongly in favour of Imperial defence, and that we ought to pay more for our defences. </para>

                            <para>- I am not saying that he was right or wrong, but in view of his statement I wish to direct attention to the item of &#163;58,000 for field artillery. This appears to me to be putting the cart before the horse. I take it that our sea defences are our first line of defence, and therefore, if we are going to spend these huge sums in procuring field artillery, we ought also, according to the right honorable gentleman&#39;s theory, to be attending to our coastal defences more adequately than we are. These are all matters of policy that should be discussed before we vote these huge sums. There is another item of &#163;10,000 in respect to machine guns. We are to incur this heavy expenditure in purchasing machine guns before we have a definite policy of defence, as suggested by the Prime Minister. </para>

                            <para>- Even if that be so, the matter should be explained. I believe,) however, that the money has not been spent. Before we indulge in this great expenditure upon our land defences, we ought to have some definite statement from the Minister as to the defence policy of the Government. The Prime Minister has been travelling all over Australia, talking in his most eloquent way of the necessity of improving our defences, and practically of assimilating the defence system of Australia with that of Switzerland. </para>

                            <para>- Certainly it cannot, but the Prime Minister, by implication, condemns our present system. That being so, a clear, definite, and. intelligent policy in regard to the defences of Australia should be placed before the House - either by the Prime Minister or the Treasurer - before we are asked to vote these large sums. If there is an explanation to be given, we ought to have it. Let us discuss these matters adequately, and know in what direction we are trending before we pass these huge votes. Then there is the question of Inter-State telephones, to which reference has been made by the honorable member for Kalgoorlie. I find that a sum of .&#163;19,000 is to be placed to the debit of New South Wales, and a sum of &#163;11,000 is to be debited to Victoria on account of their Inter-State telephones. Surely these items raise a matter of special importance, as to which we ought to have a declaration of policy on the part of the Government. We are told that if we vote these sums the Government will then allow us to discuss the question of policy. This is a matter of the most vital concern to the Commonwealth, and the obligation rests upon us to see that these Works Estimates are not hurried through without the fullest, freest, and fairest investigation. I simply ask the Government to deal, first of all, with the. Budget proposals. When the discussion of the Budget has been concluded, it will be open to them to submit their public works policy, and there nee&#34;d be no doubt as to the attitude that the House will take up in deciding whether or not they should be passed with expedition. A delay of two or three weeks can make no practical difference in the expenditure of these moneys. </para>

I can conceive of nothing more disastrous &#34;to the finances of Australia than the pursuance of a policy that may have been advantageous in the early days ot Western Australia. I am not condemning the right honorable gentleman for anything that he &#39;did in Western Australia, but suggest that the position of the Parliament of that State is entirely different from that of the Commonwealth. Here we are acting, as trustees in monetary matters for the whole of the States. Our position is very different from that of those who are agreeing to the expenditure of money in their own State. Before we have any further voting away of large sums of money, the least we may ask the Government to do &#34;is to facilitate the discussion of the Budget, and to finish the financial debate before proceeding to deal with these Estimates. </para>

                        <para>- The acting leader of the Opposition has forestalled me in the remarks which he has just made. I think that he has put the position very fairly, and forcibly. The Government will not accuse me of desiring to prevent them from getting on with business, and it is my wish to facilitate the passing of these particular Estimates. My experience as Treasurer showed me that the effect of passing- these Estimates late in the year, and of the Works Department not having ready in advance the necessary plans and specifications, so that the works for which Parliament voted money could be proceeded with directly the Works and Buildings Bill became law, was that the parliamentary appropriations could not be spent during the currency of the financial year. I therefore intimated, some time ago, that I intended to ask the House to deal with the works portion of the Budget proposals earlier than with the ordinary appropriations for the year ; the former practice being to discuss the ordinary appropriations for the year, which took several weeks, before dealing with the works estimates. Now, however, we are asked to go from one extreme to the other, and to do what, in my opinion, it would be highly improper, and, perhaps,, hereafter, dangerous to do. I am as anxious as is any one to see necessary public works proceeded with, but it will not make any difference whether we pass these Estimates to-night or three weeks hence, because, before anything can. be done tenders must be accepted ; and there is nothing in the world tq prevent the Government from calling for tenders, and having everything ready a month hence, by which time I am certain that the Estimates will have been passed, because a large part of the amount asked for fs made up of revotes for works in progress. I admit that it is useless to fight the Government on this question, because of their solid majority, but I urge the Prime Minister and the Treasurer not to &#39;attempt to rush these Estimates through. </para>

                            <para>- No. According to the practice of the last two years, expenditure of this kind, whether incurred in Western Australia or in any other State, is debited to the Commonwealth as a whole. The suggestion I make to the Government&#39; is advanced in all friendliness, with a view to expediting the passing of the Estimates. We are to resume the debate on the Budget next Tuesday, and I am certain that the&#39; Government do not anticipate that the Estimates now before us can be finally dealt with in the two or three hours of to-night&#39;s sitting, and the few hours at our disposal to-morrow. They perhaps could be forced through if they were not properly discussed ; 1 but the Government would make a grave mistake if they adopted such a course. Besides, they would have nothing to gain by adopting it. To say that by objecting to the consideration of these Estimates now we are preventing men from getting work is to make a statement for which there is no foundation in fact. I am as anxious as are my honorable friends on the corner benches that work shall be provided for the people, but such work cannot be proceeded with until the Works Department has all preliminaries ready, so that it will be sufficiently early if we pass these Estimates in a month&#39;s time. </para>

                            <para>- I have frequently urged the Works Department to have their plans and specifications prepared in advance of the voting of money by Parliament ; but I found it difficult to get them to do so. My suggestion is that we should commence the financial debate on Tuesday next, and deal with the Budget proposals as a whole. We cannot fairly discuss proposals of great moment, such as the Budget, piecemeal ; but that is what we are being asked1 to do. We must either pass these Estimates without discussion, and vote blindfolded, or we must properly consider them, in which case they will not have been dealt with by Tuesday next, when the debate <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> the Budget is to be resumed. I suggest, therefore, that they should be allowed .to stand over until the conclusion of the debate on the Budget, which probably will be concluded within a fortnight. My remarks on the Budget will t&#62;e of the briefest character, because I have no desire to spin out the discussion on the Treasurer&#39;s statement, and I do not know that any honorable member desires to do so. Therefore a fortnight, and perhaps a week, will suffice for the Budget debate, and these Estimates can be brought forward immediately afterwards. In regard to them, I suggest to the Treasurer that he might advantageously follow the practice which I adopted in connexion with my first Budget, and which I intended to adopt in connexion  with the others, but found it impossible to do so, namely, to have a short statement prepared, giving all the information available in regard to every proposed work/ and to circulate that statement amongst honorable members. If that is done,, probably nine out of ten of the proposals will be passed without discussion. I appeal to the Treasurer, and to my old friend the Prime Minister, not to try to force these Estimates through now. The Government have nothing to gain by doing that. No harm may be likely to come from passing this particular set of </para>

                    <para class="block">Estimates at this time, but to do so will establish what I think may be a dangerous precedent. While nothing will be gained by forcing the Estimates through, nothing will be lost by allowing their consideration to be postponed until after the Budget debate, because, in the meantime, plans and specifications can be got ready, and tenders advertised for, returnable, say, in three weeks or a month, by which time the Estimates will have been passed, and the money needed will be available. </para>

The right honorable gentleman, however, spoke under a slight misapprehension, while the acting leader of the Opposition was still more in error. It is. not the desire of the Government that the Committee shall pass these Estimates without the closest scrutiny and consideration. We are ready to afford all information needed, and are not attempting to force, honorable members to accept them in any. unprecedented &#39; way. We understood that there was a consensus of opinion that the course now being followed should be adopted. </para>

                            <para>- It was suggested in previous sessions, and recently pressed by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, the leader of the Labour Party, and others. We have complied with the suggestion, under the impression that in so doing we should be acting in accordance with the desires of honorable members generally. I took steps &#39; to assure myself that in improving, so to speak, on the excellent precedent set by the right honorable member for Balaclava last year in taking the Work&#39;s Estimates before the ordinary Estimates of the year, we should do nothing contrary to the principles of right parliamentary procedure. We have passed a Supply Bill framed on the lines of the Budget proposals before the financial debate has begun, and are at liberty to deal similarly with these works and buildings estimates. It might well happen that, on occasion, some great principle might be involved, in which case it would be reasonable to request the postponement of that part of the Estimates until the Budget had been dealt with. There are, however, no such items now before the Committee, and the passing of these Estimates will in no way interfere with the discussion of the general financial position. There is no constitutional objection to following the course which the Government has proposed, if honorable members are ready to do so, and we understood that it was their wish that it should be followed. If any novel proposal can be discovered in these Estimates, demanding special consideration, there can be no objection to dealing reasonably in regard to it. In adopting this course, the Government have no intention of achieving any advantage for themselves. But, year after year, Parliament is asked to re-vote sums of money which could not be expended in the year in which they were originally voted. There are a number of such items in these Estimates from last year. The proposals to which they relate have been already thoroughly discussed, and approved by Parliament. </para>

He has made an appeal which it is very hard to resist, and to meet his friendly invitation I venture to make a suggestion. I find from consultation with the officers of the Postal and Home Affairs Departments that the requisitions have been received for a certain number of works, for which preparations are now in hand. The amount required by the Department of Home Affairs would not amount to more than &#163;4,000 or &#163;5,000, but a considerably larger amount would have to be appropriated for similar works in the Postal Department. I (understand that a number of payments would have to be made for work already done. </para>

On the understanding that we shall proceed with the works which are ready, and so give whatever employment we can immediately, I shall consent to my honorable friend&#39;s suggestion, and defer the further consideration of these Estimates until he and other honorable members have offered their criticisms upon the Budget. I think that by following this course I shall pay that regard which is due to the right honorable gentleman, and at the same time arrive at an understanding which will enable us to proceed with the more urgent works, and to some extent relieve the pres- sure. For the present, we shall have to rely upon the Treasurer&#39;s advance, but I trust that honorable members will see that the course that we have proposed to follow with these votes is far from being opposed <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> any constitutional practice, and will be a convenient one. I think that by dealing with the works and buildings estimates at as early a period of the year as possible, we shall make our appropriations real instead of sham votes, and enable the money set apart for certain works to be expended, as it is intended it should be, during the year for which it is voted. </para>

                            <para>- It is a novel thing to hear the honorable and learned member yapping, because when, he was sitting over on this side of the Chamber he was not even allowed to open his mouth. I am glad to say that honorable members on this side are at liberty to express their opinions upon any subject and at any time, and I am prepared to express mine to the extent of voting upon the question as to whether we should proceed further with the business now before us. The Prime Minister, in my opinion, for weakly yielding, deserved the rebuke which he received from the leader of the Opposition. Estimates were presented providing for revotes amounting to &#163;51,000 for works which were authorized last year, and which should be proceeded with without any further delay, and yet the Prime Minister immediately complies with the request of the ex-Treasurer, and consents to set aside the business in hand. The right honorable member for Balaclava suggests that there is no precedent for pursuing the course proposed by the Government; but my view is that we should not think of precedent in connexion with a matter of this kind. There is every reason why we should proceed with the consideration of the works estimates to-night rather than in three or four weeks&#39; time. The members of the Opposition appear to be bent on taking advantage of every opportunity to prevent business from being transacted. They have in some cases extended their speeches over a number of hours, in order to delay business and discredit the Government in the eyes of the country. They are apparently intent upon showing the electors that the Government can do no good, and they are now going to the length of preventing us from revoting moneys for the construction of works which should have been completed last year. They are denying our artisans and others an opportunity of securing that employment which should be furnished for them at the first opportunity. If the members of the late Government were .so anxious to serve the interests of the unfortunate workers, why did they permit works to be delayed to such an extent that it has become necessary to revote ,&#163;51,000? I think that question demands an answer. </para>

I am not at the behest of the leader of a band of honorable members who are prepared to prevent other honorable members from freely expressing their opinions. A few weeks ago I had an experience of some members of the Opposition which has made me particularly cautious in my dealings with them. When honorable members can sit on the Opposition benches, and hear every word that is said at the table to an honorable member whose face is turned away from them, they are very clever; and when they tell us that their present action is taken in the best interests of the country, I am not prepared to accept their assurances. I regret exceedingly that the Prime Minister should have seen fit, even at the request of the right honorable member for Balaclava, to postpone this business. We are abandoning one position because there is no precedent for it, and are establishing a much more dangerous precedent, namely, that of paying for works out of the Treasurer&#39;s Advance Account. I do not think that the Treasurer&#39;s vote should be drawn upon to pay for works for which the appropriations have &#39; to be partly revoted. Now is the time for us to express our opinions upon such proposed revotes. I am not pleased with the position, and I am prepared, if honorable members opposite will assist me- </para>

                        <para>- In that study of the law to which the honorable member for Kalgoorlie is devoting himself with so much praiseworthy zeal, he will find that he will have to be guided by precedent to a very large extent. It is simply because they have stood the test of time that they exist, and any departure from the great principles involved in them is always fraught with much more danger than is an adherence to them. I venture to say that it would be a very bad thing indeed if the House allowed these items of expenditure to pass before the Budget statement had been .discussed. Honorable members should recollect that we have now arrived at a very critical stage in the history of the Commonwealth. This year, after paying for the cost of the Commonwealth services, only a surplus of about &#163;460,000 will remain, and out of that we shall probably have to spend &#163;350,000. It will thus be seen that the Commonwealth will have only about ,&#163;110,000, which it may use for purposes of administration. I wish to point out why we should most carefully scrutinize every proposed increase in expenditure. The sum I have mentioned is so small that it will not enable us to administer very many new Acts, and it is idle to pass enactments if we cannot administer them. In a large territory like Australia I suppose that any Act of importance will cost from ,&#163;15,000 to &#163;20,000 per annum to administer. Consequently, it is apparent that by the time we pass five or six more statutes we shall have reached the end of our tether. Under such circumstances, I ask honorable members when the Budget debate is resumed upon Tuesday next to recognise that there is one matter of paramount importance, namely, a system of sound finance. </para>

                            <para>- If the Treasurer has heard it before it has fallen upon deaf ears. The more one regards the system of finance the more he must see how intimately it is bound up with the progress of the people. Without a sound&#39; system we shall embark upon a career which will bring ruin into thousands of homes, because, after all, it is the great masses of the people for whom we must have regard. We must take care that&#39; the rate of interest upon capital is not increased. By so much as we destroy credit, by so much do we destroy that which is of the greatest aid in the acquisition of wealth. I do trust that in the discussion which Wl. be initiated upon Tuesday next we shall all scrutinize the Estimates of expenditure very carefully, and do our best to cut them down to the lowest point possible consistent with sound administration. In the present instance I think that the Prime Minister is to be commended for the course which he has taken. I am sure that if the honorable member for Kalgoorlie had been present during the sittings of the first Commonwealth Parliament he would have recognised that even his impetuosity, added perhaps to my own, would be quite powerless to coerce a House into doing something of which it does not approve. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to ask the Treasurer whether he can give us any definite idea as to when this matter will again come up for consideration. The Prime Minister has stated1 that its discussion would be resumed after the right honorable member for Balaclava and two or three others had spoken upon the Budget. Upon the present occasion we had a full day&#39;s notice, that these Estimates were coming on for consideration, and, although there are some matters in them which will excite no comment, there are others which may provoke discussion. In these circumstances, I ask that the resumption of the debate shall not be sprung upon the House without sufficient notice having been given. </para>

                        <para>- I do not regard the statement of the ex-Treasurer in the same light as does the Prime Minister. I think that the right honorable member for Balaclava gave the Committee the very best reason why we should pass this portion of the Estimates to-night. He assured us that everything is &#34; right as right can be&#34; - so right that the Government could proceed to call for tenders for carrying out the works enumerated in the Bill: Personally, I am of opinion that we have been too long bound by bad precedents. I admit that we- ought to scrutinize these Estimates very carefully, but I am sure that if they had contained one- item which was open to challenge the Opposition would have found it long ago. The whole of yesterday&#39;s&#39; silting was wasted in the discussion of a most trivial matter. If that is an indication of the way in which&#39; the work of the session is to be conducted, it is very difficult to hazard an opinion as to when these Estimates will be passed. If I thought that any important matter of policy was involved in any of the items, I should be the first to advocate delay. But if such a thing could be suggested, I am sure that the watchful deputy leader of the Opposition would have mentioned it ere this. I do think that it is time we endeavoured to do a little more for those persons who at the present time are starving. We have been doing too little for them, and indulging in too much wrangling. In my opinion, we should pass these Estimates, and provide what employment we can for those who are so badly in need of it. </para>

                            <para>- I see no reason why the Government should not undertake the responsibility of immediately proceeding with the smaller works, for which the plans are ready. Although I am strongly opposed to the proposal to push these Estimates through before the Budget debate has taken place, for reasons which I shall mention in a moment, if I did not know that the practice of the Departments is such that they are not ready to proceed with the bulk of the works, I should be prepared to consider them. But the fact is that the Departments do not begin to get their plans and specifications ready until the passing of the works estimates is assured. When I was Ministerial head of the Defence Department, I was preparing to issue instructions - so far as defence works .were concerned - that as soon as the Budget was introduced ,and the Estimates circulated, the plans and specifications of those works were to be got ready, in order that they might be proceeded with the moment that they were sanctioned. I am perfectly certain, however, that that practice has not been followed in the Departments to any material extent. I am quite sure that the Minister of Home Affairs, so far as he is acquainted with the facts - and it is quite impossible to carry all these details in one&#39;s head - will confirm my statement, that there is no substantial readiness to proceed.

From my own personal knowledge, I feel sure that there will be no delay in providing employment to men outside by the adoption of the course proposed. </para>

                            <para>- One of the reasons why there is such a large amount revoted in this year&#39;s Estimates is that the&#34; Works Bill was not approved by Parliament till November of last year. While the Treasurer was speaking&#39; of these revotes, I took the trouble to run through some of them in the Defence Department, with which I am familiar, and I find that out of .&#163;26,000, at least &#163;12.000 is being revoted for reasons utterly apart from the delay which occurred in passing the Bill last year. </para>

                            <para>- If the Treasurer will inquire from the Department of Home Affairs he will obtain very good reasons for the delay which has taken place. There are thousands of pounds in the nature of revotes this year, which have no relation whatever to the time at which the Works Bill was passed last year. I merely rose to .say that, so far as I am able to judge from my limited experience as a Minister, there need be no delay in providing employment to persons outside by the adoption of the course which has been agreed to by the Prime Minister, if the Departments are instructed to get their plans and specifications ready in anticipation of the approval of Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- If these Estimates were passed to-night, I do not think there would be .&#163;5,000 worth of work begun within a month from now out of the proposed expenditure of ,&#163;400,000, quite apart from the fact that a large proportion of that sum will be spent&#39; in the purchase of goods ordered upon indent from England. I feel that we ought to thank the Prime &#39; Minister for the Courtesy wi.th .which he readily recognised the reasonableness of the objections that were raised. That recognition casts upon me an obligation to assist the Government so far as I can to pass these Estimates with as little delay as possible as soon as the Budget debate&#39; has been concluded. Some questions of vital concern are involved in these Works Estimates. I believe, of course, that those relating to Defence are correct, because they are exactly as I left them on retiring from office. Even an item in respect of which I left a minute suggesting that it should be omitted remains in these Estimates, and the House may consider that if is right that it should. But the whole question of the defence policy of tEe Government is involved in connexion with the vote for special warlike stores. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable member for Hindmarsh has lectured the Opposition for the action taken by us in regard to this matter ; but the very fact that the Treasurer has consented to the &#39;postponement of the Works Estimates shows that we have taken up a justifiable position. If the honorable member for Hindmarsh and his party had been sitting in opposition, and we had been on the Government benches, we should have had very different treatment from that which we have received to-day at their hands. We have simply urged that the Government should adhere to principles that have been recognised for years in all Parliaments. If the course proposed by the Government had been in accordance with the usual procedure, the action of the Opposition would have been censurable; but I feel that we were justified in calling the attention of the House to the Tact that it was proposed to make a distinct departure from the usual custom. I am pleased that the Treasurer has &#34;given way, and shall do all that I can to help him to pass these Estimates as soon as we have dealt with the Budget </para>

                        <para>- When the debate was interrupted on Tuesday evening, I was pointing out that the sum of ?250,000, proposed to be given by way of bonuses under this Bill for the encouragement of the iron industry, would be expended chiefly in the interests of an English syndicate. That statement was repudiated by the Minister df Trade and Customs, who said that, as a matter of fact, all the money required for the works would be raised in Australia. During the interval I have had an opportunity to examine the evidence given before the Royal Commission on the Bonuses for Manufactures Bill, and find that my statement was absolutely correct. I do not propose to read <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Darby&#39;s</inline> report bearing on this point unless it is the desire of the House that I should do so; but I am in receipt of a copy of the <inline font-style="italic">Trustees and Investors&#39; Review</inline> for August, in which reference is made to this very question. It clearly shows that this money is not going to be raised in Australia, but will&#39; really benefit an English syndicate. I specially commend the article to those who hold opinions similar to those entertained by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports. The <inline font-style="italic">Trustees tend Investors&#39; Review</inline> is published purely in the interests of financiers, and those having funds to invest ; it regards such schemes as this purely from a commercial stand-point, and it is, therefore, interesting to note that in dealing with this question it sets forth that - - </para>

                    <para>I call the attention of honorable members to the concluding words of the last sentence, and propose later on to show that the &#34;other intolerable conditions &#34; to which the writer refers are really the socialistic provisions of this Bill. I venture to assert that if those provisions be passed,&#39;&#39; English capitalists will not be prepared to invest their money in the industry. They will not be prepared to make an investment which it is said by the advocates of this bonus will be attended with such beneficial results to the workers of Australia. It must be remembered that such publications as the <inline font-style="italic">Trustees and Investors&#39; Review</inline> are issued with the object of influencing investors, and that statements appearing in them must, from a financial point of view, bear some semblance of authority. In the opinion of the writer of, the article from which I have quoted, the passing of the socialistic provisions of this Bill will have a very injurious effect upon British investors. We must recognise, apart from the statement of the writer himself, that such must be the case: If such stringent conditions are imposed, English, capitalists will not even touch the scheme. </para>

                            <para>- I am perfectly willing to read <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Darby&#39;s</inline> report if honorable members desire me to do so. I have refrained from quoting it, simply because I do not wish to occupy too much of the time of the House, and because, also, of my desire to carry out an implied promise&#39; to the Prime Minister that in view of the concession which he extended to me last night in allowing the debate to be adjourned, I should curtail my remarks as much as possible. I certainly intend to do so if I am permitted to proceed without undue interruption. When dealing with this Bill on Tuesday evening, I referred to one aspect of it which, to my mind, is a very serious one. I pointed out that although it is proposed that the payment of the bonuses under the Bill shall be limited to a certain period, we have the evidence of those who expect to reap the benefit of the bonus system that at the expiration of that period, they will ask either for the continuance of the system, or for the imposition of a duty. It will thus be seen that the Bill before us involves something more than an expenditure of &#163;&#91;250,000. It means either the continuance of the bonus system after the time limit fixed by the Bill has expired, or the imposition of a higher duty. I have already quoted evidence in support of this contention. I have shown that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford</inline> and others stated, when before the Commission, that if the bonus system were not continued for a further period, or an equivalent duty imposed, the industry would have to be abandoned. That being the case, we are simply asked to throw away &#163;250,000. In any event, that must be the result of the passing of this measure, because the Commonwealth itself will not derive a benefit, even to the extent of one farthing, f from the proposed expenditure. Every penny will go to ,the enrichment of a private syndicate. There is no getting away from that fact. We may seek to gloss it over as we will, but the bald truth remains that this expenditure will serve* no national or public purpose, and is designed solely for private gain. If honorable members turn to page 52 of the report of the Royal Commission, they will find what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jamieson</inline> said would be the position when the bonuses provided for in this Bill cease. He was asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Winter</inline> Cooke- </para>

                    <para class="block">It is a very material point that notwithstanding that bonuses are to be given, for the encouragement of the iron industry, iron manufactures are to come in as before. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jamieson</inline> admitted that for years to come, many iron products in the form of manufactures will continue to be imported. Let me read some further questions which were put to him on the point - 1079. The duty you ask for is merely an estimate ? - Yes. 1080. Then it may be found that this guesswork of 12 1/2 or 15 per cent, is not sufficient? - I would not call it mere guesswork. Men, before they were prepared to put down their money, sent out an experienced man to get the necessary data. That gentleman was introduced to this country merely as a nominee of others at home. We had the paying of his accounts, but he was nominated by those at home as the man who could give them the best opinion. 1081. We are aware that the estimate was carefully made; but, the industry having been established, if the estimate were proved to be wrong, what would happen - an application for more duty ? - In going into a business of this description, or any new business, you cannot make a dead certainty ; you have to run risks. What yow mean is that there is a possibility we might ask for more duty. 1082. That has been the experience, in Victoria, at all events ? - That may be ; but I cannot look into the -future. 1083. That is a danger I wish to point out? - Then the best thing would be to make the duty 20 per cent, at once. </para>
                    <para>So that the voracious promoters of this syndicate want not only a bonus but concurrently a protective duty of 20 per cent.

                            <para>- I have already said that this estimate took into account the fact that Australian labour is dearer than that employed in connexion with the manufacture of imported iron. Let me read some more of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford</inline> &#39;s evidence - 1128. That, of course, would be a rate which would enable you to compete with foreign competition? - Yes. I may say that I formed my judgment in part from the action taken by a member of the Commission when Minister for Mines in New South Wales, in appointing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jacquet</inline> to inquire into the question. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook has, in my opinion, done as much or more than any other man in New South Wales in connexion with this matter by appointing an expert like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jacquet</inline> to see what we have in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jacquet&#39;s</inline> conclusions were confirmed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Enoch</inline> James, and I may say that when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Enoch</inline> James was here we had over a dozen applications outside of known properties from people willing to supply us with ore, showing that the industry only wants to be set going for the manufacture of pig-iron, to have a number of works started in Australia. The best thing ever done for the iron industry of Australia was what was. done by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Joseph</inline> Cook. It was action anticipating the next best thing to do, and it was done. 1129. <inline font-style="italic">By</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCay.</inline> - I am not quite sure that I understand what you mean when you say that pig-iron could be produced at Lithgow for under 35s. per ton. Is that taking everything into account? -I give that as an estimate of the net cost at Lithgow. </para>

                            <para>- Even allowing that a mistake may have been made, there would still be sufficient margin of profit to the local manufacturer. We know perfectly well that when gentlemen engaged in commercial enterprises, such as that contemplated under the Bill, see an opportunity of obtaining a present of a large sum of money for which they are not expected to give anything in return, they will do everything in their power to improve their chances. I do not blame them,, but I think the conduct of the representatives of the people who are prepared to give them such a present is in the last degree reprehensible. </para>

                            <para>- I desire to make a comparison between the cost of production of pig iron in New South Wales, and the price of the imported product. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jamieson,</inline> imported pig iron costs from <inline font-style="italic">&#163;3</inline> 15s. to 5s- per toil - the price varies - and, according to Mr. W. A. Robertson, the cost ranges from &#163;4 10s. <inline font-style="italic">to &#163;5</inline> 5s- Per ton, and if those prices be correct, a very large margin of natural protection would be enjoyed by the local manufacturer. </para>

                    <para class="block">Lithgow for&#163;1 15s. per ton. If the freight to Sydney, 10s. 6d. per ton, be added to that price, the cost landed in Sydney will amount to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2</inline> 5s. 6d. That price compared with the cost of imported pig iron would give the local manufacturer an advantage of&#163;2 4s. 6d. per ton, which would amount to protection at the rate of over 50 per cent. Surely that ought to be sufficient to encourage any local manufacturer. The truth of the matter is that the bonus is looked upon in the light of a present. That is shown by the evidence given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> A. Robertson, who at page 138 of the report of the Commission, question 2895, was asked - 2895.Ifyougotabonus, you would still want a duty? - Now that the bonus has been offered, we should certainly desire it. To ask us now to do without a bonus would be like offering a man a present and then taking it away. </para>

                            <para>- That statement bears out my contention that this bonus is regarded as a present. Honorable members are practically proposing to make a present of&#163;250,000 of the taxpayers&#39; money to an English syndicate. For what purpose? To benefit Australia ? Not in the slightest degree. The payment of that money to the proposed company would not benefit a single man, woman, or child in Australia. It will swell the profits of a rich English syndicate, which, on the face of the evidence of their own experts, have a splendid property from which they could derive high returns without the assistance of any grant from the Commonwealth. There is a very peculiar feature about the shares in this company. We find that they have practically no market value at present. They are supposed to be worth 2s. 6d, each, but it is expected that, if the bonus be granted, their value will be increased to <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1</inline> each. I do not propose to deal with this aspect of the matter at any greater length, because the ground has already been covered by the honorable member for New England. I wish now to refer to some of the provisions of the Bill. Clause 4 reads as follows: - </para>

                    <para class="block">I have already pointed out that the evidence of men who are interested in the establishment of this industry shows the absolute farce of imposing a time limit within which the bonus shall operate. We know perfectly well that when the bonus is about to expire, an agitation will be raised for its continuance, in order to protect what will be termed a &#34;languishing&#34; industry. Is not that the experience of every enterprise which has received artificial aid from the Treasury? Is it not our own experience in connexion with the sugar bounty ? In that- connexion, do we not find that long before the period during which the bounty is to operate has expired, an agitation has been created for its continuance, and did not the Government indicate in the Treasurer&#39;s Budget speech that they intend to make provision upon the Estimates for an extension of that period? What has happened in the case of the sugar bounty will occur in the case of the iron bonus. It is a perfect farce to insert a clause of that character when we know perfectly well, from the evidence of the very men who will receive this bonus, that it will require to be continued. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member must know that we are being asked to pass a provision which the evidence before the Iron Bonus Commission shows will not have the desired effect. Where, I ask, is this system of bonuses going to end ? Only last session, the present Minister of Home Affairs proposed that a bonus should be granted to the cotton industry. Thus we shall establish a precedent for supporting any industry which likes to set up a claim for adventitious aid. I say that if we are going to grant a bonus to any industry we must grant bonuses to all. Why should we favour one industry at the expense of others? It is a scandal and a perversion of the powers of Legislature to convert public money to purposes of this kind. Coming to clause 8, I find it provides that - </para>

I refer to the attempt which is being made to preserve a high rate of wages. But, unfortunately for the Possible success of the measure, that very clause is one of those which will operate prejudicially to the successful flotation of this company upon the London market, that is, Sf the writer in the <inline font-style="italic">Trustees and Investors&#39; Review</inline> is correct in his surmise.

                        <para>The new provisions in the Bill are evidently for the encouragement of manufacture by a State as against private enterprise. It cannot be expected that capitalists will look at the industry which is not to be under their control, but under the control of the President of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation. The Government evidently regard themselves as partners in the business by providing a bonus, and desire to actively interfere in the management. The fixing of wages by the Arbitration Court is n|o new power, it already exists in case of dispute between employer and employe, where unions are formed. The fixing of prices, at which the manufactured article is to be sold, however, is an unnecessary and undue interference in the business, particularly as no steps have been taken to secure the home market. </para>

I merely wish to say that to me it appears extraordinary that no provision is made for expert evidence upon which to base a valuation. The President of the Arbitration Court is to be the sole arbiter.

                    <para class="block">The President of the Arbitration Court is to be placed in a position which I think he cannot reasonably be expected to occupy without provision being made for expert assistance. There are other clauses in the Bill which, under other circumstances, I should criticise, but upon which I shall defer comment until the measure reaches the Committee stage, when I propose to offer the strongest opposition to the Bill. Before resuming my seat, I wish to read two or three clauses from a report signed by six members of the Royal Commission on the evidence submitted. As the House is aware, there were twelve members of this Commission, and six reported in favour of the bonus system, and six against it, the only difference being that the Chairman was among those who signed the report in favour of the Government proposal. As a protectionist he gave his casting vote in support of the bonus system. I have no objection to offer to the adoption of that course by the right honorable gentleman in question. No doubt he formed his conclusion on the evidence submitted to the Commission-, but, amongst those who signed the dissenting report, was the leader of the Labour Party, who is a protectionist. </para>

                        <para>No effort was made to bring forward witnesses against the Bill. Notwithstanding that fact, the evidence given failed to establish a case in its favour. Several witnesses thought the establishment of ironworks in the Commonwealth premature, and much of the evidence was strongly against any attempt by the Government to establish the iron industry by the payment of bonuses. </para>

                    <para class="block">It will thus be seen that the case for the granting of bonuses broke down on the evidence, not of those who were opposed to the principle, but of those who favored it, and came forward to give reasons for its adoption. I desire to say, in conclusion, that I regard this Bill as a most impudent and barefaced attempt to use the public. Treasury for the purpose of enriching a private syndicate. I shall use every legitimate means in my power to oppose the Bill line by line when it reaches the Committee stage. It is really one of those measures that ought to be submitted to a Select Committee. I do not know whether the Government are prepared to adopt that course, but they certainly ought to do so. There are many other points with which I had originally intended to deal, but, in compliance with the promise I made to the Prime Minister last night that I should endeavour to complete my speech within an hour, I do not propose to further discuss the question at trie present stage. I have only to repeat that I shall do all that I can to oppose the granting of these bonuses, when the Bill reaches the Committee stage. </para>

                            <para>- They might be very good principles if they were dealt with in separate measures, but they have been crowded into one Bill for a special purpose. The Bill is really a double-barrelled one. In the first place, it provides for the granting of bonuses - the desire of the Government being to placate those who, like the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, are staunch protectionists, and believe in the system - while in the second it embodies certain conditions as to the ultimate nationalization of the industry that are calculated to satisfy the socialistic party and their supporters. I should like to point out to the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, who approves of this Bill, that when we were discussing it twelve or eighteen months ago, he asserted that he was in favour of the nationalization of the iron industry of Australia. </para>

                            <para>- My strong objection to the Bill is that the Ministry, who are now. the servile and subservient supporters of the socialistic party in this House, have not only made provision for the payment of bonuses, but have inserted certain clauses in the Bill for the nationalization of the industry, in order to meet the wishes of that party. Notwithstanding the strong way in which he spoke on this matter some time ago, the Prime Minister, who is now the slave of those on the cross benches, has provided in clause 9 for the nationalization of the industry. Why has he not made a straightforward proposal in that direction, if he believes in this step? </para>

                            <para>- I am not to be intimidated by that statement. I speak on my own responsibility, and stand here as an independent member, to represent the interests of my constituents. That has been my attitude ever since I entered the House. Provision is made for the resumption, under the order of the Governor of a State, of the ironworks which may be successfully established by means of the bonus. That will be a nice little business for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> O&#39;Connor, as President of the Arbitration Court of Australia, to adjust, though whether he will be able to give satisfaction to those connected with the industry, and to convince the members of this Parliament that the arrangement is in the interests of the Commonwealth, is a question which can be answered only in the future. In inserting this provision in the Bill, the Government are showing a most servile obedience to the cross benches, the like of which has never been shown by any previous Administration which has held office in Australia. The Barton Administration, in which some of the members of this Government were Ministers, afforded us instances of subservience and servility, but their &#34;Yes, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson,&#34;</inline> was a small thing to the &#34; Yes, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson</inline> !&#39; of this Government in connexion with the Bill now before us. Those who had the honour to be members of the Iron Bonus Commission know the strong opposition which was shown by the leader of the Labour Party to the granting of a bonus to private persons. </para>

If that it not its object, I should like the Minister in charge of the Bill to explain what it is. I think that the Minister in charge of the Bill should be present. </para>

No one is more sorry than I am that ill-health should prevent the honorable member for Bland from attending here, and <inline font-style="italic">no</inline> one more cordially wishes to see him restored to his usual robust health and back in his old place. At the same time, when an important matter of public policy is being launched we are entitled to know what the great Labour Party intends to do, and to expect that the deputy leader of that party will make a pronouncement. </para>

                            <para>- I presume that there is not a man in this country who would not desire to see the iron industry established in our midst, but there are the strongest possible objections to the granting of a bonus under the conditions now proposed. I had the honour of taking part in the inquiry conducted by the Iron Bonus Commission, and, in common with my colleagues on that Commission, I gained a large amount of knowledge, such as would not be available to honorable members in the ordinary course of their experience. I venture to say that, however clever a man may be, he cannot when reading over evidence in connexion with a technical matter such as this, form anything like a correct idea of its value without having seen the witnesses. A large mass of evidence was taken by the Commission, the value of which no honorable member of this House - apart from those who had the honour of being Commissioners - and no man in this country, can accurately estimate. In cold type that evidence conveys a very different impression from that which was left upon the minds of the Commissioners when it was given by the witnesses who appeared before them. What I am now saying applies equally to the testimony taken before any Commission. We all know what human nature is. I believe that if this Bill be passed, a great injustice will be done to the taxpayers of Australia, because a few private individuals will be afforded an opportunity of dipping their hands deeply into the public purse. Yet, when this important matter is under consideration, we find that Ministers are absent from the Chamber, and that honorable members occupying the corner benches are practically silent. To-night, I had repeatedly to call attention to the state of the House. Even when a Bill of this character, involving as it does, an expenditure of &#163;324,000, is under consideration, we find that the Government are unable to keep a quorum. Such a condition of affairs is absolutely disgraceful. It is no wonder that the people of Australia decry Commonwealth politics, and declare that Federation has been a failure. To-day, from one end of the Continent to the other, we hear complaints in reference to the Commonwealth Government and Federal politics. It&#39; is because Ministers flout this House and the country, and because honorable members upon the cross benches are content to allow the Government to do as they like in matters of this kind, that there is such a public outcry. At the present time, the names of some of our leading politicians are a by-word throughout Australia. I have spoken strongly, because I feel strongly. In introducing this Bill the other day, the Minister of Trade and Customs said that there was no necessity for him to speak at length, seeing that he had already made two speeches upon the measure. Evidently he forgets that since he made those speeches a Royal Commission has exhaustively investigated this question. The Minister, however, during the course of his remarks, made only one reference to the labours of that body. He stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jamieson,</inline> in his evidence, declared that the industry, if es-  tablished,  would provide employment for  3,000  men. I have looked through the official report a&#165; the evidence, and&#39; I fail to find that he made any statement of that character. The Minister further declared that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carson</inline> - I do not know who he is - stated that if the bonuses were granted, instead of employment being found for 3,000 men, work would be provided for 10,000 or 13,000 hands. Honorable members can search the whole of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jamieson&#39;s</inline> evidence, but they will fail to discover any statement of the kind attributed to him by the Minister. The fact is that the honorable gentleman endeavoured to bolster up this business in the same way that the honorable member for Riverina attempted to bolster it up the other night. He talked about the&#39;  3,000  men who would be engaged in the industry if a bonus were granted upon the production of pig iron. He said that it would lead to the establishment of a flourishing industry ; but he failed to produce a single particle of evidence in support of his statement. </para>

                            <para>- I do not propose to allow this Bill to pass its second reading if &#91; can prevent it. Why does the honorable member wish the measure to get into Committee? Simply because it will please his protectionist friends. If it does reach the Committee stage, we shall find the Labour Party pressing the Government to nationalize the industry. Just as in New South Wales a few years ago, an endeavour was made to sneak in protection, so will an endeavour be made now by the Labour Party with the help of the Government to sneak in Socialism. I shall do my best to prevent them accomplishing their object. </para>

                            <para>- I would vote any day for the nationalization of the industry . in preference to the granting of the proposed bonuses. Honorable members pf the Labour Party favour the nationalization of the industry, but are prepared to accept a miserable compromise in order to keep the Government in. power. Why do they not stand to their guns? Why do not the Socialists who favour the nationalization of the iron industry, say straight out to the Prime Minister, &#34; This industry must be nationalized. That is our belief, and the belief also of the people who have sent us here.&#34; The Prime Minister&#39;s socialistic education, however, is hardly so complete, as to allow of that being done. When the motion submitted by the honorable member for Barrier was before the House&#34; this afternoon, the honorable and learned gentleman showed that his socialistic education was not such as to allow him to support the ideals of the party to the extent that they desired. I am not blaming the Labour Party for the views which they hold. I honour them for the openness with which they proclaim them, but I certainly condemn them for proposing to support a Bill which, according to the statement of the leader of the party, and of the sworn evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lamond,</inline> secretary of the Labour League in New South Wales, will simply produce a monopoly in Australia. That is a state of affairs which every member of the Labour Party professes a &#39;desire to avoid. It is because I believe that if these bonuses are given to a syndicate to establish the iron industry, we shall have a monopoly that will crush all industries - industries like Mort&#39;s Dock-dependent on cheap iron, that I am opposed to the Bill. </para>

                            <para>- That being so, I wish the honorable member to say what he thinks would be a fair duty to impose. The honorable member is silent. I take it that, like many others who propose to support the Bill, he is not prepared to say anything in regard to the payment of these tonuses. Together with those who think with him, he is ready to allow the Bill to pass in any form that the Government desire. Such a state of affairs is much to be regretted. I am satisfied that a number of honorable members of the Labour Party will vote against the Bill, while others,, like the honorable member for Newcastle, will vote for it. In justice to his constituents, who are dependent upon the coal industry, the honorable member should hesitate to vote for the payment of bonuses that will benefit private speculators not in Australia, but in London. Why should we pass a Bill which will be the means, not of making our own people rich - not of putting money into the pockets of our taxpayers - but of riving persons in other parts of the world an opportunity to speculate? I object to the Bill from start to finish, and shall do mv utmost to prevent its becoming law. The Commission, of which I was a member, took exhaustive evidence in Melbourne, Sydney, Lithgow, and Newcastle. We examined about thirty-five witnesses, and ultimately presented a majority and minority report. The majority report was affirmed by the casting vote of the right honorable member for Adelaide ; but what I desire to draw attention - particularly of honorable members on the cross benches - to is the minority report signed by the six members of the Commission&#93;, whose names are attached. That minority report is signed by, amongst others, the honorable and learned member for West Sydney, who is one of the leading members of the Labour Party in. this Parliament. The honorable and learned member has occupied high positions, not only in the Federal Parliament, but in the State Parliament of New South Wales, and no name stand&#39;s higher than his in the party to which he belongs. For weeks past the honorable and learned member has been the intelligent representative of trade- unions in the Arbitration Court of New South Wales. Some honorable members seem to think that there is no good1 in lawyers, b,ut members of trade unions, in New South Wales seem to think there is a lot of good in &#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lawyer</inline> Hughes,&#34; who is now representing them so ably. The honorable and learned member is no ordinary man; he is the accredited representative of trade unions, and a leader of the Labour Party, and his name appears at the head of the list in opposition to the granting of a bonus to the iron industry. What does that mean? It means that the honorable and learned member, like his colleagues on the Commission, including the then honorable member for Kalgoorlie, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kirwan</inline></para>

Will the Labour Party sit quiet under these circumstances? We have not heard a single word from the cross benches in connexion with the matter. Has the honorable member for Bland gone away, and instructed his representative, the deputy leader of the party, to refrain from saying a word on his behalf? Has the honorable member for Bland, by reason of the extraordinary combination which resulted in placing the present Government on the Treasury bench, changed his ideas in regard to the report which he signed in common with us ? The hour is late, and I again ask leave to continue my remarks on a future day. </para>

The honorable member has spoken for an hour, and we are able to afford any further time he thinks necessary. We have heard this report of the Commission read, and the comments of honorable members before; but if the honorable member thinks it necessary to repeat them, well and good. In the interests of business, we ask him to be good enough to condense his remarks, so that he may finish to-night. </para>

I have no doubt that the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> if it expresses an opinion in the morning, will say that my remarks were frivolous, and that I wasted a lot of time. The honorable member for Melbourne Ports, who was a member of the Royal Commission, knows that what I am saying is perfectly correct. The honorable member attended the meetings at Melbourne, Sydney, and Lithgow, though not at Newcastle or Brisbane, and he heard the evidence which I am about to quote. I do not wish to make any reflection on the honorable member, but it was a remarkable fact, to which my attention was called at the time, that the confidential report, which was handed to me and other members of the Commission by the chairman one afternoon, appeared the following morning at full length in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age.</inline> This was remarkable ; and it was generally understood that that report in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> was supplied by the honorable member for Melbourne Ports. The report of the Commission, which I am about to read, was drawn up in no careless fashion, but had much consideration bestowed upon it. </para>

                            <para>- If I have done the honorable member for Melbourne Ports an injustice, I withdraw what I said. I shall not deal with the majority report, because I feel satisfied that honorable members are already acquainted with it, and I do not wish to occupy time any further than is necessary. But I do wish to direct attention to the report which, though it is signed by six members of the Commission in the same way as is the majority report, is called the minority report. I happened to be one of the six Commissioners who signed this so-called minority report, but I may say that, so far as their intelligence and attention to the business of the Commission are concerned, they do not stand behind those signing the majority report in any shape or form. I direct attention to the fact that the report to which I now refer was signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hughes,</inline> the honorable member for West Sydney, and by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Winter</inline> Cooke, an ex-member of this House. Those who had the honour of knowing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cooke</inline> know that he was a man of more than ordinary attainments. The report is also signed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kirwan,</inline> who drew it up. It was perused by the honorable member for Bland, who also signed it, and I undertake to say that there is no honorable member in this House who can go through the evidence submitted to the Commission and from it disprove a single statement in the report to which I refer. </para>

                            <para>- I throw out the challenge to the member in charge of the Bill, and also to the member for&#39; Newcastle, who was one of those signing the so-called majority report. I defy any one to show that the minority report is incorrect in any of its statements. - This afternoon we had a motion for the appointment of a Select Committee. Various statements in support of that proposal were made by the honorable member for Barrier, and other honorable members on the cross-benches, but here we have a report, not from a Select Committee, but from a Royal Commission accompanied by a mass of sworn evidence, and I ask whether honorable members propose to take any notice of it, or intend to completely ignore the labours of the Commissioners ? We gave the utmost attention to the matter, considered the whole of the evidence given from start to finish, and six Commissioners honestly and conscientiously drew up a report in opposition to the bonus proposal. I admit that the six other Commissioners just as honestly and conscientiously signed the so-called majority report; but I am still entitled to ask the Minister in charge of the Bill, and honorable members who propose to support it, to show me any respect in which the minority report is wrong. I understand that the Postmaster-General has taken up the challenge. I am delighted that the honorable gentleman should have accepted it, though I know his capacity, his keenness in debate and his skill in the discovery of little points in support of the cause he has espoused. If the honorable gentleman can tell me from the evidence given before the Royal Commission that any statement appearing in the. minority report is not justified, I shall be the first to admit that I have made a mistake; but it must also be remembered that there are others as well as myself who must be satisfied on the point. </para>

                            <para>- I shall let the honorable member for Hindmarsh know all about that. I repeat that it was through the action of the leader of the Labour Party that the first measure of this kind was referred for inquiry to a Select Committee, which subsequently became a Royal Commission; and that after he had Heard the evidence taken during that inquiry, he was more strongly opposed to the granting of bonuses to private individuals than he had been before. I ask the Postmaster-General, who appears to be in charge of the measure at the present moment, if the Bill provides for the nationalization of the iron industry. As he does not answer, I assume that he does not know what the intention of the Bill is.1 Ministers&#34; seem to be in the same position with regard to this Bill &#39;that they were in with regard to the Commerce Bill, which the Attorney-General thought provided for the grading of butter, and the Minister of Trade and Customs thought did not, they being thus in direct opposition on a question affecting one of the most important industries in Australia. I again ask the Prime Minister if the Bill provides for the nationalization of the iron industry. He does not answer my question. </para>

                            <para>- I am prepared to go on until question time comes again if honorable members compel me to do so. I can speak for ten or twelve hours on this subject without repeating myself. I feel very strongly in regard to the matter, because I was a member of the Royal Commission, and attended most of its meetings. I heard the evidence of nearly all the witnesses who were called, and was in as good a position as any member of the Commission to form a fair and honest judgment on the question submitted to us. Having given careful consideration to the whole matter, having heard the evidence, and seen the demeanour of the witnesses who were called, I felt so strongly opposed to the granting of bonuses that I signed the minority report, which was agreed to by six of the twelve members of the Commission. As some honorable members now present may not have heard that report, I shall direct particular attention to it. There can be no doubt that, in many respects, Australia is favorably circumstanced for the production of iron. The protectionists who sit on the Government side of the Chamber pose as the only members of the House who desire the establishment of manufacturing industries in the Commonwealth, but we free-traders who sit in opposition are as anxious as any protectionist who was ever elected has been for the establishment of such industries. But we desire that private enterprise shall have free and fair play - that men of ability and enterprise shall have the fullest opportunity to carry their ideas into effect, and to develop their businesses for the benefit of this great heritage which has been bestowed upon us by the mother land.&#39; </para>

                            <para>- We who are freetraders recognise the desirability of establishing the iron industry in Australia if only in order that we may manufacture guns and implements for defending our shores. We on this side yield in no par&#39;ticular to honorable members on the other side so far as that question is concerned. While we recognise that we are not placed in as good a position as other countries for manufacturing iron, still we are placed in a very favorable position when we have such magnificent deposits of iron, coal, and limestone in close proximity in various parts of Australia. The report of the Royal Commission contains a list of the witnesses who were examined. The Minister of Home. Affairs, as well as the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, will bear me out that no attempt was made to call witnesses in opposition to the principle of granting a bonus. </para>

The evidence given by all the men who came to support the granting of a bonus was so weak that the Commissioners whose names I have read out twice felt themselves justified in drawing up a strong report, from which I intend to read after I have referred to the witnesses. The list of witnesses contains many names which are well known in the commercial community. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jamieson,&#39;</inline></para>

                    <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford,</inline>and others are prominent men in commercial undertakings. All these gentlemen were examined at length. The first witness was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Edward</inline> Fisher Pittman, a gentleman who has occupied a high and honorable position in the Public Service of New South Wales for a great many years. He is a geologist, and his knowledge of the iron deposits in various parts of Australia is not excelled by that of any man in Australia, or by that of any of the experts who have been brought here from abroad. He was examined at length by the chairman and other members of the Commission. Although, in view of his official position, we did not ask him to express an opinion on the policy of granting a bonus, still he gave most valuable and interesting evidence in connexion with iron deposits and the possibility of establishing an iron industry here, which every honorable member before he votes on this Bill ought to study at length. If I find that honorable members are obdurate, and are disposed to treat this important question in a light way; if they are not prepared to study the report, it will be my duty, however long it may take, to quote those salient features which I have marked off. The honorable member for Barrier knows that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Pittman</inline> is highly esteemed by all mining people in New South Wales, and that his word on these matters has never been questioned. Another expert who was examined was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jaquet,</inline> whose attainments in connexion with mining matters are well known in Australia from one end to the other. In his evidence <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford</inline> declared that the honorable member for Parramatta, by appointing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jaquet</inline> to make full inquiries concerning the iron deposits of New South Wales, had done one of the most valuable things in connexion with the development of the iron industry. My honorable friend is entitled to great credit for what he then did. The evidence given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jaquet</inline> concerning the deposits of not only New South Wales, but other parts of Australia, forms a volume which every honorable member ought to study before he votes on this Bill. If it is passed it will afford to certain persons an opportunity of floating a company. We have it on the sworn evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jamieson,</inline> two men who are specially interested in the formation of a syndicate, that although the bonus may be instrumental in enabling them to start the iron industry, it will be of little use to them in the end, unless &#39; protective duties are afterwards imposed. This measure has been placed before us by the Minister of Trade and . Customs as a Bill providing merely for the granting of bonuses; but we know perfectly well that if the iron industry is started here as the outcome of the bonus, and some hundreds, or even thousands, of men are employed, we shall pass through the same experience as has fallen to the lot of Canada. We know that demands will be made for an extension of the bonus, or for the imposition of high protective duties. In Canada applications have been made for further and higher bounties. The American iron industry was established without the aid of any protective duty, and in Australia, where we possess abundance of natural facilities for carrying on an enterprise such as that contemplated, we should be able to get along without any artificial aid. I had not the advantage of hearing the speeches delivered by the Minister of Trade and Customs or the leader of the Opposition, but from what I can gather from the official reports, the assertion of the leader of the Opposition that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford</inline> had stated that he could manufacture iron at Lithgow at a cost of 35s. per ton was questioned. I would appeal to the honorable member for Melbourne Ports, who attended the meeting of the Commission at which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford</inline> gave his evidence, to say whether that gentleman did not squarely and fairly State that he could manufacture pig-iron at Lithgow at the price mentioned. </para>

                            <para>- I have no desire to keep honorable members, but I recognise that this is an important matter to the people of Australia. Some honorable members seem to think that it is of no importance that a large sum of money is to be taken out of the pockets of the people for the benefit of a few ; but I think it is my duty, in the interests of the country, to point out these matters, because I feel keenly and honestly about them. </para>

                            <para>- But I prefer to speak when it suits my purpose. I know that the Prime Minister wants to get the Bill into Committee, but I do not. If I judge honorable members opposite wrongly, I apologize to them, but I really do not believe that they have read the evidence of the Commission. They would not have so much calm confidence in reference to this Bill if they had done so. Let me again invite attention to what is called the minority report of the Commission. They say - </para>

                    <para>We, the undersigned members of the Commission, are against the passage through Parliament of the Bill for the payment of bonuses by the Federal Government for the establishment of the iron industry within the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para class="block">The very first clause is, it will be seen, a declaration against the principle of paying bonuses. The second clause of the report is one to which exception cannot be taken. The members of the minority recognise that the Commonwealth possesses vast deposits of iron ore, of high-grade coal, and other material required in iron works. </para>

                            <para>- I have no desire to obstruct business. I thought it would be of interest to honorable members to hear what the minority of the Commission had to say. I had also intended to quote the evidence of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Jamieson</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Franki.</inline> But, apparently, honorable members are in. a frame of mind in which they are prepared to pass anything without consideration at the dictates of the present Government. It appears that honorable members on the cross benches who believe in the nationalization of the iron industry, and not in the granting of bonuses, are not prepared to stand to their principles. On a former occasion, the honorable member for Melbourne Ports proclaimed that he was in favour of the nationalization of industries. I have looked up <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and have before me a report of his speech. But he and other honorable members are now chiefly anxious to keep the present Government in power. I suppose that one of the most treacherous things ever done in the history of parliamentary government in Australia was the means by which the present Ministry secured possession of the Treasury benches. The Prime Minister denounced Socialism from start to finish. People talk of what the leader of the Opposition has said in condemnation of Socialism in this House and in the country. But he was mild as compared with the declarations of the man who now sits on the Treasury bench, and is kept in power by the support of a party who are so obviously using him for their own ends. The public of Australia ought to understand clearly that while this measure purports to be one for granting bonuses to establish the iron industry, it is really a means by which the socialistic party are sneaking in their policy, lt is intended by them that this great industry shall be the starting point in their policy of confiscation in connexion with the industries of Australia. </para>
