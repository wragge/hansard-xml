            <para>- I wish to take advantage of the usual liberty allowed to the leader of the Opposition on the announcement of a change of Government, though I may say at once that I do not propose to make any long series of observations now. I shall reserve my right to make an extended criticism of public affairs until a more convenient opportunity, when the Ministry come down with their proposed policy. But, before we pass from this new phase of political development, it would be well to try to ascertain a little more clearly than has been done up to the present what is the precise position of parties in this House. I think that this Parliament will be known in the future as the Alliance Parliament. When the present Prime Minister was in office, at the beginning of this Parliament, he had, for some slight period, the support of that very large section of the House known as the Labour Party. The two parties sat together, as they do now. There was no written alliance, no written understanding ; but that was practically the state of things when this Parliament first met. The then Deakin Administration having been defeated; or having resigned, a Ministry came in which represented a party to which the honorable and learned member for Ballarat had up to that time made no pointed reference, except to compare it to one of three cricket elevens; but the moment that an Administration was formed by my honorable friend, the member for Bland, a new set of things was created, and the honorable and learned member for .Ballarat, on the basis of a fiscal truce which had been decreed by the people, rushed into my arms, and suddenly developed a very pointed spirit of antagonism to his former allies. He found that the voters who returned them were pawns, that the members who were returned were dummies, and that the Ministers of the party were figure-heads. He also discovered that their methods of organization outside, and their methods inside, were such as were subversive of the true principles of parliamentary government. I cordially agreed with him in that view, and we drew up a statement, to which I do not wish to refer, except to say that it pointed out the absolute inequality of the position with reference to these honorable gentlemen. The honorable and learned member for Ballarat and myself having formed an alliance.. I must now acknowledge the devoted assistance, and recognise the ceaseless energy of the efforts with which he, the honorable member for Eden-Monaro - whose capacity for negotiation is so well-known - and the honorable member for Richmond aided me in dislodging the Labour Ministry. That task, which I could not accomplish by myself, was happily accomplished with their very able assistance. Then a new alliance was formed between the Labour Party and some mysterious party known as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Isaacs&#39;</inline> party - the party of the honorable and learned member for Indi. This alliance was not only ample in its terms, but was to be of very long duration ; it was to exist during the whole of this Parliament, and the whole of the next Parliament. It got so far as an arrangement for a joint committee to control contested elections, so that the real danger feared by its members should be properly provided for. Is that alliance still in existence? I was assured by the honorable and learned member for Ballarat only a day or two ago that our alliance was intact, and that he went, to Ballarat as a loyal supporter, in order to help me in my arduous task of carrying on the Government. I do not wish to be accused of any breach of any understanding that I have entered into, but I do not at present know whether I am or am not bound by my written agreement with him. There are also some explanations due to the House and the country as to the alliance  between my friends of the Labour Party and the honorable and learned member for Indi. Is that alliance still in existence? I have often been abused by the application to me of an epithet, harmless in itself, but intended to be offensive, when I have been called a &#34; yes-no &#34; politician. Now we have something in the nature of a concerted Ministerial duet. We have three Ministers who agreed with me that the methods of my honorable friends who now sit on your right, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker,</inline> below the gangway, were utterly subversive of parliamentary propriety, and were wrong inside and outside ; that their influence was pernicious to parliamentary government, and proper parliamentary independence; that they were aiming at extreme socialistic measures, which it required the foundation of the National League at Ballarat to repel. We were told all of those things by the Prime Minister, the Vice-President of the Executive Council, and the PostmasterGeneral. On the other hand, the AttorneyGeneral, the evergreen Minister of Trade and Customs, and the Minister of Home Affairs drew a sharp line of distinction between themselves and their present colleagues. They had nothing to find fault with in the Labour caucus, or in the political organization of the Labour Party outside. On the contrary, they proposed an alliance with them under which there should be a joint committee to work the political organizations outside in harmony with the views of representatives in. this House. As for Socialism. I do not know whether they are actually Socialists, but they are ready to become Socialists on the shortest notice. So that we have this galaxy of six Ministers, three of whom sing one tune, and three another ; three of &#39; whom see nothing good in the Labour Party, its methods, principles, or organization - at any rate, so far as State Socialism is concerned, or as to their parliamentary methods, their caucus, and their leagues ; while the other three are in an alliance with the Labour Party - with those whom their three colleagues denounce as the enemies of parliamentary institutions - which is to be practically perpetual, because it is to last for two parliaments. I call this a &#34;Yes-no&#34; Ministry. </para>

          <para>- I am sorry that I have to trouble the House with a personal explanation. I do not, as honorable members know, often draw their attention to myself in that way, but I feel that statements which were made yesterday, and with which I could not deal yesterday in the House, are of a character which go so far beyond the bounds of political decency or truthfulness that I must ask honorable members to allow me their generous indulgence whilst I refer to them. These statements appeared in yesterday&#39;s leading article of a newspaper that is known, according to the newspaper law, toy the name of the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> and which is equally well known by another name, which is not registered, but which is notorious. This statement was made by that newspaper, and I must ask honorable members to bear with me in view of the seriousness of the language which was used - </para>
        </talk.start>
        <quote>
          <para>The reunited Protectionists can afford to breathe freely again, with a sense that they have escaped from a great danger. They learned in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid&#39;s</inline> speech of Thursday last, for the first time, of the full extent of his treachery towards the cause. Under the pressure of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin&#39;s</inline> argument that the Tariff Commission and its promised report radically modified the compact of a fiscal truce, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline> made the naive confession to Parliament that he had never an idea of permitting the Tariff Commission&#39;s report to be brought before this Parliament at all. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>That statement is absolutely without foundation. In my speech on Thursday night there was absolutely not a single word which could be distorted into that meaning. </para>
        <para>There was a momentary gasp in the House - </para>
        <para>I did not observe it.  when the late Prime Minister made this astounding admission of almost incredible treachery to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deakin</inline> and his Protectionist supporters ; and inquiring eyes were turned on <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Turner and Messrs. M&#39;Lean  and  M&#39;Cay  to ascertain if they, too, had been parties to this deception. </para>
        <para>The whole thing is a piece of absolutely wicked manufacture from beginning to end. There is not a singe word of truth in these statements. I notice that in an interjection which I made when the honorable and learned member for Ballarat was speaking, I said - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>I told the honorable and learned member then that there was not the remotest possibility of a report being brought up by the Tariff Commission during the present session, because its members have to go all over Australia before they can report. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That interjection mentioned no word about the Government or myself, or any intention to prevent the report of the Commission from being dealt with when it had been arrived at. I pointed to the remote possibility of the report reaching the House during the present session, and I had good reason to do that, because the Commission had not yet dealt with the subject which was thought in Victoria to be of the greatest urgency, namely, the iron industry. They had not yet dealt with that subject in any of the States, and therefore it seemed impossible to expect their report during the present session. That, however, is not all. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> goes on to say - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>We do not remember any previous example in Australian public life that can parallel this as an instance of duplicity in which a man has been convicted out of his own mouth. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Words are put into my mouth which I never used, and then I am stated to have been convicted out of my own mouth on the strength of the falsehood imputed to me. I think this reaches a depth of gutter literature which is beyond our ordinary experience. Then, again, there is another remark - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid</inline>had accepted it quite frankly as a body that was to inquire into the industries which had been strangled by the Tariff. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>That is another absolute fabrication. There were two issues before the House as to the appointment of that Commission. It was proposed to limit the Commission to an inquiry into certain specified industries, alleged to have been suffering severely, but I took up the broad ground that if there was to be any inquiry it should deal with the whole range of Australian industries. Honorable members will recollect that perfectly clearly. At the end of the article the following statement is made: - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>It was the culminating act of ten months of treachery ; and, as we have said, it wound up with the shameless admission that, as Prime Minister, he never intended permitting the Tariff Commission to make a report to Parliament. In contemplating this long course of underhand dealing we have no hesitation in saying that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Reid&#39;s</inline> Ministerial life presents the most glaring instance of political deception that any Australian Parliament has a record of. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>That is stated despite the fact that not one of my bitterest enemies has imputed to me the slightest breach of the honorable understanding I had with the honorable and learned member for Ballarat. I want to point out that, before this Commission was appointed, I made my position absolutely clear. When the honorable and learned member for Indi moved an amendment specially dealing with this matter - I think it took the form of a proposal to reduce Supply by &#163;1 - he made a remark as to certain hardships, and as to dealing with hardships which might arise under the reports - progress reports or otherwise - of the Commission, and I was careful to say to the House and the country on the 26th of October, some considerable time before the Commission was appointed, that there must be no misunderstanding upon one point. I said - </para>
        <para>The honorable and learned member for Indi quite inadvertently put me in the position of having made this great concession - that if any hardships were disclosed by the investigations of the Commission I should be prepared to remedy them. Hardships is an ambiguous term. </para>
        <para>Then, after some interruptions, I again referred to the word &#34;hardships,&#34; and I said - </para>
        <para>I wish to have no misunderstanding about this matter. At the present time, any duty which is below 30 or 40 per cent. is, in the opinion of some honorable members, a hardship to certain industries. Instead of duties of 20 per cent., they wish for duties of 30, 40, or 50 per cent. </para>

            <para>- I am going to leave no opening for that sort of abuse which has been poured on my head from day to day, and from hour to hour, both in this Chamber and out of it. I have been industriously represented as one who is always endeavouring to arrive at amicable compromises, regardless of the weighty obligations which they entail, and, therefore, I am determined that there shall be no misunderstanding about this matter. I wish it to be clearly understood that while I hold my present position, I shall absolutely refuse, during the life-time of this Parliament, to allow anything to come before this House in the name of the Government, or in spite of the Government, which amounts to a reopening of the fiscal question. If the Commission reports the existence of a state of things with reference to any industry amounting to a hardship, but recommends what does not amount to a reopening of the fiscal question between the free-traders and the protectionists, I shall be willing to give the subject my best consideration. But any honorable member who twists my statement so far as to represent me as a Prime Minister who is willing to prove false to the faith in which I believe, by bringing protectionist measures before this Chamber, thinks me capable of a breach of my trust as a public man, which I shall never commit. </para>

        <para>The only arrangement under which free-traders and protectionists can sit together on this side of the Chamber is one which, although we are prepared, even in connexion with the Tariff, to remove every sort of injustice or hardship which is brought to light, is subject to the understanding that if the opening of the fiscal question is involved to any degree worthy of serious regard, it will be our duty to go to the electors of Australia upon the subject with a distinct policy. If either wing of the Government finds that a difficulty has arisen under which the loyal protectionists and the loyal free-traders &#39;find it impossible to continue together on the present basis, I think I can say for my protectionist colleagues, as well as for my free-trade colleagues, that from that moment we part company. </para>

            <para>- The motion that has just been submitted to my mind covers a great deal more than the mere passing or granting of Supply by this House. We are asked without notice to suspend the Standing Orders to enable Supply to be granted to  His  Majesty. If we agree to the motion, I am under the impression that it will involve the granting of power to elect a  Chairman  of Committees, in order that effect may be given to it.

            <para>- The,motion, as it stands, if it be passed, will allow so many of the Standing Orders to be suspended as would intervene to prevent Supply being granted without delay. It would suspend no other Standing Orders than those. Incidentally to the granting of Supply, however, an honorable member will have to be appointed to take the chair, and therefore the Standing Orders will be suspended to the extent necessary to enable that to be done. </para>

            <para>- It seems to me that it would be much better to have two distinct motions - one relating to the granting of Supply, and the other to the appointment of a temporary  Chairman  of Committees - submitted to the House. A definite procedure has hitherto been followed by the House in dealing with Supply Bills, and I fail to see why we should depart from it. If we do, our action will be quoted on some future occasion as a precedent for the proposal of a Ministry, which may have a big majority at its back, to deal with a more important question than that of the election of a temporary  Chairman  of Committees. We are treading on very dangerous ground, and my advice is that the motion should be so altered as to agree with the procedure that has hitherto been adopted </para>

              <para>- On the point of order raised by the honorable member, I would remind the House that the motion which has been submitted by the Treasurer is precisely in the ordinary form, and does not cover the introduction of anything that is not essential to the obtaining of Supply. It would not permit of the appointment of a  Chairman  of Committees to-day, if Supply could be granted without the adoption of that course ; but  as such an. appointment is incidental and indeed necessary to the obtaining of Supply, the passing of the motion would enable that step to be taken. I see no possibility of dividing it into two parts, because it relates to only one matter. </para>

              <para>- The Government are not under compulsion to-day to do more than is essential to fulfil their purpose of obtaining Supply. In order to obtain Supply, however, it will be necessary to appoint a  Chairman  of Committees either for this d&#39;ay only or for the remainder of the session. The honorable member&#39;s suggestion, as I understand it, is that in some manner the question of Supply should be severed from that of the appointment of the  Chairman,  in order that if the House so desires it, the appointment may be for this day only- It appears that this could be accomplished by amending the motion in the way suggested by the honorable member for&#39; Lang. The Government desire to consult the wishes of the House in this matter, for the question of when a selection of a  Chairman  for the session should be made is&#39; one on which they are not entitled to dictate to honorable members. They are prepared to accept any proposal that will do justice to the consideration of the motion for Supply, and the passing of the necessary Bill. If the honorable member for Lang intends to test the feeling of the House by moving the amendment he has indicated, I would suggest that he should so amend it as to provide that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> be asked to take the chair. That would remove all cause of difficulty- It would avoid the selection of any one who is at present an unofficial member of the House, and! make the whole course of procedure absolutely official. If the honorable member will move an amendment on these lines, I shall invite the House to take it into immediate consideration, and we shall then be able to decide at once whether no not the course proposed shall be adopted. If it be not adopted. I shall hope to have an opportunity of addressing the House in regard to the method of electing a  Chairman  of Committees for the session in the event of a proposal being made to that end. </para>

            <para>- In amending the motion of the Treasurer in the direction which has been suggested we should be taking what seems to me to be a dangerous step. A section of the House holds the view that the present is an opportune time to proceed with the election of a  Chairman  of Committees. The attendance of honorable members is fairly large, and as there are absentees from all parties, I do not think that any .one party in the House would be taken at a disadvantage if we proceeded to-day with the election. Some honorable members may desire to oppose the proposal to elect a  Chairman  of Committees for this day only, although they may be favorable to the granting of Supply, and if the motion were dealt with in the complex form which has been suggested, some honorable members, in order to make their position clear, would have to take a stand that might defeat the desire of the .Government to obtain Supply. We have no desire to bring about such a situation. I therefore suggest that we should take a vote on the question of the election of a  Chairman  of Committees quite apart from the issue as to the granting of Supply. </para>

I know that precedents for this procedure have been set in some of the State Parliaments; and by adopting that course we shall overcome what appears to be a temporary difficulty. It seems to me that if no steps whatever were taken in this matter, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> would naturally be called upon to fill the office of  Chairman  when the House resolved itself into a Committee. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. FRAZER</inline>(Kalgoorlie).- It is wry rarely that an honorable member finds himself in disagreement with a proposal to place <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> in a position of responsibility. On this occasion, however, I am bound to say that no sufficient reason has been advanced why the House should not now accept the responsibility of selecting a  Chairman.  Upon the very day of the opening of last session a proposal was submitted to appoint a  Chairman  of Committees. Now, when there is work which requires to be done, and it is necessary that the position should be filled, why should we be asked to delay? I say that it is the intention of standing order 215 that at the earliest possible opportunity, when the necessity for so doing arises, a  Chairman  of Committees should be elected for the session. Why cannot we shoulder the responsibility of appointing him? It is not reasonable to suppose that we shall obtain a better attendance of honorable members, if the appointment be deferred. Consequently, I claim that we should proceed immediately with business. I intend to oppose the proposal of the honorable member for South Sydney, and I think a majority will be found in favour of my view that we ought to accept the responsibility of electing a  Chairman  without delay. </para>

            <para>- I indorse the remarks of the honorable member for Kalgoorlie, and hope that the House will come to a vote upon this matter to-day. We have about as good an attendance of honorable members as we are likely to get during the session, in the absence of a no-confidence motion. There is another reason why the selection of a  Chairman  of Committees should be proceeded with without delay. There are a number of candidates in the field, and so far I have not been asked to support one of them. I should like to be able to ca&#39;st my vote without having any unpleasant pressure put upon me. </para>

            <para>- Of course this is a non-party question, and it is very evident that all parties are divided upon it. Personally, I think that the balance of convenience is in favour of delaying the appointment of a Chairman of Committees for the reason that no notice of the intention to arrive at a decision upon that matter has been given. Honorable members should have been apprised of the fact that the question was to be decided to-day. I intend to vote for the motion, although the matter it not one of verv great importance. </para>

            <para>- I am at a loss to understand why we cannot select a  Chairman  of Committees at once. It seems to me that the House has got into the position of consistently refusing to do today what it can conveniently postpone until to-morrow. No reason whatever has been advanced for delay. Surely the House to-day is just as well, informed of the qualifications of the various candidates for the office as it will be in the future. Is the appointment to be deferred in order to provide ari opportunity for the exercise of a little more finesse? We all know the gentleman who previously occupied the position, and we know the qualifications of those who are eligible for the office. Then why not proceed with the appointment today ? Why establish a new precedent ? I intend to vote for a settlement of the question without delay. </para>

              <para>- It may save the time of honorable members if I state the exact position. At the present moment, the position is that the House has suspended all standing orders which might prevent the granting of supply forthwith. These would include the one to which the honorable member has referred - the standing order which requires notice to be given regarding the appointment of a  Chairman  of Committees. So far as that is concerned, the House has already determined upon it. The House is free, if it pleases, to appoint a  Chairman  of Committees for the remainder of the session, or it is free, if it pleases, to appoint him for this day only. </para>

              <para>- I am aware that the House is free either to .appoint a  Chairman  of Committees for the session, or for this day only. I merely desired to point out that we ought not, in order to obtain supply, to act upon the suspension of our Standing Orders, so far as to do away with the notice which, under ordinary circumstances, would have been given - regarding the election of a  Chairman  of Committees for the session. I have no desire to delay honorable members, but I do say that it is well to maintain those safeguards which the Standing Orders provide in all cases where it is not absolutely necessary to suspend them. It is not absolutely necessary to suspend them in connexion with the appointment of a  Chairman  of Committees to-day  and I trust, therefore, that the House will not persist in that course. </para>

            <para>- I very much regret that this motion has been submitted. It is not pleasant for me to be obliged to vote against you, sir, being called  upon to take the chair in. Committee, but it will bee my duty to do so if the motion is pressed to a division. If the honorable member for South Sydney can see his way clear to withdraw his proposal, he will re-  move an unpleasant <inline font-style="italic">impasse,</inline> which would compel me to vote against you, sir, being appointed  Chairman  for the time being. After so many months, I think we ought to be prepared to say who shall be our  Chairman,  and, . personally, I am quite prepared to proceed with his election. </para>

            <para>- I am very anxious to assist the Government in passing the Supply Bill, but I also wish to preserve the rights of honorable members, and it was never intended, when the motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders was agreed to, that an attempt would be made to appoint to-day a  Chairman  of Committees for the session&#39;. I do not think the Government intended that. To make such an attempt would be to adopt a course of procedure which should be condemned by every honorable member. The usual practice is for notice of motion to be given in regard to the appointment of a  Chairman  of Committees. Would honorable members like to see the Government take advantage of the suspension of the Standing Orders, moved ostensibly to get a Supply Bill passed, to deal with- some question upon which they felt very keenly, and which they thought would not be dealt with except on motion according to notice? The proposal of the honorable member for South Sydney is no new proposal. I believe that in many of the States the  Speaker  takes the chair in Committee, as a matter of course. </para>

              <para>- I have not seen the list, so that I do not know what support is likely to be given to the various candidates for the Chairmanship of Committees. Indeed, I do not know for certain who are to be candidates, and, therefore, I am not speaking in the interest of any one member. What I am asking is that fair play shall be given to those honorable members who left the State a day or two ago, under the impression that no serious business, beyond the passing of the Supply Bill, would be dealt with this afternoon. The Treasurer himself told us that practically the only business for to-day was the passing of Supply, and I_ appeal to the House not to set what would be a dangerous precedent, by dealing -with business other than Supply under the suspension of the Standing Orders. I hope that we shall have the assurance of the Government that they will not be parties to any such trick, because it would be a trick, and one which might be played against them in the future when they little expected it. 1 hope that the appointment of a  Chairman  of Committees will be made only on a day of which honorable members will have notice, so that they may not be unwittingly absent. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. REID</inline>(East Sydney). - I am sure that the motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders would not have been accepted unanimously, as it was, if there had been any idea that, under cover of that unanimous vote, any such serious business would be transacted as the appointment of a  Chairman  of Committees for the session. As I have already said, the necessity for obtaining Supply is clear. If there had been no change of Government, I should have had to ask for this Supply, and I wish to assist the present Government in getting it. I, therefore, point out to honorable members who desire that the public servants shall not be left without their pay, that if we are to go into a debate involving the merits of the candidates for a permanent selection to the Chairmanship of Committees, it will be impossible to get the&#39; Supply Bill through to-day. Honorable members may spring a surprise nomination on the House, but they cannot prevent other honorable members- </para>

              <para>- No; I am suggesting that there may be free discussion of the matter, that is all. Surely honorable members can see that if we are to canvass the merits of the candidates for the Chairmanship of Committees, we shall enter upon proceedings which will retard the achievement of the object for which we have suspended the Standing Orders. I understand that there is to be more than one candidate, and I would suggest that it will be unfair, if there are, say, three candidates, to nominate any one of them first, because the supporters of the other two will then naturally combine forces to vote against him, and he will have to meet the opposition of two parties, who would not be so combined if his were the second  and not the first nomination. When the  Chairman  of Committees is chosen, I should like to see the selection conducted in a way that would be fair to every candidate, instead of allowing one to be made the target of the supporters of the other two. </para>

            <para>- I am glad to hear thePrime Minister give the lie to a statement which has emanated from his official organ, the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper. But&#39; I wish to know if this important measure has been submitted by the right honorable member for Swan to the honorable member for Bland for indorsement before presentation to the House. If it has not been so submitted, I deeply deplore the absence of the honorable member for Bland, because, as a member of the Opposition, I am naturally anxious that no honorable alliance shall be broken, as apparently this new alliance is being broken in the fetter, if not in the spirit. It&#39; is interesting to find that the right honorable member for Swan is now compelled to submit all the proposals which he wishes to place before the House to a gentleman whom he so roundly trounced during the recess. If, however, this slight departure from the letter of the alliance has been made, if made at all, with the approval of the majority of honorable members on the Ministerial benches, and of the real master of the Government, the honorable member for Bland, I have no further remarks to offer. </para>

I submit that honorable members should be afforded time to go through the schedule and ascertain what is expected of them. Under the present circumstances, that is impossible, and we can only accept the assurance of the Treasurer that everything is in order. I trust that in future copies of the Supply Bill will be placed in the hands of honorable members at least twenty-four hours before they are asked to vote the money. </para>

            <para>- On the same day that the letter was received I wrote a minute addressed to  Colonel Hoad.  I may mention that Sheehan had committed a breach of the regulations by sending a communication to the Minister through other than the ordinary channels. The honorable and learned member for Corio knows perfectly well the channels through which a member of the Defence Forces should approach the Minister. Sheehan himself does not make the complaint referred to in the statement forwarded by the honorable and learned  member for Corio. I wrote this minute on the paper: - </para>

That is why the honorable and learned member received a reply stating that it was the practice to do certain things, instead of a statement that a certain course had been pursued in regard to Gunner Sheehan. On Wednesday I asked the Defence authorities to make further inquiries, and they did so, with the result that the papers now embrace full and specific statements by the sergeantmajor who enlisted Sheehan, and by the officer who swore him in, that he was fully cognisant of the regulations, and knew exactly the conditions under which he was enlisted- that he could not claim his discharge, but that, with the approval of the District Commandant, he could be discharged free in the first three months of his service. The District Commandant refused his approval, and that is the reason why the man did not get his discharge. I desire to point out that, so far as I was concerned, I did everything that a Minister could reasonably be expected to do, and made the fullest inquiry. I am not concerned with the rights or wrongs of the matter, which has passed out of my hands, and I desire merely to clear myself of the suggestion that I did not take the proper steps. </para>

            <para>- I desire to refer to the statement made at an earlier stage by the honorable and learned member for Corinella. He previously complained that I had given him no warning of my intention to refer to the case of Gunner Sheehan, and yet, although he had had the papers relating to the case in his hands for some time, this afternoon he did not think it necessary to give me any intimation that he intended to make an attack upon me.  His  remarks this afternoon were not intended to elucidate the matter, or to improve the position, but were rather designed to induce honorable members to suppose that I had made inaccurate statements. I have had an opportunity of glancing at the official file, and I acknowledge that the honorable and learned member has correctly read the letter addressed to him, in which I stated, amongst other things, that Sheehan was unable to see the Commandant, and that his applications to see the Minister had been refused. The honorable and learned member for Corinella remarked that the latter statement was incorrect. When I asked the honorable and learned member in what respect my statement was inaccurate, he practically admitted that every man had a right to see the Minister of Defence. </para>

              <para>- The regulations provide that a recruit shall be sworn in a certainmanner - that the conditions of service shall be clearly explained to him. When compliance is not made with those regulations - when a man is sworn in contrary to the regulations - it cannot be Said that he is legally detained. From a perusal of the papers I have gleaned the source of certain information relative to the Royal Australian Artillery, which appears in to-day&#39;s issue of the Melbourne morning newspapers. It is stated in- both journals that many men enlist for service at Queenscliff in order that they may have the advantage of the summer season, and be able to flirt with the visitors at the seaside. </para>

I do not say that the honorable and learned member for Corinella, as Minister of Defence, was personally responsible, but it was his duty to see that his subordinates carried out the regulations. </para>

            <para>- It is all very well for the ex-Minister of Defence. to seek to put this matter aside in such a light and airy fashion as he has done; but we have to remember that there is a man&#39;s freedom at stake. If Sheehan was induced to join under false pretences he should be&#39; detained no longer, whatever an ex-Minister or ten ex-Ministers of Defence may say. I shall ask the Minister of Defence to personally inquire into this case, and I have so much faith in his goodness of heart that I feel satisfied he will not allow Sheehan to be detained one day longer if he discovers that the Department is in the wrong. Surely we have not come down to the level of the barbarities practised in the armies of some of the continental countries. The exMinister, in common with the rest of the House, is to have a fortnight&#39;s holiday ; and why should we allow this man to be illegally detained for even a day ? </para>

              <para>-The honorable member for Maranoa would not laugh if the case related to a &#34;toffy&#34; officer. The statement that I have received from the men is that those who visit the big families in Toorak always received far more attention from the late Minister of Defence than did any man who was simply a gunner or a private in the ranks. I trust that the Minister of Defence will look into this case. It is said that a new broom sweeps clean. In this case the new broom will be handled by one who has at &#39; his back a far more liberal Ministry than that which has just been dispossessed of the Treasury Benches. Let the question be thoroughly sifted. The honorable and learned member for Corio has had as much military experience as has the ex-Minister. </para>

            <para>- I do not know why the honorable member for Melbourne should have lashed himself into a fury in dealing with this case. When the honorable and learned member for Corio brought the matter before the House, I requested the then Minister of Defence to allow me to peruse the papers relating, to it. He willingly complied with my request, and, after looking through them, I arrived at the con.clusion that he had gone out of his way to shield the man from trouble. It cannot be said that a man who has been sworn in is illegally detained. It is idle to suggest, as the honorable member for Melbourne would have us believe, that Sheehan was taken by the collar of his coat, and dragged into the service. He volunteered, in company with others. </para>

              <para>- The honorable member worked himself into a passion in talking about something of which he knew nothing. If this man had been in the Imperial service, he would have found himself in Millbank as the result of his action. When a man volunteers he knows what he is going to do, and we should have a curious army indeed if it were open to any soldier, at the end of three, months&#39; service, to retire, on finding that the work was not to his taste. Could the Commonwealth be expected to incur the expense of clothing and feeding a recruit, and teaching him his drill, if at the end of three months he might leave in this way? If we are to have a service on such lines, the sooner we appoint the honorable member for Melbourne General Officer Commanding the better. </para>
