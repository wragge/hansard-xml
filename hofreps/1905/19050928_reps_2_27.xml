          <para>- I thoroughly agree with the right honorable gentleman, and have been watching anxiously, from the first day of the session, for an opportunity to dispose of the Bill.. Unfortunately, however, the one question that has to be dealt with is of such importance, and is one upon which the House is so divided, that, in the absence of some understanding with regard to it, the measure would probably be lost. It is in the hope of saving the measure that I am endeavouring to arrive at some fair arrangement in regard to that matter. </para>

              <para>That, in the opinion of this House, in view of the facts that the Japanese people have placed themselves in the front rank of civilized nations; that they have proved themselves to be one of the most progressive peoples in the world;that, as a nation, they have become the honoured and trusted friend and ally of the British people, and therefore of the British Empire ; because of their high national character; and because they have become one of the greatest naval and military powers of the world : the time has arrived for differentiating the Japanese people from other Asiatic races with whom they have been impliedly grouped under the Immigration Restriction Act of1901, and for placing them, in their relationship to the people of Australia, upon the same footing of international amity as that which is now extended to European peoples. </para>

          <para class="block">Whatever other honorable members may think with regard to the motion,  I  consider it one of the gravest importance,, because it will afford this House an opportunity to recede from the step which it took in 1901 in regard to the Japanese nation - a step which I then regarded, and still, regard, as a diplomatic mistake of the first order. It is a singular fact that, although this notice of motion has been on the business paper for nearly twelve months,  I  am afforded the  first  opportunity to bring it forward, upon the very day on which there appears in the daily press a detailed statement of the second alliance entered into between the mother country and Japan. I do not hesitate to say that that alliance is one of the most intimate diplomatic alliances that the mother country has made in modern times. It is in the nature of a diplomatic marriage, because each nation has paid the other the compliment of agreeing to afford mutual assistance, for better or for worse, in the event of war during the next ten years. One cannot read the second clause of that treaty without feeling  1 hal:  the mother country, of which we always acknowledge the greatness, and of which&#39; we all feel proud, has paid the Japanese nation the most profound compliment. In order to show the far-reaching effects of this agreement, I would point out that it is provided in article 2 that -  if bv reason of unprovoked attack or aggressive action, wherever arising, on the part of any other power or powers, either of the contracting parties should be involved in war for the defence of the territorial rights or interests mentioned in the preamble of the treaty, the other power shall immediately come to the assistance of her ally, conduct the war in common, and make peace in mutual agreement with her. </para>
          <para class="block">This intimate alliance and diplomatic marriage has been effected with a nation in whose face we have slammed the door ; and it seems to me that the motion affords us an admirable opportunity for reconsidering the step which&#39; we took in 1901, though we can hardly take that course to-day with the same grace that would have characterized similar action on our part in that year. The motion has, I fear, not been understood by more than a small number of honorable members. I have gleaned from conversations which I have had with many members that they were under the impression that I was seeking to induce tlie &#39;House to alter the law in such a way as to permit of the introduction of Japanese into this country without reasonable limit. I wish honorable members to understand that I am attempting nothing of the kind - not that my view of the Japanese is not sufficiently liberal to incline me to do so, if I saw an opportunity of giving practical effect to my wish; but I recognise that as this Parliament is constituted the chances of inducing it to go back on the principle of restriction are hopeless at the -present time. All I am now asking is that the House shall deal with the Japanese people in the manner in which they asked us to deal with them in 1901, namely, to take them out of the category of Asiatic nations generally with whom they have been grouped, and to deal with them in the same way and in the same spirit that the mother country has adopted in  regard to the much greaterquestion of a common ground of defence in war. All I ask the House to do is to pass a resolution, which will authorize the Government to take some legislative step that will recognise the great national power of the Japanese people, as well as their international claims to our consideration, at the same time taking whatever precautions are required to guard against an unlimited influx of Japanese - if there should be any fear of such a thing in the future. It is necessary that I should deal briefly with the correspondence which look place, not only between the Commonwealth and the Japanese people, but between some of the States authorities, especially those of New South Wales, and the Japanese people prior to the passing of the Act which has so much offended them in their national pride. I know that anything I can say on my own account would not receive very much consideration at the hands of many honorable members. </para>

              <para>- I am obliged to the honorable member for his observation, but it does not accord with the impression which I had gleaned. I am very glad to learn that my impression was a wrong one. I have acted upon the assumption I have indicated. In my endeavours to lay before the House material which in my judgment ought to induce it to act in the manner I have suggested, I have attempted to collect data from various sources - from the press, and from members of this House whose opinions are more likely to carry weight than my own. I am very much afraid, therefore, that a large part of my speech will consist rather of the reproduction of other people&#39;s opinions than of an expression of my own thoughts, to which I have frequently given utterance in this Chamber. I assume my hearers to possess a certain general knowledge of the history of Japan, because I contend that this is a question which involves the national pride and self-respect of a great nation ; and the extent to which that pride and self-respect are valued by that nation cannot be fully understood unless we possess some knowledge of its history. I know that until a very few years ago - until Japan loomed up as a possible opponent of Russia - a large proportion of the people of Australia were under the impression that it was a barbarous nation. - When the fleet of the Japanese arrived in Australia, I not only saw in the press, but I heard from different members of the public, exclamations of the most profound surprise that Japan should possess an organized army, a navy, and a civilized form of government. That state of ignorance has passed away, _ and the world now knows much that it did not know previously. Still it is necessary, in order to understand the national character and <inline font-style="italic">morale</inline> of the Japanese, to realize the extent to which they have been offended by our action as a Parliament in 1901. It is some satisfaction to me to reflect that, in that year, I stood in this House with&#39; very few other honorable members to vindicate the cause of the Japanese. I knew the nature of the correspondence which had passed between the representatives of Japan and at least one State Government in regard to this question ; and I understood how that representative had emphasized the importance of the Japanese being treated upon terms which would, at least, entitle them to be placed upon the &#39;same footing as some of the smaller European nations. It was in consequence of my knowledge of these people, of their national power, of their self-respect, of their civilization, and of their morality, that I contended five years ago that we ought to treat them in a very different manner from that in which we have treated them in the Immigration Restriction Act.. </para>

              <para>- Yes. I did not use it, perhaps, in the Sunday-school sense in which the honorable member seems to lie applying it. I am using it in a broad philosophical sense, and I say that it is a word which is peculiarly applicable to the Japanese people. I think I shall satisfy the honorable member, if he will allow me to deal with that attribute in a less restricted waK. that some of the greatest authorities  in the world - authorities whose opinions he will admit are entitled to respect - have pronounced the judgment which I have just uttered in regard to them. Recently there have been two small but interesting books published, one bv the honorable member for Melbourne, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Japan and the East,</inline> and the other by Colonel Bell, who, for some years, filled the position of United States Consul in New South Wales.

            <para>These Empires, for feneration after generation, century after century, asked nothing of the  rest of the world, save to be left alone.

          <para>As history is counted, the years were but few since British guns had thundered at the portals of one Eastern country after another, and demanded that all doors be opened to the Britisher, not only for trade, but for residence. This historical fact certainly carried with it some counter obligations, even if there were no such things possible as international treaties or courtesy. Those who demand a privilege should be careful how they withdraw a similar privilege. </para>
          <para>Colonel Bell, who is an able thinker, has put in a very succinct . way  the same aspect of the question in a small work called <inline font-style="italic">Little Giants of the East.</inline> He says - </para>
          <para>Japan, to the great busy world fifty years ago, was little more than a geographical expression. True, a few foreign traders knew something of its resources, - and a few more knew of it as the &#34;home of happy, smiling, artistic heathens, who associated with their gods, worshipped their earthly despot, and painted fantastic figures on small and trifling things; but, to the many, the notions regarding Japan were of dreamy vagueness. </para>
          <para>It was in 1853 that Commodore Perry anchored off Unaga ; and, under the persuasive influence of the American guns an official communication was received by the Japanese Government from President Philmore. The next year the first modern Japanese treaty was signed with a foreign power, and soon a flood of light poured in which startled this wonderful nation into resolute action. </para>
          <para>Japan was not aroused from &#34; savagery &#34; in a few years ; but, having evolved splendid capabilities, with unparalleled alacrity she moved out of a dark and narrow path, into a higher, a broader, a nobler, and better sphere of thought and action - and never raw recruit handled new armour more dexterously. It was not the sudden development of an intellect; it was the application of an intellect already developed to new fields of action. </para>
          <para class="block">I have said that the Japanese are a proud, self-respecting, and sensitive people, and the correspondence which passed between them and the Commonwealth Government - preceded as it was by; correspondence between the then- Premier of New South Wales and the representative of Japan in that State - clearly shows that the public men of Australia had had placed before them the full effect which this legislation was  likely  to have upon the Japanese people. I do not hesitate to say that the urgent correspondence of a great country was never treated with  scanter  courtesy than was this Japanese correspondence by the public men of Australia. I have here a letter, written by the Japanese Consul to the Premier of New South Wales in 1897, from which I propose to read a short extract. </para>

          <para>Permit me to say that, so&#34; far as Japan is concerned, New South Wales has no reason to fear alien immigration. The Japanese Government does not wish to lose any of its subjects, and so far as the people themselves are concerned, they are under no necessity to emigrate - as may be judged from the fact that wages have nearly doubled within the last three years, consequent upon the marked development that has taken place in many industrial pursuits. </para>
          <para class="block">I may say here that, when the question was before this Parliament in 1901, I had an opportunity of looking carefully into certain figures which were laid on the table by the Barton Government, showing the number of the arrivals and departures of Japanese, Chinese, and of people of other Eastern nations, in and from Australia. I. quoted those figures then to show that during the two years immediately preceding 1 90 1, a larger number of Japanese had left Australia than had entered it. Consequently, I contended that there was 110 justification for legislation of what I then described and still consider to be, &#34;an- hysterical character.&#34; The statement that the Japanese were not anxious to enter Australia - however much persons who entertain racial prejudice may doubt it - is substantiated by the figures which were laid upon the table of this House by the then Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton.

              <para>-- I have not. On 14th September, 1901, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Eitaki</inline> again addressed the Prime Minister. I shall not read the letter, because it merely reiterates the protests made in .former communications against the passing of legislation of a character offensive to the Japanese. He pointed out in it the character of certain legislation that had been passed in Japan, and requested that some effort should be made to enter into a treaty by which the desired exclusion might be effected. In the same month <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Eitaki</inline> addressed a further letter to the Prime Minister with reference to the proposed education test. The following extract from it is certainly interesting: - </para>

          <quote>
            <para>In Japanese schools and other educational establishments the most approved European methods are adopted, and the most important works on science, literature, ait, politics, law, <inline font-style="italic">Sec.,</inline> which are published in Europe from time to time are translated into Japanese for the use of students. Thus a Japanese, without being acquainted with any other language than his own, is frequently up to a very high educational standard in the most advanced branches of study, by means of a liberal use of these translations. I cannot imagine any sufficient reason why the Japanese language should not be regarded as upon the same footing with, say, the Turkish, the Russian, the Greek, the Polish, the Norwegian, the Austrian, or the Portuguese, or &#39;why, if an immigrant of any of the nationalities  I  have mentioned &#39;may be examined in his own language, the same courtesy should not be extended to the Japanese. . . . </para>

          <para class="block">That paragraph has a bearing upon the aspect of the question now under consideration. In the Immigration Restriction Bill, as introduced, it was provided that if any European immigrant could pass an examination of fifty words in an European language, he should be considered entitled to land here. Tt was reasonable that the Japanese should think that, if the passing of an educational test in such languages as the Greek, the Polish, the Norwegian, or the Austrian, were a sufficient guarantee that the immigrant was educated in such a way as to entitle him to come into Australia, the passing of an examination in the language of Japan ,&#39;should be considered equally satisfactory, having regard to the position in which their nation stood in 1901. A further letter was addressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Eitaki</inline> to the Prime Minister on 18th September, 1901, and still another on 20th September. I ask honorable members to notice what an immense volume of correspondence took place on the one side, in order that they may appreciate what I have to say with regard to the scant courtesy afforded by the answers which were sent. On 20th September the Japanese Consul addressed a letter to the Prime -Minister, in which he referred to the <inline font-style="italic">Mansard</inline> report of &#39; a speech made by the honorable and learned member for Ballarat - the present Prime Minister - in which he said - </para>

          <para class="block">I think honorable members will recognise that so long as the Immigration Restriction Bill was so worded as to require the passing of an educational test in the English language the Japanese offered no objection, because all European and Eastern nations were treated alike. But when the Bill was so amended as to require an immigrant to pass an examination in an European language, it was held that the differentiation of the Japanese language from, those of all Europeans was such as to give rise to a sense of injury to their national pride.

          <para class="block">This, so far as I have been able to ascertain - and I shall be glad to be corrected - is the only letter which was ever sent by the Prime Minister to the Japanese Consul, in acknowledgment of the many communications to which I have referred. I submit that the Japanese authorities were treated in an off-hand manner. Apparently, it was not sufficient to have passed legislation of this kind. I cannot conceive why the Japanese Consul should not have been addressed in a spirit of diplomatic friendliness. It might have been pointed out that -whatever the Japanese might think of the attitude of Australia - so long as the people of the Commonwealth entertained a fear that the Japanese might come some day in large numbers to our shores, it was necessary to take steps to give assurances against such an influx. Had that been done, I think that the Japanese would have felt that they had at least been paid the compliment of receiving a clear, explicit, and straightforward explanation for the action of the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford</inline> uses even stronger language with regard to this correspondence.

What I contend is, that whilst we may have been justified from the point of view of &#34;the people&#34; in passing a Bill to exclude Eastern races, we were not justified in differentiating between this great nation and all the other nations of the world, of which perhaps not more than four can be compared to her. We were not justified in so differentiating between them and all the European nations, as to say, &#34; We do not even intend to provide that your language shall be one of those in which an educational test may be made.&#34; </para>

It was not honestly intended that educational fitness should be the qualification for admission to the Commonwealth. The provision in question was an indirect and politicallydishonest method of overcoming a difficulty, and was designed to give the Government a plausible sort of excuse for keeping the Japanese out of the country. </para>

              <para>- I must decline just now to reply to a series of more, or less irrelevant questions on this subject, because I desire to preserve some sort of sequence in my remarks. I contend -though I am not going to spend time in discussing this aspect of the case, because I think the House recognises the truth of what I am about to say - that the Japanese rank with the people of the first four nations of Europe. No one who has looked closely into their civilization, habits, government, constitution, and administration, can doubt that, whilst the world has believed them to be asleep, or continuing in the old exclusive manner of living which they followed for many centuries, they have really been making tremendous strides in every channel of human activity. Twentyfive years ago, when I was a law student in England, reading at the Temple, I met scores of young Japanese, who also were studying law, in order, that they might take back to Japan a full knowledge of the legal system of Great Britain. </para>

              <para>- I learnt from them that for ten or fifteen years past the same thing had been going on in every department of life, although the outer world did not know of it. A few who had travelled or read works about Japan knew of it, and those who have looked into their history, and are acquainted with their present condition, are aware that, for the &#93;as forty years, they have been making an advance such as has been unheard of in the records of any other nation. In 1901 I reminded the House that Japan is our ally ; and  1  could not then understand why we, who professed to desire the consolidation of the British Empire - by which is meant, l&#34; suppose, the wish to make it more compact, by harmonizing one part with another, and the whole with the outside world - could, in face of the fact that England was making Japan her greatest national friend, act so insultingly towards her. BecauseEngland has no compact in existence, nor has had any such compact in modern years, which will compare for its &#34; intimacy &#34; - that is the only word that I can use ire regard to this compact - with that with Japan. </para>

              <para>- They have not expressed themselves in the same way ; and, moreover, I do not think that they have so far qualified themselves as the Japanese have done by their progress, or by their enlightenment, to receive the same consideration at our hands. Perhaps I recognise as fully as does the honorable and learned member, the prospect that in the near future the Chinese, under the tutorship of Japan, will realize the strength of their position, and the possibilities of their people; but, at present, China is not so educating herself, or distinguishing herself, among progressive peoples, as to make the call upon us so strong as that which Japan puts forward. However, my feeling in this matter is such that if the honorable and learned member for Corio , will . bring forward a suitable motion, relating to the Chinese, I shall be happy to co-operate with him. I have had to look on many sides to obtain material in support of my motion, because I recognise that I might stand here for a very long time, and speak my own personal opinions of the civilization, culture, morality, and progress of the Japanese without making much impression upon, honorable members. If honorable members are not prepared to take the step that I am now about to propose, they must decline, with the full knowledge that the extreme progress which has been made by the Japanese people is now being generally admitted, and has secured for them the respect of Europe. The conditions of to-day are very different from those which obtained in 1901. Our knowledge of Japan and of the Japanese is very much greater than was then the case, and the position which the japanese occupy is verv much more forward. Altogether, Japan occupies towards Australia a. verv different position from that which she filled in 1901. In that year we might have taken the step I am now proposing, as an act of national courtesy, but to-day we shall have to act rather from considerations of international policy, because we know that Japan has become one of the great factors of the world&#39;s peace. Honorable members may recollect a wellworn text which recommends us in certain cases to make peace quickly. It is not, however, upon that ground that I am asking the House to move in this matter, because in all the literature that has come under my notice, I have never read of one phrase used by the Japanese which would indicate that they were likely to allow their disappointment or pride to prompt them to say an angry word about us. In fact, magnanimity is a national characteristic which will lead the Japanese rather to heap coals of fire upon our heads than to utter words of anger. I remember one remark of the Marquis Ito spoken by him after he had commented on the action of the Australian people, and the effect it would have upon the Japanese. He said that he wondered &#34;what the Australian people would say if some day when they were in trouble, the Japanese sent their fleet down into their waters - to help them out of their difficulty ! That is the spirit of the Japanese people, and no Britisher who has not studied their national characteristics can thoroughly realize their magnanimity with regard to others who have given them offence. I have not met with one report of an utterance by a Japanese politician or public man, in which any angry spirit was allowed to escape. All that was indicated was a feeling of disappointment and offended pride at the way in which their nation had been treated. I should like to quote an utterance of the honorable member for Gippsland, which seems to me to accurately present the position to-day. In the course of an interview on 13th June, he said, with regard to Japan - </para>

            <para>The question as to what Australia should do, in view of the altered condition in the East, is a big one - the whole situation will require to be carefully considered by the Federal Government. It&#39; must be apparent to every thinking man that the sense of security we have always considered we derived from our great distance from the bases of all the great military or naval powers of the world, has now been removed. We now find one of the great naval and military powers of the earth within a very short distance of our shores. That puts us in a very different position from that which we considered we occupied heretofore. . . It is fortunate for us that the great power that has recently arisen in the East is friendly with Great Britain. She is an ally of the Empire. Of course, that condition of things might not always continue. </para>

If I were asked to make a succinct summary of that publication I should say that the honorable member started from Australia with very many racial prejudices, and a determination to keep all Asiatics out of Australia. The book shows that his visit to Japan has caused him to completely shed all the grounds for his prejudices ; although I am bound to say that it demonstrates _ that his prejudices continue, and that he is as determined as ever to keep the races of the East out of Australia. </para>

            <para>The motion of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> Smith gave notice yesterday in the Australian Federal House of Representatives will evoke a feeling of gratitude and satisfaction both in England and Japan.  His  reason far the proposal is that Japan, by her work of civilization and reform, has shown her right to be regarded as one of the great nations of the world. Japan is England&#39;s ally ; and it were only right and proper that the subjects of a State, whose policy, as we know, from a note of Lord Landsdowne&#39;s  is identical with that of England, should be treated with a full measure of respect by the New England of the Southern Hemisphere. Like the Italians of the  Riso Gimento,  they have conquered the world&#39;s esteem in battle; and whatever the issue of the present struggle, their conduct during it will be embalmed in history as one of the most precious examples of human fortitude and devotion in the hour of tribulation- The war may be said to have made an end of the ancient superstitions regarding the illimitable gulf between Europe and Asia. In Japan the impartial observers of the world have seen a State which obeys the Western code of honour, whose subjects make war in the most chivalrous manner, whose statesmen keep the pledges which they give, whose people are ready to a man to be killed for a great idea. The hard things which are said today about Japan upon the continent were said forty years ago about Sardinia, and will hereafter be said about any State which arises to disturb the existing conditions of world power. But they cannot hide the fact that Japan is in the right, and fighting, as we in England believe, for a cause which is the highest and greatest to be conceived by man - her freedom, her integrity, her very existence as a nation. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Quite apart from the war, however, the question which we have to consider is : Are the Japanese as a nation worthy of Australian consideration ? Honorable members will notice that I do not at present ask that they shall be permitted to enter Australia. I merely ask that we shall deal with them by treaty, in order that their national .feeling may not be wounded, as it has hitherto been. I do not suggest that they shall be permitted to enter Australia in large numbers, but I wish to ask whether they are worthy of our trust? That question ought to be answered without the slightest hesitation. The mere fact that the mother country has entered into so remarkable a treaty with them should be conclusive evidence that they are so worthy. But if we must look more Closely into the history of Japan as a nation, and the <inline font-style="italic">morale</inline> of her people, let us see how she stands when compared with other nations. In the first place, it is well known - and I regard it as one of the greatest tributes to her stability as a nation - that she has lived for 2,500 years under the same line of monarchy. For twenty-five centuries there has not been the. slightest departure from the Imperial line of descent from which the present Mikado springs. That is certainly a strong argument in favour of national stability, and that .is the attribute to which the British nation should look more than to any other. Japan had her census as far back as 86 b.c. It is recorded in her history that at the time the people in Great Britain - prior to the visit of Caesar - were running about with their bodies painted, the Japanese had established a census, and as late as 658 a.d.  -  that is, 400 years before the Norman conquest - they had systematized it to such an extent that it could be relied upon as a trustworthy record of her population. In 1900, no less than 13,000 foreigners visited Japan. That nation had advanced to such an extent that no difficulty appears to have been experienced by outsiders in entering her territory and travelling through it. Only the other day I heard some honorable member say that the Japanese really excluded other races from their country, and that consequently other nations were justified in retaliating. In refutation of that statement I would point out that it is recorded in statistical works - the accuracy of which there is no reason to doubt - that no less than&#39; 13,000 foreigners - one-sixth of whom were Britishers - visited Japan in 1900, without any embargo being placed upon their movements. </para>

              <para>- Certain classes of Japanese come here at the present time without experiencing any1 difficulty. That fact, however, only strengthens mv argument. If we allow them to enter this country, surely they are entitled to expect us to deal with them in the less offensive way I suggest - that is, by treaty - so thattheir intercourse with us other than by merevisits may be regulated in a manner which is not calculated to wound their national pride. I am aware that my speech must resemble an historical essay ; but the nature of the case demands that I should put before the House the character and history of the Japanese, whom we have hitherto treated in so arbitrary a way, and whom I wish should be treated differently in the future. I come now to some testimony with regard to the monarch who stands at the end of a dynasty which extends for 2.500 years without a break. In his book, Colonel Bell says - </para>

              <para>- I should like to say that if we ourselves were to be judged by precept and practice, and if true Christianity were taken as the basis of conduct in our own country, we should find that there is a greater chasm between the actual and the ideal than is to be found in any other country in the world. There is no country in which one standard is being preached, and another practised more than is the case in our own. I would therefore ask the honorable and learned member for Corio, who has had a legal training, to consider for a moment the logic of his interruption. What possible bearing can it have on my present contention? I am not suggesting that we should shake hands with the Japanese - that our people should be compelledto intermarry with them - in short, thatwe should take them to our national bosom. I am merely urging that we should deal with them in a diplomatic manner, in order that we may regulate their inability to enter our country. The Constitution of Japan is one which every honorable member would do well to study. I had the advantage of receiving a copy of it some four years ago, and I venture to say that it is one of the most enlightened Constitutions that the world has seen. Everybody is aware of the immense trouble which was taken in its preparation and drafting. The Marquis Ito - one of the most eminent statesmen in the world - spent years in Germany, the United States, and Great Britain, during which time his attention was almost exclusively devoted to the drafting of a Constitution for Japan, because the adoption of that Constitution was to mark an entirely new era in the history of that country. It placed her people and affairs upon an entirely new basis, and substituted for a rational despotism - a despotism which was certainly in the hands of a very wise man - a system of representative government which is as liberal as is our own.

          <para class="block">If we look to her Parliament, what do we find ? She has a House of Representatives, like our own, and a House of Peers. But in connexion with the House of Peers, we find a novel feature, which is suggestive even to ourselves. That branch of the Legislature includes not only Princes of the blood and Peers, but men of distinguished service, of remarkable erudition, and representatives of the highest taxpaying section of the people. In Japan it is held that the particular district which can show that it has Paid the largest share of the taxation of the country shall be entitled to send representatives into the House of Peers to take part in checking its legislation. </para>

              <para>- It is scarcely copied from England, because it does not &#39;provide that men who have succeeded in industry merely shall enter the House of Peers. The Japanese Constitution makes provision for the nomination to that branch of the Legislature of men of distinguished service, of remarkable erudition, and of representatives of the highest taxpaying section of the people. Every Englishman looks upon the practice of transferring wealthy brewers, who may, possibly, never have opened their mouths in the House of Commons, into the House of Lords, as an abuse of a fine principle. There is no justification whatever for declaring that the procedure in Japan finds a /parallel in the old country. In Japan, the Constitution merely allows the district which has paid the highest proportion of the revenue, to nominate its own representatives in the House of Peers. It is very unfair to attempt to introduce a parallel which has no application, whatever. Let us now look at Japan&#39;s Courts of Justice. &#39;In that country we find that there is one Supreme Court - a sort of Privy Council - seven Appeal Courts, forty-nine local Superior Courts, and 310 District Courts. They have seven Judges to every Supreme Court, five to every Appeal Court, three to every local Court, and one to every District Court.

          <para class="block">That is striking testimony to the way in which the Parliament of Japan and its Courts are conducted. Their laws were codified and systematized as far back as 1882, and again in 1889, and I may also say - although being a senior member- of the Bar myself, I cannot claim that it redounds to their credit - that they have an organized Bar of advocates for suitors before their different Courts. Their Parliament is as deliberative and at least as levelheaded as our own. Their laws are as certain as our own, their Bench is as pure as our own, and their Bar is as honorable as our own. </para>

              <para>- I cannot undertake to give opinions on Japanese law. It is very difficult now-a-days to say what is the English or Australian law, but it would be much more difficult for an Australian to express an opinion on a Japanese law point. I hope, therefore, that the honorable member will not put such questions to me. The population of Japan in 1903 was 46,7323000, and an interesting fact bearing on our present loss of population in Australia is that her excess of births over deaths  in the same year was 542,000. I wish now to refer briefly to the character of her people. My first witness, if I may speak in <inline font-style="italic">Nisi prius</inline> language, is the honorable member for Melbourne, who, in a little book upon Japan which he recently published, writes - </para>

            <para>Though I have called this chapter the &#34; Head of the  Peril,&#34;  I do not propose for one moment to stint my admiration or modify in any way my appreciation of the people of whom I have  seen a  little, andtaken some pains to understand.

            <para>It is a head in which exquisite pathos and tenderest sentiment are blent with iron determination, and courage which is absolutely identical with the back to back courage  of  sternest despair; identical with the courage  of  the Zulu, who went  on  because certain death was behind ; and with that  of the  Moslem, who saw, plain  as  the rising day, beyond death, the voluptuous paradise. </para>
            <para>And with all that there is a love  of  country, such as, with all deference, I  do  not think even an Australian can understand. </para>
            <para class="block">I think that testimony like this - coming as it does from an honorable member who stands in the forefront of the party which took such active steps to exclude the Japanese from Australia - as to the national character and morality of the people of that country, is of the highest value. If I were in a Court of law I should regard the honorable member as a witness on the other side who had made valuable admissions, carrying much more weight than the asseverations of one&#39;s own witnesses.

            <para>Our moral notions do not materially differ from either the Greek ethics of the Platonian school and the moral teaching of the Gospel in essence and purport. Morality has been a feature in Japanese education for centuries. It has developed side by side with Bushido or chivalry, the dicta being chiefly founded on the precepts of Confucius. </para>

            <para>Throughout all grades of the educational system in Japan this Imperial code forms the  basis  of the moral and ethical teachings. Regular hours are devoted in the State schools to lessons in this law; and on the great days of festival it is read aloud, and addresses given on its precepts. </para>
            <para class="block">I shall now read an extract from a leading article recently published in the <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> which is a great tribute to the national character of the Japanese, and which I think they are entitled to have read throughout Australia - , </para>
            <para>Beneath all this amazing power of devoted cooperation for a common national ideal there must, of course, be a solid ground of individual character; and the elements that go to make that form the most interesting part of the study which the Jap has drawn upon himself by his prowess. In the first place, his religion looks nebulous to us, on account of our different point of view. What it lacks in definiteness of dogma and mythology it makes up for in depth of sentiment - affection, which is the motive power of active morality, is the inner spirit of the Japanese religion. The intense appreciation of family affection in Japan causes the people to practice kindness and consideration from their earliest years. The passage to the civic virtues is then easy. Family affection widens to friendship and friendship to patriotism. Hence the whole Japanese ethical system, known as Bushido, rests without dogma on the principle that the highest -satisfaction is to be found in the exchange of kindness. Bushido makes the interests of the family the concern of each member, it makes the interests of the State the concern of each family. </para>

          <para class="block">My limit of time has been almost reached, and I am anxious to come to some of the more substantial testimonies with regard to the civilization of these people. I have before me testimony as to Japanese statesmanship, and also testimony from various sources as to the Japanese civilizing and colonizing policy. I have also a <inline font-style="italic">resume</inline> of an article which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Times,</inline> giving an account of the astonishing work which has  been  done by the Japanese Government in colonizing the island of Formosa. They found in the interior of &#187;that island people of no higher grade than are those of the interior of New Guinea today - cannibals - while pirates and a variety of other criminal classes were living on the coast. But since entering into possession of the island, they have established manufactories there, constructed .railways, opened up mines, built for the people, and taught them agricultural pursuits. Formosa is now one of the most promising possessions of the Japanese people. A striking contrast of some of the work that has been done by our own people is offered by the honorable member for Melbourne, whose testimony the House will see I highly value, regarding it, as I do, in the nature of admissions by the other side. He says, speaking of Western colonization - </para>

            <para>I find it impossible to doubt that in their own lands and in their own waters the Easterners, as represented by the Japs and the Chinese, must henceforth be regarded as invincible, and not to be touched aggressively with any impunity. And, following immediately on that appears the advisability - nay, the urgent&#39; necessity - of every power of the West considering forthwith its position in the East. </para>
            <para>A reckless and rapacious inconsiderateness has so far characterized all their exploitations, for every &#34; Sphere of Influence &#34; is but a field of exploitation. The one object has been to make profit - that -is, to drag away the wealth, the accumulated produce of the East for the support and enrichment of the West. All talk of civilization and Christianization is mere pretence and humbug. Wherever the West has. settled down in most force, there degradation of the native people is most deplorable. Bryce states this plainly as regards Canton, and it is true all along the coast. The white settlements are made up of a few high-class officials, some few of them, it may be admitted, white flowers of the garden of our highest civilization. But the bulk is vile : and in the general system there are elements mixed, repulsive to honest democratic ideas, as insulting and offensive to the great people trespassed on. </para>

          <para class="block">That passage and the facts it embodies offer a very striking contrast with the effect which Japanese colonization has had upon Formosa. For want of time, I pass away from a mass of interesting matter to quotations in a more concrete and statistical form. I have in my possession to-day two most valuable and complete statistical works on Japan. </para>
          <para class="block">One is called the <inline font-style="italic">Financial and Economical Annual of Japan,</inline> and the other <inline font-style="italic">Japan in the Beginning of the Twentieth Century.</inline> Both have been translated into English, and both have attached to them diagrams of a most careful and scientific character. I do not hesitate to assert that no country in the world is at the present time publishing statistical works which are more carefully and scientifically prepared, or more beautifully and informingly illustrated by their diagrams, than are those published in Japan. These works treat o|f finances, loans, currency, money market, banks, clearing houses, army, navy, post and telegraphs, railways, shipping, education, colonization, and industries. They show that the trade of Japan with the outside world is worth something like ,&#163;21,500,000; the trade with Europe being worth about .&#163;9,500.000, and the trade with Asia about &#163;12,000,000. Japan&#39;s trade with British India is worth about ,&#163;5,000,000 a year, and with Great Britain about the same. In Japan there are 28,000 public schools, attended by 5,085,000 scholars, and - 1,676 private schools, attended by 173,000 scholars. There are 109,000 professors, and teachers in the public institutions of the country, and 8,000 in the private institutions. Japan&#39;s schools are classified as primary, blind, deaf and dumb, normal, higher normal, middle, higher girls, high, universities, special, and technical. There are seventy -eight high schools and 400 technical schools. Occupying university chairs are twenty-nine professors of law, twenty-seven professors of medicine, twenty-one professors of literature, twenty-one professors of science, and twenty-two professors of agriculture. There are also special schools which give instruction in agriculture, commerce, navigation, and fisheries. The Japanese Imperial library contains 419,000 volumes, and there are forty-nine country libraries, containing 408,000 volumes. A writer on Japanese education says : - </para>

The Government schools are all secular, and neither of the four religions of the  country  - Buddhism, Shintoism, Confucianism, or Christianity - is taught, but good moral science is taught in them all. In the school books they are taught to be honest and truthful, and sober and modest, polite and respectful to their parents, and to their brothers and sisters, and neighbours, and charitable to the poor ; to train and cultivate their moral faculties ; to train and cultivate their intellectual faculties, and to be upright in every thought, word, and action.....

The causes of non-attendance were poverty in 84 per cent, of the cases, sickness in 13 per cent., and miscellaneous causes in 3 per cent. </para>

          <para class="block">There were, in 1902, 250,072 pupils studying English, while only 8,973 pupils were studying other languages foreign to the Japanese, a great compliment to the country to which we belong. Although Japan has a population of only about 47,000,000, and a territory of about 163,000 square miles, while Russia has a population of about 130,000,000, and a territory of nearly 9,000,000 square miles, Japan has more pupils in her schools than there are in the Russian schools. In Japan&#39;s elementary schools there are 4,302,000 pupils while in Russia&#39;s elementary schools there are only 4,193,000 pupils. In Japan, 92 in every 1,000 of the inhabitants go to school, and in Russia only 32 in every 1,000. The figures for . secondary schools and1 universities are equally in Japan&#39;s favour. The Japanese are great readers of both books and newspapers. I find that in one year the books taken from the public libraries numbered 668,703. The greatest number of books read in that year related to mathematical science and medicine. In the next class were those relating to history, biography, geography, travels, and voyages. Then came those relating to literature and language. Next came those relating to law, politics, sociology, economy, and statistics . After them came those relating to arts, industries, engineering, and military and naval science, while the rest were encyclopedias or related to miscellaneous subjects. Apparently no works of fiction were supplied by these libraries ; or, if such books were issued, there is no record of them. Japan encourages inventions ; 7,000 patents have been granted in that country, together with 21,000 trade marks- and 2,000 designs. The Department of State records a farming population of 28,000,000. There is an agricultural department, whose branches deal with irriga tiran, drainage, reclamation, and fertilization, and  in  connexion with which there are experimental farms for instruction  in  agriculture, sericulture, cattle breeding, and horse breeding, while .publications  on  agricultural subjects are issued. There  is  a hypothec bank, with local branches, which makes advances  to  farmers for .all purposes  of  their industry. Mining for coal, oil, iron&#39;, copper, and sulphur  is  carried  on in  the country. ; Coming  to  the finances, I find that the public revenue  is  251,000,000 yens,  or  ,&#163;25,000,000 a year, and the public expenditure 245,000,000 yens,  or  ^24,500,000, a year. In 1903, Japan&#39;s national debt was 595,000,000 yens,  or  ^59,500,000, which  is  little more than two-thirds  of  the public debt  of  New South Wales, and about the same  as  that  of  Victoria; although Japan has managed  to  buy for herself one  of  the finest navies in the world, and has proved herself superior  to  one  of  the greatest European military powers. In banking, Japan  is as  much to the fore  as is  Australia. The  hanks  doing, business there are the Bank of Japan, the Yokohama Specie Bank, the Hypothec Bank&#34;  of  Japan, the local Hypothec Banks, the Hokkaido Colonization Bank, the Industrial Bank  of  Japan, besides ordinary banks and savings banks. In 1902, Japan&#39;s despatches  of  foreign mails, including parcels, papers, and letters, numbered 6,776,000, and the arrivals 7,010,000. Sixty thousand foreign moneyorders were issued, and 9,000,000 domestic money-orders. In the Postal savings- banks  of  the country,  in  1903, there were 2,859,000 depositors. Seventeen million telegraphic messages were despatched throughout Japan  in  1902, and 600,000 foreign telegraphic messages were sent away. There are 30,000 telephone subscribers  in  that country. Her  domestic  postage  in  1902 included 208,000,000 letters, 484,000,000 postcards, 149,000,000 newspapers and magazines, 48,000,000 other packages, and 10,000,000 parcels,  or  900,000,000 posted articles  in  all. Thirty-seven million pounds have been invested  in  railways  in  Japan, there being 3,010 miles  of  private lines and 1,226  of  Government lines, Her shipping,  in  1902, included 1,441 steamers, aggregating 610,000 tons; 3,977 sailing vessels, aggregating 336,000 tons; and 18,742 junks, aggregating 2,351,000 tons. These figures show that Japan  is  progressing by leaps and bounds,  in  a way  in  which pro- bably no other country has progressed in the world&#39;s history. I invite those who doubt the wisdom of the modest step which I advocate to look into these statistical works for themselves. If they do, they will be astonished at the proportion of the track and national concerns of Japan. It may be asked, what are other countries doing in this matter? I would refer, first, to the example of Canada. A cable of the 26th April stated that the Canadian Dominion House of Commons had disallowed British Columbia legislation against Japanese immigrants, on the ground that such restrictions were incompatible with British6 Imperial interests. In <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pulsford&#39;s</inline> book on <inline font-style="italic">The British Empire and the Relations of Asia and Australia,</inline> there is an account of the steps which  President  Roosevelt has taken to insure the courteous treatment of Japanese citizens, and only this week it was reported that an American Chamber of Commerce has asked the  President  of the United States of America to recommend .Congress to pass legislation which will promote harmony between the United States and Japan. On the 23rd June, a cable message stated that Canada had invited Great Britain to ask Japan to include the Dominion in the terms of the Anglo- Japanese treaty of 1904. I do not wish to prolong my remarks, because the time allowed by the Standing Orders for the discussion of motions has nearly expired. I only wish to say, in conclusion, that I have heard a little song which speaks of &#34; lovers in the shade &#34; and &#34; summer friends.&#34; Japan is now in the summer of her existence, and I find great satisfaction in the reflection that four years ago, when she was not the Power which she is to-day, and, as far as Australian public opinion was concerned, stood &#34; in the shade,&#34; I had realized her strength, her progress, her importance, and her future, and then asked what I ask now. I beg the House to take a liberal view of this question. Honorable members will see clearly that the motion does not ask that the Japanese shall be admitted to our shores, if we are not yet ready to go so far in our liberal policy. If we are not cosmopolitan enough, if we are not liberal enough, to see the advantages of having Japanese amongst us, let us at least arrange in a friendly way for their exclusion, so that a self-respecting nation will not feel called upon to sacrifice its just feelings of national pride. </para>

          <para>That an humble Address be presented to  His  Majesty as follows : - May it please Your Majesty : </para>
          <para>We, Your Majesty&#39;s dutiful and loyal subjects, the Members of the House of Representatives, in Parliament assembled, desire most earnestly in our name and on behalf of the people whom we represent, to express our unswerving loyalty and devotion -to Your Majesty&#39;s person and Government. </para>
          <para>We have observed with feelings of profound satisfaction the evidence afforded by recent legislation and recent debates in the Houses of Parliament of the United Kingdom, of a sincere desire now to deal justly with Ireland; and in&#39; particular we congratulate the people of the United Kingdom on the remarkable Act directed towards the settlement of the land question, and on the concession to the people of Ireland of a measure of Local Government for municipal purposes. But the sad history of Ireland since the Act of Union shows that no British Parliament can understand or effectively deal with the economic and social conditions, of Ireland. </para>
          <para>Enjoying and appreciating as we do the blessings of Home Rule here, we would humbly express the hope that a just measure of Home Rule may be granted to the people of Ireland. They ask for it through their representatives - never has request more clear, consistent, and continuous been made by any nation. As subjects of Your Majesty we are interested in the peace and contentment of all parts of the Empire, and we desire to see this long-standing grievance at the very heart of the Empire removed. It is our desire for the solidarity and permanence of the Empire, as a Power making for peace and civilization, that must be our excuse for submitting to Your Majesty this respectful petition. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. RONALD</inline>(Southern Melbourne).I have very few remarks to add to those which I have already uttered in support of this motion. When I previously addressed the House I omitted to explain why the motion had passed from my hands into those of the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne. The explanation is a very simple one. When I first proposed to take action in this matter, I consulted the honorable and learned member, and asked him to table a motion on the subject. At that time he was not prepared to do so, and I then stated that if no one else took action I was prepared to table a motion myself. Afterwards I found that the honorable&#39; and learned member was prepared to take an active part in bringing the matter before the House, and I readily gave way to him, knowing that he, as an Irishman and an enthusiastic Home Ruler, would do full justice to the subject. Moreover, I had already addressed the House on the matter, and I did not wish to inflict myself upon honorable members a second time. I desired, further, that the subject should be dealt with from a fresh stand-point. The honorable member for Dalley recently made an assertion, which I think calls for an immediate and emphatic contradiction. He stated that the Marquis of Linlithgow, formerly GovernorGeneral of the Commonwealth, was an Orangeman, the evident intention being to support the organization by lending to it the weight and dignity of a highly-esteemed gentleman, and to a corresponding degree to prejudice- the cause of Home Rule for Ireland. I challenged the honorable member for proof in support of his statement, but he was unable to furnish it. I think it is unfortunate &#39;that the name of the first Governor-General of the Commonwealth should have been dragged into a debate of this kind, in association with an organization whose aim is to set one section of the community at the throats of the other section, and which lives upon the prejudices of the past. I believe that the Marquis of Linlithgow has had an inquiry addressed to him as to whether he was ever associated with the Orange institution, and, although no reply has yet been received, a letter has been addressed to me by a gentleman who las so confident that the statement made by the honorable member for Dalley is without foundation that he is prepared to make a liberal donation to any charitable! institution named by the honorable member for Dalley if if can be proved that his statement is correct. He writes as follows : - </para>
        <quote>
          <para>I received the paper you sent, and with much pleasure read your speech on the Home Rule movement. I consider the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wilks</inline> should be challenged. He stated, &#34; That the province of Ulster was opposed to Home Rule for Ireland.&#34; He also referred more particularly to my native county; Down. Having been in that county, and brought up among Presbyterians in that county, I have had good opportunity of knowing the feelings and aspirations of the people, and know as a positive fact that they are almost to a man in favour of Home Rule, and have from time to time for years elected members to the British Parliament, pledged to Home Rule, among them a relative of mine. Another statement made was that Lord Linlithgow was an Orangeman. I feel confident that statement was untrue, and if it can be proved. that he has ever taken the Orangeman&#39;s oath, I am willing to give a liberal donation to a charitable institution, feeling confident that that honorable gentleman has too high a sense of honour to take so vile an oath. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">If the Marquis of Linlithgow had associated himself with the Orange movement, his connexion with it would not have enhanced the prestige of the society, but would have caused that eminent gentleman to fall greatly in the esteem of a large number of citizens of the Commonwealth. I refuse to believe the statement until it is proved beyond all doubt to be true. We have already demonstrated that upon political, national, and moral grounds we are perfectly entitled to express our opinion that it is desirable to grant autonomy to Ireland. We have answered the objections which have been advanced in support of the hands-off policy, namely, the contention that we are not justified in interfering with the domestic policy of the Empire, to the extent contemplated. We have pointed to a number of precedents which are furnished by the history of the Empire, and I submit that the interchange of opinions between the Legislatures in the various portions of  His  Majesty&#39;s dominions are calculated to lay the foundation of a practical Imperial or Anglo-Celtic Federation. I do not for one moment suppose that the Imperial Parliament will regard our action in presenting an address to  His  Majesty upon the subject of Home Rule for Ireland as an impertinence or as any undue interference by us in matters beyond our province. No such intention &#39; underlies the proposal. They did not so regard the kindred motion which was passed three times in Canada. The attitude of certain honorable members in opposition to this motion is perfectly intelligible. They think that an attempt is being made to intro: duce a disturbing element into our political life. I am sorry to say that the disturbing element of factional prejudices is already in operation amongst us, and that our political affairs cannot be established upon a reasonably secure basis until the present vexed question of Home Rule for -Ireland is settled. I believe that the resolution will be accepted by the British Parliament in the spirit in which it is .conceived. It contains one paragraph which I should prefer to see excised; but I can assure honorable members that there is no intention to commit an impertinence or to affront the Imperial authorities. I need not delay the House any further, because I have already spoken at considerable length on a former occasion. I hope sincerely that the motion will be agreed to by a large majority, and that we shall be able to demonstrate to the Imperial authorities that, apart from anything approaching a meddlesome spirit, we take a lively interest in the domestic affairs of the nation. Further, I hope that the interchange of opinions between the Legislatures of the nation may prove to be the beginning of a closer and more tangible union, which may ultimately take the form of a Federation of the Anglo-Celtic races. Referring once more to the statement of the honorable member for Dalley, that the Marquis of Linlithgow was connected with the Orange institution at one time, I wish to say that, even if our former GovernorGeneral was induced to join the organization, he could not have been aware of the hideous oath by which he would be required to bind himself to carry out the objects of the order. I feel perfectly sure that he will give an emphatic denial to the statement. </para>

            <para>- I do not think any one can ever have his attention drawn to any question affecting the welfare of the people of Ireland without expressing the strongest possible sympathy with the Irish .people in reference to the long and dark period of oppression and injustice through which they have passed at the hands of the superior power of Great Britain. No man can become familiar with Irish history without feelings of profound indignation at the intolerance and injustice which animated the dominant power in its dealings with the Irish people. But there is no doubt that , many df the miseries of Ireland were not due to oppression or injustice. Some of the saddest aspects of Irish history are presented by the bitter feuds winch have paralyzed the real power of the Irish race for many centuries. If they had been as united in the defence of their rights as the smaller population of Scotland has been, they would have been able to stand side by side in those days, as the patriots&#39; of Scotland did, and we may be sure that many a dark page of wrong and hardship would never have been written in the history of the Irish race. One of the sources of their weakness was the intense dissension which in those days seemed to mark the relations of the various divisions of the Irish people, and one cannot help regretting that even to-day they are divided by differences of the bitterest  kind. I would also say that no one can help expressing his highest admiration for the character of the Irish people. The effect of oppression and wrong upon national character has often been disastrous. Many noble (peoples have been bent down by oppression and wrong until they have lost the noblest attributes of their national temperament. But we are glad to know that, in spite of the wrongs which they suffered in those dark centuries, the inhabitants of Ireland stand before the world today as one of the most generous, virtuous, and gifted peoples on the face of the globe. Another of their attributes which excites - and ought to excite - the gratitude of every loyal subject of the Empire, is that they repaid oppression and injustice by magnificent services to Great Britain. Their achievements on the battle-fields, which helped to win the Empire, their brilliance in diplomacy, their signal services in the governing circles of the nation, have been such as to excite admiration. I have said enough to show that I approach this subject with no unworthy feeling, with no disparaging element of scepticism as to the worth of the Irish race. I now come to the motion, which is under consideration. Whilst there are many sentiments in the proposed Address which must elicit our approval, we have to ask ourselves: &#34;What is the practical point of these resolutions &#34; ? It is that a request, in the form of a petition to the King, shall lie submitted in the name of the House of Representatives of the Australian Commonwealth, asking the people, the Government, and the representatives of the United Kingdom, through the Sovereign, to make a vital change in the system of parliamentary government which prevails there. I encounter, upon the very threshold of this proposal, one or two most serious difficulties. In the first place, whilst upon every matter which affects any ; part of the Empire it is the undoubted right of every British subject to express his opinions - whilst he has the right to appear upon any platform to ventilate any grievances - when we seek to express our opinions, not in our individual capacity, but as embodying the views of Parliament, and as representing the voice and judgment of the people, we have one or two preliminary questions to consider. The first is: &#34;What right has the House of Representatives in this Commonwealth to propose to interfere in one of the burning questions of political controversy in the mother country to-day?&#34; </para>

              <para>- I repeat, we must draw the sharpest possible line between, the right which we enjoy as individual subject&#39;s of the King to express, in any way we please, our opinions upon any question coming within the wide range of Imperial politics, and the proposition that this House should make an official representation to the British Parliament upon a question which is not an Australian question, and one that excites the most vital differences of opinion in the three kingdoms - a question which has divided people in the mother country as very few great questions have done. I wish to know where is the basis of our right to make such a representation? We have been sent into this Parliament to attend to the politics and the business of the Commonwealth. We have not been sent here to interfere with the people or Parliament of the United Kingdom upon any matter of domestic concern, or in regard to any alteration of the British parliamentary system. I do not know what may have been the experience of other honorable members, but during my public life, which embraces a period of twenty-five years, I have never been asked at any public meeting my opinion upon the subject of Home Rule for Ireland. Only once did the matter come before me in the course of my public career. I recollect that a long time ago the representative of a great English journal waited upon public men in Australia to ask their opinions upon the subject of Home Rule for Ireland, and in the course of his interviews he called upon me. I at once told him that I declined to be interviewed upon that question. I absolutely declined then, as I, will decline now, to incorporate false issues with Australian politics. We have a sufficient number of burning questions of our own to attend to without complicating the politics of Australia with inquiries whether a man does, or does not, believe in Home Rule for Ireland. If that subject came before the people of Australia, it would excite just as lively a difference of opinion here as it does in the mother country. Thus we should add a burning issue to Australian politics which is, in my judgment, absolutely foreign to it. I view with the greatest apprehension any interference by one part of the Empire with the political concerns of another part. What has made the harmony of our wonderful Empire possible? What has made it possible to develop the self-governing rights of different parts of the Empire but the marvellous wisdom which has led our great selfgoverning bodies to mind their own business? I ask honorable members to regard just for a moment the immovable respect of that mighty Mother of Parliaments - the British House of Commons - for the self-governing rights of the dependencies to which she gave the freedom which attaches, or ought to attach, to parliamentary institutions. How tempted the British Parliament must have been to address petitions to the King in. reference to &#39;many developments in the Commonweal ti 1 Legislature? How tempted that Parliament, which stands above us all, and which by a few words in a Statute could wipe out all our liberties to-morrow- </para>

              <para>- I do not say that such a thing is probable, but nevertheless the Imperial Parliament technically possesses that power. Our Australian Constitution could never have been called into being had it not been indorsed by an Act of the Imperial Parliament. I make these references only for the purpose of showing the marvellous self-control of that great Parliament. We have set up harriers against the trade of the country which gave us our political freedom. But does the House of Commons present a petition to the King, asking him to communicate with the Commonwealth Government, to complain of the exercise of our legislative freedom, even against the mother country herself? We have passed Acts which make our fellow countrymen in England, Scotland, and Ireland liable to imprisonment if they come to Australia under conditions of honest contract. Does the House of Commons rise in indignation, and present a petition to the King, complaining of that use of our undoubted powers of legislation? Throughout all the vagaries of colonial legislation, that mighty author of all our powers and liberties Stands by and respects our independence - respects our right to work out our own political destiny in our own way. The Empire is full of burning questions to-day. They are to be found in the mother country, in Canada, in India, and in South Africa. Each country is  wisely  left to deal with its own political destiny, its own political factions, and its own political agitations. Local agitations are never allowed to spread all over the surface of the Empire. There are occasions when it is well and fitting that these Parliaments should adopt .an Imperial attitude. There are times of grief and of rejoicing in the history of the Empire when the Parliaments of the self-governing dependencies can show their sympathy with the mother country, and reveal to all nations the close connexion which exists between one part of the Empire and another. But we must draw a sharp distinction between such occasions, which reveal sentiments of sympathy and loyalty which all men share, and which lead to a unanimous demonstration of good will, and occasions which reveal vital differences of opinion, setting one loyal subject against another. Nothing in our parliamentary history seems more ridiculous to me than this attempt to debate in the Parliament of the Commonwealth the parliamentary conditions of the mother country. Nothing, seems to me to be more sublimely ridiculous and impertinent. If the House of Commons were to discuss our Constitution - if it were to discuss some alteration in our parliamentary system - we can imagine how our honorable friends would rise as one man in patriotic resentment at such an interference with our right to manage our own Parliament, our own policy, and our own political destinies, in our own way. But what that mighty mother of all our Parliaments does not and dare not do, some of us are prepared to do in a spirit of cool complacency. We presume to cross the seas and to enter into a political controversy in the mother country on the very eve of a general election, at which this question of Home Rule for Ireland will be one of the principal issues. We make our appearance in the presence of King Edward, and constitute ourselves his advisers in regard to the shape that a British political agitation should take. We propose to try our hand at reforming the parliamentary relations which now unite the three kingdoms. The proposal to do so is, I think, foolish and absolutely wrong,. We hear again and again the question : &#34; What harm can there be ? We are asking only for an extension to Ireland of that system of self-government which we en- joy.&#34; I think that is the strongest way in which the position could be put. Great Britain has been generous and wise enough to extend parliamentary independence to Canada, South Africa, and Australia, and some wish to say to the mother country - &#34; Since you have done this for us, we ask you to do the same for Ireland.&#34; That sort of statement, which is a very common one, is based upon a most superficial view. On what state of affairs did the agitation for colonial parliamentary independence arise? Gentlemen were sent across the seas to this distant dependency of the Crown to assume despotic power in the management of this country, and the agitation for parliamentary independence was an agitation against a state of irresponsible despotism. The person who was put into Government House owed no responsibility to the Australian people; he was responsible only to the Imperial Government. It was a natural and manly desire, springing from the genius of the British race, that led us to demand a change - to desire to exchange for the despotism of the person sent out from the mother country some system of parliamentary government. We had no Parliament when we fought, and so we fought for and won the parliamentary institutions that we now possess. The moment the mother country granted parliamentary institutions to Canada, Australia, and other parts of the Empire, she granted with it an implied power to demand even:tually separation. The corollary of the grant of the right to manage our own affairs in our own Parliament is the right to separate from the mother country, when the people of this country desire to do so. That is one difference between the two cases. If those who granted self-government to Canada or Australia did not realize that the grant of that right carried with it the right to separate - the right to absolute independence if desired, they failed to know what every statesman! should have known. Let us suppose that the people of Australia decided the connexion between Australia and the mother country should cease, and that decision was indorsed by the two Houses of Parliament, which carried resolutions after a general election on the point in favour of the severance of the tie which binds us to the mother country. How could Great Britain, which gave us the right to manage our own affairs as a free people, with a free Parliament, draw her sword to destroy the aspirations of that free people expressed by that free Parliament? What English statesman would contemplate such a situation? </para>

But I wish to return to two points in respect of which there is a vital difference between Ireland and Australia. I should have mentioned first of all that there is no analogy between the condition of Ireland and that of our own self-governing Colonies in reference to the demand for parliamentary institutions. We asked for parliamentary institutions because we had none, and because there was no Parliament of any kind in which we were represented. Australia, as I have said, instead of having a Parliament, had a despot, and had to. choose between the two. Is it a matter for surprise that we should have longed for a Parliament? But Ireland is not in that position. She is not an outcast. </para>

              <para>- Ireland may not value her position in the Imperial Parliament ; but the fact remains that on the only basis that the  democracy  of the Empire acknowledges - the basis of manhood and womanhood, the basis of population - she has a larger share of representation to-day in the British Parliament than have the people of England or of Scotland. The difference between the position of Australia and that of Ireland is that when we sought selfgovernment we had no Parliament and no pretence to a share of representation in any Parliament. </para>

              <para>- I am not saying that it was. I am simply pointing out that on the basis of union - of the three kingdoms being one - this is an important fact. On any other basis my argument would altogether fail. If the position taken up is that Ireland should be an independent community, that she has for centuries prayed for independence, that her aspiration is to be free, and that there should be an Irish&#39; nation as well as an Irish Parliament, a different line of argument will have to be followed. I am assuming, however, that the Irish people do not wish for independence. I am  asuming  that they are content to remain within the United Kingdom, and that they do not wish to break off their connexion with the British Parliament. On that basis I say that the British Parliament is one in which&#39; Ireland holds a fair share of representation. It would be just as wise to ask that Scotland should dominate the British Parliament while she remains one of the three kingdoms, as it would be to ask that Ireland should do so. I wish, however, to point out that Ireland has representation in the grandest of all Parliaments. We may talk of the Canadian Parliament, or of that of Australia; but what are they when compared with the grand Imperial Parliament, which has the destinies of a fifth of the human race within its grasp? Ireland has a share, and a fair share, of representation, in the greatest Parliament the world has ever seen. The agitation &#39;now is for a modification of that relationship, and I am willing to take as perfectly loyal and sincere the profession that this desire for an Irish Parliament is not the prelude to a demand for total separation from the mother country. There are grave reasons in the history of Irish political agitation for a belief that, the profession that Home Rule for Ireland is sought only because of a desire for the extension of the parliamentary life of the Empire, and not in order to assert independence and bring about separation, is not  as genuine as it might be. There was - a time when any people with the slightest spark of manhood would have rebelled against the English power and the English connexion. There was a time when I should not have stood here for a moment to gainsay the right of the Irish people to any remedy of the wrongs under which they suffered. There is no doubt that the desire to make Ireland a real partner in this great Parliament - the desire to give the Irish people an honest share in the rights and liberties of Englishmen and Scotchmen - has been very tardy. It was in a very tardy and grudging way that the English people of seventy, eighty, or a hundred years ago gave Ireland any sort of share in the rights of free men. If the people of Ireland at such a time had risen in rebellion and cast off the British yoke, no man who respects human rights would have said that they were not entitled to do so. I am happy to say, however, that a different relationship has grown up between the Irish people and the rest of the people of the United Kingdom. Reparation has been tardy, but it has been magnificent. No one can forget the grand part that Gladstone, played in redeeming the character of the British people in their dealings with Ireland - no one can forget that mighty effort which disestablished the dominant .church, then representing only a fraction of the people. No one can forget that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Gladstone</inline></para>

              <para>- He was, and his motives in declaring for Home Rule were of the noblest character. There is no doubt that Gladstone&#39;s inspiration was a noble one. He believed that, by extending selfgoverning institutions to Ireland, he would crown the real, true, and lasting union between the Irish people and the people of Great Britain. But I am addressing a House of Parliament in this distant part of the King&#39;s dominions, in which it is proposed to express an opinion in favour of a radical change in the parliamentary institutions of a self-governing community. </para>

              <para>- The name of Gladstone is one that I revere ; but it should remind us that one of the best inspirations of his policy was the maintenance of Ohe right of people to manage their own affairs. Shall we be managing our own affairs if we at this time interfere in a parliamentary struggle which will presently be submitted to the arbitrament of a General Election in the United Kingdom? There may be members who were sent into this House to express the voice of their constituents on the question of Home Rule for Ireland, but I am not one of them. During the past twenty-five years I have never been asked by my electors one single question on this subject. If I am to vote on it, as the representative of East Sydney, surely  I must first know what the electors of East Sydney think in regard to it? My private opinion is quite another matter. Tha seventy-five members of this House can, every one of them, go on to the platforms of Australia, and express their opinions on the subject of Home Rule in the freest way possible. They can address public meetings on the subject; but, in doing so, they will be expressing only their own views and opinions. They have, so far as I know, no right to represent the views of their constituents. The expression of our individual views outside this Chamber is one thing, and the expression of our views as the representatives of the Australian people is another. Our action here should be based only on opinions submitted to our constituents, and after their opinions have been ascertained - not by a secret method, or by guessing or jumping at conclusions - but as the result of open discussion. My honorable friends must admit that if this question be put before the country as a live political issue for the next elections, it would turn Australian politics upside down. Speaking of the constituencies generally, no one can say what their verdict would be in regard to it. We have no right to arrogate to ourselves the power to speak on behalf of the Australian people when they have not authorized us to do so, and when we have not asked for authority to do so. As I have said, we can declare our own opinions on this subject outside, but we have no right to use the name of Parliament in expressing them as if they were the opinions of the people. This issue has never been before the people. I decline to countenance any such action. This discussion will, unhappily, tend to bring the question into the arena of Australian politics. Will not the fact that honorable members voted on this subject here be remembered by their constituents when they review their actions? But do we wish to complicate the burning questions  which will have to be settled at the next election in Australia with the question concerning the right sort of Parliament to have in the mother country - whether there shall be one Parliament for England, Scotland, and Ireland, or one for England and Scotland, and another for Ireland ? The issue may come to this : A candidate may say to the Socialists in his constituency - and I have no doubt that in many cases it would be a determining appeal - &#34;I am not a Socialist, Michael ; but I am a Home Ruler&#34;; or &#34;I am a Socialist, Andrew; but I am not a Home Ruler.&#34; I regard the question of Home Rule for Ireland as one which must be left for determination to the good sense and intelligence of the 41,000,000 of the British people. It has nothing to do with the politics of Australia. </para>

              <para>- The interjection of the honorable member for the Barrier reminded me of the occurrence, and enables me to add that those who wish to preserve the politics of Australia from side issues should avoid intruding this question of Home Rule. I wish again to emphasize the fact that every member whom I am addressing has a perfect right to talk about Home Rule outside the House. As a British subject, he can hold meetings to advocate it, he can write articles in support of it, and he can seek to influence the people upon in every conceivable way. But in this House </para>

          <para class="block">Ave  are not authorized by our electors to express their opinions on the subject. We are free to govern Australia; we are free to take up all sorts of matters,, as they arise, in the exigencies of Australian legislation, whether they have been before the electors or not. But I draw a sharp line between the use of our consciences, our judgments, and our advocacy in Australia of Australian reforms, and the arrogation of a right to speak for the 4,000,000 of Australian people on a subject which has nothing to do with Australian politics. Surely if we think we are competent to work out our own destinies, we might give the people of the mother country equal credit for ability to workout their political destinies. Do we think that we can shed a luminous ray of statesmanship upon this troublesome problem by merely expressing our opinion ? For that is all the motion amounts to. It asks that we shall express our individual opinion that Home Rule for Ireland is an advisable thing for the Imperial Parliament to agree to. The vital point on which this question turns is one which the English, Irish, and Scotch people must settle for themselves. It is this : Will the extension of a special Parliament to the Irish people, whilst no special Parliament is extended to the English or Scotch people, strengthen or weaken the tie which unites Ireland with the United Kingdom? As we settle that question, we settle the question of an Irish Parliament. Those who  honestly  believe that this change will strengthen the tie between Great Britain and Ireland are entitled to advocate it in every way they can, but I say to them, &#34;Advocate it in your own names. Express your own views. Do not put forward the expression of your views as if your constituents had empowered you to express their views, and to express them in the  way  in which you have expressed your own views.&#34; That isthe strong distinction which I draw. The question whether the granting of a Parliament to Ireland will weaken or strengthenthe relations between Ireland and Great Britain is the vital point. There is nopossibility of a separation between England&#39; and Ireland so long as the British Empirelasts ; it is inconceivable.  Just  think onwhat a diminutive base that vast and marvellous superstructure of Empire, whichovershadows the whole earth to-day, rests.. Fracture the base upon which our mighty Empire stands, and you seal the doom.  of that Empire. I leave it to the wisdom of the people in the mother country to decide this burning question. It is within the province of their politics, while it is not within the province of our politics. I leave it to them to settle this great problem, which affects the happiness and welfare of the Irish and British people. No man has a more earnest desire than I have that such a settlement may be arrived at as will strengthen and increase the prosperity of Ireland, while preserving the stability of the Empire. I do not think I should act fairly if I did not put the position which I take up plainly before the House, and, in order that honorable members may take a course which will probably be more satisfactory than negativing the motion, or agreeing to the previous question, I have a proposal to make. I thought at one time of moving the previous question; but I felt that such a course might be thought to be unsympathetic with respect to the legitimate aspirations of the Irish people. I have no desire to take up any unkind attitude with respect to that once oppressed and once wronged people. I have no desire to add in the least degree to the misfortunes of that country. But I put the Ireland of to-day before the world as a country which has been treated more generously than any other during the last twenty years. So ardent has been the desire even of the resolute opponents of Home Rule, the Conservative Party of England, to do some long delayed measure of justice to Ireland that the principles of British legislation have  been  strained to breaking point in favour, not of the dominant power of the landlords and tenants of the great rural districts of England and Scotland, but of the people of Ireland.&#163;100,000,000 of British money have been pledged to place the Irish landlords and tenants in a position that British landlords and tenants have never occupied and never will occupy. That is, I say, a magnificent proof of the generosity of the dominant power, which might have employed the most barbarous methods of past ages for the purpose of oppression and wrong. But in the brighter stage upon which the relations of England and Ireland have entered, we see the unbending Tories forgetting all their principles and prejudices with regard to the ownership of land in their endeavours to place the Irish tenants upon a better footing than they ever occupied before. </para>

              <para>- That is one view of the matter; but does the honorable member forget the improvements effected in the condition of the Irish tenants. I think that there is some reference in the resolution before us to the enormous benefits conferred on the Irish peasantry, who were at one time in a condition of the utmost misery. We know that now the tenant can stand up against his landlord in the face of the law, and obtain some justice - and generous justice too. In conclusion, I desire to say that no man wishes Ireland a more generous measure of prosperity and contentment than I do, but I leave this question of parliamentary policy and parliamentary change, to the august tribunal of the people of the United Kingdom, and, so far as I am concerned, I shall stand against the intrusion into this Parliament of burning questions which have created so much bad blood and bad feeling in other parts of the Empire. I move as an amendment - </para>

            <para>- To my mind, there are three possible issues; one is to declare in favour of the petition as it stands, another is to negative the proposal to petition altogether, and the third possible issue is such a one as that presented by the amendment,&#39; which comes between the two extremes. That is the position so far as I gather it from having heard the amendment read, and if my impression be correct the amendment is perfectly in order. If, after I have had time to further consider the amendment, I find that it is merely an expanded negative, it will be my duty to rule it out of order. At present I think it is more in the nature of the &#34; previous question,&#34; and therefore in order. </para>

            <para>- I speak upon this question under a great disability, since I am called upon to follow the right honorable and learned member for East Sydney, who has just treated the House to a most eloquent speech. I stand at the further disadvantage of having received from a number of my constituents a request that I should support the motion. I recognise the fact that if I do not comply with their desire I shall excite a considerable amount of animosity in my electorate, which may have a disastrous personal effect in the future. However, I have never hesitated to do what I believe to be right; and, when I remember that some time ago I opposed the motion in favour of petitioning the English Parliament against the introduction of Chinese labour into the Transvaal, on the ground that we had no right to interfere in such matters, I do not see how I can support the present proposal. On the occasion referred to I expressed the opinion that the English Government would treat the petition with con tempt, and my prediction proved to be a true one. In dealing with this matter we must remember that the decision of the Irish people to cast in their lot with Great Britain was arrived at in their own Parliament, and, although it has been asserted that certain members of that Legislature were bought over by Lord Castlereagh, the fact remains that the representatives of the Irish people, of their own free will, deliberately entered into the union. Under, these circumstances, it seems to me that we have no right whatever to interfere. We must also remember that Scotland, which at that time was in exactly the same position as Ireland, has never asked for a Parliament of her own. </para>

              <para>- We. know that there are always discontented people in every community, and it is possible that a few Scotchmen may have desired to see a Scotch Parliament established, but there never has been an expression by the Scotch people of a unanimous desire to have a Parliament of their own. It is quite possible that Great Britain may in time grant powers of administration to the Irish people similar to those which are now exercised by the London County Council - a system of, local government which has latterly come much into vogue in Great Britain - but it is not for us to say that the time is ripe for any such change. What does this proposal mean? Does any honorable member suppose that the Irish people will be content to have a local Parliament which will have no voice in matters relating to the army and navy? Is it not recognised that this is merely the thin end of the wedge - that the more the Irish people get, the more they will want? What have the people of Ireland been doing during the last twenty years? They have been agitating for Home Rule, not by legitimate means, but by means of incendiary methods. It cannot be said that the Irish people have been unjustly treated so far as their representation in the British Parliament is concerned. Some time ago, when a redistribution of seats in the British Parliament was proposed, it was established beyond doubt that, in proportion fo population, Ireland possessed more representatives than England, and considerably more than Scotland. If the motion be carried, we shall deliberately invite the Imperial authorities to administer a snub, and we shall deserve it. </para>

          <para class="block">Honorable members must remember that I warned them as to what would be the result of forwarding a petition to the Imperial Government on the subject of the introduction of Chinese into&#39; the Transvaal. It is true that only five honorable members joined with me in voting against that proposal. How was the petition received ? Were we not, in effect, told to mind our own business ? If we adopt this motion I am satisfied that similar treatment will be meted out to us. Are we perpetually to invite &#34; snubs,&#34; and to remain silent under them ? I do hope that honorable members will exhibit a little common sense upon the present occasion. God knows we have enough to do to mind our affairs, without attempting to interfere in matters which do not concern us. I am perfectly aware that the views which I am expressing will prejudicially affect my position at election time ; but I am indifferent to any such consideration. I maintain that during the past fifteen or twenty years the people of Ireland have received the very greatest consideration at the hands of the British Parliament, and even if I stand alone, I shall be found opposing any motion which contemplates interference by this branch of the Legislature in a matter in which we are not concerned&#39;. </para>

            <para>- When the motion in reference to the introduction of Chinese labour into South Africa was submitted in this House, I was one of those who protested against it. I take up a precisely similar attitude upon the present occasion. The question of the wrongs of Ireland is one upon which honorable members may hold their individual opinions, but as a deliberative body this House has no right to discuss it. A motion of this character must inevitably engender class bitterness. I hold certain views upon the question of Home Rule for Ireland, but t contend that it is not a matter upon which we should be compelled to vote, inasmuch as it in no way affects the Commonwealth. </para>

              <para>- It is a request - with a bludgeon at their heads. If we agree to this motion, we might just as well adopt a resolution affirming that the crofters in the Hebrides off the coast of Scotland should be granted a system of Home Rule. </para>

              <para>- It is true that they have not asked for it, but why should we not take up the question on their behalf? The same remark is applicable to the inhabitants of Wales. From time to time the Welsh people have laboured under many grievances. Surely they have the same right to be cut off from the British Parliament as have the people of Ireland. I protest against any action being taken upon the lines indicated by this motion. We know that for many years the subject of Home Rule for Ireland has been a burning one in British politics. </para>

              <para>- Certainly not. In the north-western corner of Ireland there is the section which is known as the Ulster Irish, and in the southern and south-eastern portions of that country the other section is to be found&#39;. Both sections have rendered yeoman service to the Empire in all parts of the world, and both are entitled to every consideration at the hands of the Imperial Parliament. But I would point out that during recent years the Irish people have been extremely well represented in the House of Commons. As a matter of fact, they are far better represented there than are the people of Wales and Scotland. It  is not our province to take cognizance of wrongs which were committed many years ago. We have only to consider the character of recent legislation by the Imperial Parliament to see that determined efforts are being -made to relieve the ills from which Ireland has suffered. The primary object of the Land Purchase Act which is in operation at the present time is to settle the Irish pea- santry upon the soil. That Act is of a most liberal character. The leaders of the Irish party in the House of Commons are perfectly satisfied that Great Britain has dealt with Ireland in a very generous manner indeed. </para>

              <para>- They wish to revert to the parliamentary days of Grattan - and I am proud to know that I! bear the name of that illustrious man. If Home Rule is to be granted to Ireland, why should it not be granted to Scotland? Why should we not make representations in favour of the people of Scotland being granted a Parliament of their own ? I hold that we have no right to deal with this question, and I regret that it has been brought forward. I have always felt that it is undesirable that the class bitterness which exists in the old land should be stirred up in Australia. It should be our wish to keep ourselves arid our politics free from such matters. We should confine our attention to questions affecting the people of the Commonwealth. Home Rule for Ireland is not a matter that directly affects one individual in Australia, nor can it be said that it affects us externally. It is one that does not come within our sphere ofl external influence, and I therefore protest against such, a motion being submitted to the HouseIf the amendment be in order, I shall certainly support it, and if not, I shall do my best to so amend the motion that honorable members may show by their votes that they feel, not only that this House has no right whatever to deal with the question, but that it is highly undesirable that the Parliament of Australia should be brought into contact with the class bitterness; of the old land. </para>

            <para>- -The question that has been put before the House by the honorable member for Southern Melbourne, and subsequently by the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, is a very prickly one, and, like most prickly things - especially nettles - needs to be firmly grasped. I do not propose to hedge on the advisableness of the Commonwealth Parliament considering the question of Home Rule being granted to a country to which our legislative deliberations do mot extend. The right honorable member for East Sydney, in moving the amendment now before the Chair, very el earl v placed three, facts before the House&#39;. He urged, first of all, that we had absolutely no mandate from the people of Australia to consider this question ; and, secondly, that even if we had, we have no right to interfere. Finally, he contended, with great force, from the point of view of any one who loves the Empire, that it is neither expedient nor wise for the House to meddle in matters over which  it  has &#39;no control. I think that the right honorable member proved each of these contentions up to the hilt. I must say  that I regret that the advocates of this proposal have not seen fit to attempt to  rebut  any of his arguments. </para>

              <para>- There are some honorable members who dare not speak to the question, and their only desire is that we should&#39; proceed to a division. Those who were at one time so anxious to speak in support of the motion are now not at all eager to do so, the reason being that the arguments adduced in opposition to it are obviously irrefutable. The question of whether we have a mandate from the people of Australia to deal with this matter is covered by the amendment. I have no hesitation in saying that if any honorable member, were to &#39;go before his constituents and tell them frankly that he considered they had instructed him to vote for the motion, they would not be so keen to again intrust him with their confidence. Honorable members may ,go on the public platform and try to educate their constituents up or down to their appreciation of this proposal, but they have no right to attempt to use the House as an educational medium for the people of Australia in respect of questions that do not concern the well-being of the Commonwealth. </para>

              <para>- Are we yet to learn that Ireland has no representation in the House of Commons? Are we to understand that the States of Australia, because they have not each exclusive control of the Commonwealth, are not represented in the Federal Parliament? Are Victoria and New South Wales not autonomous States? Are not their peoples self-representer&#34;! in the Commonwealth of Australia? And vet the honorable member tells us that Ireland has no Parliamentary representation. He forgets that Ireland is as near to the place of meeting of the Imperial Parliament as is Sydney to the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth. </para>

          <para class="block">Rule? We have not yet been told what Home Rule is. A friend of mine, when asked &#34;Are you in favour of Home Rule?&#34; replied, &#34;It largely depends upon what Home Rule is.&#34; Until we know what Home Rule is, how can we be expected to express an opinion upon the question of whether it shall be given to a part of the Empire over which we have no control? The question is not whether Home Rule shall be granted, but whether we ought to obtrude our interference at a critical time, and attempt to unduly influence the electors of another part of the Empire with respect to a matter that concerns them, and them alone. Those who have dealt at length with the maltreatment - and I use the word &#34;maltreatment&#34; advisedly - which the people of Ireland suffered in centuries gone by at the hands of the mother country, may well be asked whether they can find in the long range of history the case of any country which, in the centuries long passed, did not maltreat its dependencies, or its people. Let us look, for example, at France, and endeavour to ascertain whether there is any demand on the part of the descendants of the Huguenots for separation from the central authority. We find among those people nothing but the most loyal devotion to the great country of which they form a part. In the great heart of the Irish people, when it is untroubled by political agitation, we also find expressions of the most loyal devotion to the inspiration andi ideal of Empire, and satisfaction with Ireland&#39;s part in the Empire. Do honorable members opposite deny that that is so? Their silence shows that they know that my statement is correct. If the matter be not sufficiently clear to honorable members, they have only to look at the motion which has been put before the House. It begins - </para>

              <para>- Yes. As has been pointed out, although we are asked to express our opinion on this subject as &#34;the members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled,&#34; we have no mandate to deal with it from the people whom we represent. Why, then, should an obvious misstatement be made in this proposed humble address to  His  Majesty the King? Surely, if we owe anything to the constitutional head of this great Empire, it is to fearlessly tell the truth - if, indeed, we do. not owe that duty to our self-respect and the sense of conscience which even politicians may be expected to possess. But the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne does not ask for absolute local autonomy for Ireland, although he speaks of us as &#34;enjoying and appreciating the blessings of Home Rule,&#34; and therefore asking for similar advantages for that country. All he asks for is &#34; that a just measure of Home Rule may be granted to the people of Ireland.&#34; What is &#34;a just measure of Home Rule &#34; ? Again, we are told that the people of Ireland have asked for Home Rule through their representatives. Where are those representatives asking for it ? Are they asking for it in Australia, where, we can Hear them, or in the Houses of Parliament at Westminster, in the heart, of the Empire, where the people of the United Kingdom can hear them? Are we in as good a position  to know how &#34;clearly,&#34; &#34;insistently,&#34; and &#34;continuously&#34; they are asking for Home Rule as are the members of the Imperial  Parlia  ment, to whom, and among whom, they are making this request? Surely the Parliament of the United Kingdom is better able to deal with and decide this question than is the Parliament of Australia. I sincerely believe in the absolute loyalty and devotion of the Irish people, and am proud of the fact that I am descended from Irish stock. Therefore, I ask, why should it be inferred that, if the request of the people of Ireland for Home Rule is not granted, they will do something which may imperil the &#34;peace and integrity of the Empire&#34; to which I believe they, as well as we, are proud to belong? The motion contains a series of contradictions, which should justify any deliberative assembly in rejecting it. </para>

              <para>- I have such a painful sense of the value of public time, and of the manner in which honorable members opposite waste it by making ill-timed interjections, that I decline to be drawn off the track of my observations to discuss trivialities with the honorable member. Although my present position in this Chamber is not precisely the same that it was a few months ago, I still retain the views I expressed when I occupied the position of  leader of the Government. Although it may seem to militate against the interests of the Opposition, I am prepared to give the present Government the same earnest support that I would have accorded to the members of mv own party, if they grapple with the difficulty arising from the delivery  of unduly long addresses in this Chamber. It will be impossible for us to acquire a reputation for &#39;business aptitude, and for the despatch of public business in a proper way, unless the expression of the individual views of honorable members on various questions which come up for discussion are regulated by some standard, and limited in some manner. I am glad to say that my late honorable colleague, the honorable and learned member for Corinella, who practically represented the late Government on the Standing Orders Committee, has bestowed considerable attention upon this question. I do not know whether lie has brought the result of his labours before the Standing Orders Committee. </para>

              <para>- I understand that my honorable friend&#39;s object was to arrive at some method of limiting the length of speeches in this Chamber. Viewing this question entirely apart from its party aspect, I would strongly urge the Government, without waiting for the full consideration of the Standing Orders, to grapple wilh the difficulty. I admit that one of the obstacles in the way of dealing with the Standing Orders in the course of a busy session arises from the fact that they present innumerable topics for discussion, and must therefore occupy a large amount of valuable time. At the same time, I consider that the House will continue to occupy an altogether wrong position until a wellthoughtout and complete code of Standing Orders is adopted. It is a reflection upon this Parliament that, although over four years have elapsed since the establishment of the parliamentary government of the Commonwealth, we are still at the mercy of temporary Standing Orders, which, were intended merely to fill up a gap until we could get into working order and adopt a complete set of Standing Orders v adapted to our requirements. I was exposed to considerable ridicule because I laid great stress upon this subject, hut I have no hesitation in saying as leader of the Opposition what I stated as the head of the late Government, namely, that the business of the Commonwealth Parliament will never be properly considered or despatched until we have a proper set of Standing Orders. It is easy to employ ridicule in attacking those who are taking up a sensible attitude, and I think that ridicule was never more misapplied than in connexion with my endeavour to place in the forefront of the Ministerial programme the question of new Standing Orders. I do not think that any honorable member on this side of the House has occupied the attention of honorable members for more than three hours at anyone time this session. I most nearly approached that limit in my speech on the Bonus for Manufactures Bill, which occupied two hours and three-quarters. With that exception, I do not think that any member of the Opposition has occupied more than one hour and a half at any one time. </para>

              <para>- During the last month I have done what I never did before. I have actually read through the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports, and I wish to say that I never read a collection of abler speeches in connexion with&#39; ordinary topics of legislation than those delivered by honorable members on this side of the House. Their deliverances were pregnant with the most cogent arguments in- favour of the views they were advocating, and there was an entire absence of ill-feeling. In fact, I think my honorable friends had a tendency -to minimize the evils of the present Administration, and the incapacity shown by the Minister of Trade and Customs to understand the measures which he had introduced. I think that my honorable friends carried political generosity to an extreme in the mildness of their criticisms of the Government in connexion with the provisions of the Commerce Bill. I do not wish to rebuke my honorable friends for their forbearance, because I think that is an admirable duality. No Opposition ever performed its duty of intelligent and mode- rate criticism more efficiently and more reasonably than did my honorable friends. When the late Government were in office under the mistaken idea that they were occupying their position subject to a written understanding with some honorable members - that turned out to be a chimerical notion - they were exposed to speeches from honorable members then sitting on this side of the Chamber, two of which occupied four hours each, or a total of eight hours - the period which the present Prime Minister very properly allots to the parliamentary day&#39;s work. The honorable member for Darling, who, I am sure, has endeared himself to all honorable members, especially by the kindness of his references to &#34;our travelling arrangements, (and the honorable member for Gwydir, who is not so capable of the friendly emotions of human nature, but who has many excellent qualities, delivered speeches on matters of no importance which together occupied nearly nine hours. I do not suppose that during the whole of his public career the &#34;VicePresident of the Executive Council, who supports the dignity of his onerous office with becoming modesty and with a due sense of shame, and who is one of the most brainy among the silent members of Parliament, has consumed so much time as was occupied by the two honorable members referred to in discussing side issues. In fact, their exertions have produced such an unhappy effect upon them that they have since been mentally paralyzed. Who would now expose the honorable member for Darling or the honorable member for Gwydir to the cruelty of a five hours&#39; speech ? Irrespective of all these party considerations, and of the question of what sort of men are in office, I say that no Government will ever be able to render a proper account of their trust as leaders in the performance of parliamentary and legislative duty until they adopt some means or other to curtail the abuse of the privilege of speech. I am glad to say that no such abuse has occurred during the reign of the present Administration. That fact is entirely owing to the character for political sagacity and moderation borne by honorable members on this side of the House. They have carried the high traditions of the late Administration even into the cold shades of Opposition, and the present Government have not been exposed to the strain of speeches of four or five hours in length.

I could understand the Committee laying upon the table a set of Standing Orders aimed at speeches of undue length, which have been the curse of all Australian Parliaments; but, as a matter of fact, the Committee have no new proposals to make beyond one of a remarkable character, which has excited the ridicule and contempt of the whole of the Australian people. Where is the inconvenience in forming a quorum if there are twenty-five honorable members within the precincts of the House ? It simply imposes on those honorable members who do not happen to be present at the particular moment when the bells are rung, the trouble of walking from one or other of the ante-rooms into the Chamber. If honorable members are in their party rooms, they have merely to walk a few yards in order to make their appearance here. If they are in the billiard-room, the refreshmentroom, the writing-room, or the library, the only inconvenience to which they are exposed is that of having to walk a few yards. The Constitution is very clear upon this subject. It declares that, in the absence of legislative provision to the contrary, the attendance of twenty-five&#34; out of seventy - five members shall be necessary for the transaction of public business. I should be the last individual in the world to be so unreasonable as to suggest that twenty-five honorable members ought to be in the Chamber every moment that the House is sitting. But in view of the express direction contained in the Constitution. I do say that, if any honorable member draws attention to the fact that the statutory number of members is not present, a quorum should be formed. Why should a novel standing order be proposed to meet the convenience of four or five honorable members who wish to absent themselves from the&#39; proceedings of this Chamber? lt strikes me as being one of the most ludicrous efforts at reform of which 1 have ever heard. Instead of drawing the bands tighter, it is actually proposed to make them looser. Under the operation of the suggested Standing Order, honorable members might remain for hours outside the Chamber, attending either to their own private business or to public affairs, whilst the House continued <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> transact the business of the country with only five or six honorable members present, so long as the  Speaker  or the  Chairman  of Committees was satisfied that there was a quorum within the precincts of the House. Thus, while five or six honorable members might be in the billiard-room, another five or six in the refreshment-room, a similar number in the library and the party-rooms, and five or six more in the vaults engaging in gymnastic exercises, under this precious Standing Order business could proceed so long as the  Speaker  was satisfied that a quorum was within the precincts of the building. Is that the sort of reform that we ought to expect from the Government? Surely one of the reasons why excellent work should now be done is to be found in the fact that the Government occupy an invidious position. Here . is a Ministry which, outside of itself, numbers only four or five supporters in its own party. Surely honorable gentlemen in that position might hope to make up for the ignominy of it by endeavouring to improve the methods of transacting public business. But the onlyemanation of their genius in reference to the conduct of parliamentary business is a suggestion to render the easy life of honorable members still more. easy, by making the transaction of public business in the absence of a quorum equivalent to its transaction in the presence of a quorum. I believe that we shall hear no more of that proposal. It has apparently- been buried. If the Government had been in earnest about it they would have submitted that Standing Order by itself, and have brought it into operation without delay. But they felt - and properly so--that they had made a false step, and that there was only one method of escape from it, namely, by burying this new-fangled idea in 400 or 500 other orders, so that we should, for some time to come, hear no more about it. I say again that if any honorable member upon this side &#39;of the House occupied four or five hours in delivering a speech - as some honorable members opposite did when I was in office - I would heartily applaud the Government if they submitted a Standing Order to put an end to such an abuse of privilege. No man has a right to occupy such a large share of the public time. I should not speak so long as I do, but for the fact that I am verv&#34; frequently absent from the House, and that I do not often occupy its time. I would, however, always attach a safeguard to the time limit. I would make that limit a thoroughly liberal one, and I would attach to it a provision that, without debate, the question might be put to the House or Committee - &#34; That the honorable member be further heard.&#34; If any honorable member were addressing himself to a subject of large importance and complexity, which called for a speech beyond the usual limits, I am sure that the sense of fairness of the House would immediately allow the Standing Order to be relaxed. We all know that in the warmest conflicts that have taken place in this House, the moment an appeal has been made to the fairness of honorable members, that appeal has never been in vain. With such a safeguard as I have indicated, a time limit might very well be imposed upon speeches. However, the urgency of this matter seems to have disappeared, since my honorable friends have gone over to the other side of the Chamber. Before I conclude my remarks, there is one matter to which I wish to refer, because since I last addressed myself to it, I have had an opportunity of considering the difficulty which was then presented to me by, the Prime Minister. I refer to the settlement of the trouble connected with the Federal Capital. I had never previously, considered the difficulty as to whether it was within our power to pass a measure which would give the High Court an opportunity of settling such questions as those involved, by means of some friendly arrangement. Of course, I do not pretend to express any very weighty opinion, because I recognise that there are members in this House who have studied constitutional, matters much more thoroughly than I have done. Nevertheless, I have taken an opportunity of referring to our Constitution upon this subject, and I should like to express the opinion at which I have arrived in reference to the powers which we, by legislation, can confer upon the High Court. I am sorry to see in the newspapers a statement by the Premier of New South Wales to the effect that he considers that a recent communication from the Prime Minister frustrates the hope of a peaceful settlement of these difficulties. </para>

I do not think that I could add any weight to the learned advice &#34;that he Has received, but having carefully considered the section in the Constitution which relates to the Seat of Government, I have come to the conclusion that no real difficulty should be experienced in the way of an appeal to the High Court. Of course there is the technical view that the ordinary working of the machinery of that tribunal is by means of litigation and contest; but I do not think that I am expressing a very strange opinion when I say that its higher function is to settle any matter connected with the Constitution which involves a difficulty of interpretation, or in respect of which there is a conflict of judgment, as between the Commonwealth and the States. What possible objection can there be when the two parties interested agree to invite a friendly decision by this judicial tribunal?

              <para>- I should not care if the State would accept that act as being sufficient to bring the matter before the High Court. I am not at all concerned with the mere formal method of bringing the question before the Court, for there should be no difficulty in regard to it. My difficulty in reference to the proposal to drive a stake is that, under the Constitution, the determination of the site of the Capital hinges upon a prior consideration - the acquisition by the Commonwealth either bv grant or purchase, of a territory. Until we have a territory we cannot have a sits for the Capital. </para>

          <para class="block">That marks the next step. We may determine the site of the Capital whenever we please. The moment we pass a Bill declaring that the Federal Capital shall be in a certain locality, we exercise our constitutional power. We have the right to take that step without any reference, except in a friendly way, to the State of New South Wales ; but dependent upon the taking of that step is another stage which certainly concerns the people of New South Wales, and in respect of which they have a right - unless the .Commonwealth Government takes action under the Property Acquisition Act - to be consulted. That Act confers on the Commonwealth Government the right to acquire land for any public purpose, and it is wide enough, I think, to allow of the exercise of the powers necessary to the Commonwealth when determining upon a Capital site. But until this Parliament had determined on a particular site, it would be idle for the Commonwealth Government to look for a territory. The Parliament must first decide where the Capital is to be. The next step is one regarding which there should be consultation between the Commonwealth and the Government of New South Wales, for the Capital can be only in territory that has been granted or acquired. That being so, the Commonwealth Government cannot drive a stake into any part of New South Wales that does not form portion of the territory granted to or acquired by it. </para>

              <para>- I admit that anything can&#62; be made a pretext for a friendly settlement ; but I should like to warn the Federal Government against taking a step with respect to which they must be defeated, unless a mutual arrangement has been arrived at. I would warn the Government against taking such a step in the absence of any such agreement, because, so far as I can see, until territory in New South Wales shall have been granted to, or acquired by, the Commonwealth, the Federal Government will have no power to drive a stake into a single inch of New South Wales territory. There is no doubt that the Commonwealth Parliament has a right to pass a Bill determining where the Capital shall &#34;be. But the Constitution then steps in, and says, in effect: &#34;After the Commonwealth Parliament has decided where the Capital is to be, it cannot exercise rights of ownership or occupation in New South Wales for the purposes of the Capital, except it acquires, or has had granted to it, the territory which it desires.&#34; </para>

              <para>- Whilst we can do a great many things, no Act passed bv this Legislature can . alter the rights of New South Wales under the Constitution. In spite of  any Act we may pass, New South Wales has the constitutional right to say to the Commonwealth - &#34; You may select your site ; that is a matter to be determined by yourselves. We have no objection to your doing so, but it is, after all, only a preliminary step. Once you have selected your site, that selection must remain in abeyance, so far as New South Wales is concerned, until you have gone further, under section 125 of the Constitution, and have had granted to you or have acquired, under the Property Acquisition Act, a legal basis of occupancy.&#34; The only way in which the Commonwealth can occupy an inch of New South Wales is by exercising some right which it possesses under the Constitution. The Constitution declares that the Seat of Government shall be determined by the Commonwealth Parliament, and it then goes on to deal with a matter regarding which the Federal Government is not supreme, unless it exercises certain powers under the Property Acquisition Act. The grant can come only from the Government of New South Wales. The word &#34; grant &#34; implies the giving of land by the owner, which&#39;, in this case, is New South Wales. The Commonwealth can acquire the land only by mutual arrangement or by the exercise of statutory powers. There appears to be no chance of a mutual arrangement being .arrived at, because, I understand, the Parliament of New South Wales objects to the selection of Dalgety. The next point is that, since a mutual arrangement is impossible, New South Wales must either grant, or we must acquire, under our own statute, the territory within which we propose to establish the Federal Capital. So far as this point is concerned, I think that New South Wales would be successful before the High Court. Let us suppose that, having selected Dalgety, under our undoubted constitutional powers, we proceed to drive a stake in a piece of land in the neighbourhood1. That might be done by the consent of New South Wales. But, assuming that there was no such&#39; assent - assuming that the selection was opposed by the Parliament of New South Wales - then, in the absence of the <inline font-style="italic">acquisition</inline> of property under the Act to which I have already referred, or of a grant by the Parliament of New South Wales, the driving of a stake by our representative would clearly be an unauthorized act. In dealing with this question, which has excited so much feel ing, I should be very sorry to see the Commonwealth take any sort of step, except by consent, in the direction of the assertion of a right to interfere with the territory of New South Wales, because it would be a step which the High Court would have to repudiate. That would be a false step which no one would desire to see the Government take. </para>

The sooner we close up and heal these sores, wherever they occur, the better for the Commonwealth and the States.

              <para>- I wish to bring under the attention of the Government the question of the valuation of harvesters. My desire is to avoid the introduction of any sort of party feeling, and to deal with this case from the highest possible stand-point. I am sure that it is to the interest of any Government to inspire in the minds of the community a fe|eling that, whatever its fiscal views may be, it is anxious honestly to administer the Tariff and to act just as fairly to importers as to any one else. It is to the interests of any Government to show that the Department of Trade and Customs, in its administration of Statute law, knows no bias - that the rights of every man, no matter how humble or inoffensive he may be, are fairly considered. I stronglyurge the Prime Minister 1o recall the facts of this case. If any one had told me that in Australia an interested party could walk into the Customs House, and cause to be altered the decision of the. Department, which had been established by a previous Minister, after inquiries had been conducted in Canada, South America, and South Australia, I should have hesitated to believe it. I thoroughly admire the enterprise of the McKays, in connexion with the Sunshine harvesters. I do not wish to associate myself with any unfriendliness to a firm which, I think, has shown a marvellous amount of invention and enterprise. I look upon a man who invents an improved method-- </para>

The point I am making is that the books of the Massey-Harris Company were closely investigated by one of the highest officers in the Customs Department of Canada, the investigation concerning not only the profits and quotations of the particular machines imported into Australia, but the basis of cost and profit applied to all the firm&#39;s manufactures, and the result was a certificate to the honesty of the firm&#39;s valuations. </para>

              <para>- The statement was madeafter the Customs Department of Canada had assisted the Common wealth Government in the investigation to which I have referred, Let me put the case without referring to the Sunshine harvester, or any particular article of manufacture. TheGovernment had a doubt in respect to the- valuations of an importer, and asked for information as to the value of the import from the Customs authorities of the country of manufacture. The books of the manufacturer were&#39; thoroughly investigated, and the report received was that the valuation was an honest one. But the Government did not stop at that. They were not satisfied with the information received from Canada, and they telegraphed, through the Governor-General, to Buenos Ayres, whence they obtained confirmatory opinions from the -British Consul. Then they investigated the books of Messrs. Clutterbuck, at Adelaide, to whom for many years the Massey-Harris people had been selling their machines. The honorable member for Gippsland exhausted every means of information available in Canada, South America, and South Australia, and was satisfied with the recommendation of his officers that the valuations of the importing firm were correct. A change of Government occurred, however, and on the representations of a rival manufacturer, who said that he had received a. letter from a man in Italy, the same officers without referring the matter to the firm whose actions were in question, accepted the statement of this interested person, and a new Minister brought into operation a section of the Customs Act which prevents them from going into open Court to prove their innocence. That is a monstrous state of things. Such action on the part of the Department does not inspire confidence. Of course, Ministers are responsible for the actions of their officers, but I am putting the blame on the officers of the Department to meet the interjection to which I am replying. After the thorough investigation to which I have referred, the officers of the Department reversed their original recommendation, because of the representation of an interested business rival to the firm affected. If a free-trader like the honorable member for North Sydney had been Minister of Trade and Customs, and, on representations made bv an importer behind the back of an Australian manufacturer, had reversed the decision of a protectionist predecessor, come to after thorough inquiry, bringing into operation a section of the Customs Act, preventing that manufacturer from vindicating himself, the country would have rung with justifiable indignation. </para>

              <para>- In administering the laws of the country we must not be biased by personal feeling. We desire that the highest standard of administration shall be set. If the protectionists wish to increase the duty on harvesters, there is an honorable and honest way to do so. This method of acting unjustly to an importer cannot commend itself to those who are anxious for the maintenance of the purity of our Departmental administration. The Minister of Trade and Customs has made a statement to this House on the subject which &#39;has placed a different complexion upon it, and we on this side said at the time, &#34;That is a very fair proposition.&#34; So long as the right thing is done, we do not wish to make too much of any little error that may have been committed in doing it. The Minister of Trade and Customs promised to give these people an opportunity to prove their <inline font-style="italic">bond fides,</inline> by showing that the Department was wrong, and that they were right. I have been led to fear that that opportunity is to be denied, though I do not credit the rumour. I accept the statement of the Minister made in the presence of honorable members. </para>

              <para>- We can deal with that matter by-and-by. I wish to deal with the subject on which I am speaking entirely by itself. I hope that the Minister will perform his promise to give this firm an opportunity to show their <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> by a proper legal investigation. If they have done wrong, we do not wish to shelter them.- We do not carry our fiscal preferences so far as to wish to shield importers who have defrauded the revenue. But if we have regard to our own reputation, we must pay a similar regard to the reputation of others. If this firm have been cheating the Customs, they have, considering the investigations which have been made, proved  themselves most elaborate swindlers, and I do not care how heavily they may be punished. But it is beneath the dignity of the Commonwealth to keep them in their present position longer than is absolutely necessary. I have never seen or had the remotest intercourse with any member of the firm. I do not know them, nor do I wish to know them. Information has been conveyed to me that the Massey-Harris Company invited the Government to send an officer to Adelaide to inspect the books of Messrs. Clutterbuck, who buy these machines from them. A Customs officer was despatched to Adelaide and was afforded an opportunity to go through the books of the firm there. 1 am given to understand that he found that the Massey-Harris Company, who import the harvesters in Melbourne at a Customs valuation of ^38 10s., absolutely sell them to Messrs. Clutterbuck in Adelaide at <inline font-style="italic">&#163;40</inline> each. Now, this firm might have had an opportunity of compromising this matter. I do not wish to break confidence too far, but I believe that if they had chosen to confess themselves guilty, by consenting to a compromise, they could have done so ; but thev very naturally - and I think very honorably - declined to arrive at any compromise. They refused to accept a proposal that the valuation for duty purposes should be reduced by <inline font-style="italic">&#163;10,</inline> that is to say, from <inline font-style="italic">&#163;65 10 &#163;55-</inline> That offer was made to them by the Customs authorities some few days ago. I do not suggest that the offer was conveyed officially or formally, but it was made to the Massey-Harris Company through their solicitor. In the course of an interview which that gentleman had with the Comptroller-General, it was put to him in this way, &#34;What about making the value .&#163;55 ? &#34; That would bring the valuation down by <inline font-style="italic">&#163;10.</inline> The solicitor, I think very fairly and honestly, absolutely refused to accept any compromise with regard to the valuation of the article. If the facts be as I have stated- and I have every reason to believe that I have been correctly informed - the Massey-Harris Company acted, in a perfectly honest manner, their desire being that the whole question should be tested. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay,</inline> in his evidence before the Tariff Commission, at question 16422, stated that the value of the harvesters delivered by the Massey-Harris  Company in Buenos Ayres was <inline font-style="italic">&#163;60.</inline> Sworn in* voices, covering several years&#39;  exportations  of harvesters to Buenos Ayres, have been sent out from Toronto, in Canada. I have the invoices, which were handed to me, not by the Massey-Harris Company, but by an honorable member of this House. The notarial certificate - the sworn declaration - identifies every one of the invoices, which show that in the early stages of the export business, the value of the harvesters was a little higher than at present. Some invoices for 1902 show that the value placed on the machines was $240, which, roughly speaking, would be equivalent to about <inline font-style="italic">&#163;4%.</inline> That was at a time when the business was in its infancy, and orders were limited. There are other invoices, covering the last two years, and dating from 22nd August, 1903, onwards, which show that the price at which the harvesters have been delivered in Buenos Ayres by the MasseyHarris Company is $225, or about <inline font-style="italic">&#163;45.</inline> I understand that these sales were on credit, instead of for cash. The $225 is the f.o.b. price, and that seems to have been the rule throughout the two years. I do not wish to attribute any intentional mis-statements to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay.</inline> I shall assume that he was misinformed. But it is strange that a man who ought to have known the facts so well should have been so misled. According to his sworn evidence, the value of these machines delivered in Buenos Ayres was <inline font-style="italic">&#163;60,</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">&#163;15</inline> over and above the value given in the sworn invoices covering a period of two years. I wish to put the matter in the fairest way as regards <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay,</inline> and I am willing to assume that he was deceived. The facts, however, only tend to show how dangerous it is for the Customs Department to rush to conclusions merely on the strength of statements made by interested persons. The Customs authorities were ready to take action on the evidence which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McKay</inline> was able to produce to them in respect to the price of harvesters t sent to Italy. It now transpires that the quotation given in the case referred to was for a single harvester, which was ordered through the London agent of the Massey-Harris Company. The machine therefore had to bear transhipment charges. I hope that the Minister will carry out the promise he made to the House, that the Massey-Harris Company should&#34; have an opportunity to appeal against his decision. In the first place, the Minister&#39;s promise stands; and, in the second place, it is a matter of common justice to a company who complain that they have been wrongly treated that they should be allowed to justify, their allegations. I do not wish to introduce any party spirit into this matter, but I most earnestly ask the Minister to give the Massey-Harris Company an opportunity to appeal against a decision which was arrived at behind their backs, at the instance of a trade rival. I now wish to say one or two words with reference to a paragraph which appears in this morning&#39;s newspapers, to the effect that the views expressed by the leader of the Labour Party, and also, I believe, indorsed by the honorable and learned member for West Sydney, in favour of an amendment of the contract section of the Immigration Restriction Act, are not shared by all the members of the Labour Party ; that, in fact, if the members of that party are not equally divided upon the subject, a considerable number of them are opposed to any alteration of the section. I should be very sorry to think that the statement is true, because immediately the leader of the Labour Party announced his readiness to have the Act amended I hastened to express my gratification, and to assure the Government that the Opposition would be only too glad to help them to amend the Act. I hope that, whatever may be the state of feeling in the Labour Party, the Government will have the courage to carry out their announced intention, lt has been declared that the Government propose to amend the section, and that they are only delaying their proposals until they can be carefully drafted - it is alleged that a great deal of difficulty will be experienced in the drafting - and embodied in their immigration policy. I only wish to say, by way of an antidote to the statement contained in the press - if such an antidote be necessary - that, supposing the members of the Labour Party show any opposition to this portion of the Government programme, there will be no sort of ehendeavour on the part of the .Opposition to embarrass the Government by withdrawing support from them. No matter what difficulty the Government may be confronted with in respect of their friends and supporters in their praiseworthy endeavour to amend the section, I think I may promise, on. behalf of the whole of the; members of the Opposition, a loyal and solid support, irrespective of party temptations or party advantage. I cannot help feeling that, apart from any question of immigration, or of adding to our population, we cannot, except by an amendment of the Act, dispose of the slanders upon the Commonwealth, in many cases absolutely untrue, ill-founded, and malicious, and in some instances sent from Australia by Australians. One of the worst features of these slanders is that many of them are fabricated in Australia, and are made to impose on the ignorance of English journalists. </para>

              <para>- Nobody who knows that honorable member will imagine for a moment that he made the misstatement in question deliberately. The fact is that he made a mistake in regard to the law, just asFull Courts sometimes do. Nobody would accuse him of being actuated by any malicious motive. I am very anxious &#34;that we shall establish friendly relations with the people of the mother country. That is a matter of vital importance to us. It is of no use attempting to dispel slanders upon Australia when, upon the face of our own laws, this charge can be truthfully levelled against us - that if an Englishman, Irishman, or Scotchman endeavours to come here as an honest working man - not as a loafer - and for that purpose enters into an honest business engagement at the Australian rate of wages, he can be sent to gaol for six months, and the only way in which he can escape that penalty is by finding two sureties, who will guarantee that he shall be transported from the shores of Australia. What a mockery such a condition of things is upon the word &#34; transportation <inline font-style="italic">&#34;I</inline> It is. a word that we have always associated with the criminal class, but Australia has invented a new kind of transportation in order to drive back to their own land our fellow-countrymen, whose only offence ii that they have an honest job ahead of them. The Labour Party may well wish to help us to remove that stigma. Let us surround the provision as carefully as we think is necessary, let us stipulate all sorts of safeguards, let us provide that any agreement which! is deceptive as to the ordinary rates of wages obtaining here shall be torn up by the nearest magistrate: but when we have safeguarded our law in that respect, do not let us lay the hand of the policeman upon an honest fellowcountryman. What idle talk it is to say that a man who works under contract is a sort of slave or helot ! How many men in Australia to-day do not work under an agreement for wages? And what a tremendous reflection it is upon our own people when it is suggested that the man  who  is not rich enough to be free from the necessity of engaging in honest work, under an honest contract, is an inferior person, and ought to be treated as a slave or a criminal ! </para>

              <para>- If the honorable member says I did, I will admit it. Even then, I occupy only the same position as that occupied by every other honorable member. The honorable member for Kooyong supported the third; reading of the measure. But did he know that he was voting for a law of that character? As a matter of fact, he actually went to the table, and asked the then Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton, what the provision meant, and  he was informed that it was only intended to deal with contract labour. I do not say that honorable members&#39; ought not to have understood its meaning, but I do say that when a layman like thd honorable member for Kooyong had the assurance of the Prime Minister that a certain clause in a Bill meant a certain thing, he was entitled to believe it. </para>

              <para>- I should like to ask another question which will supply the honorable and learned member with a very good answer. Let us suppose that a law were in force as to stealing, amd that the punishment for theft was six months&#39; imprisonment. Let us further assume that nobody steals, and  1  as a result, nobody is sent to gaol. Does that fact alter the law? Is it not because a thief is liable to imprisonment for stealing that many people do not steal ? What decent man will come 12,000 miles under an agreement which is a fraud on Commonwealth law, if he is liable to six months&#39; imprisonment for so doing? What British workman will come to a country when his choice lies between &#34; sneaking &#34; in, and imprisonment in case of detection ? </para>

              <para>- That is simply because there has never been a man who was criminal enough to break the law. The law provides that an Englishman, who is a manual labourer, shall be a prohibited immigrant if he comes here under contract, and that he shall be liable to six months&#39; imprisonment. The honorable member&#39;s justification for that law is that nobody has attempted to get into gaol. What man will come to Australia from the old country while such a law operates? The English workman is not yet reduced to such a pitiable condition that he is obliged to travel  12,000  miles to become a member of the criminal class. </para>

              <para>- That is another conundrum. Surely the honorable and learned member does not place British subjects coming to Australia in the same category as foreigners going to the United States? There is not a single American - even though he may have a hundred contracts in his pocket - who is prevented from entering the United States. I wish the honorable and learned member to recollect that there is not &#39;an American in any part of the world who cannot return to his own country under contract. The laws of the United States do not shut out a single American citizen, and the honorable and learned member ought not to place our fellow British subjects on the same footing as foreigners and aliens. We may keep our gaols for aliens if we choose, but we have no right to open the doors of our prisons to honest British subjects, whose only offence is that they come here, not to loaf on the people of Australia, but to do honest work. I should like to remind honorable members that there is no conspiracy, so far as the statute-book of the Commonwealth is concerned, to misrepresent Australia. Under section 3 of the Immigration Restriction Act, the following are prohibited immigrants : - </para>

              <para>- I can get more as the result of ten minutes&#39; work than the honorable member can earn in a year. I repeat, that a man employed upon piecework is nevertheless under a contract. The only difference in the two cases consists in the measure of payment. The man does not get so much a day, but a lump sum, for the work that he carries out. Whether the honorable member is working under <inline font-style="italic">contract or</inline> not, we all know that hundreds of thousands of workers in Australia are receiving daily or weeklywages. That, will not be denied. Would any man tell the Australian miner, who gets so much a day or so much a week from his employer, that he is not the equal of the man who is on piece work? </para>

              <para>- I should like to withdraw the invitation. The wretched pretence that there is a difference between these two classes of contracts because, in the one case, they are made in Australia, while in the other they relate to men who come from the mother country under agreement to work in Australia, instead of entering into a contract when they reach here, is one of those shallow subterfuges which show the extremities to which my honorable friends of the Labour Party are driven. I am quite familiar with the interjections that have been made while I have been dealing with this question. When I went all over Australia, denouncing the contract section of the Immigration Restriction Act, I was met with precisely the same ejaculations from various suspicious characters in different parts of the halls in which I spoke. It was quite a common thing to hear such interjections as &#34; Why, they are bondsmen,&#34; &#34;They are chattels,&#34; or &#34;They are slaves.&#34; I say, with all respect, that a working man in the mother country is probably just as respectable, and as honest, as is any member of the Labour Party, or of any other party in this House. In my opinion, so long as this law exists, we are justly exposed to truthful, honest, well-founded accusations that, by our laws, we are treating our fellow countrymen in England, Ireland, and Scotland as other nations treat aliens. I suppose that is a fair statement to make. We have been told that the laws of Canada shut out men under contract. That is again only half a truth. Canada does not shut out a single emigrant from England, Ireland, or Scotland; she does not by any such law exclude a. single subject of King Edward. Some of our honorable friends feel hurt because the people of England say unkind things about Australia, Australian laws, and Australian Parliaments ; but, so long as this law remains on our statute-book, the English people are entitled &#39;to refer to it in terms of the strongest reprobation. </para>

              <para>- I appealed to the people of Australia to return to this House sensible men, who would pass such an amendment. Instead of doing so, they returned other men in large numbers. I intend, if I live, to make precisely the same appeal to the electors on a future occasion, and am very happy to think that I shall then have the cordial support of the leader of the Labour Party. Speaking for himself, that honorable member said, quite recently, &#34; Oh, it has been a very unfortunate piece of business. We do not want to shut out honest working men, coming from the old country. Our desire is only to prevent men from entering into deceptive agreements to work in Australia. We merely want to prevent the introduction of con-  tract labour at the time of a strike.&#34; The honorable member did not profess to speak for his party ; but I am very happy to think that at the next election I shall have his support in my endeavours to secure the return of men who arc prepared to amend this law. With reference to the proposal of the Government to submit a comprehensive scheme for the promotion of immigration, I have only to say that any wellconsidered proposal with that object in view will receive the support of nearly all, if not every one, of the members of the Opposition. The matter is one of great importance to Australia; but the mere promise to encourage immigration will be of no avail. I hope to see the Government, in a very short time, submit their immigration policy. When they do so, I think that they will find that they have a number of friends on this side of the House. Whatever the attitude of honorable members sitting below the gangway may Le, I can safely say that, if the Government seek to pass measures designed to promote immigration, the Opposition will set aside what they think are well-founded grievances, and support them. The Government are in power. We feel that we cannot shift them, and while &#39;they remain in office we are anxious to assist them to carry out any useful work of which we approve. When they take this step they will learn who are their best friends in the House. In view of the contract which has been entered into by the Government of New South Wales, I hope that the Government will make some statement with reference to the Manufactures Encouragement, Bill. </para>

After  a week or two, or perhaps longer, I received those copies, and then took action, with a view to finding out a little more than was disclosed on the papers. There was an extraordinary difference between the freight charges put down by the Massey-Harris people for the carriage of their harvesters from New York to Australia, and the freight charges paid by McKay to send his harvesters from Australia to South America, the amount in one case being about <inline font-style="italic">&#163;7</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">&#163;j</inline> 10s., and in the other about 30s. </para>

              <para>- I am&#39; speaking from memory, but the amounts were practically what I have mentioned. In explanation, I was informed by the representative of the Massey-Harris Company that the Sunshine harvesters were packed differently from the way in which their harvesters were packed, and therefore cost less to transport, but I have not had a sufficient explanation of the difference. </para>

              <para>- In connexion with the transport of goods from the interior of America to the seaboard, there are arrangements whereby manufacturers, railway companies, and agents all gain certain pickings. An article is ordered at a very low price, and excessive freights are charged for sending it by rail or other conveyance to the seaboard&#39;, part of which is returned to the manufacturer. At the port of export - the f.o.b. port - these charges, are deducted, and the Customs valuation is made on the price, less that deduction. By that pernicious system our Customs Department were losing between ^30,000 and &#163;40,000 a year in connexion with the importation of machinery. </para>

              <para>- It is of general application. With regard to goods coming from Canada through New York, the charges between the Canadian and United States border, and the port of export - the f.o.b. port - are not interfered with. I mention this matter to show how difficult it is to get at the truth in connexion with freight charges. I find that harvesters are now being made in many towns in Australia. When I was at Corowa, about six weeks since. I saw at the local show harvesters which had been made in the town by a manufacturer named Henderson, who used to have works in Victoria, and farmers who had bought them told me that they were as good as could be obtained anywhere. </para>

Clutterbuck Bros., a firm which have been purchasing harvesters from the Massey-Harris Company, and he has brought back with him a good deal of information. He tells me that three years ago only forty or forty-one harvesters were imported into and sold in South Australia by the Massey-Harris Company ; that two years ago the importation had increased to seventy or eighty machines; and that last year no fewer than 450 or 470 were imported; and of course the manufacture of a like number in Australia prevented. </para>

              <para>- I have repeated the words that I used ; and when I have dealt with the matter there will be no cause of complaint. I do not know that honorable members wish for a further explanation now. I should only like to add that the result of my action has been, not to increase the price of harvesters to the farmers, but to decrease it. No doubt the light thrown on the whole subject is the reason why harvesters can now be bought more cheaply than they could be bought before this occurrence arose. </para>

              <para>- Probably that is so. The increase of the valuation would have had the effect of raising the price of imported harvesters by <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2 16s.</inline> had the additional duty been charged on to the farmers ; but as a matter of fact, these harvesters can now be bought more cheaply than they could be bought last season. I  have shown that a harvester manufactured at Corowa is sold at ;&#163;8o, and I believe that harvesters are also made near Yarrawonga, and at Junee or Wagga. . It has been said that my action will cause the Massey-Harris people to commence operations in Australia. I should be glad if it had that effect. I should welcome both the Massey-Harris people and the International Harvester Company if they would commence to manufacture here. </para>

              <para>- The price of the Sunshine harvester in Melbourne has been .&#163;81 for one size, and ,&#163;84 for another. The leader of the Opposition referred to thai action of the Government of New South Wales in entering into a contract with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford,</inline> of the  Eskbank ironworks for thd supply of iron and steel required for public works. I have already stated, through the press, that I am very glad indeed that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford.</inline> &#39;has been so lucky as to secure a very good bonus. But I am not .prepared to make any announcement with regard to the Bonus for Manufactures Bill at the present time. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford</inline> has entered into a contract to supply the iron and steel required by the Government of New South  Wales, he wall receive no consideration in connexion, with the requirements of private consumers of those commodities in that State. Furthermore, the arrangement entered into by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Sandford</inline> will confer no benefit on the other States. In considering the question of iron and steel production, we have to take a broad view of the requirements of the States. The leader of the Opposition referred to the dreadful consequences which had followed upon the administration of the Immigration Restriction Act. I am under the impression that the  right honorable gentleman voted for the third reading of that Ball, and some time ago, when speaking in reference to the contract clause, he said that he approved of the law, but abhorred the administration. </para>

              <para>- I do not wish to labour this question, but I consider that a great deal of injury has been done to Australia by the persistent misrepresentation of the facts by the Australian metropolitan press, whose statements have been republished in England, and have created a very nasty impression. The object of the Act is to prevent employers from introducing workmen under contract at rates of wages lower than those which prevail in Australia, and   that  aim seems to me to be a very proper one. We have been repeatedly and maliciously slandered by persons who have stated that no British subject can come to Australia. It should be  clearly  understood that no obstacle is imposed to the free immigration of British subjects into Australia, so long as they have not entered&#34; into contracts to work at wages lower than those which are current within the Commonwealth. </para>

              <para>- It is absurd to suggest that the proposal was regarded as of a party character. If the proposal made by the honorable and learned member for Corinella had been pressed, I should have voted for that also. I indicated by my conduct that I did not support the Standing Order adopted by the Committee merely because it emanated from a member of the party with which I happened to be connected. I can assure honorable members that party considerations did not enter into the discussion of the matter. Until I went to a meeting of the Committee, which was called for the transaction of ordinary routine business, I had no idea that any proposition of the kind was to be brought forward. When, however, it was submitted, I- thought it was a good one, and I supported it accordingly. I still adhere to that opinion. It was not proposed in order to deny honorable members the opportunity to call for a quorum when only a few members are present in the Chamber, but it was designed to prevent one or two honorable members from penalizing the whole House. </para>

              <para>- I absolutely deny that anything of the kind occurred, and I have better opportunities of ascertaining the facts than has the honorable and learned member. I wish to take the responsibility of my own action in the matter, and to assure honorable members that the Government had nothing whatever to do with it. . I have never been content to allow other people to bear the burden of responsibility which properly belongs to me. I am not here to excuse the Government, but I desire to assure honorable members that I acted entirely of my own volition, and was not inspired by any act, word, or deed on the part of the Government. I know that I hold my position on the Standing Orders Committee by virtue of the office to which I have been elected by honorable members, and I feel sure that they will not regard me as capable of betraying their confidence by giving my support to any and every proposal brought forward by the Government of which I happen to be a supporter. The honorable and learned member for Corinella will bear me out when I say that I assured him over and over again that I was prepared to assist him in securing the adoption of the Standing Order which he proposed. </para>

              <para>- I recognise that honorable members who are strongly opposed to any particular measure are justified in endeavouring to secure its defeat. But it is not a legitimate thing for honorable members to impede the business of the country by rising half-a-dozen times in as many minutes to direct attention to the state of the House, when they know perfectly well that there is a quorum within call. If honorable members possess rights, they should also recollect that they have responsibilities. I would ask any impartial observer to say whether there have not been more members present upon this side of the House during the past two months than there have been, upon the Opposition benches ? </para>

          <para>Air. DUGALD THOA1SON.- The honorable member has chosen to state - and of course we cannot very well . dissociate him from his position as an officer of the House - that the Opposition has not done its duty in assisting &#39;to maintain a quorum. I venture to say that, in proportion to its numbers, there are usually as many - if not more - honorable members to be found upon this side of &#39; the Chamber as there are upon the Government benches. I have frequently counted them, and I make that statement as the result of my observation. It must be recollected that there are two parties upon the other side of the House. I entirely disagree with the definition of &#34;purposes of a quorum&#34; which was given by the honorable member for Laanecoorie. I claim that the attendance of a quorum, as provided for in the Constitution, means the presence &#34;of at least twenty-five honorable members- in this Chamber, not their presence within the precincts of Parliament. What an absurdity it would be, in fixing a&#39; quorum, to imply that honorable members might be scattered over several acres of ground ! </para>

            <para>- It is. The honorable member has stated that by  adopting the proposed new Standing Order we shall merely be following the practice of the British Parliament. I shall not debate that question at the present stage, but I do not think that his statement is correct. Then I take strong, exception to an interjection which was made by the honorable member for Gwydir. He stated deliberately - and he adhered to his statement, despite the fact that it was contradicted - that when the honorable and learned member for Corinella proposed, and I seconded, a motion, at a meeting of the Standing Orders Committee, in favour of limiting the speeches of honorable members, we were members of the late Government. I have here the minutes of the meetings of that Committee. From these I find that notice of the motion in question was given on 17th August last. The present Government came into office upon 7th July. I learn from the records that the honorable and learned member for Corinella moved - </para>

              <para>- The honorable member is now declaring what were our intentions. Does he mean to say that two members of the Standing Orders Committee who are members of the Opposition supported a proposal which was intended to shorten the proceedings of Parliament whilst another Ministry was in office, for the benefit of a Government which had ceased to exist? The honorable member adhered to his statement, which should have been withdrawn immediately it was denied. I maintain that members of the Opposition have shown quite as much desire as have the Government to legitimately curtail debate. The honorable member for Laanecoorie also alluded to an attempt which was made last night to count out the House, as if similar tactics had not been frequently - and upon two occasions successfully - resorted to during the term of office of the previous Government. Yet he expressed abhorrence and surprise that anything of the sort should have been attempted. I should not have risen had he not made an attack upon the Opposition which was altogether unjustifiable. Coming to the question of the valuation of harvesters for the purposes of the Customs, I would point out that the Minister has clearly indicated that he has allowed himself to be influenced by certain matters to which he should really give no consideration. He stated! that he found that the sale of imported harvesters in South) Australia had largely increased. </para>

              <para>- I believe that it was after the officers had investigated the books of the South Australian importer that they advised that the valuation of &#163;38 &#34;10s. should be accepted as the correct import price. I think that the Minister must recognise that charged as he is with the duty of protecting the revenue, and of seeing that trade is honestly conducted, he ought to institute legal proceedings against any firm, which, in his opinion, has been defrauding the Customs. This firm certainly has been doing so, if the valuation of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;65</inline> is the true one. If such proceedings are not to be taken the opportunity of having the question settled in a court of law should be given the importers. I was under the impression that he had already promised to give the firm in question an opportunity to test the correctness of his decision. When he says, in effect, to them - &#34; I am not prepared! to punish you, as I ought to do, if, as I allege, you have bean under-valuing your imports,&#34; he ought also to say, &#34; I am prepared to give you an opportunity to show that I am wrong, and if you prove your case, I shall revise the valuation.&#34; The honorable gentleman stated that certain firms in the United States and Canada were over -estimating the railway and steam-boat charges from the place of manufacture to the port of shipment. I quite agree that under the old practice, there was a great danger of that being done. For some reason or other the practice was adopted of accepting as the basis of valuation the rates ruling for goods at a particular market in the country of  manufacture, regardless of whether that market was on the coastline or in the centre of a large continent. In this way, an opening was given for fraud - for the undue inflation of railway charges, and the consequent reduction of the cost &#39;at factory. I quite agree that the new system is one that ought to have been adopted from the first, and that the f.o.b. price at the port &#187;f export should be accepted. I think the Minister said that he was satisfied that there was a great deal of under-valuing taking place in connexion with exports from America. </para>

              <para>- I do not know whether he has considered the desirableness of applying some check in the countries of export. In order to protect their revenue, the Americans insist that sworn valuations of exports to that country shall be made at the port of shipment before the American Consul, who has an opportunity there to ascertain whether or not the values are correct. If fraud has been committed in this direction, it may be de sirable for the Minister to consider the advisability of resorting to this system inthe United States. I wish now to allude briefly to the present system of rating telephones. This is a matter to which I have previously &#39;drawn the attention of Ministers, and I was under the impression that it was to receive consideration. There are some regulations in force which do not fit the conditions to which they apply. If twenty-five applications to be connected with the telephone service are received at the one time from a suburb which may have suddenly sprung into existence, a charge of only ^5 (per annum is made i(n respect of each subscriber, but in a suburb where there may be 100 subscribers who have applied at different times to be connected, a charge of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;6</inline> per annum may be made. In another case we have the strange anomaly that in a thicklypopulated suburb which may be regarded as part of the city itself, and where there are perhaps 100 or 200 subscribers beyond the mile limit, a charge of <inline font-style="italic">&#163;6</inline> per annum is made, whilst those living in a suburb fourteen or fifteen miles away from the central exchange - sand where the cost of making the connexion is consequently much greater - have to pay only <inline font-style="italic">&#163;5</inline> Per annum, although there may not be more than twenty-five or thirty subscribers there. The regulations simply take into account the distance from the centre, and not the density of subscribers. I should not have alluded to this matter, but for the fact that a promise has been made on more than one occasion, that it will receive consideration. I understood from the late Postmaster-General that these regulations were about to be revised. I do not attach any blame to the present Minister, because I know that he has not been long in office,, and could not reasonably be ex- pected to have already attended to all these matters ; but I think it necessary that the Telephone Department, which is a business one, should have its regulations framed upon business lines. If it be shown thai its regulations do not meet the existing conditions - that they bristle with irritating anomalies, and have given rise to legitimate complaints - they ought certainly to be re-considered . I think that the PostmasterGeneral will admit that it is absurd that regulations should provide that twentyfive subscribers to the telephone service, living fourteen miles away from the central source of the connexion, should hav&#171; to pay only &#163;5 each per annum, when, perhaps, 100 or 200 closely packed subscribers within a mile and a half of the very same centre have to pay a higher&#39; rate. I trust that the Minister will give consideration to the regulations, and recognise the necessity for their amendment. </para>

The honorable member for Gwydir might have been able to explain it as readily as the honorable member for North Sydney has explained his absence from the meetings of the Standing Orders Committee. The leader of the Opposition has only attended one out of twenty-five meetings of this Committee, and yet he dares to criticise those who have attended regularly.

            <para>-  2 on the motion that it be read a third time. In my opinion, the measure is so framed that, unless very liberal regulations be made under it, the people of the Commonwealth will be entirely deprived of the advantages which science is now offering us in the direction of wireless telegraphy. It would be a great boon to residents of country districts to be able to communicate with their friends miles and miles away by means of this cheap and effective system, but unfortunately the provisions of the Bill are so stringent that, unless the Postmaster-General is careful to frame liberal regulations, private Individuals will find themselves absolutely unable to avail themselves of it. He must see that the officials of the Telegraph Department do not seek to impose harsher restrictions than are necessary upon any one attempting to use this method of telegraphing, to the serious injury of the people of Australia. An unfortunate &#39; result of our legislation is that all improvements are practically blocked by it, and there can be no such &#34;thing as progress. </para>

              <para>- It is natural for departmental officers who have been brought up in a groove to be averse to changes, but I think that the Postmaster-General will see that the regulations are framed in a liberal spirit, so as not to hinder the development of the wireless telegraphy system. At the present time a very heavy penalty, can be imposed upon any one who uses it. I feel sure that the honorable gentleman will do all that he can to improve the means of communication available to settlers in country districts. I have been glad to learn from him privately that he will do all that he can, consistently with the maintenance of the revenue, to provide conveniences for communication to the public, but the maintenance of the revenue should not be the only consideration, be cause it must be borne in mind that we cannot open up the country without expense. The leader of the Opposition referred to the Capital Site question, and I cannot too earnestly urge the Ministry to bring about some settlement of that question. The state of affairs is rather complicated, in view of the fact that the PostmasterGeneral naturally desires the retention of Dalgety; but I still assert that that place is too far from the main railway  line between Melbourne and Sydney to be a suitable site for the Federal Capital. </para>

              <para>- I have always said that it was as good as the suggested site near Tumut, but my view is that the Capital should be established close to the overland railway line, so that speedy access may be had to it from the capitals of the States, where the bulk of the legislators of the Commonwealth will always reside. If the Federal Capital is placed in a dis- .trict away from the main line, all mails will be at least half a day longer in transit each way, which would be a great objection in these days of quickness of travelling and rapidity of communication. I should have been willing to see the Constitution amended, so that a site might be chosen anywhere within the mother State. If the country within 100 miles of Sydney had been made available, the Federal Parliament would long since have chosen a suitable site, and we should now be meeting in a Parliament House belonging to the Commonwealth. When this Parliament meets in the Federal Capital, the New South Wales representatives will gain a great advantage, because they will have much less travelling to do, while the Victorian representatives, who so strongly objected to expenses being granted to members, will find that the cost of living, when one has to spend part of at least four days every week in travelling, is considerable. While the allowance given to us under the Constitution may be sufficient for a member who resides in Melbourne, it is altogether too little to a representative coming from another State. I very much regret that the Minister has not brought in a Redistribution of Seats Bill, so that we might know exactly how we shall find ourselves at the next elections. I am afraid that the method which thev are pursuing will cause us to g&#169; before the electors on the same distribution as took effect at the last general elections, which will be verv unfair for New South Wales at least, because, although that State is contributing towards the expenses of Federation on the population basis, she is not represented in this House in proportion to her population. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. MALONEY</inline>(Melbourne). - The honorable member for North Sydney has informed me that he was appointed to the Standing Orders Committee in November of last year, and has attended three of the six meetings which have been held since that time. He has also assured me that he had no intention to make a bitter attack on the honorable member for Laanecoorie. I wish, therefore, to- withdraw what I said on the subject. </para>

            <para>- I was not present when the honorable and learned member for Wannon referred to the valuation of imported harvesters, but I distinctly heard the Minister of Trade and Customs say that he would not throw any obstacle in the way of the importing company, if they wished to prove their <inline font-style="italic">bona fides. 1</inline> This evening, however, the honorable member for North Sydney informed the House that the Minister has not yet done anything in the matter, and I therefore ask him to give the House an assurance, for the sake of his own reputation, and that of the Commonwealth, that he will give these people an opportunity to prove that they have not been guilty of fraud, by taking proceedings against them. I do not defend attempts to defraud, and should like to see such attempts punished. </para>

            <para>- I think that the Postmaster-General, in common with most honorable members, recognises the important part which telephones play in connexion with the development of our territory, and I therefore ask him to consider the advisability of bringing more prominently under the notice of the public the means &#39;provided for their convenience. When a telephone exchange is established, the names of the persons whose residences are connected with it appear on the list which is made available to the public. But there are many cases in which country homes or stations are connected by private telephone lines with the nearest telegraph office, and I suggest that some method should be adopted of acquainting the public with the fact that these means of communication exist. For instance, if residents in Melbourne could consult a list showing the country homes connected bytelephone, they would probably be induced to avail themselves of the facilities offered, and would thus bring additional revenue to the Department. I hope that&#39; the Minister will give this matter his attention. </para>
