                    <para>- I cannot give such an assurance. We intend to call for tenders this month, and if a tender were received which it would be advantageous to accept at once, it would be unwise for the Government to wait until the meeting of Parliament before ratifying it, though, in every case, the representation&#39;s made by honorable members will be taken into consideration. </para>

                            <para>A great deal of the Customs work of the State of New South Wales has been transferred to the head-quarters in Melbourne. </para>
                        </item>
                    </list>
                    <para>This statement is incorrect, as the whole of the detailed work of the Customs, New South Wales, is still transacted in that State. </para>
                    <para>It is true, of course, that the central administration is in Melbourne, that city being at present the seat of Government, but that administration has to do with the Customs of the whole of the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para>To show how misleading the statement is, it may be mentioned that the Customs staff of New South Wales is 334, while the whole staff of the Ministerial office dealing with matters referred from all the States, and with many other important matters besides those relating to Customs administration, is only 20. </para>
                    <list type="decimal-dotted">
                        <item label="2.">
                            <para>That the Customs collect wharf age rates in Melbourne for the Harbor Trust for a lump sum of &#163;800 a year, rendering services which, if done by the Harbor Trust officers, would have cost the Trust an extra sum during the past five years of nearly &#163;20,000. </para>

                    </list>
                    <para>The arrangement under which the Customs collected wharfage rates for the Melbourne Harbor Trust, and for which the Trust paid a lump sum of &#163;800 a year, was terminated on 1st July, 1905, the Trust having decided to collect these rates with its own officers. </para>
                    <para>The remuneration to the Customs for collecting these rates had, for some time, been considered inadequate for the services rendered, and, if the arrangement had been continued, the Department would probably have required the payment to be raised from <inline font-style="italic">&#163;800</inline> to (at least) &#163;2,000 per annum. </para>

                            <para>That the New South Wales Government requested the Customs to collect rates for the Sydney Harbor Trust, and that the request was refused. &#34;They say that it should not be done by Customs officers, who should not be brought into contact with shipping in the collection of local State dues. The Federal officers ought to wear one uniform, with gold buttons, and the State officers another, with silver buttons, and the Federal officers should not be called upon to do menial work for the State.&#34; </para>

                    <para>No official request from the Government of New South Wales can be traced. The matter was, however, discussed with the Comptroller-General by the Chairman of the Trust two or three years ago, and a desire was expressed to meet the Trust&#39;s wishes. </para>
                    <para>The first difficulty connected with this suggestion, and one which at the time could not be overcome, was the lack of accommodation in the Customs House, owing to the large amount of space occupied in the building by State Departments. </para>
                    <para>Great inconvenience was, and still is, caused to the mercantile community of Sydney owing to the congested state of the accommodation in the Sydney Customs House, and it was impossible, without causing an intolerable state of affairs, to undertake work which would have meant finding accommodation for an increased number of officers. </para>
                    <para>Negotiations between the Commonwealth and State Governments with a view to obtaining more accommodation in the Customs House for the business of the Customs Department have been carried on for some time, but nothing definite has yet resulted. </para>

                    <para>This was laid down as a guiding principle by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kingston</inline> - the first Commonwealth Minister of Customs - and has been followed by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Lyne, the present Minister, and by other Ministers of the Department. </para>

                    <para>This is a measure to make certain necessary amendments in the Patents Act of 1903, chiefly to prevent persons from losing their rights because of omissions from that Act. Clause 2 gives the Commissioner power to extend the prescribed time for doing any act, or taking any step in relation to an application for a patent made under section 29 of the principal Act, and to revive any application which has lapsed by reason of an omission to do any act, or take any step within the prescribed time. There are not many cases which will be affected by this clause, though the Commissioner informs me that there are four or five important ones in regard to which, without the proposed amendment, he will be unable to do what he considers to be just to certain applicants. Clause 3 expands the definition of patentees in the principal Act, and is an amendment consequential to that of clause 4, which makes&#39; the rights granted to a patentee personal property, capable of assignment, and of transmission by operation of law. Clause 5 provides that the forms of letters patent may be varied, it having been found that the forms provided in the original Act will not meet every case. Clause 6 amends section 71 of the principal Act, which provides that, where a patent has been mortgaged, the request for leave to amend the specification - shall be made by the mortgagor and the mortgagee, or by the mortgagor, with the written consent of the mortgagee, or by the mortgagee. </para>
                    <para class="block">It is proposed to add the words - with the written consent of the mortgagor. </para>
                    <para class="block">Clause 7 provides for a verbal amendment of section 74. Clause 8 gives power to remedy lapses arising from faults or errors in the Patents Office. Owing to the rush of work when the administration of the Patents Act was entered upon, mistakes were made by the Department which cannot be remedied unless a provision of this kind is agreed to. For instance, a patent was applied &#39;for by some one in Maryborough, Queensland, and, as the reply to the application was sent to Maryborough, Victoria, and failed to reach him, he did not complete the necessary payments, and the patent was not sealed. As these cases have arisen through the fault of the Department, it is only fair that they should be remedied. The last clause of the Bill - clause 9 - amends the schedule of fees. There is no real change in the charges made, but it is provided that the fee for lodging an application for a patent, accompanied by a specification, which is <inline font-style="italic">&#163;1,</inline> and the fee for lodging a complete specification after the provisional one has been lodged, which is <inline font-style="italic">&#163;2,</inline> may be paid in one fee of on lodging an application for a patent accompanied by a complete specification in the first instance. This is a convenient arrangement, and will put an end to the mistakes which have occurred through omission to make the second payment. </para>

                        <para>- I did not see this Bill until about five minutes ago, but I have no hesitation in, saying that it is full of danger. The Minister tells us that it is only a formal measure, but it proposes to place in the hands of the Commissioner the right to go back on some of the most important provisions of the existing Act. The Minister has not said a word about the vested rights which may already have been affected by a strict observance of the rules of the Patents Act having been insisted upon. I have no desire to interfere with the passing of a formal Bill, but I wish to point out to honorable members the very serious consequences that may follow from provisions such as those now submitted to us.

                            <para>- Very valuable properties may be affected by these provisions. There are certain rules laid down, within which certain steps have to be taken, and certain precautions have to be observed; and very often where people interested in patent rights see that all the rules have been complied with, and that there is no further chance of competitive patents coming into conflict with them, they enter into negotiations which involve very large sums of money. I think that the Minister has unintentionally misled the House. </para>

                            <para>- I shall not be prevented from saying what I desire by any such interruptions of the Minister. I am not attempting to lay down any distinct proposition, but I am warning the House against being led away by the statement of the Minister that this is a merely formal matter. The Patents Act of 1903 lays down a number of provisions which are intended to regulate the procedure in applying for patent rights. People, in dealing with certain rights may assume that all the requirements have been complied with, not only in regard to a particular patent, but in regard to competitive patents, and large transactions may be entered into on the strength of the fact that other patent applications are out of time, and have thus been finally disposed of. This Bill, however, provides that the Commissioner shall have practically unlimited power in relation to any application that comes before him. He could extend the prescribed time, probably in regard to future patents, and revive any application. There might have been an application in opposition to a patent which has since been granted, and which has been the subject of important negotiations. But the Commissioner will have power to revive any application which may have lapsed by reason of an omission to do any act, or take any steps within the prescribed time. Clause 3 is pregnant with danger. In sub-clause 2 it is provided - </para>

                    <para>The Minister told us that the Bill was introduced owing to a flaw in the Act, but he has not indicated any flaw. He <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> seeking to unfasten all the strings that were tied up when the Act was passed. We do not know what may be underlying this Bill. Suppose that a patent worth&#163;10,000 has been granted because an application for another patent has failed. Negotiations may have been entered into because of the knowledge that the competing patent had not been registered. Yet we are asked to place in the hands of the Commissioner, who is, no doubt, a very capable man - in fact, I know that he is - the power to revive an application, not one month old, or six months old, but, it may be, five years old. This is a deliberate attempt - I do not say with an improper purpose - to untie the strings of the Act of 1903, and give the Commissioner power to receive past applications, to get rid of past inaccuracies, to take up past applications which were previously out of time, and to generally do many things calculated to disorganize the patent laws. Sub-clause 3 of clause 5 provides - </para>

                    <para class="block">Who ever heard of such an unconditional power being given to the permanent head of a Department? Why were our patent laws passed? Because we recognised that a citizen who made an invention should be protected. A regular code of procedure is laid down by which patent rights are protected from stage to stage. If these precautions are not necessary, why should the Act have been passed? Having adopted the Act, I ask why should we unconditionally relax its provisions, as the Minister now proposes? </para>

During the time that the Act was being passed through this Chamber, the question was raised as to whether we should not allow applications to be lodged before the commencement of the Act - the time at which it would be convenient, after the organization of the office, to have full effect given to the Act. In consequence of that, section 29 was inserted. That section provides - </para>

                            <para>- In the case to which I refer the applications were lodged under section 29 before the Act came into operation. They then allowed about fourteen months from the commencement of the Act to elapse before they asked for the sealing of their patents; in other words, they construed section 67 as allowing them the full period of sixteen months after the commencement of the Act, notwithstanding that they had lodged their applications before its commencement. The Commissioner came to the conclusion that the sixteen months&#39; period dated from the receipt of the application, and upon that ground he ruled that these persons were too late with their application for sealing. I understand that a number of members of the legal profession hold that the applicants were well within the time allowed them, so long as the sixteen months from the commencement of the Act had not elapsed. As a layman, the section does appear to me to bear that construction. As I understand, what is proposed in this Bill is to allow applicants whose claims may not have been confirmed within the specified time from the lodging of the original applications an opportunity to be placed in possession of their patent rights. In one particular case an application was made, and the patent was being operated, but the applicant had not the money in the earlier period to apply for the sealing of the patent, and to pay the required fees. Later on, however - within the sixteen months&#39; period provided under section 67 - he was in possession of the requisite means, and applied for the sealing of his patent. He was then met with the decision of the Commissioner that his application was too late. </para>

                            <para>- The suggestion of the honorable and learned member is worthy of consideration. I know of two such cases which occurred in Sydney. One of them related to a very valuable patent indeed. The application was made under section 291 of the original Act, and the applicant waited until fourteen months after the commencement of the statute before attempting to seal his patent. At that time, the sixteen months dating from the period of his original application had expired, and he thus incurred the risk of losing a very valuable patent owing to the loose drafting of the law. The principle which impresses me in connexion with clause 8 is that it is very hard to make the applicant responsible for an error o the Department. </para>

                        <para>- I rise for the purpose of suggesting that the Minister should agree to postpone the further consideration of this Bill until&#39; Monday next. By this time, every honorable member must be aware that the measure is not a formal one, as was indicated by the Minister, but is one of considerable importance. For instance, in clause 5, it is proposed to multiply the forms of patents. That provision sets out that the form of a patent is not to be so material a point as it has been heretofore. I should think that the forms of patents are the very essence of them, and the matter should receive the most careful consideration before any departure is made from the present law in that connexion. Then clause 6 proposes to effect an alteration in the manner in which patents relate to mortgages. I can easily see that the Bill is of sufficient importance to warrant careful consideration, before it is finally deal with. Having regard to the fact that it was only placed in our hands after the Minister had moved its second reading- </para>

When the honorable and learned member for Parkes caught <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker&#39;s</inline> eye, I was about to take the same point that he has taken. Although I do not think that there is any occasion for a display of heat between honorable members, there is no doubt that he is right in saying that the Bill is not a formal one. It may bear very grievously upon applicants for patents. If there are two rival applicants for a similar patent it is possible to grievously injure the man who has been holding back to see if his opponent has sacrificed his rights owing to his neglect to take action within the prescribed time. I can see by the instances which have been cited by the honorable member for Bland that there are cases which require to be met. A very natural mistake has been made- </para>

                            <para>- The provision that an applicant may lodge an application before the Act came into operation is a peculiar one, and some misunderstanding has very naturally resulted. I am quite sure that no honorable member would care to see an applicant injured by placing a wrong construction upon the Act. As the honorable and learned member for Parkes has pointed out, it is possible, in remedying our mistake, to give the sections of the principal Act a wider scope than is desirable. This Bill would practically allow the Commissioner to say which of two rival applicants he would favour. The title to a patent is a matter which ought not to be interfered with without the gravest consideration. Then, if it is proper to revive early applications for patents, we ought to make similar provision in respect to future applications. Why should we extend the period prescribed by the law as to applications within sixteen months after the passing of the Act, and not subsequently? I do not quite understand either the need for clause 2 or clause 8, but I have no doubt that they have been well thought out, and that the Minister will give us the reasons underlying them, besides showing us how they fit one into the other. I would suggest to him that after the second reading of the Bill has been carried, he should allow honorable members an opportunity of studying its details. In the interval the Attorney-General and the law officers of the Crown might easily consider whether or not these clauses do not go a little too far. </para>

                        <para>- I am sure that we are very much indebted to the legal members of the House for drawing attention to the far-reaching effects of this Bill. The more one considers its provisions, the more far-reaching its possibilities appear. It is manifest, from the speech made by the honorable member for Bland, that it has been introduced to meet specific cases in which applicants for patents have been unwittingly made sufferers, and I think that it should be confined to the rectification of errors that have actually crept in. My suggestion is that on the Bill being read a second time, the Minister should agree to its further consideration being postponed until Monday; that he should then bring down a list of the cases of injustice which it is proposed to remedy by this measure, and that if honorable members consider that they are deserving of special consideration, they should be made a schedule to the Bill, which would then apply simply to them. As one who has had practical experience in connexion with patents of some magnitude, I feel that the Bill is a most important one, and that the House is under an obligation to the honorable and learned member for Parkes, the honorable and learned member for Northern Melbourne, and others, who have pointed out its true significance. If passed, it would not only neutralize certain legislation relating to patents, but would strike at the very root of the value of many existing patents in respect of which large sums have been expended. I hope that the Minister will be prepared to accept this suggestion. </para>

It is certainly not the formal measure which the introductory remarks made by the Minister would lead one to believe. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Sir WILLIAM</inline>LYNE (Hume- Minister of Trade and Customs). - I thank honorable members for having agreed that the Bill should be carried into Committee without delay. When I introduced it, I did not imagine that there would be any lengthy discussion upon it. There are a few cases, similar to those which have been mentioned, that press very heavily upon the persons interested. My object in introducing the Bill was to rectify these anomalies, which have arisen through no fault of the parties concerned. </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that that can occur. I know of one case where a man allowed more than the sixteen months referred to by the honorable member for Bland to elapse before securing the sealing of his patent. This was due to illness ; and although he presented the necessary fee a few days after the time had expired, the Commissioner was not able to accept it. The invention is a very important one, and although the man interviewed me on the subject I could do nothing for him. </para>

                            <para>- I quite admit that. But if in the meantime another person had come in and secured a right in respect of the invention, this man, through no fault of his own, would have lost it for ever. The Commissioner told me that in this respect there could be no clashing under the clause, and it was, perhaps, because of that information that I replied in somewhat heated terms to the honorable and learned member for Parkes. </para>

Objection has been taken to clause 4, which provides that patent rights shall be personal property. That, to my mind, is simply a formal provision. Certain words that would give a clear right to mortgage are missing from the original Act, and this clause is simply designed to remedy that flaw. </para>

Several honorable members have taken exception to clause 5, but according to the papers that have been placed before me, and the information with which I have been supplied by the (Commissioner and the Crown Law Officers, a similar provision is to be found in the English Act, and indeed, in most, if not all, Patent Acts. The claims coming before Che Commissioner are so varied that it is impossible to have a set of forms that are suitable to the circumstances of every case. </para>

                            <para>- It is only reasonable to expect that practical experience in the administration of a Federal Act embracing the legislation of the States, and that of other countries, may lead to the discovery of certain defects, and that is the reason why they are dealt with in this way. Clause 8 was explained to me by the Commissioner to be intended to deal with cases where, owing to two post towns bearing the same name, a man&#39;s valuable property had gone to the wrong town, and, through its non-receipt, he had lost his right. There is power taken in the clause to preserve to a man in such a position his right ; but whether it goes too far or not I do not know. However, if there is going to be a long discussion about the matter, I shall ask the House to go into Committee to-day <inline font-style="italic">fro forma,</inline> and see whether, by Monday, we cannot come to a solution of the difficulty, and so relieve those persons who are now oppressed; in consequence of the absence of some such legislation. </para>

                    <para>By this Bill the House is asked to take a step in furtherance of the Seat of Government Act, which was assented to on the 15th August, 1904. It is hardly necessary for me to dwell upon the importance of settling the momentous question of the Seat of Government. It has caused a great deal of grave concern to the House. Of course, it has evoked a certain amount of warm criticism ; but to-day I ask the House to pass this Bill, in furtherance of its previous decision - that is, to determine more definitely that the Seat of Government of the Commonwealth shall be in the neighbourhood of Dalgety. It is desirable, I think, to take a retrospect, in order to exactly appreciate the position in which we find ourselves. I ask honorable members &#34;to cast their minds back to the time when it was first contemplated that the Commonwealth should proceed to the establishment of the permanent Seat of Government. The earliest step was taken on the 14th November, 1899, when the Government of New South Wales appointed the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Alexander</inline> Oliver as a Commissioner to inquire into certain sites. He conducted an inquiry, and on the 26th October, 1900, the sites he recommended were - (1) Orange (or Canobolas), (2) Yass, (3) Bombala-Eden (Southern Monaro). The next important matter to which I invite attention is a letter which was sent on the 13th April, 1901, by the then Prime Minister of the Commonwealth <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Edmund Barton),</inline> and in which he says - </para>

                        <para>I have the honour, on behalf of the Government, to inquire whether the Government of the State of New South Wales is prepared to offer to the Commonwealth, under the provisions of the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act, any sites for the Federal district or territory within which the Capital of the Commonwealth is to be situated. I have to intimate that the Federal Government desire to consider offers of tracts of larger area than the minimum prescribed in the 125th section of the Constitution Act, and would suggest that in the meantime the Government of New South Wales may, in the public interests of the whole Commonwealth, take steps to secure unalienated lands within any areas offered from losing the character of &#34; Crown lands &#34; within the section, until a decision in the matter is arrived at. </para>

                            <para>- The three sites were Bombala, Yass, and Orange. Towards the end of 1901, the Premier of New South Wales used certain expressions, to which I desire to refer, in order to show the attitude which its Government then took up on this question.

This is my clear position. Undoubtedly, under the provisions of the Constitution Act they (the Federal Parliament) have the right to make the selection. If the State Government stand in the way of that selection being confirmed we shall have the Capital in Melbourne probably for all time, or at any rate during the time that this House might squabble as to whether the site which the Federal Parliament selected was or was not the right one. </para>

                            <para>- After the Premier of New South Wales had offered those sites to the Federal Government, and had offered further to consider any representations which might be made in respect to any other site, on the 29th August. 1901, the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth addressed to that gentleman a letter in which he asked whether the Federal Government might expect any further sites to be submitted for consideration, and suggested that certain sites should be reserved in the neighbourhood of Albury, Tamworth, Armidale, and Tumut. In March, 1902, a party of senators visited the sites, and in May of that year, a party of members of the House of Representatives visited them. On the 25th September, 1902, a resolution was passed by each House of the Federal Parliament, to the effect that a Committee of experts be appointed to examine and report upon the sites in the following localities: - Albury, Armidale, Bombala, Lake George, Orange (including Bathurst), Lyndhurst, and Tumut. A Royal Commission was appointed on the 14th of January, 1903. On the 26th of July, 1903, their report was presented to this Parliament. On the 4th of August, 1903, a further supplementary report of the Commission was submitted, dealing with Dalgety. On the 22nd of September, 1903, the Government submitted a proposal for holding a joint sitting of the Senate and the House of Representatives, for the purpose of selecting a site. The Senate would not agree to that proposal. On the 8th of October of the same year this House considered the matter, and decided that Tumut should be the site. The Senate amended the Bill, and inserted Bombala. After further surveys, made by the New South Wales officers, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scriviner</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chesterman,</inline> with respect to the country surrounding Bombala and Tumut, the matter was again submitted to this Parliament </para>

The matter again came before this House, and on the 15th August, 1904, the Seat of Government Act, as it at present stands on our statute-book, was passed, and Dalgety determined on as the Seat of Government. Now, the point which I desire to make is this - that the New South Wales Government offered sites to this Parliament; that this Parliament absolutely proceeded all through in conformity with the terms of the Constitution; that with the consent of the State of New South Wales we considered every site that that State had submitted to us ; that we further considered other sites which it was suggested should be considered; and that finally this Parliament accepted one of the sites originally submitted to us by the Government representing the people of New South Wales. </para>

                            <para>- The Premier represented the people of the State of New South Wares for the time being. The Parliament of New South Wales sat continuously, knowing that we were dealing with this matter.; knowing that we were looking into these sites ; knowing that we were examining the reports submitted to us ; knowing that we were consid&#39;ering the Seat of Government Bills of 1903 and 1904. It is rather interesting, in this regard, to read the speech delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers,</inline> the present Premier of New South Wales, in the Legislative Assembly of that State last week. I will ask honorable members to pay particular attention to this statement - </para>

                        <para>None of the sites which were offered were selected. We offered Bombala; and I go this faT and say that if the Federal Government had accepted Bombala this State would have been out of court, because, practically, in offering Bombala our position was compromised. Luckily, or unluckily, the Federal Parliament did not accept Bombala, but proceeded, without asking our consent or concurrence, to select Dalgety, a site which had never been considered in this State. In fact, a large majority of honorable members did not know where Dalgety was. One honorable member, who was actually born close to Buckley&#39;s Crossing, said, when the vote was taken, that if they had gone for Buckley&#39;s Crossing he would ha-ve voted for it. </para>

Such incorporation, it will be seen, has been suggested. (See plan and description of boundaries of Southern Monaro Extension Site, marked S in Appendix.) </para>

We have determined that the Seat of Government: shall be within seventeen miles of Dalgety, which locality is included in the extended territory suggested.

                        <para class="block">As a result of the discussion with the Federal Attorney-General, two points became clear : - </para>
                        <para class="block">First, that it would be useless for this State to enter upon an action for trespass, or to challenge the right of the Commonwealth to drive in a survey peg, if that step were to be first sanctioned by Act of Parliament ; and, secondly, that the Commonwealth had no authority to drive in a survey peg or exercise any act of ownership by virtue of the Seat of Government Act ; in other words, confirmation was given to the repeated contention of this State that the Seat of Government Act was not a determination of the Seat of Government within the meaning of the Constitution. </para>
                        <para class="block">As to the actual effect of this Statute, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Isaacs</inline> and myself were not entirely in agreement. On the one hand, it was argued that it is a quasi or partial determination of the Seat of Government, in so far as the Federal Parliament has declared that no area outside that within a radius of 17 miles of Dalgety will be considered by the Federal Parliament in negotiating for a seat of Government, and to that extent it is binding, both upon the Federal Parliament and the State of New South Wales. On the other hand, it is contended that this Statute is a mere registration of the opinion of the Federal Parliament, and that it is no more binding upon this State than a joint resolution of the two Houses. This resolution may be revoked, and the Seat of Government subsequently determined within territory quite outside the Dalgety area. </para>

                        <para>Whichever view is correct is really immaterial at the present time, because both Governments seem now to agree that the next step is to define some area by metes and bounds; next to open negotiations for the grant or acquisition of that territory ; and, finally, when such territory becomes the property of the Commonwealth in terms of the Constitution, it will be necessary for Parliament by formal Act to determine the Seat of Government within that area. </para>

Although the Prime Minister and the Premier of New South Wales had agreed that the Attorneys-General of the Commonwealth and State should confer to try to raise the issues and settle the matter between them, to the letter written by the Federal Attorney-General to the Attorney-General of New South Wales, no reply was received. The Premier of New South Wales then took the matter into his own hands again. Of course, I do not for a moment say that he did not do so with the full concurrence of his Attorney-General, but the correspondence between the Attorneys-General was continued no further. The Premier of New South Wales took up the matter again, and practically objected to our going on with any legislative proposals whatever. We were not in a position to take any steps which might properly raise the issues. We knew that, it was useless to drive in a peg, as that would determine nothitng. We proposed to pass an Act of Parliament which would authorize a survey of the Federal territory, and to call upon the New South Wales Government to grant that territory. Upon that an action for a declaration of right might have been made, and all the issues could be definitely settled. In this connexion I should like to read the concluding words of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wade&#39;s</inline> opinion - </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline>sent a letter dated 1st November, 1905, after the proposal that the two Attorneys-General should settle the issues, from which I quote the following paragraph: - </para>
                    <para>I cannot now assent on behalf of this State to any further Federal legislation to create a different situation in the face of the fact that the (negotiations between it and the Commonwealth had not reached the stage when they should be superseded by statutory enactment, setting aside the will or wish of one or other of the governing bodies that- stand in the position of negotiators. </para>
                    <para class="block">We were prepared to submit legislation to enable the issues to be brought before the High Court, but the Premier of New South Wales would consent to no legislation upon the matter. He desired to go back and re-open the whole of the negotiations, practically saying that in the negotiations on the part of the Commonwealth we were not to consider our selection of Dalgety as binding upon New South Wales or ourselves in any way. The Prime Minister wrote that the letter of the 3rd November, 1905, in reply, breaking off the correspondence, and indicating at that date the action that was likely to be taken. He said - </para>
                    <para>You have, however, passed by the suggestions we made, and declined to agree to the solution which, in deference to yourself, we offered. You nave preferred to repeat former arguments, and, above all, practically to claim the right of your State to control the constitutional action of the Parliament of Australia in determining a question which is essentially one requiring to be regarded not in the interest of one State only, but from the -stand-point of the whole Commonwealth. The claim cannot be admitted, but in closing this correspondence permit me to say that in the interests of New South Wales itself, as well as of every other State, this Government will invite Parliament to definitely determine the precise territory for the Federal capital. </para>
                    <para>We are doing that now. After that letter was written, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> wrote again, entering a protest against the negotiations being broken off, and the matter was finally summed up in a letter written by the Prime Minister on the15th November, 1905. He pointed out that the selection was only made after full inquiries, and then continued as follows : - </para>
                    <para>The representatives of your State, thoroughly well informed upon all the local circumstances to which you allude, place them, with many other contentions, before &#39;the Parliament in the amplest manner. </para>
                    <para>After hearing them fully, and after being urgently pressed by them to make its choice, Parliament declared its preference to the Dalgety district. Unfortunately, your Legislature, when subsequently passing, resolutions professedly preliminary to fresh negotiations with the Commonwealth, deliberately excluded that very district from consideration. </para>
                    <para>When those resolutions were forwarded to the late Minister of Home Affairs, he attempted to negotiate with you in respect of the area of the territory and its access to the sea, matters which were left undetermined in the Act of 1904; but no progress was made. In the correspondence with me you first proposed a reference to the High Court, next asked for some. act on the part of this Government which might be made a ground for action before that Court, and finally suggested a meeting of Attorneys-General to settle the terms of a Bill for that purpose. We found at last that our agreement to these proposals led to nothing. Indeed, when after the Conference of our Law Officers, we offered a fair and practical proposal, you ignored it and all that had passed between us. </para>
                    <para>Your one real contention, simply stated, is that the Act of 1904 must be repealed and a new site substituted. </para>

                    <para class="block">I have no wish to take up time unduly, but I am desirous of putting the matter clearly before honorable members&#39; I have shown, in the first place, that these sites were originally offered to us by the New South Wales Government j that the Government of that State approached us with the view that &#39;we, as the Federal Parliament, had a right to determine the site, and that all they had to do was to send the sites to us. After most complete investigation of all the sites, we fixed upon Dalgety for the Seat of Government. After the site for the Seat of Government; had been selected, our predecessors and ourselves honestly tried to open negotiations with the Government of New South Wales respecting the acquisition of the site, regarding the Statute as mandatory upon ourselves. When the issues were raised regarding the interpretation of the Constitution and the legal rights of New South Wales, we took up the attitude that we did not desire to do anything which would prevent&#39; the State of New South Wales having the legal issues properly raised before the High Court; but, at. the same time, we, as the guardians of the rights of the Federal Parliament under the Constitution, had to take such a stand as would preserve those rights intact. &#39; That was a duty intrusted to the Government of the Commonwealth, no matter who might be in power. We approached the matter in a friendly spirit, with no desire to indulge in suggestions of compulsion or threats. We negotiated in an open, frank way. expressing our readiness to raise all the legal issues which could be raised. When we attempted to do so we were blocked in our endeavours, and it is because we were not able to come to any agreement as to how the issues were to be raised that the duty devolved upon us, as the Government of the Commonwealth, to take steps to give effect to the expressed will of the Federal Parliament. That is what honorable members are being asked to do to-day </para>

                            <para>- I propose to go through the provisions of the Bill if the honorable member will permit me. I have already indicated that both in the opinion of the Attorney-General, and in the speech of the Prime Minister, it was announced that the next step the Federal Parliament would be asked to take would be to introduce a Bill to determine the territory in metes and bounds. It was at first thought that the procedure should be to introduce a Bill to enable a survey to be made in order that the technical boundaries might be discovered, and that when they had been ascertained, we could fix the territory within them as the territory for the Seat of Go&#62;vernment. We found that we could go a step further. We got <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scrivener</inline> from New South Wales to make a report. We asked him whether, from any information in his possession, he could give us such a technical description&#39; of the territory we required, as would obviate the necessity for an expensive survey, before we brought a Bill before the House. He has presented a report which I have had circulated amongst honorable members, and in it he defines, by metes and bounds, the territory of the Seat of Government, as honorable members will find it defined in this Bill. The Bill purposes to be a Bill for an Act - to determine more definitely the Seat of the Government of the Commonwealth in the neighbourhood of Dalgety. </para>

                            <para>- I think so, judging, by the tone of the correspondence. The Bill provides for the determination&#39; as the territory of the Commonwealth of the area described in the schedule, and it will be the duty of the Administration to endeavour to acquire that area. The Minister will be empowered, to obtain from the State a grant of it, and upon its acceptance it will become Federal territory, and be under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Parliament. It is also provided that additional territory may be acquired if, in the opinion of the Parliament, it is necessary for the purpose of obtaining an adequate water supply. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. District</inline> Surveyor Scrivener, who has investigated the matter, recommends that it would be desirable to acquire an area of 1,550 square miles, in order to preserve an absolutely pure water supply for the Seat of Government. We are not now asking Parliament to sanction the acquirement of a larger area than that originally provided for, but we ask it to sanction negotiations with the State of New South Wales for the acquirement of the larger area if that be thought necessary. The other provisions of the Bill are merely formal. The laws of the State are to continue to have effect within the territory until they are altered, and all the estates and interests held by the State in it will, on its transfer to the Commonwealth, be held bv the Commonwealth. All land, even that held in fee-simple, is, under English law, held from the Crown, and this provision merely substitutes the Commonwealth for the State as representing the Crown. </para>

                    <para class="block">The acquisition of the land which has been alienated to private holders can be brought about at a later date under clause 6. This Bill was framed before the New South Wales Parliament passed its resolutions last week, and is in harmony with the views stated by the Government in their correspondence with the Government of New South Wales. Parliament is asked to adhere to its decision as&#39; to the site of the territory, and to enable us to acquire it, though, of course, it is open to it to reconsider the matter in the light of the resolutions passed by the New South Wales Parliament. Still, I ask honorable members to recollect that we came to our decision after due deliberation, and I hope that we shall abide by it. We are not being asked to review the decision of a former Parliament, but to confirm our own decision. The Bill leaves it open to the State of New South Wales to raise any issues it desires to raise on a grant being asked for. It can raise them by an action for a declaration of rights. We do not ask Parliament to take from that State any constitutional right which she now possesses ; I ask honorable members not to approach the consideration of this measure in any spirit of antagonism, but to consider it fairly, in the interests of both New South Wales and the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- That is not so, though it might be objected that the Parliament of that State has not extended much consideration to us. We are deciding a verv momentous question in fixing for all time the Seat of the Commonwealth Government ; but, having settled that question, we shall have got rid of one of the greatest difficulties now besetting the Federation. Therefore, I a&#187;k that the measure may receive no carping criticism, and may be regarded from the point of view of the interests of the Commonwealth as a whole. I do not think&#34; the merits and demerits of the other sites which were proposed or suggested should now be discussed. Parliament has, on the advice of the best experts obtainable, determined on a certain site, and, though some of us individually have favoured other sites, we should now stand by that determination. I hope that when the matter is finally settled there will be built in the Federal territory a Federal Capital which will be an ornament to the Commonwealth and the source of inspiration of the true Federal feeling to Australia. </para>

I do not take exception to his speech, but I hope that it will be remembered that the representatives of New South. Wales have also the right to put the State view of the question. </para>

                            <para>- I intend to take this course, in order to avoid any display of feeling in connexion with the matter. I should regard it as the act of an enemy to New South Wales if one were to try to make any stronger the feeling which now exists. The matter must be considered as dispassionately, impartially, and impersonally as we can consider it. No doubt the language which has been used hitherto has created friction and contributed to delay. I regret the very strong language used by the Premier of New South Wales yesterday; but the language used in the Senate, which provoked his remarks, was equally strong and regrettable. Nothing could have been more unjust than many of the statements recently made in the Senate on this subject. So far as that is concerned, honours are at least even, so far as we are concerned, and we may very well dismiss from our minds that personal view of the case which, I fear, is colouring the consideration of this question at the present moment. </para>

                    <para class="block">It is well known that matters might have assumed a different aspect, both in this House and in. the other Chamber, had it not been &#34;for the feeling provoked, and for the personal considerations which have been allowed to influence honorable members. In justification for the Premier of New South Wales, I may point out that he is not the only Premier who has used strong language with regard to the Federal Parliament. Strange to say, however, his remarks alone have attracted serious attention. The Premier of Western Australia recently announced from the public platform that, unless full and fair consideration were given to the claims of the transcontinental railway, he would head a movement for the secession of that State from the Commonwealth. I think that that is an infinitely stronger statement than any uttered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers.</inline> Yet we did not hear a word about it from honorable members representing Western Australia, who have &#34; got their backs up&#34; with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> over the Capita&#93; Site question. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> specially begged of the New South Wales Assembly not to consider the question of secession at all. Furthermore, he declared that he would not countenance secession for a moment, but that his sole object was to make a firm and dignified protest against the action of the Commonwealth Parliament. When honorable members interjected, and suggested that he should head a secession movement, he immediately deprecated all reference to the subject. Not only! the Premier of Western Australia, but the Premier of Queensland has, from time to time, commented very strongly upon the action of this Parliament. Therefore, it is not fair for honorable members to give undue consideration to any language which may have been used by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers.</inline> We should eschew all feeling, and betake ourselves to a consideration of the merits of the case. I do not propose to make any charges or statements of a personal character. After all, personalities will not help us at all, and I deeply regret that, they should have already found entrance to this Parliament, and have coloured the :view of honorable members in considering this matter. In my judgment, we are not called upon, in our selection of the Capital Site, merely to placate <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> or the people of New South Wales. Our first duty is to make a selection which will honour the bond entered into with the State. It is not a question of placating any man in New South Wales. We can afford to ignore any such consideration as a triviality. It is our sacred duty to liberally interpret the bond entered into with New South Wales, and carry it out in the spirit as well as in the letter. The Minister, &#39; in introducing these proposals, went into the history of the matter. I do not propose to follow him, but not because a reply could not be made. The history of the case discloses that the initial mistake was made when <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John.</inline> See declined to take any responsibility in regard to the selection of the site. He certainly offered certain sites, and gave certain instructions, but when asked by this Parliament to assume the responsibility, which properly attached to him, he definitely declined to do so. Therefore, he must always stand charged with the complete abnegation of his Ministerial responsibility. We may credit him with having taken a mistaken view of his constitutional position, but it is clear that at the point to which I refer the negotiations took a &#39;wrong course. Moreover, when the instructions were issued to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Oliver</inline> to report upon certain sites prior to their being offered to the Commonwealth, the terms of the compact entered into at the Premiers&#39; Conference appear to have been completely lost sight of. They were, 9 however, recognised to the full in <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton&#39;s letters. In his first communication, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edmund</inline> Barton clearly and fully recognised the constitutional position. He asked &#34; if the State Premier would make offers of sites within territory within which the Capital is to be situated.&#34; Therein, I think that he took up the correct position. The question remains - &#34; What is the territory indicated by the Constitution within which the Capital Site may be situated?&#34; This brings us to the kernel of the whole position, and, had a fair interpretation been placed upon the Constitution at the time to which I have referred, the reports and offers which were made would not have been made. I have not been to see Dalgety or Tooma. I have steadily declined to be made a party to an investigation of these sites, because, in my judgment, neither of them comply with the bond entered into with New South Wales. It has always seemed to me to be a waste of time to consider sites which practically outrage the compact entered into between the States Premiers. I have inspected sites which I regard as eligible for selection within the terms of the bond, but I have not investigated other sites away on the border line of the State, because of the preliminary objection I have mentioned. Now, the Bill on its face recognises that the State of New South Wales has some rights. I venture to say that, when the Parliament passed the Seat of Government Act, many honorable members were not fully seized of the constitutional aspect of the question. They were certainly not fully seized of it in the light of the subsequent Conference of Premiers, and the explanations they gave. Therefore, I would ask honorable members not to consider that we have irrevocably selected a site at Dalgety. I hope that this House will always be able and willing to rectify a mistake. The Act we have already passed ought not to be regarded as unalterable. I thoroughly believe that honorable members have a sufficient sense of fairness and justice to amend the Act, if it can be shown that there are good grounds for doing so ; and I wish to address myself to the question of the original compact, in order 10 ascertain whether it has been observed by us. I have already stated that the Bill recognises that New South Wales has rights. The provisions of the Bill are conditioned all through upon a grant to be made by New South Wales. If the right to make a grant is recognised, we must also acknowledge the right of the State to have its opinion fully and freely expressed as to what grant shall be made. Further, if the State may make a grant, it mav also refuse to do so. Surely, the right to grant carries with it the right of refusal. If not, why should not the Bill be framed with a view to the acquirement of a site, with a view to empower the Minister to peg out the necessary territory. Unless New South Wales grants a site, the Bill will become an absolute dead letter. Even the acquirement of the territory is made conditional upon its being granted by New South Wales. This recognition of the right of New South Wales carries us a step further. The Bill in itself becomes a perfectly idle proposal, so far as the establishment of the Capital is concerned. The New South Wales Government have specifically declined, to make the grant of Federal territory spoken of in the Bill, and in view of that fact, is it not idle for the Government &#39; 10 introduce this measure, with a view to the settlement of this very important question? Reverting to the utterances of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> on this question, now that the Western Australian members are present, I would point out that when we hear Other Premiers in Australia openly advocating secession, we need not attach so much importance to the language of the Premier of New South&#39; Wales. </para>

                            <para>- Then I will say that a member of this Parliament is reported by the press to have stated that he will not reconsider this question until <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> has apologized. That, I contend, is a ridiculous attitude to take up. It is absurd to urge that the language 0? any one man should influence us in the slightest degree in dealing with this very important matter. Here is what the Premier of Western Australia said upon the public platform a little while ago: - </para>

If he failed, it might possibly be his duty to come before his constituents and ask them - and ask the people of Western Australia - whether, having tried all other means in their power to obtain justice, and having failed, it would be advisable to cut adrift, and run their own boat as he thought they ought to. </para>

                            <para>- I do not say that. Of course, this Bill does not completely exhaust our powers. It is an attempt to define them, and all the powers which it contains are conditioned by this precedent grant on the part of New South Wales. That is a dear recognition that New South Wales has rights, and, therefore, that she has a right of refusal as well as of agreement. </para>

                            <para>- I think that she has. At any rate, she has exercised it and exercised it, apparently, to the disgust of a large number of members of this Parliament. If New South Wales has a right to make a grant of territory, surely she has an equal right to refuse to make that grant? The exercise of that right of refusal ought not to subject her to the evident feeling which has been provoked in this Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- That is not so. The question of whether she has a duty to grant must be referable to the terms of the Constitution. Everything depends upon how we read the Constitution in the last resort. The Minister of Home Affairs pointed out that the See Government made certain proposals, and submitted certain offers. The answer to his statement is that the present Parliament of New South Wales has repudiated everything which that Government did. The members of that Government have been scattered as a Government. They did not, in my judgment, represent the opinion of New South Wales upon this matter, and consequently it is idle to quote what they did. Then we have been told that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers</inline> himself offered Dalgety as la site. That is to say, he sought to induce the New South Wales Parliament to include it in the list of sites which were offered. I should think that that fact evidences his <inline font-style="italic">bona fides</inline> in this matter, rather than condemns him. He showed that he desired to give the Commonwealth Parliament the widest possible choice of the Federal Capital. He favoured the inclusion of Dalgety, but was overruled by the New South Wales Parliament. In considering this matter, we should recollect that we are not dealing with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers,</inline> except as the mouth-piece of the Parliament. The position is that the Commonwealth Parliament is dealing with the Parliament of New South Wales, and we ought to keep that fact in view. </para>

                            <para>- There is no point in it. The Minister himself voted against Dalgety, and favoured the selection of Lyndhurst. Yet we now find him a resolute champion of the claims &#39;of Dalgety. In dealing with this question, we ought to entirely set aside the personal views of honorable members, and regard it only from the stand-point of the relations of one Parliament to another. I think the Attorney-General will admit that New South Wales has a&#39; right to the fulfilment of the compact. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. Then let us see what the bond is. In this connexion, I do not propose to confine myself to the mere terms of the Constitution. I think that we should take into consideration whatever will throw light upon the Constitution, and upon the intention of its framers. Believing that those who made the bargain are its best and most accurate interpreters, I naturally turn to the interpretation which was put upon section 125 by the Premiers of the States, immediately after their Conference had concluded. </para>

Those who entered into it said that the Capital should be not less than 100 miles from Sydney, and I hold that the clear inference is that the selection of any suitable site outside that100-mile limit, but as near to it as possible, would be in strict compliance with the terms of the bond. Some regard should be paid to the wishes of New South Wales in the selection of a site outside that prescribed area. </para>

                            <para>- It is a State as well as a Commonwealth matter. The question is whether we are going to honour the terms of that bond and depart from the spirit of it. We have the best test of the spirit of the bond in the declaration of the signatories to it that the site is to be a reasonable distance from Sydney. May I put this point to the Attorney-General ? Supposing it had been decided to place the Capital in Victoria, within a reasonable distance from Melbourne. </para>

                            <para>- I find that the furthest distance by rail from Melbourne to the Adelaide border is about 286 miles. On the other hand, Dalgety is 330 miles from Sydney. Would the Attorney-General regard it as being within a reasonable distance of Melbourne if the Capital was placed on that border? That is the parallel. No Victorian would regard the Capital as being fixed within a reasonable distance of Melbourne if it were put on the South Australian border, and yet, if it were, it would still be 50 miles nearer to Melbourne than Dalgety is to Sydney. </para>

                            <para>- If, in the circumstances I have named, the people of Victoria would not regard the establishment of the Capital on the South Australian border as being in accordance with the bond, neither should New South Wales regard its establishment at an even greater distance from Sydney as honouring the bond. It is strange how the Commonwealth Parliament interprets the language of the bond in its own favour and as against the real interests of New South Wales. The Constitution declares that the Capital shall be not less than 100 miles from Sydney, and we say, therefore, that it should be erected 300 miles from Sydney ; it declares that the Federal territory shall be an area of not less than 100 square miles, therefore we say it shall be an area of 900 square miles. In other words, we say that the territory shall be nine times as great as that for which the Constitution provides, and that the Capital shall be three times further from Sydney than is required by the Constitution. Although that may be observing the letter of the compact, in my judgment it is departing grievously from the spirit of it, the intention being that it should represent a substantial concession to New South Wales. That is the view I take of this bargain, and what it means. Those who made it should be the men to interpret it. The Premiers of all the States place upon it the interpretation that the Capital is to be within a reasonable distance of Sydney. </para>

                            <para>- He was speaking purely of the Capital Site. I am pointing out the interpretation which those two honorable gentlemen placed upon the agreement when they were seeking to induce the people of New South Wales to enter the bond. That is the best way of getting at the meaning of what was understood at the time by the people who were most concerned in making the compact, and upon the faith of which New South Wales eventually adopted the Constitution, and became a constituent part of the Commonwealth. I shall content myself with that reference, because I do not believe in labouring the matter in so small a House, and when there is such an evident inclination to close the session and get away. &#39; But I do submit that it ought to receive very much more serious attention than it appears to be getting at the hands of this Parliament. We have had hardly a quorum, either during the delivery of the Minister&#39;s speech, or since that time, and apparently not very much interest is taken in this great question of fixing for all time the Seat of Government for Australia. According to the terms of the agreement, Dalgety is out of the running as a site &#39; for the ultimate location of the Federal capital. Being 300 odd miles from Sydney, it is much further from there than is any point connected by railway from Melbourne. Therefore, it cannot be said to be in the heart of the State, and a substantial concession thereto. </para>

If these magnificent sites are in the terms of the bond by all means let us get the best of them, but the condition should be - does the site comply with the bargain entered into originally ? </para>

Suppose that the Treasurer had agreed to put the capital in Victoria, as he did in New South Wales, would he have considered that it was a reasonable distance from Melbourne within that State, and as containing a substantial advantage and concession thereto, if it were placed on the South Australian border? </para>

                            <para>- No, for the simple reason that all places within 100 miles of Sydney are shut out. By the same reasoning, if the site is to be within a reasonable distance of Sydney, such places as Dalgety are shut out. We have not to consider&#39; whether a site is a preferable one as such, but whether it is a good and adequate one, complying with the solemn agreement made with New South Wales. I do not wish to labour this matter, but I want to know what this precious Bill is going to do for us. I cannot see that it will take us one step further forward. </para>

I can see infinite possibilities of delay, but I cannot see the possibility of a settlement which would be satisfactory, and which would continue harmonious relations between State and Commonwealth. The Treasurer has blurted out the truth again in his usual blunt fashion. &#39;He says that the Government of New South Wales will have to wait a bit if they do not agree to make the grant in accordance with this Bill. That may be the intention, but I venture to say that statements of that character will not tend to improve the feeling in New South Wales. They will not take us one step more forward in the final and just consideration of this question. This Bill is, I think, a good deal weaker than is the Act. By the latter, we authorized the Government to acquire territory for a Federal Capital. This Bill does not do anything of that kind. It says - </para>

                            <para>- It is many hundreds of miles from Sydney. A site within a reasonable distance cannot be said to be one three or four times as far away as it need be. That is not the way we usually express ourselves when we make a bargain. When we fix a limit we mean to do something as near to that limit as possible. I shall not pursue this matter further. I am afraid that the House is in no mood seriously to consider the subject today. I regret it extremely. I should have liked to see a serious attempt made during the closing hours of this session to settle the question. The way in which this question of the Federal Capital Site has been left over to be the last item in the programme of the Government &#39;is one of the most regrettable features of the whole session. It does not show much indication of a desire on the part of the Government, so far as I can see, to deal with this matter, which so profoundly affects the relations of one-third of this Commonwealth to the rest of its people. I see no evidence of a genuine desire on the part of the Government to settle the matter in any way which will be at all satisfactory to the State which I have the honour to represent. I admit that every State has rights. I concede that to the full ; but I say that those States rights are all embodied in the bond. The to demand that that bond shall be carried into full and complete execution is one which is inherent in the State of New South Wales. And that, I take it, is what has been asserted by the Parliament of that State. It has made a respectful protest, repudiating any notion of secession. In as respectful a way as is open to it, it has expressed its view, as representing the State,; claiming the carrying into effect of the bond on the faith of which it entered into this Federation. </para>

                    <para>Mr.FRAZER (Kalgoorlie).- In commencing, I must congratulate the deputy-leader of the Opposition on the address which he has delivered. His intention has evidently been to induce honorable members to be conciliatory in regard to the question. After the experience we have had, one can feel a certain amount of satisfaction that the honorable member has at last adopted a conciliatory spirit. I quite agree that in the consideration of a matter so important to the interests of the Commonwealth and to the State of New South Wales, we should manifest as much of a conciliatory spirit as possible. I wish to refer first to the contrast attempted to be made by the deputy leader of the Opposition between the remarks of the Premier of Western Australia- </para>

But the Premier of New South Wales has resolutely and determinedly said that the question shall not be settled in accordance with the wishes of this Parliament.

Imagine Western Australia quibbling over such a question! There can be no possible contrast between the two positions. </para>

                            <para>- That may not have been the honorable member&#39;s intention, but&#39; such an interpretation might be placed upon what he has done. I regretted that in New South Wales the other day an attack was made upon the integrity of that tribunal, the constitution of which I hold to be the best act of the Commonwealth Parliament up to the present time ; and I deprecate any action that might possibly be supposed to influence that tribunal, in the event of a deci-&#39; sion having to be given by it upon this important question. I listened with considerable interest to the statement of the Minister of Home Affairs in moving the second reading of the Bill. What is the position? It appears to me that there has been an absolute reversal of form in New South Wales. The State Premier for the time being, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> See, definitely offered to this Commonwealth the choice of three sites. At a subsequent date he made another offer - that, in the event of either of those sites not being accepted, his Government would be prepared to give consideration to a request for other sites. In another communication, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> See absolutely declined, in the name of the people of New South Wales, to select a site. That action cast upon this Parliament the responsibility of taking a certain action. Parliament selected a site. But another Premier has come into office in New South Wales, and an attempt has been made by him to refuse to this Parliament the right to select a site. I can see no possible justification for Parliament altering its previous decision. As a justification for the reversal of form of the New South Wales authorities, a document has been put forward to-day in relation to the conference of States Premiers. This document has been printed by the Parliament of New South Wales. </para>

I remind the House that if the honorable member for Kalgoorlie chooses to say that a substantial alteration was made in the document to which he refers, he has a right to say so; and if other honorable members choose to say that there has been no substantial alteration, they are at liberty to explain their point of view in subsequent speeches. But these continual interjections interrupt the thread of the honorable member&#39;s speech. I must ask that they may cease. </para>

I have investigated this question, and I know that the first proposal was that the Capital should be within Australia, and that the next proposal was that it should be within the State of New South Wales. There was still some objection, and then came the third proposal of the Premiers&#39; Conference. This was the view of the Premiers - </para>

                            <para>- But a limit of 100 miles was not sufficient in the opinion of the Premiers, as shown by the words &#34; at a reasonable distance from that city.&#34; And when the context of the resolution is taken into account, no other interpretation is possible, although the fact that the words I have just quoted are placed in italics, is calculated to convey another and a false impression to the cursory observer. Of course, we cannot say what was in the minds of the Premiers at that time, though we know that the present leader of the Opposition never raised any particular objection to the proposal. Indeed, the question was never raised until some honorable members, who are opposed to the selection of the Dalgety site, began to look around for some justification for an attempt to obtain a reversal of the decision of Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- Probably Tooma may be selected if the decision as to Dalgety is reversed. It is pretty well known that a number of honorable members are desirous to substitute Lake George for Dalgety. I have supported Dalgety all through the negotiations, and I see no reason to alter my attitude. What has occurred to justify us in humiliating ourselves so far as to reverse a decision deliberately arrived at after mature consideration ? </para>

                            <para>- We shall no doubt have the pleasure of hearing the honorable member for Illawarra on the question. The honorable member for Parramatta has advanced no substantial reason why we should reverse our decision. We are placed in the position of having to say definitely and decisively whether we shall depart from our previous determination simply because some State Premier is dissatisfied with the conditions. My own opinion is that the Premier of New South Wales will be satisfied with&#39; nothing short of our giving that State the right to select the site. </para>

                            <para>- New South Wales has distinctly refused to allow the Commonwealth Parliament to select the site we particularly desire; and what does that indicate, except that New South Wales is not prepared to accept the decision of the Commonwealth Parliament? And it may reasonably be supposed that the alternative is that the New South Wales Parliament desires to make the selection. The opinions held by the Opposition on this question are not the opinions held some little time ago by their leader, the -right honorable member for East Sydney. I am prepared to admit that gentleman&#39;s capacity for finding justification for the reversal of a vote or any other change of front, but in a matter of this kind he may be expected to adhere to his opinions, for, at any rate, a few months. The right honorable member for East Sydney, speaking on the 15th December, 1904, on this question, said that &#34;if the provisions of the Constitution were carried out loyally&#34; on both sides - the Federal Capital will be established in New South Wales at no distant date, but, just as it is possible for the Federal Parliament in its treatment of the subject to so act that there will be no Capital in New South Wales within a reasonable time, it is possible for the Government and Parliament of New South Wales to so act that there will be no Federal Capital in New South Wales within a reasonable time, unless we have an inherent right to select the capital by our own will. That is a question of serious importance, which I hope will never have to be considered. </para>

                        <para>. - As I explained yesterday, these Supplementary Estimates represent the ordinary expenditure and the expenditure on additions, new works, and buildings, in excess of the appropriations for the years 1903-4 and 1904-5, the money for which has been obtained out of the Treasurer&#39;s advance. The expenditure in excess for 1903-4 was ,&#163;6,768 for ordinary departmental expenditure, and for additions, new works, and buildings, &#163;490., making a total of &#163;7,258. The excess for 1904-5 was &#163;84,414 for ordinary expenditure, and for new works &#163;52,527, or a total of &#163;136,941.. Honorable members will understand that these votes represent what in some States are called Excess Bills, and are the. amounts expended in excess of the votes included in the Appropriation Acts for the years named. Under our system, an advance of &#163;200,000 is given to the Treasurer, and these amounts have been expended on his authority out of that advance. In making this advance to the Treasurer, Parliament has been careful to direct that it is given to enable him to make advances to the public Departments, to meet expenditure the particulars of which will afterwards be included in a parliamentary appropriation. This is very desirable, as it compels the Treasurer to account to this House for all sums he has expended out of the advance granted to him. Expenditure from the Treasurer&#39;s advance is perfectly legal, but it is our rule that there should be a second appropriation of the items. If Parliament so desired, that might be avoided by the adoption of other means; but still the practice in this Parliament and in the Parliaments of the States is that every item expended out of the Treasurer&#39;s advance, or whatever the fund may be called, shall be submitted for the approval of Parliament. As I said yesterday, it is rather late in the day to ask parliamentary approval of expenditure which took place in 1903-4; but I believe this necessity has arisen through some inadvertence. Honorable members are aware that all this expenditure took place before the present Government came into office, and they are therefore not in &#39;any way responsible for it. I believe that it was all jus* titled, and I shall be glad to give any information which honorable members may desire in regard to any particular item ir&#187; these Estimates. </para>

                            <para>- I have .glanced through the items cursorily, and I can find nothing that is not ordinarily included in supplementary votes. One really has to take matters largely upon trust from the Government at the fag end of the session. Measures are thrown before us without the slightest time for consideration, and there appears to be nothing left for us to do but to agree to or reject them. I take the Treasurer&#39;s assurance that the items included in these Estimates are the ordinary items of expenditure usually appearing in&#62; supplementary votes. </para>

                        <para>. - In reply to the honorable gentleman, I may say that there has been expenditure under this heading, by the Barton Government and by the late Government. The expenditure included in this vote was by the late Government. The rule followed by all Governments, almost since the beginning of the Commonwealth, has been that salaried Ministers do not charge any expenses except for transport. Hotel bills and personal expenses of all kinds are defrayed by Ministers from their private purses. But when honorary. Ministers are requested to go to distant places on duty, it is unreasonable to expect that they should pay their own expenses. A small amount is therefore allowed to cover their actual expenses. The amount here set down is only , &#163;18. There is very little expended under this head, but it is quite unreasonable to expect honorary Ministers to follow the same rule as that which is followed by salaried Ministers. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable member overlooks the fact that this vote does not apply to salaried Ministers. If a Minister holding an honorary appointment, in order that better representation might be given to his State in the Cabinet, has to travel to that State on public business, it is unreasonable that he should be called upon to pay hotel bills and other travelling expenses. It should be borne in mind that the amount granted as travelling expenses to Ministers is always largely exceeded, as they are called upon to pay tips and such expenses which do not appear in hotel bills. I presume that the amount here set down covers only the mere hotel bills and such expenses, and I consider the item a reasonable one. </para>

                            <para>- I hope that this Government will avoid making any engagements of this kind. It seems that several months&#39; notice was required to terminate the arrangement with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Plummer,</inline> which was made by the Reid Government. , I do not know what position <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Plummer</inline> occupied in Sydney, but I believe that he was of some considerable service to some honorable members of the Opposition. I have heard and read a good deal about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Plummer,</inline> and it seems extraordinary that an arrangement should have been entered into with him, which could not be terminated without giving several months&#39; notice. I have read some of his letters, which were as heavy as lead, and were not written even in an attractive journalistic style. I think we ought to have some information with regard to this matter. </para>

                        <para>- The remarks of the honorable member show how critics are made. If you are going to criticise anything effectively you require, first of all, to know nothing about it. The honorable member was not aware of the period over which the Hobart Conference extended, and he did not know anything as to the amount of printing that was done in connexion with it. But he had no hesitation in stating that the work could not have cost more than <inline font-style="italic">&#163;30</inline> or &#163;40. </para>

A small amount of work may have been done in Victoria, but the main part of the printing was carried out in Tasmania. Proofs had to be furnished day by day as the Conference proceeded, and subsequently a condensed report was issued, and copies were distributed in considerable numbers to all the States concerned. </para>

The Tasmanian Government have only a small unofficial <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> staff, and its members were engaged on some other work. The secretaries were made use of, and whilst they are excellent officers, they are not as good shorthand writers as are men who are always engaged in reporting work. They had frequently to work until 1 o&#39;clock, or 2 o&#39;clock in the morning, and were paid for the extra demands made upon their services.

The appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Plummer</inline> was made in view of the opinions that had been expressed in Parliament from time to time that it was desirable that some one should communicate to the British press matters of interest relating to Commonwealth affairs. Some one from one of the States had to be appointed, and, so far as I know, no influence was brought to bear in favour of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Plummer.

                        <para>- There is one matter that I desire to bring under the notice of the Government. Recently I was present in the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales, when the resolution in regard to the Federal Capital site was submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers.</inline> Upon that occasion, I heard a great deal of criticism directed against this Parliament, and in the course of conversation with members of the Legislature of that State I learned that one of their grievances is that a large quantity of printing which has hitherto been done in Sydney has been removed to Melbourne. They allege for example that the printing of the <inline font-style="italic">Postal Guide,</inline> and of the telephone exchange books, as well as a considerable amount of printing in connexion with military and others matters has been taken away from the Sydney Government Printing Office, and is now being carried out in Melbourne. I should like to know whether there is any justification for these statements, and, if so, what are the reasons underlying the action of the Government. </para>

                        <para>- I wish to direct attention to the constant appearance in our Estimates of items relating to law costs incurred by the Customs Department. At an early stage in the history of this Parliament the Department found itself troubled by a number of useless officers, and, instead of getting rid of them in accordance with the law, the Minister of the day, in an autocratic manner, dismissed them. Naturally they enforced their rights, and the Department was mulcted in heavy damages. Some lack) of supervision is evidenced in the Department by the way in which law costs are continually being piled up. More care should be exercised in this connexion, or the head of the Department should be given a strong hint that it is undesirable that any action should be taken which would land the Department in legal expenses. </para>

                        <para>. - I would point out to the honorable member that before gratuities are sanctioned by the Government, the States interested are always consulted. In the matter of the gratuity to the widow of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. N.</inline> E. Knight, the Government of Western Australia was consulted, and I believe that that State paid nearly the whole of the amount. Consequently the Commonwealth funds are not charged with it. I do not know the facts connected with the other two gratuities, which total about &#163;13. </para>

                            <para>- Quite so; but I think that it can properly be discussed at this stage. I think that the gratuity is a ridiculously small one to grant to the widow and family of a man who lost his life while fitting himself to defend his country. As the Minister representing the Minister of Defence in this House is not present, I hope that the Treasurer will convey to him what I am sure is the unanimous opinion of the Committee, that substantial compensation shall be paid to the bereaved wife. </para>

                        <para>- In connexion with the item relating to the Commandant of the New South Wales Military Forces, I would point out that a few months ago General Gordon made a speech, from which the inference might have been drawn that other defence schemes were not very satisfactory, but that he had one which would save the Commonwealth. It certainly conveyed the inference that neither Major-General Hutton nor the Military Board, nor even the honorable and learned member for Corinella, knew very much about defence matters, but that General Gordon was thoroughly conversant with&#39; them. For about a fortnight after this the people were breathlessly awaiting a statement as to his scheme; but, although the Minister of Defence has been questioned in regard to it, the scheme is not yet forthcoming. Are we to understand that General Gordon is reserving it either for the use of some other country, or in connexion with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carruthers&#39;</inline> secessionist movement in New&#39; South Wales? He is the Commandant, of that State. It is not long since the State Commandant of Victoria said that he looked not to the Commonwealth, but to the State, Government as his employers. Will the Minister promise that General Gordon&#39;s scheme will be produced ? </para>

                            <para>- I desire also to make some observations in regard to the question of false information supplied to this House by officials of the Defence Department. Any one who has had any experience of that Department knows how it attempts to resort to bluffing tactics. The less information it can supply, in answer to questions, to this House the better its officials are pleased. For example, seven out of about ten answers made in reply to a question which I put in regard to the consecration of banners were absolutely false. Some time ago I pointed out that men at Drysdale were working on ah obsolete gun. which would be of no service in time of war, and I was informed that there were four guns at Queenscliff which had been thrown out of use by General Hutton, inasmuch as the Government would not supply him with sufficient cordite. I &#39;wrote a letter, which is on record, in reply to which it was stated that there were no guns that were not supplied with full ammunition. That letter ig also on record. But, at a meeting held in Geelong, the officer commanding the Garrison Artillery there stated that there were four guns at Queenscliff, which, for the reason I have stated, could not be used. I then put a question to the Minister in regard to the matter, and in my absence yesterday he read a report in which it was stated that there were four guns at Queenscliff for which a sufficient supply of cordite was not forthcoming, and that, therefore, they had been reserved. That reply, given at a time when the Department apparently was taken off its guard, is in striking contrast with the previous statement, and I think that we shall have to endeavour during the recess to have this, matter dealt with. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. MAHON</inline>(Coolgardie). - It appears that in the matter of gratuities, each State is allowed to carry out . its own special view, and that whilst owing to the liberality of the Government of Western Australia, several gratuities have been granted in that State, none are conceded in the others. A couple of years ago, the present Minister of Home Affairs brought under notice a case in which an officer of the Postal Department was killed by the fall of a pole, and pointed out that a proportion of the wages due to him at the time of his death was actually retained by the Department to pay his funeral expenses. In view of such an incident, it seems to me that it is time that the Government determined to lay down a general principle for the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- But surely it was the refinement of cruelty to refuse compensation to the man&#39;s mother.. Whenever a proposal to do justice to some unfortunate individual in the Public Service is brought forward, the bookkeeping section is invariably hurled at us. I do not think that the bookkeeping section of the Constitution places any obstacle in the way of the Government devising a scheme by which all cases, regardless of the State in which they occur, will be treated alike. I find in this proposed vote an item of &#163;200 to the widow of a Western Australian officer who, as a matter of -fact, did not die in the discharge of his duty. On the other hand, the public servant in Queensland to whom I have referred sacrificed his life in the execution of his duty, and nothing was done for his family. I know of another extreme case which occurred in Victoria. A sorter in the General Post Office, who had served in that capacity for about thirty years, and was a very conscientious man, broke down in health, and was retired on a pension of &#163;75 per annum. About nine months after his retirement he died, and instead of the Government granting his widow compensation, computed on the leave to which he would have been entitled at the end of his period of service, they actually cut her down to the few pounds which were due to her husband at the time of his death. The difference was only a matter of &#163;25 or &#163;30. It was an act such as might be expected from a mean private employer. Apparently every advantage is taken of an opportunity to cut down the claims of poor people. When this matter was brought under the notice of the Department, the answer was that, because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bent</inline> would not agree to an arrangement, it could not give the widow an increased amount. I am expected to go down on my hands and knees to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bent,</inline> and ask him to grant this little concession, when the Department belongs to the Commonwealth, and is entirely under the control of Parliament. This is a most extraordinary state of affairs, and it is about time that the Government found out a guiding principle, and followed it in all such cases. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. JOSEPH</inline>COOK (Parramatta).Will the Attorney-General inform the House what business is to be taken on Monday? Are we to proceed with the further consideration of the Seat of Government Bill ? I should like to urge upon the honorable gentleman the importance of proceeding with that measure as soon as possible, in view of the intended early departure from Melbourne of many honorable members who are anxiously concerned about the measure. Many of us are desirous of proceeding with it, in order that a decision may be arrived at. It appears to me that there is no other business on the notice-paper that is nearly as important, and as to which it is so necessary that the full sense of the House should be taken. I hope that an announcement will be made that the discussion on the measure will be allowed to proceed at the earliest possible moment. Measures like the Copyright Bill ought not to be pushed on in front of it. It is not treating the question fairly. I therefore ask the Attorney-General whether the Government will not strain a point in order that we may be better able to dispose of the Bill to which I have referred. </para>

                        <para>- I spoke to the Prime Minister before he was compelled to leave the House, about the business to be taken on Monday. He then informed me that he proposed to take the Copyright Bill as the first business on Monday morning, with a view to having an interval in the debate on the Seat of Government question, in order that honorable members might take advantage of the opportunity to think over the speeches delivered to-day. </para>

                            <para>- They do not expect to be back again during the remainder of the session, unless they are summoned in connexion with very important business. It is not giving fair treatment to this very important question if it is not dealt with in a full House. As the honorable member for Bland says, it is the fault of honorable members if they are away ; still many honorable members had made arrangements in anticipation that the session would have closed by this time. The longer the consideration of the Bill is delayed, the fewer honorable members will be present to attend to it, and the less time there will be. </para>

                        <para>- I think that the honorable member who has just resumed his seat has furnished very good reasons why the further consideration of the Seat of Government Bill should be postponed until next session. I wish also to enter my emphatic protest against the manner in which business is being conducted in this House. It seems to me that the sittings and adjournments are being arranged so as to suit the convenience of some Government supporters and a few members of the Opposition without any regard whatever to the convenience of the great bulk of members of the House. Their interests and arrangements are absolutely ignored. Fair play, not only to members, but to the attendants, the officers, and everybody who is obliged to attend meetings of the House, justifies some protest against the length of the sittings this week. We have been sitting here since Monday, on an average of fourteen hours per day. We have had Estimates brought under consideration this afternoon without the responsible Ministers being in their places to answer questions. </para>

                            <para>- I trust my emaciation is not equal to that of the honorable member. If this state of things is continued much longer it will be easier to find a quorum of members in the Melbourne Hospital than in this Chamber. Instead of sitting fourteen hours a day, why not resume the business of Parliament a month after Christmas? Where is the need for ending the session before Christmas? Why should we resort to the old Victorian practice of meeting in May and sitting throughout the winter months, when it would be much more convenient to meet at the end of February and continue our business until it was finished. It is about time that the present absurd practice was discontinued. It may suit certain parties, but I am satisfied that it is inconvenient to the bulk of honorable members. We are sent to our electorates during the extreme summer and detained in Melbourne during the extreme winter. Why should this arbitrary line be drawn? It is a scandalous thing that this Parliament should have kept its members, its officers, and all who have to do with its proceedings fourteen hours a day on six days a week. The Opposition must understand that I am not blaming the Government entirely for what has occurred. The chief responsibility rests with the Opposition. I believe that, notwithstanding their statements, they are even now attempting to dodge the settlement of the Federal Capital question as far as possible. </para>

                            <para>- Is it fair, I ask, at this late period of the session, that we should be asked, with fagged minds and bodies, to settle matters of importance like the Capital Site - a matter which will affect generations of Australians for all time? Is it fair that we should be asked to make an important change in the law, such as is involved in the Patents Bill and the Copyright Bill under such circumstances? I think it is nothing short of indecency for any Government to throw Bills so full of disputatious matter before the House at such a time. If honorable members desire that Parliament should prorogue before Christmas, let it be prorogued; but there are honorable members, including myself, who are determined that the business before us shall be fairly considered. The Copyright Bill, the Patents Bill, and the Seat of Government Bill, are measures which, under other circumstances, would occupy the attention of the House for at least five or six weeks, and they ought not to be rushed through in a day or a day and a half. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to indorse the remarks of honorable members in regard to the desirability of continuing the consideration of the Seat of Government Bill, without the intervention of other business. I further desire to add my protest to that of other honorable members against the indecent haste with which legislation is being dealt with - haste which amounts to nothing less than a scandal to the country. This afternoon, in the course of a few minutes, we have voted immense sums of money, without having had time to look into the items of expenditure, and without being able to obtain information, owing to the absence of Ministers in the charge of certain Departments. Reference has been made by the honorable and learned member for Corio to the false character of some of the answers to questions put by honorable members and to attempts on the part of officers of Departments to bluff Ministers in this connexion in reference to Departmental matters. An instance of this was brought under my notice only this week. It will be remembered that I asked some questions in reference to alleged sweating in the New South Wales Post Office, and&#39; also in, regard to hours of labour and leave. Certain answers were given which, I have been informed, were absolutely contrary to fact at the time the questions were asked. For instance, I am credibly informed that, after the question in relation to leave had appeared on the business-paper, certain officers were granted leave, and then the answer given made it appear that there was no ground of complaint. </para>

                            <para>- If my information be correct, it shows there has been a deliberate attempt to mislead the House. It is customary at Christmas time to employ temporary hands in the Sydney Post Office, in order to cope with the extra work; but I am informed that this year little telegraph messengers from suburban offices, who receive 10s. a week, are called in ; and, although I am credibly informed that some of them are scarcely big enough to reach the stamping tables, they are required to drag heavy baskets, and., generally, to do the work of men. All this is done in order to save the few paltry pounds which would be involved by the engagement of the usual temporary assistance. I am sure that the Postmaster-General has no sympathy with that kind of thing, and I hope that he will do his best to prevent it becoming a practice, and to stop it if the practice has already been initiated. </para>

                        <para>- I desire to call the attention of the Postmaster-General to a matter which affects municipalities. If a new municipality arises, and the telegraph posts then in use interfere with the alignment of the streets, the cost of removing the posts has, according to the Post and Telegraph Act, to be borne entirely by the local body. If such a municipality could be consulted as to the original position of the posts, the present practice might be a fair one, and I can quite see that if the Department were called upon to pay the whole of the cost. some municipalities might cause unnecessary removals. I have in my mind Victoria Park, a rapidly rising suburb of Perth, and there the muncipality, which is struggling under the expense of establishing a new local body, feel it a great hardship that they should be put to this cost. I do not suggest that the Post and Telegraph Act should in this particular be entirely repealed; but I ask the Postmaster-General to endeavour to arrive at some more equitable arrangement. </para>

There is no reason whatever why the Patents Bill and the Price and Bayly Bill should not be easily disposed of, and thus leave only the Copyright Bill before the Capital Sites Bill. As to the observations of the honorable member for Parramatta concerning the absence of honorable members, it has been well known for a considerable time past that the Government have resolved to proceed with the determination of the Capital Site question this session. The question, as I understand it, is one, the consideration of which will take very little time, namely, how best to effectuate quickly the existing determination of Parliament. When we hear honorable members like the honorable member for Parramatta complaining that we do not proceed with that business at once, I should like to say that it was certainly with the acquiescence, and, I believe, to a large extent at the suggestion, of the Opposition that the debate was adjourned to-day until a later period. </para>

We think also that, as some honorable members have made arrangements - and it is well known that they have done so - which will render it impossible for them to be here until Tuesday, it is only right that the final determination of the question should not be arrived at until that day. It is known that certain honorable members have made arrangements to be here on Tuesday for that purpose. </para>

                            <para>- It would therefore be unfair to rush to a determination of the question on Monday. There is no reason why we should not have the matter sufficiently forward to enable us to arrive at a conclusion this session in both Houses of the Parliament with regard to the delimitation of the Federal Capital Site. Some observations have been made as to the absence of Ministers when expenditure incurred by their Departments has been under consideration ; but I should like it to be understood that the financial measures brought forward by the Treasurer to-day related to the transactions of past Governments only. They were introduced merely in order to put on a legal basis what previous Governments had done, and they have no reference whatever to the administration of the members of the present Government. There was, therefore, no necessity for members of the present Government to be present to explain any of the votes, and if any of them required explanation, honorable members who were members of the late Administration should have been here for that purpose. </para>
