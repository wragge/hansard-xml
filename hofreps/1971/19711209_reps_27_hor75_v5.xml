I have not seen the film. I was unable to be at its premiere in Ballarat last Friday. The honourable member for Ballarat and his wife, who is a prominent member of the Council for the Arts and who knows some of the background to this matter, attended that premiere. I am disturbed to hear the matters raised by the honourable member. I do know that the film has been given a &#39;M&#39; rating by the censor which means that children if accompanied by their parents will be able to see it. In view of the matters raised by the honourable member, I certainly will convey his comments to the  Chairman  of the Australian Council for the Arts and the  Chairman  of the Australian Film Development Corporation. As soon as I receive a report from them, I shall convey it to the honourable member. </para>

            <para>-Order! There is far too much audible conversation in the chamber. I have had to appeal to the House on 3 occasions this morning on this matter. If this continues in future. I will request honourable members individually to cease these loud conversations. Complaints have come from my right that Ministers are unable to hear questions asked by honourable members. This has occurred on 2 occasions this week. I think that it is a reflection on the conduct of honourable members in this House. I would suggest to honourable members that, if they must speak, they should speak in soft tones. I ask the honourable member for Gellibrand to repeat his question. </para>

I will certainly look at this matter. However, the honourable gentleman will be aware that this is a policy matter and that, therefore, I cannot give a precise answer. 1 will look into the matter and bring it to the attention of my Department. </para>

In an endeavour to persuade manufacturers to produce cigarettes with a lower tar content, will the Treasurer consider providing a sliding scale of excise duties so that those brands which have the lowest tar content will attract the lowest rates of duty? If the answer is in the affirmative, will he take into consideration both the gain to revenue from excise duty on cigarettes and the cost to the taxpayer of providing medical treatment and hosp i ali sati on for sufferers from heart disease and lung cancer? </para>

            <para>- Like everybody else,I am concerned about the prevalence of lung cancer and heart disease, but whether those diseases are directly caused by cigarette smoking I do not know. So far I have not seen any conclusive evidence to that effect and, as I understand the position,  there is still argument on the question. The balance of opinion seems to be that there isa direct causal connection. If this is so I would think it is more a matter for the Department of Health. I do not favour the use of revenue procedures to encourage or discourage something which relates directly to the health of the community. However, I will give close attention to the honourable gentleman&#39;s question to see whether the course he suggests is practicable. </para>

            <para>- I am delighted that the Leader of the Opposition has given me the opportunity to refer to a matter which is of great importance. I am pleased to see his rather new found interest in this matter. I acknowledge the fact that my Department and I spent a considerable amount of time last year preparing the basis of a document for consideration by the Government in relation to the development of our natural resources. In its early stages this document became public knowledge although at that stage it was not a public document. The matter has been before Cabinet for some considerable time and has gone through the early stages of its first consideration by Cabinet. Naturally the consideration of development on this scale, affecting as it does policy matters involving quite a number of departments, is a long and complicated process. Many of the matters which were raised when the subject was first being considered have now been dealt with and public announcements have been made. However, there are still quite a number of matters in the original document that have yet to be considered. The position at the present time is that an interdepartmental committee is considering a number of them. When it has finally considered these points and make recommendations to me, the matter will again be considered by the Government. But I. do appreciate, as I say, the new found interest of the Opposition in this very important matter. </para>

            <para>- The answer to the first 2 parts of the honourable member&#39;s question is yes. The answer to the third part is that State Government Ministers other than the Victorian Minister have asked that an early meeting of the Australian Agricultural Council be convened to consider possible ways in which restraint on egg production can be imposed within the States. However, the Victorian Government believes that at this stage the matter is not one on which it is prepared to take legislative action in any way, and consequently has asked that the meeting be deferred until the normal time for the next meeting which is February 1972. The matter is listed for discussion then and I hope that growers in Victoria and elsewhere in Australia will take note of the difficulties which face all sections of the industry and bring pressure to bear on the Victorian Government so that at the time of the meeting of the Agricultural Council adequate consideration can be given to some way of restraining excess production. There is no doubt that of all the primary industries, there are few in a more critical financial plight than the egg producing sector of the poultry industry. It is regrettable that there  is no&#39; way in which the Commonwealth Government can take action in an area where the particular responsibility is within the sovereign control of the States. i: INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS &#39; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr BEAZLEY-</inline> I address a question to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I ask the  Minister whether consideration has been given to suggesting the calling of either a  Commonwealth Prime Ministers conference or a Commonwealth Foreign Ministers conference, perhaps in Ottawa in view of  the acceptability of Pierre Trudeau to both sides, to offer mediation in the war between India and Pakistan. ::i <inline font-weight="bold">Mr N.</inline> H. BOWEN- There has been  some discussion of Commonwealth initiative and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Arnold</inline> Smith in London has  been communicating with Commonwealth &#91; countries. The difficulty here is that it is  the general assessment of most of the leading Commonwealth countries that any approach of that type at the present time would be less than effective. This would be largely a matter of judgment. It has not been overlooked. I can assure the honourable member that it is currently under discussion but none of the Commonwealth countries wants simply to do something which is a mere gesture and would be entirely abortive. They are therefore  closely studying the matter. </para>

            <para>- There is no truth whatsoever in the allegation. My predecessor made the decision that this particular school was not a school which should attract Commonwealth support. The Commonwealth does not provide per capita grants to this school. It provides no capital assistance to this school. It does not provide assistance to this school and this sort of information is perhaps typical of the propaganda that is sometimes used in this direction. </para>

            <para>- The position at the present time in the Palm Valley-Greenie area is that the exploration and proving work is continuing. It will take some considerable time to prove the reserves of gas and liquid crude there. In the meantime some discussions have been held and are still continuing between officers of my Department and the companies concerned. The situation is a fairly, complex one because it involves not . only the actual development of the Held itself but also the situation whereby certain areas are allocated . to different marketers in relation to the subsidy provided by the Commonwealth. So careful consideration has to be given to the allocation of certain areas. But the negotiations in relation to the possible development of a small refinery in Alice Springs are continuing. 1. expect that it will be some little time before they will be finalised and it will also be some little time before the extent of the reserves at Greenie are finally proven.

            <para>- I preface my question to the Treasurer with a reference to a report of proceedings in the Bankruptcy Court earlier this year revealing that Australian residents used a sham company set up in Norfolk Island to avoid taxation, and also to my quests of 11th March last year to his predecessor suggesting that taxation was being avoided in this . way, with which his predecessor agreed. </para>

            <para>- The honourable gentleman has every right to be concerned about this matter. I am also concerned about it. There is a difficulty involved here in that the Norfolk Island administration and the Norfolk Island people feel very strongly that companies should set up there because this provides considerable revenue for Norfolk Island. My colleague, the Minister for External Territories, naturally enough is concerned for the interests of the people of Norfolk Island. For my part I am very concerned that Norfolk Island, which already shows promise of becoming a very considerable tax haven, should not be allowed to develop in that way, for if it does it will only enrich some companies and add a considerable burden to the taxpayers of Australia. The consequence is that I have had a thorough investigation of this matter made by the Taxation Office and Treasury officers. As a consequence I have a paper of considerable size, containing very many pages, which has been submitted to a committee of Ministers who deal with tax matters. Unfortunately it has not been possible, to consider the report of the investigation within the last week or two, but that committee will be called together as soon as possible, for the purpose of reaching conclusions about it so that it can be recommended for the consideration of the Government. </para>

            <para>- I do. .not think it is .&#39; simply because of high interest rates in Austhalia. In reality interest rates in Aust thalia fit about in the middle of the interest rate spectrum of all countries in. the world. Very considerable differences in interest rates are found in other countries between the short-term market and the long-term market. There is a very much bigger difference between the low and high rates in other countries than there ls in Australia where interest rates tend to &#39;be in a closer band. But the&#39; level of interest rates may well have been one of the&#34; factors. For instance the interest rate in switzerland is quite low although access to that market is not easy. But inquiries.&#39; .1 have made show&#39; that&#39; it is  difficult to obtain money from overseas at a more advantageous interest rate than it can be obtained in Australia. The reason for the. borrowings overseas has&#39; been that there has been a . . greater demand for finance for development projects than we generate ourselves in Australia. The reason : for that is, of course, our rapid rate of growth. I think one of the major, reasons for the increase in borrowings was that there has developed over the last 2 or 3 years a , very marked improvement in the sophistication of the merchant banking area which has been able to make contacts with, overseas sources of capital, put the capital together and make it available to projects in Australia which, prior to that event, just did not have the expertise to use or the entrance into those overseas capital markets. They have now managed to achieve that and that is one of the major reasons for the inflow. </para>

I ask him  whether the committee of Ministers concerned with taxation matters has considered the New Hebrides tax haven. Finally I ask whether, since the New Hebrides is an Anglo-French condominium, he has asked the Prime Minister, who is still the means of communication with the British Government, or the Foreign Minister, who is the means of communication with the French Government, to study this aspect. </para>

            <para>- I do not know to which report the honourable gentleman refers in particular. I have seen a number of papers from the Taxation Office in general on tax minimisation including that element which is tax minimisation arising out of the use of havens outside Australian territory. It is a matter which  concerns  me and indeed it concerns every country in the world, whether the haven is a total haven or half haven or whatever it is. It is not an easy problem to cure, but it is one of which the taxation officers are very well aware and so am 1. 1 have decided that we ought first to approach that area upon which we have undoubted legislative power, and that is in relation to our own Territories. Hence the priority of Norfolk Island remains higher. </para>

            <para>- The honourable member&#39;s interest in this matter is made evident not only by his question today but also by the fact that he has written to me recently on a couple of occasions.  1  can assure honourable members that I agree with him that this is a very important matter. The beef roads programme has provided a very good service in many areas in the northern parts of Australia. The negotiations in relation to this are handled by the Northern Division of my Department. </para>

          <para>The present programme continues under the existing plan up to  1974.  At this point of time I cannot give an assurance in regard to a further plan. But I can give the assurance that some planning is being done in consultation with the States and the industries concerned. A lot of work is being done to see what further programmes would be required to service this industry. Of course, as the honourable member knows, subsidiary benefits spill over into other industries such as tourism and the programme provides a service to the community generally. We are well aware of the honourable member&#39;s interest in the matter. I can assure him that the point he has raised will be given full consideration. </para>

            <para>- I direct my question to the Prime Minister. Have 21 years elapsed since the Tariff Board commenced its inquiry into the shipbuilding industry and has its report been in the  hands of the Government since 12th July this year? Has a Cabinet sub-committee been considering the location of a new graving dock for over 12 months? Has the Newcastle State Dockyard submitted a plan for the construction of a new graving dock capable of docking and repairing large bulk carriers and tankers operating on the coast? Further, I ask whether the right honourable gentleman has any information as to what progress has been made with these reports and when a decision can be expected. Finally,I ask how much longer is the Government going to sit on the reports. </para>

            <para>-I was asked a similar question some weeks ago and I said in reply that the Tariff Board report had been received. I pointed out that this was a very complex report and that it was being given close Government examination. Further I said that the examination was being carried out by an interdepartmental committee and that we hoped to be able to hand down a decision as soon as possible. I am fully conscious of the difficulties that the delay is causing the shipbuilding industry. I am fully aware of the uncertainty that prevails at the moment as to the industry&#39;s future. Give an assurance that we will deal with the report as expeditiously as possible. I would hope that a decision might be made early in the New Year. </para>

In view of the indication contained in his answer a few minutes ago to the Leader of the Opposition that the staff resources of the Taxation Office are not sufficient to cope with the great demands upon them to investigate and endeavour to plug up loopholes in relation to tax avoidance, will the Treasurer reconsider a suggestion I made not very long ago to the effect that the time might be appropriate to appoint another specialist committee like the Ligertwood Committee, which sat in 1960 and 1961, to supplement the activities of the Taxation Office in relation to tax avoidance? </para>

            <para>- I have been giving consideration to this matter. The elements involved are what sort of issues should be looked at by such a committee and, if a committee were appointed, to what degree must it be serviced by, the very same officers who are doing the work themselves and to what extent, therefore, would it detract from the work performance of those officers. Unfortunately, like parliamentary counsel, these experienced officers cannot just be created. They are of a special type, being a combination of intellect and character. The other thing which these officers are involved in at present, and this is by chance, is the negotiation of a series of double tax agreements. For a number of years we did not have them, but we are now in the course of vigorously achieving them. We have a list of countries in order of priority, so to speak, and the same sort of officers are used in that pursuit. I will continue an examination to see whether they can be helped by an outside committee without detracting from their work performance. </para>

            <para>- It would have been preferable had this question been directed to my colleague, the Minister for Labour and National Service. As the honourable gentleman will know, or should know, we have in this country an Arbitration Commission which has the function of determining minimum and award wages. Negotiations also take place outside the Commission which involve what is called the wage group, which also encompass a very large section of wage increases. To determine such matters for the Commonwealth Civil Service, there is the Public Service Arbitrator. These avenues are all open to the unions so that they can represent the best interests of the working man. But I think the honourable gentleman, having the interests of the lower paid workers at heart, would know that these days, with the great power of the big unions, particularly unions like the Amalgamated Engineering Union - </para>

            <para>- I do not think it is quite correct to express the position as the honourable member did and to say the Australia and New Zealand had been standing out against overseas charter operators coming to Australia and New Zealand. Of course, there has been a considerable amount of charter operations, both by our own international carrier and by other international carriers. But Australia has adhered very firmly in her own interests and in the interests of international aviation to the conditions of the International Air Transport Association. However, as honourable members know, there has been some change in Australia in relation to a subsidiary company being set up under Qantas Airways. Ltd specifically for charter operations, In addition, I know what my colleague in another place is giving consideration to the position of the entry of additional charter flights to Australia by other international operators. However, I am not completely in the picture as to the present position, so I will draw the attention of my colleague in another place the question that has been asked and see that a suitable answer is furnished. </para>

He may recall my question to him on 13th September in which I sought a reduction in interest rates in the home building sector of the building industry in order to stimulate that section of the industry. In reply the Prime Minister indicated that he would keep a close watch on this section of the industry. Is he aware that there had been a 6.6 per cent decrease in the number of commencements of the houses and flats in the September quarter compared with the corresponding quarter in1 969 - 2 years ago - and that since that time 350,000 migrants have come to Australia and there have been over 220,000 marriages in Australia?

            <para>- My question is addressed to the Minister for the Interior, who administers the Electoral Act. With a view to giving non-metropolitan Australia an opportunity to develop, will the Minister, when the next redistribution of Federal electorates is being made, endeavour to have the permissible 20 per cent over and 20 per cent under the quota fully implemented in favour of rural areas? The Minister will realise that this is provided for in the Electoral Act. In other words, will he endeavour to have decentralisation of political representation adopted? </para>

            <para>- I am well aware of the views of the honourable member on this question of decentralisation and of his adherence to the belief that, in order to achieve decentralisation, decentralisation of administration is essential. Over the years, the Government has taken into consideration the need to try to get a balance between representation for rural constituents and representation for metropolitan constituents. The Act has been framed in such a way as to ensure that people living in rural areas can be adequately represented. We have some very large electorates, like the electorate of Kalgoorlie, which covers an enormous area. Of course, the people in such . areas are not able to see their member as frequently as con st i tue tents in the electorate of Grayndler can. So, we do have a very necessary tolerance to try to ensure that adequate provision is made for people living in the rural sector. I can assure the honourable member that we will observe the provisions of the Electoral Act should there be, and when there is, a redistribution. </para>

I have received a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lewis,</inline> the Manager-Public Relations of Conzinc Riotinto in which he refers to a speech that I made in the House on 2nd December 1971. He draws my attention to the fact that in that speech 1 said that 84 per cent of the shares of Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Limited were held by the United Kingdom parent company, the Rio Tin to Zinc Corporation Ltd. He points out that the figure now is 80.65 per cent with respect to shares held by the parent company. I am sure that all Australians will heave a sigh of &#39;gratitude&#39; at this &#39;magnificent&#39; gesture to local equity which has been displayed by Conzinc Riotinto of Australia Ltd. </para>

            <para>- No. This question arises under standing order 64 which provides that a member may explain matters of a personal nature. I refer to a matter which arose in the House. During the course of question time, the honourable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kelly)</inline> asked for the distribution of certain material from the Australian Broadcasting Commission. I interjected because, as a member of the Library Committee, I was concerned that the Library&#39;s functions were&#39; misunderstood. The Library circulates or has available the transcripts to which the honourable member referred in relation to the programmes Monday Conference&#39; and &#39;Guest of Honour&#39;. Indeed, the transcript of &#39;Monday Conference&#39; is circulated to honourable members. 1 am deeply grieved that honourable members have not noticed this fact. I apologise to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> for having breached the Standing Orders on this occasion, but I was provoked. </para>

        <motion>
          <para>That so much of the Standing Orders be suspended as would prevent the honourable member for Dawson moving a motion to establish a select committee to inquire into and  report  upon the area management proposals of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department, the constant closing of country post offices and similar policies adversely affecting the customers and s&#39;.alT of the Australian Post Office. </para>
        </motion>
        <para class="block">All members of Parliament who represent rural and semi-rural electorates, as well as some of those representing city electorates, are well aware of the attitude of the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Alan Hulme)</inline> and his Department to the very serious problems caused by the wholesale closing of country post offices throughout Australia. The Opposition believes that the Federal Parliament must act to curb the dictatorial powers exercised by the Postmaster-General and his Department in their decisions to close down these country post offices. There is an urgent need to establish a select committee of the Parliament to inquire into these matters which are, of course, of great concern to all members of the Australian Labor Party representing rural electorates, as they are to all members of the Country Party and the Liberal Party, although I would assume that the last 2 mentioned parties will do very little about it. Because of the . Postmaster-General&#39;s dictatorial attitude, the Federal Government now is being depicted in country areas as a government which has little sympathy for the needs of country people. </para>
        <para>Country post offices are an integral part of the welfare of all rural areas; they have provided essential services to rural communities for almost as long as those communities have existed. In the last 3 years the Government, through the PostmasterGenera&#93;, has closed down 700 .post offices throughout Australia and. the great majority of these were in rural electorates. And while this happens the Government seems to turn a blind eye to the powers of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department. The disturbing feature of these closures is that in all cases there are no real reasons for them and no warnings are given to the people concerned. They have little chance of appealing to the Postmaster-General and their Federal member to take this matter </para>
        <para>Up  wilh the Department. Usually notification is given and protests are made, but by then it is too late. </para>
        <para>In addition, another decision has caused serious problems with respect to the compulsory transfer of staff from country areas to the provincial cities, a move which is contrary to the principles of decentralisation. This re-organisation is, in effect, in pursuance of a policy of centralisation in capital and provincial cities. And this is another reason why there is a need for a committee of inquiry. No committee of inquiry has been established to investigate the operations of the Post Office for more than 50 years and a competent independent investigation by the Parliament of the entire .structure of the Post Office is badly needed. </para>
        <para>The Opposition has another reason for moving this motion. There are mounting delays in rural areas in the provision of telephone services. There was an announcement made in this Parliament some time ago concerning an acceleration in the provision of telephone facilities to country people within a certain radius of the exchanges. But all we have had are mounting delays. Divisional engineers throughout Australia will  tell  us  that the provision of these  facilities  is at the bottom of the priority  list because apparently there  are  not sufficient funds available. In  my  electorate,  a  typical country electorate,  the  delay in  the  provision  of  multi-coin facilities which  are  essential  for  people  in  rural areas wishing  to make  trunk-line calls is  at  least 12 months. And if the Postmaster-General does not believe me, I can give him details of the applications which have been made  by  people in my electorate and who have been told that there is at least  a  7-month delay in the provision of even multi-coin facilities. This is proof of  a  deterioration in the operational conditions in the Post Office. There is a need for  an  investigation. The Postmaster-General has informed the Government and the public that he will retire shortly and I believe in all sincerity that he should intervene in this matter before then. If he does not it will seem that he has lost interest  in  the welfare of the Australian people. I believe he should resign. </para>

However, I will take this opportunity  to  remind the honourable member for Dawson that it is  a  motion for the suspension  of  Standing Orders.

            <para>- I have tried to confine myself to the reasons for seeking  a  suspension  of  Standing Orders  in  stating me problems that have arisen, not only the problems that have arisen  in  country areas but also the problems  of  Post Office staff involved  in  the compulsory transfer. I will now deal with the points that the Postmaster-General made in his last 2 statements on this matter of area management proposals. Apparently the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department is ignoring the protests by the staff affected by the proposed compulsory transfers. These transfers mean that the people will have to sell their homes and in many instances in country areas they will not be able to sell their homes except at give-away prices. What does the Government intend to do about this? This is. another reason why there should be an inquiry. </para>

        <para>There is also the area mails centre project which threatens to bring hardship to and place unreasonable requirements on customers of the Post Office in the capital and large provincial cities. This is yet another reason why there should be a suspension of Standing Orders to allow a committee of inquiry to be set up. Many postal workers and Commonwealth public servants in rural areas are being subjected to a downgrading of their district allowances. There is another very pressing reason why these matters should be aired now. There are grave allegations being made by postal workers that the centralised office in Melbourne is becoming even more centralised because of the empire building tactics of what is called the engineer lobby. It is significant that under new proposals of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department the number of engineers in the Central office will increase from-- </para>

            <para>- No statement has been made by the Postmaster-General as to the real reason for the centralising of staff  and the further centralising of offices in rural areas. This is one of the urgent reasons why this matter should be investigated. 1 have moved for the suspension  of Standing Orders so that a committee &#91; could be set up to establish the reasons for this move. Another reason for an urgent inquiry is the obvious uncertainty of the Postmaster-General and his Department about the justification of the scheme itself. This is very relevant. It would seem that the centra) office of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department is itself now establishing a committee of inquiry. But this is not good enough. 1 submit that there should be an independent parliamentary inquiry. There should be a suspension of the Standing Orders virtually to countermand this proposal and allow for an independent inquiry, so that we do not simply have a departmental inquiry white washing itself. There are other urgent reasons for an inquiry. There is a need to provide precise figures of the number of people who will be affected by hardship as a result of their having to move. When this matter is put to the vote or gagged it will be interesting to see the attitude of the Country Party. I assume Country Party supporters will remain silent as usual although they are always condemning the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department-  .. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr SPEAKER-Order!</inline> The honourable member will resume, his seat. </para>

          <para>- I second the motion. I believe there is an urgent need for the suspension of Standing Orders and the appointment of a committee of inquiry because of the dissatisfaction and the concern amongst many of the employees of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department. The top engineers are, of course, not affected by this change but rh district reorganisation has not been in the best interests of the Post Office and the public. 1 feel that this matter should he aired because it affects so many people in country areas, particularly in my area around Cairns.

          </motion>
          <para class="block">The motion, which is deliberately a short one, would enable any committee which was set up to make fairly wide sweeping inquiries into what is one of the major problems concerning Australia as a nation at this time and which has confronted Australia .as a nation over a considerable period. The degree of inactivity which exists on this matter is startling, to say the least, &#39;and is possibly a reflection of self satisfaction&#39; by those people who believe, as we heard at question time today, that the problems of rural communities and provincial areas can be solved, not by development, not by the increasing and maintenance of population of those areas, but merely by altering the Electoral Act. A select committee of this Parliament would bring down recommendations which could reverse a trend which has been growing over a number of 5&#39;ears. </para>
          <para>I think that even at this early stage 1 should put .forward one proposition which will, I hope, counter the proposition put forward by the honourable member for Mallee <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Turnbull)</inline> that the way to get a better deal in the rural areas is. to reduce the size of the rural electorates and thus give better representation in this Parliament. On the last occasion the Electoral Act was altered the allowable ratio between electorates was increased from 10 per cent to 20 per cent up or down. The census which has been taken since the application of that redistribution shows tha! the growth rate in country areas in Victoria has dropped from 3,53 per cent to 0.52 per cent. So the extra members, satisfied that their seats in Parliament are safe, have decided that . they need do nothing except at some further .date amend the Electoral Aci again. </para>
          <para>That is not the way to approach the problem&#39; which confronts Australia, lt is not the way lo deal with the very serious problem which is shown to exist by growth rate .statistics for any State. .1. have here the growth statistics for Victoria, which I think fairly accurately reflect the position in the rest of Au tralia. Because it is not good to fill a speech up with statistics I will deal only with those statistics relative to Victoria. The metropolitan area of Melbourne, which is changing statistically according to census figures.- in 1933 had 57.83 per cent of the population of Victoria and non metropolitan areas had 42.17 per cent. At the time of the last census in June of this year, the proportion of the population in the metropolitan area of Melbourne had grown to 68.1 per cent and the proportion in non-metropolitan areas, including Geelong, had dropped to 31.9 per cent, a drop of 1 1 per cent in a period of 38 years. </para>
          <para>I would suggest that this is in itself adequate evidence of the decline in the activities in rural areas and the decline in the importance of provincial areas in Australia.. Since 1961 statistical divisions have been applied to the census so that the actual areas concerned are absolutely identical. &#34;Since the 1961 census the population growth in the statistical division of Melbourne has been very close to 500.000 persons. The growth in the remainder of the State has been 50,000 persons. 10 per cent of the growth rate of Melbourne. That is the real evidence of the problem. It is a growing problem. To indicate how the problem is growing I will quote the growth rates in the non-metropolitan areas in Victoria between censuses. Between  1947  and  1957  there was a  21.8  per cent growth in the non-metropolitan areas of Victoria. In the next inter-census period the growth was  15.45  per cent. In the period between  1961  and  1966 -  this is when the rot really set in - the growth rate, in non metropolitan areas in Victoria was  3.53  per cent. In the period from  1966  to the last census the growth rale was  0.52  per cent, or half of  1  per cent. </para>
          <para>In case it may be thought that because of the changes the changing pattern of the metropolitan area resulting from the change in definition has altered the position materially, I point out that for the remainder of the State, leaving but the statistical division of Melbourne, the growth rate for the period between  1961  and  1966  was 4.61 per cent in non-metropolitan areas, and the growth rate between  1966  and 1971 was  0.94  per cent or less than  1  per cent. That is allowing for the fact that the figures for the metropolitan area of Melbourne relate only to those&#39; areas within Melbourne&#39;s fixed boundary, which is in fact an unreal position, because the urban area of Melbourne is growing and these figures do not reflect the rural population of individual areas which are in the area of Melbourne but outside the statistical division. This is a real problem. </para>
          <para>We have a current problem which I hope is temporary but which most likely is not. I refer to growing unemployment in rural areas. I think this subject is to be covered in a subsequent debate, and it has no real application to the problems which are the subject of this debate. Unemployment in rural areas is a problem but it is not directly associated with the matter we are now discussing. The question which I believe must be decided, and decided quickly, is whether we are to continue with our present method of dealing with rural and provincial depopulation, that is by amending the Electoral Act, or whether we are to do something about the maintenance of population and the maintenance of population ratios in the areas outside the major capital cities? It is ridiculous to suggest that in a nation of 3 million square miles we should be doing everything possible to squeeze all the population into  a  couple of thousand square miles. Is the rest of the nation not fit to be lived in? Some of it is not fit to be lived in by large masses but a great deal of it is and many provincial and rural areas are better equipped than are the metropolitan areas for the growth of population and the maintenance of the way of life we like to think is Australian but which in fact is not Australian. There are many areas of Australia where facilities for population growth already exist and it is necessary to provide the people in those areas with the necessary employment opportunities and the necessary facilities of life to keep these areas as viable population centes. There is hardly a non-metropolitan area in Australia that is at this time growing at a satisfactory rate with satisfactory employment opportunities for the full cross-section of our population. </para>
          <para>I believe that only by Government action designed to encourage the maintenance of population in and the movement of population into provincial and regional centres can the non-metropolitan population of Australia he maintained al a satisfactory level. The stupid and short-sighted proposition which is promoted very often by the Government of Victoria that we should have 5 million people crammed into Melbourne and leave the rest of the State hare of people to me is almost akin to genocide, it will result in a population at some future time of absolutely neurotic morons. We cannot put people in cages continually. Without any policies to develop in the capital cities an environment which is comparable with the environment which people are able to enjoy outside the capital cities we are seriously damaging human beings. By economic pressures we are forcing people who are not urban dwellers or who are not psychologically orientated towards urban living to move out of country areas into urban living, into areas where the basic facilities are not provided. This is a secondary but a very important problem resulting from depopulation of the country areas. Not only are we forcing people to leave facilities which have been developed and destroying communities which have grown: we are also creating areas of urban population which do not have the basic facilities because the </para>
          <para>State governments and the municipal councils do not have the funds to provide and maintain them. </para>
          <para>This Government is creating areas which are not satisfactory living areas and this must have the effect of downgrading our population.I would suggest that interdepartmental committees and intergovernmental committees could study these matters. There has been one such committee studying this subject for so many years that no-one can remember the last time that it actually did anything, if it ever did anything. Apparently it has not met for about 3 years. A parliamentary committee would highlight - this is very important - the needs and the problems of non-metropolitan areas and the need for the promotion of future growth. A parliamentary committee would serve to acquaint the members of this Parliament, and I would hope it might even acquaint some of those who represent the rural electorates, with the real problems which are developing, problems which have nothing to do with how many members there are in this Parliament but which have a lot to do with what members are prepared to do for these areas. </para>
          <para>The rate of growth of non-metropolitan areas, as I have already said, is totally unsatisfactory. In fact, if it continues to decline at the rate which is shown in the last census we will reach a situation where not much more than 10 per cent of our population will be living outside the capital cities by the year 2000. That is the sort of problem with which we are faced and the sort of problem for which solutions must be found. There are no easy remedies and there are no cheap remedies for this problem. There are some things that the Commonwealth Government could do now. It could decentralise its own departments to a greater extent instead of transferring everyone into a centralised area. With the modern communications and facilities now available this is quite a practicable step. </para>
          <para>This Government could deal with the very severe burden which telephone charges place on businesses operating outside metropolitan areas. For instance in Victoria a business operating in Melbourne has access to a very wide area and a unit charge fee for the payment of a very small extra rental. But a business operating in the city of Ballarat, Bendigo, Geelong or Mildura. which is in the electorate of the honourable member for Mallee <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Turnbull)</inline> is faced with fantastic telephone charges. A person can make a call from Frankston to Newport or Melbourne for 4c and talk all day. A person who makes a call to the same areas from Geelong, which is a shorter distance, will be charged 20c or 25c for every 3 minutes of the conversation. I do not think that this is a realistic approach to a problem. I think that the realities of the situation are that businesses are seriously disadvantaged by this type of costing. The postal services available to businesses in country areas are less than satisfactory. </para>
          <para>I had reason to protest recently about the advertising of jobs with the Commonwealth Department of Works at the Avalon airfield which is just outside Geelong. The jobs were advertised in Melbourne and the applicants had to go to Melbourne to apply for jobs in Geelong. That is the psychology of the Commonwealth Department of Works. The reason why the jobs were not advertised in Geelong, according to the Department, was that it had to give a week&#39;s notice to country newspapers to insert the advertisement but it had to give only 1 day&#39;s notice to city newspapers. That is not true. The fact is that the Commonwealth Advertising Division was not prepared to place the advertisement unless it had a week&#39;s notice, so people living in the area where the employment was needed could apply for these jobs only by going to Melbourne but by the time they got there they had all been taken. </para>
          <para>There is a very serious lack of facilities in country areas. There is very little reason why businesses would establish themselves in country areas at this stage. Country areas have many disadvantages and the Commonwealth adds to- those disadvantages. These areas have very few advantages other than a better environment and possibly a more stable work force. But the problems are such that economically the people in these areas are disadvantaged. The Commonwealth, no longer controls payroll tax but this is an area in which the States could take action in order to give advantage to country industries over and above metropolitan industries. In other countries there are means which are used to promote the growth of non-metropolitan industries in certain areas. These are matters which 1 think could well be taken up by this House and could well be put before a committee which could sift out the problems, such a committee should consist of people who are interested in this problem, of people who .have a voice in. this Parliament and who are able to be effective. Public servants are npt the people who should be inquiring into human problems which are the, responsibility of the Parliament. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-style="italic">I</inline>believe that a parliamentary committee should be set up to investigate this matter. It may be that the terms of reference of the committee would not necessarily be those contained in the motion. Other terms of. reference may be more, desirable but 1 believe, the principle should be established. I will be very interested at the conclusion of this debate to see whether a vote is taken. I was told a few minutes ago that the  debate will be chopped off at 12 o&#39;clock so that some Government business can be brought on. But&#39; if a vote is allowed,-&#39; and I hope it will be, I will&#39; be interested to &#39;see whether members of this Parliament are prepared to support the appointment of a parliamentary committee to inquire into the future of human beings in this country. We have. taken this action in regard to our wildlife. We have done. it, for fauna. It is about time that we did it for human beings&#39; because after all they are at least equally important. </para>

              <para>- Kangaroos do not get counted . under the provisions of the Electoral Act. I think that human beings are just as important even though they are not always, represented in this Parliament. Another point I .would like to make is that the statistical evidence of a decline, and a rapidly, increasing .decline, in the percentage of population it i non-metropolitan areas,, is beyond question. So. that honourable members may have available to them information on the population in Victoria I seek, leave of the House to incorporate in Hansard a table which sets out the census figures .. for metropolitan . and non metropolitan areas. </para>

              <para>- The table refers solely to census statistics which have been compiled. I think they are of value because they show exactly what the problem is. Because of the space that would have been required, the table refers only to one State but  I know that the general trend is almost identical in other States. There is a real need, if this population trend is to be reversed, for secondary and manufacturing industries to be established in country area&#39;s. Possibly academic institutions including tertiary institutions could also be established. But the real solution to the problem is the development of manufacturing industries in country areas. This can largely be done only at the provincial level or the regional centre level but it would provide a basis for employment over a wide area. If we continue in the way that we are now doing without being prepared even to look at the problem then we will jeopardise the future of the entire population of this nation. Not only are we jeopardising the future of those people in country areas but we are seriously jeopardising those in the major metropolitan areas which must suffer through unnatural population growth. I commend the motion to the House and I hope that the House will agree to it. I believe that it is very important that the House does so. </para>

            <para>- As I understand the burden of the complaint of the honourable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Scholes)</inline> it is that this Government and various preceding governments of Australia and of the States are responsible for the population distribution of Australia. Unfortunately in the main I believe that is not so although there are certain things which governments might do to try to redistribute the population in some measure. I find myself in the position of being able to commend the honourable member for Corio in, I think, one respect only and that his proposition, real or implied, that a national view of this sort of thing is desirable. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I agree with that implicitly. However, I think that the honourable member fails to recognise some very substantial historical and geographical underpinnings of the situation which he has described and deplored in his speech this morning. The honourable member suggests that this is a major issue, and that is perfectly correct. He suggests that it is a major issue because of government inactivity. I do not want to traverse at this particular time the longish history of the distribution of population and the extent of urbanisation in Australia, or for that matter anywhere else, because it is a worldwide phenomenon. But the plain fact of the matter is that this country was settled through 6 port settlements which became towns and cities. Various other developments took place, notably in the economic life of the areas over which the port settlements came to have domination. Therefore population concentrated on those 6 centres. </para>
          <para>Unlike the United States of America, which I think is the best comparative example which I can make, we have continued in that way. There has been a concentration, or perhaps an over concentration and influence on and by 6 port capitals. In the United States there was a population movement westward. . Railways preceded the development of settlements and various centres were set up so that there was an urban frontier as well as a rural frontier in the early part of the 19th Century. The population moved on to the west coast and then something approximating the coastal distribution of population in Australia came into being. But in the meantime the middle of the American continent, which was basically settle able, had become settled. That was not the case in Australia for reasons which are all too obvious to members of this chamber and to those outside it. So do not let us try to pin this thing on this Government or any other government. </para>
          <para>There are other aspects of the matter on which, I hope, I will have time to dilate. However, basically what the honourable member for Corio was talking about is the process of urbanisation, which used to be called the rural-urban drift, by which people have increasingly concentrated in cities. This has happened not just in Australia. The process of urbanisation occurred in some ways in other parts of the world before it took place in Australia. Attention was drawn to this phenomenon in a notable work before the turn of the century. This work made considerable reference to the dist rub it ion of population in. this process of urbanisation in Britain, Europe and elsewhere, but notably in Britain and Europe. So, initially, we are not talking really of provincial centres and regional development; we are talking about the process of urbanisation because from that stem any problems that may exist in provincial centres and in regional development. This area was touched on only lightly by the honourable member for Corio. In that sense I would criticise the honourable member&#39;s terms of reference, although he fundamentally is trying to do something which is sensible. But I believe that he puts forward a too narrow term of reference for the consideration of this problem because the problem stems from the metropolitan situation and only from there, and after that, one may come up with certain rural problems. </para>
          <para>The extent of urbanisation in Australia is well known, lt is not necessarily well known in degrees of particularity. I would like, if 1 may, to incorporate in Hansard a small table based on census statistics relating to the 6 State capitals. I will draw attention to it later in 2 or 3 sentences. </para>

              <para>- The document merely shows how certain functions are concentrated in the capital cities. I do not wish fo dilate upon the whole matter. Although the figures are slightly dated, the relativity is roughly the same and we get the following kind of situation. Firstly 56 per cent of the population of New South Wales was concentrated in Sydney at the time of the 1961 census. Some 57 per cent of the retail activity and 73 per cent of the manufacturing jobs were concentrated in that city. That sort of situation can be reproduced through 4 other capital cities. The only exception is Hobart where, at the same date, 33 per cent of the population, 40 per cent of the retailing activity and 32 per cent of the manufacturing jobs were concentrated. Tn other words, there is in Australia only one example of actual decentralisation in operation. It has occurred, as it were, naturally. There is governmental influence but it has not occurred basically because of governmental influence. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>This situation has occurred because the island of Tasmania was settled simultaneously through 2 centres - Launceston in the north and Hobart in the south. Tasmania even developed one or two other coastal centres of reasonable standing. As a result the island developed a decentralisation of various functions, not the least manufacturing, which has not been reproduced in any other States. This is the basic reason why we have the situation about which the honourable member for Corio complains. In saying that I do not suggest that it is impossible for governments to do anything about the matter, nor that it should be. But I find the honourable member somewhat less than factual when he makes certain suggestions. In fact, I am surprised that he concentrated on Victoria in this matter. I say that for several reasons, one of them being that the honourable member comes from that State. </para>
          <para>He suggests that there is a great Victorian Government emphasis on &#34;Melbourne to the detriment of the rural areas. Whether or not that is so 1 cannot prove in the course of the next 5 or so minutes, but the plain fact of the matter is that for governmental or other reasons, Victoria has the densest average distribution of population of any Australian State, including Tasmania, lt could even bc said - from some points of view that Victoria has the best population distribution in a balanced fashion which is partly a reflection on the fact that most of the countryside is able to be occupied and worked in some sort of way. I do not think I have found myself in a position before of making a brief for the Bolte Government but I would like to point out that the Liberal government of Victoria for some time have consistently tried all forms, of manufacturing and industrial locational incentives to get decentralisation moving in Victoria to a greater extent than already exists. So it is less than fair to suggest that the Government is willy-nilly interested in the promotion of Melbourne to the detriment of the &#34; rest of Victoria. </para>
          <para>If we turn to this Government- and taking up the same point made by the honourable member for Corio - we clearly have example after example of governmental legislation, sometimes fully supported, sometimes supported to a lesser degree and sometimes even opposed in certain respects by those on the opposite side of the chamber, to assist rural industries. A sub st anti a) proportion of our recent sessions has been taken up by measures to support rural industries. If the honourable member does not think that these measures have been designed to keep people on the land and in country towns I am not sure what he thinks they are designed to do. In the last few months we had a Bill - and other Bills have also been introduced - designed to keep the Shepparton cannery in operation for the sole purpose, one. assumes, of retaining the population in that centre instead of having it drift in the direction of Melbourne or some other capital city. Therefore I think the honourable member does less than justice, to put it mildly, to both Federal and State Governments as I have shown by a couple of examples in relation to this problem. </para>
          <para>Decentralisation is an important matter. 1 believe that the honourable member who preceded me completely failed to appreciate the difficulties of achieving it. In the first place Australia has a great lack, by world comparisons, of medium sized towns and medium sized regional centres for tha reasons which I spoke of earlier in reference to the United States. He failed also to take account of the fact that possibly the most against decentralisation is that there is a lack of differential labour costs which is not the situation in the United States. In that country there are regional disparities in costs and one can employ people in the south east for about 70 per cent of the wage than would have to be paid for labour in New York or on the west coast. Clearly this is an incentive to decentralisation. It is an incentive to put industry down in the south east because the wage bill is a good deal less. If an industry is a labour intensive industry such as the textile industry, so much the better. We do not have the advantage, if it is an advantage, of an incentive for decentralisation. I think that in a speech delivered on another occasion I drew attention to a small experiment which took place in Townsville about a year ago. That place is probably one of our better examples, and one of our few examples, of significant decentralisation outside the capital cities. </para>
          <para>A governmentally established industrial estate was set up at the cost of something like $600,000 and a year or so after having been set up it had placed on it one tile making industry employing, I think, 3 or 4 people at the time. </para>

              <para>- The situation is that certain efforts, which have been made over quite a long period of time in some cases to achieve decentralisation, have not been notably successful. In fact, at the base of the problem - I am not suggesting that an attempt cannot be made to solve the problem - there is the situation to which I have drawn attention during my earlier remarks. Firstly, there has been historical, followed by geographical, inertia in which it is well nigh impossible or, at least, very difficult to move people off their pitch. If they arc well established with all their ramifications and industrial links and so on,, it is difficult to move them from where they are, and where they , are usually happens, to be the metropolitan, areas. I draw attention to other moves, which are &#91;not exactly governmental moves, such as the new States movement. Look what happened to the New England new State movement. That could have been regarded as a popular move to decentralisation and the proliferation of Slates because our too few Slates or too many, however one regards&#39; it,. is the. basis of our State-Federal problem in Australia.. However, that was, for whatever reasons, unsuccessful. So, I hope . I have made the point; it is not easy to decentralise. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>In the few minutes remaining to me I should like to discuss how decentralisation may be achieved. There &#39;.are, of course, many ways in which that can be done. I think probably the most telling factor would be, in a sense, a negative one. When the big cities reach a stage where economies of scale no longer operate and become dis economies there will probably be the greatest incentive to . decentralisation. It was nm found in places like New York that those factors of dis economy operated in any significant way until the populations reached at least 5 million and. in the case of New York, about 1.0 million. One or two people looking at Australia on a comparative basis with the United States certainly have come to the conclusion that those dis economies are not likely to operate significantly in Sydney or Melbourne until they reach populations of the order of 5 million people. So. what are we left with? On the positive side, are the creation of manufacturing incentives and the making of incentives for service provisions. In fact, the latter may be more important than manufacturing incentives. Certain studies have shown that, in fact, people look lo areas - this is well known, I think - where their children can have a good schooling, where they have good access to markets and to their shopping provisions and so on. It may be that if governmental influence were to come to bear on creating service provisions before manufacturing provisions in certain decentralised places, more may;, be achieved. Nevertheless that is difficult .and it brings in .certain, other concepts of - a technical kind involving service functions which are regarded by geographers arid, others as basic functions on the one hand, and non- . basic on the other. The basic Junctions are those which .are city-growing and suburban forming functions./ The non-basic ones are those which . merely&#39; serve the populations which are there.. There is no time. for me. to dilate upon that. </para>
          <para>I was disappointed that -the honourable member for Corio did not speak more of regional &#39;development and&#39; did not appear to . show an understanding that regions usually- operate in a context of what are  called &#39;nodal regions, operating but of or dominated or influenced by: focal points. Again, :-we lack these focal -points. There may ;be. a case to stimulate : them but in stimulating ; them we face certain difficulties. Finally, perhaps one should draw attention,. as 1 did in a question a week or so ago, to the proposition of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> which no doubt he will expand upon later in this debate, in regard to governmental proposals and -new structures of government which, from., my. reading of them, appear to divorce., the. rural areas from the urban areas. In fact, this would cut right across . the. whole functional bass of. regional development which is an integration of urban operation and of rural operation. <inline font-weight="bold">&#34;Mr DEPUTY SPEAKER (Mr Lucock)</inline> - Order!

            <para>- 1 am disappointed that the honourable member for Denison <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Solomon)</inline> did not see fit lo support the proposition of my colleague, thc honourable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Scholes),</inline> that the House of Representatives set up a select committee to inquire into and report upon the future of provincial cities and regional development. The crux of the proposition is to set up a select committee. Any select committee has representatives from both sides of the House: any select committee has a Government supporter as its  chairman  and a majority of Government members. I am certain that there would be a great degree and a growing degree of common interest between members from both sides of this House if they were to get down together and consider this subject. I will concede that the honourable member for Denison, coming from the smallest of Australia&#39;s State capitals and from a State which does have some other considerable centres of urban development, could contribute to the proceedings of such a committee. A committee is bipartisan. There is a remarkable solidarity among the members of any committee which is set up in this Parliament. I am disappointed that the honourable gentleman did not support the idea. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Even if, however, the idea is too novel for Government members, it is not a new idea. Back in 1961, a former Leader of the Australian Country Party - not the immediate past one or the one before that, but the one before that, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Earle</inline> Page - moved that there be an expert committee appointed to inquire into and report on the best means of securing effective decentralisation of population, industry, communications and administration. He was supported by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr David</inline> Drummond, with whom I worked for nearly 4 years on the Joint Select Committee on Constitutional Review. I came to know and to respect and to share <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Drummond&#39;s</inline> ideas of decentralisation. I prefer the term &#39;concentrated&#39; or &#39;accelerated development&#39;. However one describes it, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Drummond</inline> showed as Minister for Education in New South Wales in the 1930s that there are fields where governments can accelerate the development of some areas. Where now would the city of Armidale be in New South Wales were is not for the teachers college which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Drummond</inline> sited there and for the university which he initiated there? </para>
          <para>Education and science is clearly a field where great initiatives can be taken, particularly in the tertiary field - in which, of course, the Australian Labor Party includes, even if the Liberal Party does not, the question of teacher education - and where the Commonwealth can contribute to the accelerated development of centres now. On that occasion, back on 27th April 1961, the former honourable member for Bendigo, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Beaton,</inline> moved an amendment to detail further matters upon which the expert committee should make recommendations, but he supported the establishment of such a committee.I was the second  speaker  on our side.

          <para>That is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Beaton&#39;s-</inline> that a joint parliamentary committee should be set up to deal with this problem is a bit late, really.  His  proposal would not fit the bill as well as what the Government has proposed already. At the premiers Conference held in July last year - that is, 1964 -  it was suggested that there should be joint meetings between Commonwealth . authorities and State departments to go into this problem of decentralisation throughout Australia. On 5th and 6th March this year- that is, 1965 - there was a meeting of representatives of the  States and the Commonwealth, which shows a positive action to try to do something about this major problem. </para>
          <para>That was the Commonwealth and State Officials Committee on Decentralisation. It has since met on 3 occasions - on 30th November 1966, 7th February 1969 and 12th October last. It is because of our exasperation with this Official Committee, which was set up after the Premiers Conference in 1964 and behind which the present Leader of the Country Party hid in 1965, that we move again for the establishment of a parliamentary committee. It is inconceivable that if there had been a parliamentary committee it would have taken as long to consider and to recommend measures for decentralisation as this Officials Committee has taken. The Officials Committee has met 4 times in over 7 years. We know that when either House of this Parliament sets up a committee it acts as an amazing catalyst and spur to official committees. The Jimmy Committee was set up within a month of the Senate setting up, pursuant to a promise I made in the 1967 Senate election that there would be a Senate select committee to look into medical and hospital costs. People act very quickly in these circumstances. Let us set up a parliamentary committee; a committee which would have a few advisers; one which would report promptly; and one, above all, which would get members on both sides to tackle these matters. </para>

          <para class="block">I asked the new Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> when he took over what were the names and positions of the Commonwealth members of the Committee. On 6th May last he gave me the following answer: </para>

          <para class="block">I put a question on this matter on the notice paper for the Minister for Trade and Industry, the Leader of the Country Party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony),</inline> because he had admitted that his Department was represented on this joint Committee. It transpires, from an answer which he gave on29th September, recalling a pre-McMahon Government answer on 14th April last year, that the departments represented on the Committee are the Prime Minister&#39;s, Treasury, Trade and Industry, Primary Industry, National Development and Labour and National Service. Firstly, it is remarkable that the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department is not represented on the Committee. All the State Committees which have investigated this matter have pointed out that communications in the hands of the Commonwealth are a key cost item in accelerated development. Secondly, the Department of Shipping and Transport is not represented on the Committee. Clearly, the Commonwealth&#39;s responsibilities, its sole initiatives in rebuilding country railways, and its responsibilities  for  building roads, should be considered. Nor is the Department of Civil Aviation represented on the Committee; the State committees have pointed out the Commonwealth&#39;s crucial role in regard to aerodromes. Nor is the Department of Education and Science represented on the Committee, as I have already mentioned. Where  would Townsville be now but for the Commonwealth  contributions in the field of education and science? A- concluding example is that the Department of the Environment, Aborigines and . the Arts, which is now responsible for tourism, is not represented on the Committee. If there is any new industry which will give employment in the country and which will earn export income in Australia, it is tourism. </para>
          <para>The motion refers to provincial cities. I wish that Australians who live outside the State capitals would rid themselves of the idea that the word &#39;city&#39; is a 4-letter word, a dirty word. The future of decentralisation in Australia depends on building Up cities. It is only in the Australian federation that one would ever use the word &#39;city&#39; as a synonym for &#39;State capital&#39;. In the American federation and in the Canadian federation one does not have this colonial definition of city&#39; as a State capital. There are more cities outside the State capitals in the United States or outside the provincial capitals in Canada than there are capitals. The future of Australia, the future comfort of the population of our State capitals, and the future prosperity of the people who still live in the country depend on building up existing centres and creating cities. </para>
          <para>I have mentioned one very clear example, that of Albury-Wodonga. It is important because it is a production and communications centre geographically&#39; midway between Canberra and Melbourne, lt is an area to which I have suggested that the Commonwealth might transfer sonic of its remaining departments in Melbourne. Perhaps I might be allowed to incorporate in Hansard a reply which the Prime Minister gave me on 3rd December last to a couple of questions I had asked without notice on this suggestion; the Prime Minister&#39;s letter giving the advice which he said, in answer to my question, he would seek from the Public Service Board: </para>

          <para>On 30 November 1971 &#39;you asked me a &#39;question relating to decentralisation and the location of Commonwealth Government Departments. </para>
          <para>Since the question was asked  I  have received  a  report from  the  Chairman  of  the Public Service Board  on tha  possible transfer  of  central offices  of  Commonwealth departments still located  in  Melbourne  to a  mid-point such  as  Albury-Wodonga Instead of  to  Canberra.  In  his advice the  Chairman of  the Board said: </para>
          <para>It is apparent that there would be significant costs in terms of departmental operating efficiency if the central offices of some departments were transferred to a&#39; country centre outside of Canberra. One major difficulty would be the recruitment and retention of a sufficient number of staff, particularly specialised and senior staff, in such a location. There would also bc direct costs, such as additional transport and communication expenses, over those arising if the units were located in Canberra or Melbourne. From the viewpoint of C.P.S. administration, therefore, the Board would have no reason to. recommend the transfer of central offices of Commonwealth Departments to A Albury Wodonga . &#39; </para>
          <para>I also undertook to make enquiries about the present position regarding the report of the Commonwealth/State Officials&#39; Committee on Decentralisation. The Report of the Committee has not yet been received by the Government. The Committee is in the course of preparing its Report which, when completed, will be for consideration by the Commonwealth and State Governments. </para>

            <para>- There is an additional reason why Albury-Wodonga should be built up. lt happens to be on a State border and the Commonwealth therefore has some constitutional powers in respect of interstate trade and commerce. There are, of course, other centres as well. We must abandon the notion that if people want occupation, accommodation or recreation, particularly if they are young people, they have to go to the State capitals. One of the saddest things in Australia is that whenever one goes to the country one finds in the local newspapers a report of a farewell party for some teenager or man or woman in his or her early 20s who is leaving for the city, by which is meant the State capital. I conclude with a resolution which was passed by my Party&#39;s last Conference in Launceston. It states: </para>
          </talk.start></continue><para>It should be ALP policy to identify a number of sites for new cities and to proceed with their development in co-operation with the relevant States to provide effective decentralisation of development, to arrest the depopulation of the countryside and to slow up the growth of our major cities. </para>

            <para>- I was most interested to hear the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> conclude by reading out <inline font-style="italic">some</inline> aspects of his Party&#39;s policy on decentralisation. This bears very closely on what has been said today because one member of his Party obviously cannot agree with that policy as he has moved for the appointment of a select committee to investigate these aspects of decentralisation. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Members of the Opposition seem surprised when the Government refuses to countenance the setting up of various select committees. But I wonder whether members of the Opposition realise just how many select committees they have proposed establishing in the life of this Parliament. I wonder whether they realise the physical problems associated with setting up and servicing that number of select committees. I think that it might be useful for the Australian people and for members of the Opposition to know the number of select committees that the Opposition has proposed during this Parliament. </para>
          <para>Proposals by the Opposition have been made to appoint select committees to inquire into the following Bills: The Loan (Qantas Airways Limited) Bill, the Air Navigation Bill, the Social Services Bill, the Superannuation Bill, the Repatriation Bill, the Social Services Bill (No. 2), the New South Wales Grant (Flood Mitigation) Bill, the Post and Telegraph Bill, the Repatriation Bill (No. 2), the Loan (War Service Land Settlement) Bill (1970) and the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits Bill .1970. </para>
          <para>The appointment of select committees has been proposed to deal with airport and harbour development, decentralisation and an amendment to the motion that the House take note of the paper - &#39;Service Employment, Committee of Inquiry&#39; seeking the appointment of a joint select committee. Not content with that, 6 motions seeking the suspension of Standing Orders to enable motions to be moved proposing the appointment of select committees have been moved by the honourable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Clyde Cameron),</inline> the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam),</inline> the honourable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden),</inline> the honourable member for Chifley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Armitage),</inline> the honourable member for Bendigo (Mi Kennedy) and the honourable member for Dawson <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Patterson).</inline> In all, 21 additional select committees have been proposed by the Opposition during the life of this Parliament. Anybody in his right senses would realise that the members of this Parliament have more to do than merely belong to select committees of this Parliament. If . every request for the appointment of a select committee proposed by the Opposition was taken up, 21 select committees would be operating in the House of Representatives. One wonders why, in this proliferation of requests for select committees, the Opposition is not brave enough to decide policies for itself and to come out and tell the Australian people what its policies are instead of hiding behind requests for the establishment of select committees which would result in other people doing the work of the Opposition for it while its members get on with the internal strife which dogs the Australian Labor Party. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Scholes)</inline> has opened up a most interesting area of debate. I agree with quite a number of things that the honourable member has said. This is an area in which we are all tremendously interested not only as members of Parliament but as dwellers in this country. The honourable member seemed surprised that the proportion of people on the land was declining. I cannot understand why this fact comes as such a surprise to members of the Opposition. The historical fact is that, as the economy of a country develops sophistication, a declining proportion of that country&#39;s population will be engaged in rural industry. This has happened everywhere in the world. Yet this development seems to come as a bit of a surprise to members of the Opposition and particularly the honourable member for Corio. It is not hard, if one thinks about it - without the need to set up a select committee - to find out the reasons for this decline. </para>
          <para>This decline has occurred not only in the numbers of people with country holdings but also in small country towns and their populations. If one investigates or thinks about this trend, it is not very difficult to come up with an answer as to the reasons for the development. There has been an accelerating technological change in the carrying on of the business of primary production all over the world. As a country becomes agriculturally more sophisticated, the technical change in the machinery which is used to produce primary products inevitably whittles away the number of human beings required to take part in agricultural production. The number of people required to perform rural work inevitably declines as technical change proliferates in country areas. But not only has this occurred but also has the demand for services in small country towns declined. </para>
          <para>Other changes occur as economic sophistication increases in a country. A most important one which has not been mentioned during this debate is the improvement in transport facilities available to country people. I refer not only to the motor car and light aircraft in more remote areas but also to the quality and extent of the road system. I come from a small country town. T can remember very clearly the numbers of horses and sulkies that were to be seen in the country areas of north western New South Wales just after the Second World War. Now, a sulky is virtually a museum piece. It would be unusual to find&#39; a horse and sulky being used anywhere in country areas. The resUlt is that people not only have the opportunity to travel more widely but also in many cases have the facility to travel and do travel more widely than they did. </para>
          <para>Where do they go? They go to the larger country areas and they go to the cities more frequently than they did in the past. I can remember when it was really a big effort to travel 330 miles from the north west of New South Wales to Sydney. One thought about this trip for some days and prepared for it most carefully. It could take up to  2  days in an old Morris car. Now one can literally hop into ones car and undertake this trip in 8 hours or less. The reason for the decline in smaller country towns, which is being called into question today, is not only that not as much farm work by country citizens is required as was in the past but also that the land owners living around the small country towns do not need the provision of the back up facilities that they had in the past. </para>
          <para>In addition, cultural opportunities for people in small country towns are limited when compared with those available in larger country towns and in cities. It is only to be expected that the brightest sons of people in country areas will look for opportunities in places where they can realise their potential. They will seek opportunities for varied and interesting jobs. In other words, the pressure on them to move from country areas will be very strong.  1  deplore this. I deplore the necessity for it. But we must face the facts - -something which the Labor Party is not noted for doing. We must realise that this will occur and we should not be surprised when it does. 1 have been emphasising ma. nl\, the situation with respect to the smaller country towns. This pressure for movement is not so great in the larger country towns which have built up a certain amount of industrialisation. Another point is that cities of a reasonable size - I. am not referring to capital cities - offer considerable attractions for people from the country. This is particularly so with respect to. seaside cities. Those people who have lived in inland Australia, particularly in the hotter area&#39;s, will know just how pleasant it is at times lo get away from the physical conditions which obtain in those areas of Australia and go to a seaside town. Job opportunities and the variety of employment offered there are much greater and this is a big incentive for people to go to the cities. In addition the cultural opportunities are much hotter for people in cities than they are in country towns, particularly the small country towns. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Corio and other honourable members have quite rightly recognised the disadvantages of city dwelling, particularly in the major cities of Melbourne and Sydney. As we have heard frequently in this chamber, land costs in those cities have risen quite markedly, forcing people to move further and further out and developing the so-called urban sprawl with ali the problems that it engenders. We have overcrowding in many areas of the cities and this again leads to a whole series of physical and psychological problems. Transport difficulties in the major cities act as a deterrent to &#39; many people who might otherwise come to the cities, and quite rightly so. It is ridiculous that one spends up to  20  per cent of one&#39;s waking hours travelling to and from work. The environmental disturbance occurring in major cities is something which is quite properly becoming much more important. People are realising that if they want to live in circumstances which appear delightful to them they must pay for efforts to overcome environmental disturbance. They are realising also that in blindly building up major cities they are making a rod for their backs. A serious problem in major cities at the moment is the increase in the crime rate. These are just some of the features of city life which act as deterrents to people coming to major cities. </para>
          <para>But let us face the situation and be honest about it. At the moment we have not only the historical pressures moving people from rural areas to city areas but also the rural crisis, the diminution of prices and. the loss of viability . of many rural enterprises. We have very strong factors moving people towards better job opportunities, a greater variety of jobs and better cultural facilities which are available to them in the cities. It will not do very much good to set up a select committee to inquire into these problems. The problems are before us and have been appreciated on both sides of the House. Why on earth would anybody set up a select committee to inquire into them? Anybody who has been a member of a select committee will know the time that it takes to conduct an investigation. The Leader of the Opposition detracts a little from this fact. He said it does not take very much time at all. The problems are more urgent than was suggested by the honourable member for Corio when moving this motion. It is just procrastination to suggest that we set up a select committee to inquire into these matters. </para>
          <para>Nothing has been said about the responsibilities of the States in this respect. It is a typical Australian Labor Party proposal - Let us centralise the whole thing and we will provide the money&#39;. It is another example of the way in which the Opposition would detract from the sovereignty of the States and the very real responsibilities of the States. Not a word was said about co-operation with the States in analysing this problem and seeking a solution. The Opposition says: &#39;Let us set up a select committee&#39; - the 21st select committee that has been proposed in 2 years, </para>
          <para>The Leader of the Opposition said that his policy was to select certain country towns. This, on the face of it, sounds tremendous. But he has not the courage to say which country towns he would select. He has not done this for the very good reason that he knows that as soon as he selects one country town or city he will have the rest of the country areas up in arms. He will gain votes in one place but lose votes in the other rural areas of Australia. Let us be perfectly frank about it. We on this side of the House, and I in the Budget debate this year, have outlined the problems of people in rural areas - and city areas - caused by the drift to the cities. I agree that there is a very real need, and I have said so, to develop growth centres in areas outside the major cities. But I cannot and will not agree that the way to do this is to set up the 21st proposed select committee of this Parliament to investigate the problems which are apparent not only to honourable members in this House but also to the State governments. The State governments have gone by the board in the measures proposed by the Opposition. Nothing has been said about the very real efforts of the New South Wales Government and its Department of Decentralisation. </para>

            <para>- We have just been listening to the authentic voice of 19th century Australian Toryism. The greatest progress that the honourable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr MacKellar)</inline> could say he had seen in the 30 or 40 years he has occupied this land was the emergence of transport from the primeval stage of the horse and sulky. No doubt if he had been articulate then he would have opposed that too, most likely as being an interference with State rights. I find that sort of view taken by the honourable member incomprehensible. It is hard to believe that honourable members on the other side of the House can continue to express that sort of view. I represent an area that is partly urban and partly rural. It is a provincial electorate. I can tell the honourable members opposite - there have been only 2 who have spoken in this debate and. incidentally, there have been none from the Country Party - that for the people I represent and for most people in the countryside this is not a matter to be put oft again and again, lt is a serious human problem which is best expressed by :the simple term &#34;heartbreak&#39;. This is something which is often felt by families when ;they lose their children to the metropolis at the end of their school days. </para>

              <para>- I am not being abusive. I am pointing out a few facts. The honourable member for Warringah said: We think there are things more urgent than setting up a select committee&#39;. He rubbished the whole idea of a select committee. He said that the Opposition had moved for &#39;.he establishment of 21 select committees, but what he did not point out was that the Government had knocked back every one of them because it does not want to educate itself on the problems of the Australian people or on the remedies. It has refused to accept advice from outside. It is a typical, complacent Tory government; it could not care less. The honourable member for Warringah said that a select committee is not appropriate because it is an urgent matter but be did not, of course, amend the motion the Opposition has moved. Nor did he explain why, if this problem was being treated so seriously, the Government&#39;s committee has been mee&#39; ing with State officials for 7 years. It has met 4 times in 7 years and it still has not produced a report on decentralisation for the Australian people and the Government to study. This shows how urgent decentralisation is to honourable members opposite. There is not enough time left in this debate - only 5 minutes remain - for me to go much further. The simple point that the Opposition is making is that there is an urgent need for effective Commonwealth action on decentralisation We all have the chance by accepting this motion to inform ourselves so that we can decide what we can do about it. This is an opportunity for all Paries to be represented, including the Country Party, whose representatives have been as silent as the grave today. They have nothing to contribute except a request that their dwindling farm vote be made even more secure against population changes in the future. There are Liberal members who represent rural areas. The honourable member for Ballaarat <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Erwin)</inline> should be concerned about the economic position of the provincial city which he represents. He has nothing to say. He will not support a move in this Parliament today to set up a committee on decentralisation. The honourable member for Ballaarat should at some time, either on the adjournment or during this debate, express his views on decentralisation. </para>

              <para>- I would not like to prick the honourable member too often either. There are many things which can be done. We are putting a very simple proposition to the House and to the Government today, lt is tha! there should be a select committee from all parties because unless we accept that there must be Commonwealth participation in decentralisation there will be no decentralisation. There will be a continuing over-centralisation of population in city regions and a continuation of stagnation in rural and provincial areas. That is a simple proposition. Does the Government support decentralisation or does it not? If it does it should do something about it and not keep up the delaying action which has now been going on for at least 7 years so far as the State and Commonwealth officials committee is concerned. Because of a shortage of time there is not much more I can say although there is a lot I would like to say. 1 am particularly concerned about this situation but I have agreed to let the honourable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Grassby)</inline> speak briefly on the subject also. </para>

            <para>-  I think that the honourable member for Warringah <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr MacKellar)</inline> made the most powerful point that emerged in this debate when he pointed out that this method of attempting to formulate policy by the Labor Party </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Opposition is really no policy whatsoever. He pointed out that there were some 22 attempts by the Opposition to set up select committees or the like in order to examine certain aspects of government. It has been, . I think, very plain in the last year or two that the Opposition cannot devise policy with any precision and has to resort to this technique in coming in .here and speaking very superficially and loosely about difficult matters such as social questions, political questions and  economic questions and speaking very superficially also upon the motion that a committee ought to be set up. I submit that that is no substitute for policy but only a trick or a device that is used by the Opposition. Obviously honourable members opposite regard it as a good device but it is only a device used to cover up a lack of policy. I suggest that it Would be more appropriate for a Party  which holds itself out to be the alternative government of this country to sit down and do the hard work itself, devise a policy with some precision and bring it into this place, have it debated and not simply run away and suggest that a committee ought to be set up. </para>
          <para>I will speak further on this matter because I think it is an important one and it is time that it was examined. The honourable member opposite who is looking at me now is a great advocate in this place for the setting up of numbers of committees. I think we have to face fairly and squarely the fact that there is a limit to the number of committees that can be set up. There is a limit to the time which honourable members can spend on committees. They have many other functions and I do not have to tell honourable members that. They have their electoral problems, they have to participate in the debates of this House and they have to write their speeches. Presumably they have to discuss policy - at least we on this side do - </para>

            <para>- It is with a very great element of delight- 1 will not say with an element of surprise - that 1 rise to support the motion. 1 support the Government very sincerely in its attitude to this problem of non-metropolitan unemployment and I. support the measures that the Government has taken to deal with the problem. I think it is probably true to say that we have grown unused to a rapid response to a quickly emerging situation by the huge monolithic, almost amorphous masses that modern day governments have become. It is to the credit of the Ministers and the Government that such rapid action has been taken in this field. The philosophy of the scheme has already been spelt out in a fine statement by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> to the Parliament. At the risk of being repetitious 1 wish to look briefly at the philosophy behind the scheme. It is true that its implication is a short term one. It aims to take immediate action to help correct a problem that is not part of the overall economy of the nation. It aims to fill a gap before such measures as rural reconstruction, rural retraining, marginal dairying measures and new wool policies emerge, and before any of these longer term and more fundamental schemes start to bite into the rural economy. So we are faced with a hiatus period in which problems exist in certain regional areas. The scheme attempts to deal with the newly emerging problem of those areas so defined. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Government aims to take specific action on a specific problem that applies intensely to specific areas of the economy. It will aid in relieving general hardship that has occurred in provincial centres and areas where the unemployment rate is very much higher than it is in metropolitan areas. Let me expand on that a little. It is apparent to all honourable members who have journeyed from main capital city areas to provincial centres such as Bendigo, Ballarat, Newcastle, Murray Bridge or Renmark, that the squeeze on the rural industries, which has come about largely because the failure of prices for agricultural commodities to rise on overseas market has rubbed off on the home markets. It is not only those on rural blocks in these important provincial areas who are feeling the pinch. It is for this sort of reason that, to a degree - and to a degree only - the Government has decided to pour in funds at the rate of $2m a month to these areas. </para>
          <para>I think that the added importance of this scheme is that it is not only the farmers who are feeling the squeeze but it is also the main street traders - the butcher, the baker and the candlestick maker - and all those who are in business in these provincial centres. The scheme probably would not be a good one if it aimed to perpetuate jobs and employment in areas over and above the potential of those areas in the years to come. But it is proper that this investment in the education and training of people, and the expertise of people there, should not be lost to those areas. It is very important that, to a level, the facilities that are offered in those centres today should continue and increase so that. in time to come, when economic circumstances may well have changed; those areas of Australia with clean air, with beauty, with trees and with good facilities will have the capacity to attract people from some of the overcrowded cities with their smog problems and their dis economies of scale. </para>
          <para>It is becoming more apparent now than ever, before that dis economies of scale, such as 3-level highways running through Los Angeles, amount to the investment of an enormous sum per person. If we can provide facilities in regional areas and provincial cities it will be to the ultimate advantage of Australia. I am not saying that the Government should go overboard in promoting the use of taxpayers&#39; funds in areas that arc not economic. What I am saying is that this is one of a series of schemes fitting into a pattern that will hold out some hope to these areas in the future and will provide more liquidity for their main street shops and their facilities than they otherwise would have. It is worthy of note that this scheme introduced by the Government - it is a completely new piece of thinking - is limited in time to 30th June 1973. It is important that the House take note of this fact. It is limited to that time because we are not going to see or feel much benefit from rural reconstruction, rural retraining, marginal dairying measures or new wool policies for some time. It is right that, during the hiatus, the Government should firstly recognise that the problem exists and, secondly, do something about it. </para>
          <para>Having discussed my idea of the practical philosophy behind the scheme let me now move on to the administration of it. Only yesterday the Federal Government completed its discussions with the States on the administration of this scheme. I believe that certain facts are still undecided and need further clarification, but the Government has at this point of time tied in the major elements of this scheme with the States. Having nominally accepted the scheme the States now have to - in accordance with their function and their jurisdiction - draw up proper priorities for the use of the amount of taxpayers&#39; funds provided for this purpose. Nobody would doubt that the States have more local expertise to decide whether work should be done on a major bridge at one provincial centre or on a toilet block somewhere else. That is not the sort of priority that we in this Parliament should decide.It is proper that the State governments should look at this and give advice. So the position is quite clearly that the Commonwealth has made available taxpayers&#39; funds for this use, and now the States have to draw up proper priorities for the use of these funds. </para>
          <para>It is to be hoped that most of this capital amount will go to local government authorities for their use in certain areas. I think it is worth mentioning in passing that local government authorities have already had quite a slice of taxpayers&#39; funds in the past from drought aid that has been made available I think the granting of funds for drought relief purposes in different States has been very valuable to the Government. First of all. the Government has learnt a lot of the pitfalls from the use of capital in this way. Secondly it has had a look to see what projects can be worth while and what are a waste of money when administered by local government authorities. I hope these lessons are learnt and I hope that perhaps some labour that is skilled rather than unskilled will be available to local government authorities now so that more worthwhile projects can be undertaken. </para>
          <para>There is, I gather, some area of disagreement in the thinking of the Parliament in general as regards the proportion of these funds that should be used for particular purposes. The Prime Minister in his statement mentioned the fact that- preferably no more than  25  per cent of these funds should be used for equipment and like purposes. This assistance is similar to the drought aid given in the past; it is meant for labour intensive projects. I would say in passing that 1 would have though there could well be a need for more than 25 per cent of the funds to be expended on equipment, depending on what projects are undertaken. There are only 2 ways in which funds in addition to 25 per cent of what is provided by the Commonwealth can be found for equipment. Either the States find them or there will be a request to this Government to provide added expenditure for that purpose. I see no problem involved in this. I note the fact that the maximum amount of elasticity has been left, according to the Prime Minister&#39;s statement, to. cope with just this sort of emergency. Although the sum of $2m a month has been mentioned in this statement, it will be adjustable from time to time according to the requirements of the situation. </para>
          <para>I have figures to hand which give the proportion of unemployed State by State in metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas. One quick look at these figures shows quite clearly that New South Wales, with nearly 9,000 unemployed in the metropolitan area, has a far greater number of unemployed. 11,700, in non-metropolitan areas. Different patterns emerge State by State. The situation in South Australia is at the opposite extreme from the figures I have quoted. In South Australia 72 per cent of unemployed are in the metropolitan area and 27 per cent are in the country, which is markedly different from the New South Wales position. I would just say in passing that I believe the Government must look carefully at the reasons for these figures. Not the least of the reasons for these figures is that three-quarters of the population of South Australia lives in Adelaide. In addition, a satellite city such as Elizabeth tends to distort the overall picture. I believe that a special allowance will be made for these circumstances. It certainly should be. In New South Wales, for instance, cities such as Newcastle and Wollongong, which are virtually the size of Adelaide, in terms of the definition in this statement would be provincial centres. I believe on the one hand that we must look at the statistics and their importance, but on the other hand 1 believe there must obviously be some re-patterning of the disbursement of this capital sum in order to achieve some fairness of distribution. </para>
          <para>May I. finish up my remarks by saying that I give very great credit to the Government for acting so promptly in a specific area of need where assistance is necessary. I cannot remember any other occasion on which such aid has been directed so unerringly to the area where it is necessary. I see this assistance as part of an overall pattern. Not only do I see this as part of the pattern of the economic circumstances of the country and the Government&#39;s attempts to control inflation but also I see this as part of the pattern of the resurrection and the promoting of a more healthy rural atmosphere in years to come. It is an integral short term important part of this programme. I congratulate the Government and support it heavily in its ideas behind this scheme. </para>

            <para>- I move the following amendment to the motion that the House take note of the paper: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>That the following words be added to the motion: aird urges the Government to initiate immediate discussions with the States so that the first grants under this programme can be made before Christmas and further urges the Government, at the some time, to confer with the Slates to ensure the resumption of the rural reconstruction scheme now halted by lack of finance in  the  various Slates. The House regrets that the Government has not made provision to extend unemployment assistance to alleviate problems of growing unemployment in metropolitan areas with particular emphasis on. the problems and placement of school leavers which can be accentuated as a result of poor employment conditions in the country areas&#39;. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">A week ago the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> announced in the Parliament a programme to make money available to the Slates for the relief of unemployment in non-metropolitan areas. The Prime Minister in announcing the grants made the point that much of this non metropolitan unemployment is of a structural kind. For this reason it required specific rather than general economic measures to deal with it. Undoubtedly, this is correct. Brit the Prime Minister ignored the fact that these pockets of structural unemployment feel in heightened form the impact of general economic measures to reduce demand across the board. This sort of structural unemployment does not respond to broad economic stimulus. But it would be foolish to argue from this that these pockets of rural unemployment do not feel the impact of general economic measures to dampen the economy and reduce demand. The unfortunate people in rural areas are in the invidious position of feeling chill winds from both structural unemployment and the general reduction in economic activity. They are cushioned only against the beneficial effects of a revival in economic activity produced by broad economic policy. For this reason it is unfortunate that the Government should have delayed for so long in applying these grants. </para>
          <para>The Prime Minister implied that structural unemployment in rural industries is a new phenomenon, that it has emerged in -dramatic form only since the last Budget and that the Government had acted swiftly to crush it. This interpretation just does not square with the facts. Unemployment of this sort has been a factor for several years. It is part of much broader social  and economic changes in country areas which have occurred in the past 10 years. The scope of these basic changes is beyond this debate, but a majority of small country centres have been so affected that even a small change in the composition of the work force spreads hardship in the community. These changes may take the form of minor changes in the policy of a State Government or a commercial firm, for example a decision to concentrate staff at a larger centre. More sweeping changes may result from important switches in Commonwealth Government policy. </para>
          <para>An example is the proposed reorganisation of postal services throughout the Commonwealth; this may involve the transfer of only a few personnel and families but it can have a serious impact on economic activity in a small community. These changes of the past few years have increased the difficulties caused by the structural changes in world markets and the Australian rural industries. </para>
          <para>Now the general downturn in employment and economic activity flowing from deliberate budgetary policy have added to economic hardship in non-rural communities. lt is difficult to assess the full magnitude of this sort of unemployment because figures on the size of the work force !n rural centres are hard to get. The monthly statistics issued by the Department of Labour and National Service give the raw figures in important rural subdivisions for registered unemployed, registered vacancies and recipients of unemployment benefit, lt does not give any estimate of the size of the work force in these subdivisions. The latest work force figures available from the Department arc estimates made at the end of the 1969-70 financial year. It is possible from these to get an idea&#39; of unemployment in key rural centres. Using the September unemployment figures and these work force estimates, unemployment in Dubbo was 2.62 per cent, in Ballarat 2.29 per cent, in Bendigo 1.84 per cent, and Toowoomba 1.78 percent. </para>
          <para>Admittedly these examples are somewhat crude but they do give an indication of how unemployment in major regional centres is considerably above  the long term national average on which the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden)</inline> relies. With this sort of structural unemployment the first drift is to the major provincial centres. When unemployment builds up in these centres, as it clearly has in the 4 centres I have cited, the next drift is to the major cities. This adds to the pressures on employment in the metropolitan centres. For- this reason remedial action to curb structural unemployment in the country has the effect of alleviating unemployment and economic hardship in the cities. lt is not possible to divide unemployment into separate compartments as implied in the Prime Minister&#39;s statement. This brings me to the first point contained in the amendment moved by the Opposition. It is designed to clear away the deliberate vagueness which the Government has encouraged &#39; about the time scale of this programme of grants. These grants cannot be regarded as a measure to stimulate economic activity in areas affected by structural unemployment. At best it is a relief measure in the form of a holding operation to prevent further deterioration in these areas. The money will go via the States to local government authorities for public works. The point that concerns the Opposition is the lapse of time before the impact of this spending is felt in the communities the grants have been designed to help. </para>
          <para>The time scale outlined by the Prime Minister is extremely unsatisfactory. He said that the Government envisaged an arrangement providing for grants for employ men creating activities to be made to&#39; the States for the period up to 30th June 1973 subject to review after the end of the 1971-72 financial year. However, legislation for the grants will not be introduced until the autumn session of Parliament which begins on 22nd February. In the interim, temporary arrangements would be made for financing the scheme. It is the duty of the Government to spell out clearly this extremely vague : pledge of temporary financing. Does it mean that the Commonwealth will underwrite- advance grants made to the States? Alternatively, is it intended to divert some of the funds made available to the States for the rural reconstruction scheme to relief of rural unemployment? If either of these courses is intended by the Government, there has been no sign of action by any of the State governments to get the scheme going. The State Premiers are not to blame for this; presumably they are still waiting for the Commonwealth to elaborate on its proposals. </para>
          <para>The overwhelming impression to be got from the way the Government has approached this relief measures is that it does not regard them as a matter of urgency. If the Government wanted to get legislation through the Parliament to get this scheme going before the end of the season it could have done so. It would have had the full co-operation of the Opposition in securing the passing of the enabling Bills through the Parliament. In marked contrast to the speed with which legislation to assist the wool industry was drafted and shepherded through the Parliament by the Government, there is a complete lack of urgency about getting this scheme to work. Unless there is evidence of a much greater will on the part of the Government to get the States moving, it will be months before any benefit is felt from these relief grants. At the earliest, legislation to authorise, the grants to the States will not clear the Parliament until March. </para>
          <para>By the time unemployment in rural areas is assessed by the States and the grants transmitted to local government bodies, it will be near the end of the financial year. On the time scale indicated by the Prime Minister, it will be at least 6 months before this so called emergency assistance is transmitted to areas of need. The programme will then be subject to the review referred to in the Prime Minister&#39;s statement* This is hardly evidence of swift, decisive and humane action to bolster communities afflicted by rural unemployment.&#39; For this reason the Opposition has moved that the House urges on the. Government the importance of getting down with the States to the task of assessing structural unemployment, selecting the areas of greatest, need and getting the first grants out before the end of the year. Unless this is done this relief scheme .will have no impact whatsoever on the crucial January and February period when &#39;...... of thousands of school leavers will be looking for jobs. All school leavers will be feeling the crunch of a tighter economy. The plight of country children leaving school will be particularly acute because of the structural unemployment outlined in the Prime Minister&#39;s statement. </para>
          <para>In summary, millions of dollars have been made available in recent months to assist the wool industry. The honourable member for Dawson <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Patterson)</inline> has made the point repeatedly that most of this assistance is not going to the country areas where its need is most vital. Far too much of this assistance has gone back to the finance companies and pastoral companies in the cities. Assistance has gone to wealthy graziers at the expense of the small growers who are in greatest need. But assistance by the Government in this form was promptly accepted and translated rapidly into effective action. When  a  measure is introduced to provide employment for rural workers caught through no fault of their own in the massive restructuring of the rural industries and the rural community, the Government&#39;s response is contemptible lethargic. </para>
          <para>There are 2 other points in the Opposition&#39;s amendment which 1 want to refer to briefly before they are treated in greater detail by my colleagues. The first is the need for consultations with the States on getting the rural reconstruction scheme into effective operation. Honourable members will recall that under this scheme $10Om was to be allocated to the States over 4 years for rural reconstruction. This assistance was allocated for debt reconstruction, for building up farms into economic holdings, and for rehabilitation of those forced off the land. It is not possible to assess the overall impact of the scheme because of the time lag between approval of reconstruction plans and the spending of assistance provided. Quite obviously there are difficulties between the Commonwealth, and the States in the implementation of the scheme. There are difficulties in the interest rates applied by the Commonwealth; the rate for farm build-up is <inline font-style="italic">6i</inline> per cent compared with 4 per cent for debt reconstruction. This means that debt reconstruction is much more attractive and is favoured by rural producers. </para>
          <para>However, the Commonwealth wants an approximately equal allocation of funds between debt reconstruction and farm build-up. Applications from farmers have shown that this is not feasible and that most want debt reconstruction assistance. For example, only 9 per cent of applications for assistance under the scheme in Victoria and New South Wales have been for farm build-up. Because of Commonwealth policy these States have had to reject many applicants seeking debt reconstruction assistance. These are matters which must be sorted out between the Commonwealth and the States so full benefit is derived from these rural reconstruction measures. Under the terms of the Act a review of the scheme is to take place in time to allow any changes to be brought into operation by 1st July 1972. This review should be undertaken immediately to allow funds allocated for farm build-up to be redirected towards debt reconstruction in accordance with the relative demands for these 2 types of assistance. </para>
          <para>The final point which I earlier referred to indirectly was the growth of unemployment in metropolitan areas. This is relevant to the Prime Minister&#39;s statement because metropolitan and non-metropolitan unemployment cannot be separated into 2 distinct spheres. There is a constant process of movement of labour between the two. Many workers will .not linger in depressed rural areas if they see any chance of getting a job in the city. The creation of extra employment in the country must ease the strains on the labour market in the cities. Growing unemployment in the cities is a problem which has not been recognised by the Government. On the evidence of those receiving unemployment benefit, basic unemployment is increasing much faster in the cities than in the country. These statistics are important because they indicate the gut element of unemployment which is not reflected in these figures. </para>
          <para>Registration of unemployed and job vacancies gives a measure of the buoyancy or otherwise of the labour market. The numbers getting unemployment benefits indicates the extent of economic hardship flowing from a tight labour market. If the numbers drawing the benefit are compared, it becomes clear that in all States except South Australia and Tasmania, metropolitan unemployment is rising much faster than non-metropolitan unemployment. </para>
          <para>Looking at these figures for the end of October 1971 and comparing them with the end of October 1970, in New South Wales those on benefits increased by 115 per cent in metropolitan areas and 53 per cent in non-metropolitan areas. In Victoria the increases were 185 per cent and 101 per cent; in Queensland 93 per cent and minus 1 per cent; and in Western Australia 242 per cent and 92 per cent. This shows quite dramatically that hard-core unemployment is rising much more rapidly in the major cities than in the country. In Tasmania the increase is much the same for metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas at 153 per cent and 160 per cent. In South Australia, the increase is the lowest in Australia for metropolitan areas; it is 33 per cent compared with 91 per cent for non-metropolitan areas. </para>

              <para>- -He is hopelessly out of touch. Every time the Government brings something forward a member of the Labor Party nearly always moves that all words after &#39;that&#39; in the motion &#39;That the House take note of the paper&#39; be omitted and that certain words be inserted in their place. It does not matter what the Government puts up, although members of the Labor Party had not thought of a proposal before, they think it should be improved. Legislation which was introduced to enable the Commonwealth to make grants for homes for the aged is a perfect example of what I am saying. No Labor government has ever thought of giving grants of a &#163;1 for &#163;1 or a dollar for dollar basis, or a $2 for $1 basis as it is now, for homes for the aged. But the moment the Government introduced the scheme Labor wanted the grants to be increased and increased. If the Labor Party had been in power it would not have thought of this scheme. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>I would like to show bow far the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is out of touch with his amendment. The fact of the matter is that the meeting of Commonwealth and Stale officials proposed in the Prime Ministers statement was requested by letters to the Premiers on 1st December, the day before the Prime Minister made the statement. This meeting was held in Canberra yesterday. However, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in his amendment is advocating such a meeting. 1 repeat that the meeting was held yesterday and decided to take certain action. The States are willing, I understand, to cooperate to the fullest extent in regard to using the money that has been made available to overcome, as much as possible, unemployment in rural areas. It is a strange thing that a man who is the Deputy Leader of an Opposition does not keep up to date with events and know what is happening. I put it very definitely that members of the Australian Country Party and the Liberal Party - perhaps I should say the coalition Government in order to include both Parties - are delighted with the statement. Honourable members who sit behind me and other honourable members who represent rural areas are delighted because, after all, no Country Party man in a State Parliament or the Federal Parliament represents a city or metropolitan constituency. We all represent rural constituencies. Therefore, this statement has been welcomed very warmly indeed. I hope that it will give the best possible deal to people who are unemployed in country areas. </para>
          <para>The measures outlined in the statement will help to alleviate unemployment in city areas because if we can stop country workers going to the cities there will be more jobs for those people who love to live in the cities. Many people are attracted to the cities by the bright lights. I know of many people who are attracted to cities because of the better amenities offered by them. Many a man in the country says that he has to get work for his boys and girls somewhere and that be will go to a city because of the greater opportunities offered there. Most cities are what we call spoon fed and the country has had to battle for itself over many many years. </para>
          <para>The Labor Party immediately finds fault with any little thing like this that is done for people in country areas. Members of the Opposition cast suspicion on such a proposal. They ask when the country areas will get the money. At the discussion held yesterday to which I have referred, and which evidently was not known to members of the Opposition and definitely was not known to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the position was set out and clarified and generally speaking it is likely that the scheme will be operating at a very early date. As a matter of fact, the scheme could be in operation before Christmas. It is possible that some money will be made available before then, I suggest especially through local government. </para>
          <para>It has been said that nothing will be done until the end of the financial year. What greater thing could one do to try to damn the whole scheme than to make this sort of statement? It is just ridiculous when an honourable member comes into the House and makes such statements about this great country that has depended so much in the past on its rural development and its rural products. The secondary industries buy their raw materials with money chiefly derived from the sale of primary products overseas. I refer here to our exports of wheat, wool, dried fruit and other primary products of the soil that build up our balance of payments and our overseas reserves. This money comes back in the form of goods and raw materials without which secondary industry could not operate successfully. Therefore the Government has shown a national outlook in bringing a statement like this forward for the good of the whole community. After all. Australia is still so very, very dependent on its primary industries. </para>
          <para>I want to say something about how this money is to be spent. We should be able to spend it to a dual advantage. Firstly, 1 think that the money should be used to relieve unemployment. To be unemployed is one of the most distressing things that can happen to a man, especially if he has a family. Therefore, under this measure we should be able to give him some relief and some employment. But I believe it would be desirable if we could employ him in such a way that a dual advantage can be gained. For instance, men could be employed in building up tourist facilities and for local government projects. This money should be used as much as possible, where appropriate, on the pipe lining of water.  1  have said often in this House that in the electorate of Mallee, which I represent, more than 90 per cent of the water which goes from the reservoirs or the water storages to the consumers is lost through seepage and evaporation and, therefore, pipe lining must come. It will come sooner or later. If water is pipe lined from all our reservoirs it would be equal to duplicating the reservoirs. </para>
          <para>I have said many times that the priorities that I have proposed should be accepted. The first priority is defence; because what is the good of having anything in this country - a democratic government or parliament - if it cannot be protected? The second priority which I put forward is primary industry with which is associated water conservation in many cases. These are the definitive priorities that I. have suggested, but as soon as I have done so, someone has called out: What about education, social services, hospitalisation and all these benefits?&#39; It is from the products of the soil that much of the money comes from with which these things can be purchased and from which the Government can give people who are unable to fend for themselves a better deal. Therefore. I believe that the priorities I have put forward are in the best interests of this nation. The pipe lining of water is a definite proposition for attention. </para>

              <para>- But 1 have referred to it. I have pointed out that the meeting between the States and the Commonwealth that is sought by the amendment took place yesterday. Surely the honourable member for Riverina remembers me saying that. Therefore, the amendment is out of order; it is too late; the point is over because the meeting has taken place. It was decided at that meeting to do certain things in the best possible interests of this country. I believe that the proposals outlined in the statement will give great succour to the people in the country and will provide employment. I know that big machinery has caused a lot of unemployment in the past in rural areas because not so many people are required. But our country towns are rural . areas. In those towns, of course, conditions have not been very good and I believe that money spent in the right direction in country towns will assist considerably in the general outlook. I heard recently of a man who was talking about how much he liked the country. He lived in the city and someone asked him: Why do you not live in the country?&#39; He said: &#39;I am living in the city so that I can make enough money for when I retire to enable me to live in the country&#39;. This is the whole problem; the economic conditions are so much better in the cities. But I think it was Henry Lawson who said: </para>

I mention in passing a factor that can help the country areas. What could help the country most is related to a question I asked this morning, namely, that when a redistribution of Federal electorates is proposed the 20 per cent over or 20 per cent under of the quota be implemented. After all, someone said that it does not matter how big an electorate is; it is what the people do in it. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> you, perhaps better than anyone, would know that nothing counts much but votes. A person can advocate anything he likes but it is the vote that determines a matter.

              <para>- The honourable member agrees with that because it is the vote that counts. It is the vote that first of all puts a man into Parliament and afterwards, when he gets into Parliament, he soon finds out that the vote determines whether he will get something implemented.

              <para>- No, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker.</inline> I understand that the abstruseness of some members is difficult to follow. I would not in any way reflect upon the Chair at any time. The amendment, of course, is designed to do one particular thing, namely, to ensure that there is some effective action before the Christmas period. This is the whole intent of this amendment. The Commonwealth Parliament has no business going into recess for2&#189; months unless there is a definite assurance of action to stimulate the rural economy before Christmas. I am unimpressed with the dedication of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> to this matter because, although it is his statement we are debating, we have not seen him. Indeed, for the most of this debate there has been one sole survivor of the Liberal Party ministry in the chamber and the most junior Minister, with due respect to my distinguished friend at the table, the Minister for Supply, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Garland.</inline> Even he was missing from the chamber for most of the time that the honourable member for Mallee was speaking. I do not blame him for that at all. I am pointing out that very little weight is being given to this matter of getting some action in the countryside before Christmas. There have been many interjections which I am quite interested to hear from the members on my left who comprise an interesting tribal rock musical and who say in chorus that there are no problems which are not being tackled and not being taken care of. I do not see it this way, and neither does the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition or any other member of the Opposition. </para>

          <para>Last week in this House the Prime Minister and his team debated a motion that was designed to deal with the economy. We were assured for most of that day that there were no real problems with the economy; that there was nothing which was not being attended to or taken care of. We had question time 2 hours before the Prime Minister came into this chamber to make a statement on rural unemployment. In answer to a question at question time the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden)</inline> indicated that there were no real worries and no real indication of any action being necessary. In fact, he specifically indicated that no action would be taken. But 2 hours later the Prime Minister sneaked in, unheralded and unannounced after the suspension of the sitting for lunch, and made a statement which, of course, was welcome, provided that it achieves something. But let us also be clear that all it really does is to provide some finance at some time in the future - perhaps in the new year - which will give jobs to one in four people who are employed in the country areas. That is all. If honourable members on my left are happy and content with that, then I wish them well when they go home for Christmas. When the statement, was made by the Prime Minister, I immediately sought an assurance that this House would not go into recess without debating the statement. I made it plain that my attitude on leaving the question of unemployment grants as unfinished business until next year was totally unacceptable to me and the colleagues with whom I sit on this side of the chamber. I might say that the only response we received was that perhaps arrangements might be made to debate the statement. So the motion, or the actual amendment, to be more precise, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker</inline> - and I am always grateful for your guidance - that we are discussing today is the amendment which has come forward from the Opposition. </para>

              <para>- Yes. Of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> you are exactly correct. I was referring particularly to the motion. When we come to discuss the motion and the amendment together, let us be quite clear that if it had not been for the demands of members of the Opposition this matter would not have come before the House at all before we adjourned. I want to draw attention to the realities of the situation as they exist at the present time. The Premier of New South Wales has been insistent that there should be a conference before Christmas - -before the Commonwealth Parliament adjourns and before the State parliaments adjourn - because he has said that in fact there is an urgent need for finance to relieve unemployment in New South Wales rural areas. He made that statement after the wheat crop virtually had failed. He made it as a plea, and he has not apologised for doing so. In this instance .the Premier of New South Wales had the unanimous support of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly - all members of all Parties; the Liberal Party, the Country Party and the Australian Labor Party. So it is an indisputable fact that they are concerned but, of course, honourable members on the Government side in this Parliament do not seem to be concerned at all. The Premier of New South Wales has indicated that there is an urgent need for this sort of action. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Let us just see what the Prime Minister said in his statement. He indicated that in co-operation with the State governments the Commonwealth already had provided massive assistance. Every State government in the Commonwealth has contested the Prime Minister&#39;s assessment of the situation. Every Minister in charge of rural reconstruction already has decided that the rural reconstruction scheme is in a hopeless situation and has halted. They have said that we need an urgent conference to get it going again. Do not forget that what we are referring to is rural unemployment. We are referring to a rural situation which is real. Honourable members opposite say that all that the members of the Opposition in the Federal Parliament are doing is drawing attention to difficulties. The difficulties have already been drawn to their attention without success at the present time, by every State government and by all the Ministers responsible for rural reconstruction, but all that honourable members opposite have said is: &#39;You are wrong and only we are right.&#39; What an incredible situation. </para>
          <para>Let us refer to the Prime Minister&#39;s statement and to what prompted us to move this amendment. This is what the Prime Minister said: </para>
          <para>On  the assumption that these proposals will be acceptable in principle to the Premiers we shall require  to  bring forward  to  the House early,  in the autumn session legislation to autherise the necessary grants to the States. Meanwhile, however, temporary arrangements will be made for the financing of the scheme in the interim. </para>
          <para class="block">There is no undertaking as to what is to be done before the end of the year, before Christmas, and of course we are dealing with people and families who are suffering hardship. Those are not abstractions. This is not a sordid political party ploy. We are dealing with the realities of hardship and difficulty at the present time. The majority of the Premiers have called for action before Christmas. The Ministers in charge of rural reconstruction met in Melbourne. It is of interest to note that the Victorian Minister for Lands, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Borthwick,</inline> complained bitterly about the inflexibility of the rural reconstruction scheme and the difficulties associated with it. This was said. It is not suggested that the Government of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Bolte is a radical Labor administration. The Victorian Government is complaining because even it concedes that there are really serious hardships at the present time. I have referred already to the position in New South Wales. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition has spoken of the difficulties in Tasmania. In every State of the Commonwealth we have these problems, and of course they stem from the rural crisis. </para>
          <para>The interesting thing is that not only the Premiers and the Ministers in charge of rural reconstruction but also some of the really enthusiastic long term supporters of the Government are concerned about this matter. Let me quote what was said by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Norman</inline> Giles, who is head of the Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort complex. He is a long time supporter of the present administration. He said that the rural reconstruction scheme is becoming &#39;a dangerous flop&#39;. The situation is that we face this crisis of confidence and collateral which the Prime Minister has done very little to dissipate. Let us also be clear that not only did he promise us some pie, inadequate pie, in the new year - only enough finance to provide jobs for one in four of the unemployed people in rural areas, and no date as to when the assistance will be provided has been given to this Parliament - but he also appeared on national television on Monday night of this week and announced and unveiled his plan for the future of the countryside. It should be mentioned today that the Prime Minister is going to move up to 14,000 wool growers which, of course, means that, including their families, 40,000 people will be affected. On the ratio of 1 to 4 in terms of producers to the people who serve them and support them in country areas, the number of people affected will approach 100,000. This is the number which the Prime Minister of this nation has decided should move out of rural areas. As a matter of fact, I put on the notice paper today a question in which I asked the Prime Minister whether he intends to move these people out in special refugee trains. I asked him, in particular, not to use sheep trucks because this would be adding insult to injury. I asked him whether he is going to set up refugee camps in the capital cities, because do not forget that all he has offered is a loan of $1,000, on terms to be determined, for those wool growers who have to go. This is the programme which the Prime Minister unveiled last Monday night. If honourable members opposite like it, I say to them: &#39;You wear it&#39;. But as far as we are concerned, we reject the Prime Minister and his philosophy. </para>

              <para>- The honourable member for Paterson indicates that there are no difficulties in his electorate. By way of example let me refer to the city of Wagga Wagga. The total number of people registered as being unemployed in Wagga Wagga at the present time is 638. This is the highest figure in New South Wales, and I might say that it is the highest in 2 generations. I must also say to honourable members opposite who do not seem to go home very often that in many areas of New South Wales, in particular, there are no offices of the Department of Labour and National Service at which one can register as being unemployed. There are no offices at all between the Mumimbidgee and the Murray. So the unemployment figures have been underestimated quite dramatically. We have a situation where, at the end of this day, we are being asked to go home to our various electorates which have been in more trouble than for 2 generations as a result of this Government&#39;s policies and say to our electors that the Parliament was a bit too busy. The Prime Minister could not enter into the debate. He is not here. He has been missing. I do not know where he is. But certainly as this is his statement he should be here. </para>

              <para>- Perhaps he is. I am sure that the right honourable gentleman will have a pleasant Christmas at home with his family, though he is only temporarily employed. I think that this is a very poor expression of the concern of the national Parliament. It shows that we at this time have little regard for this problem that is a real and harsh one. It seems to me that we live in a world of unreality. Supporters of the Government deny that any of these real problems exist and say that there is no reason why we should express our concern. I would have been ashamed to go home not having expressed my concern and not having asked for some action to be initiated before Christmas and before the end of the year. We will not meet until 22nd February of next year. But the unemployment- </para>

              <para>- I and my colleagues would be happy to sit the whole of next week to find out exactly what is intended, what we intend to do and what the plans are. Let us discuss them again. During the last 24 months, I have listened to some unholy rubbish debated over a long period in this Parliament. It was rubbish that is irrelevant to the realities of our national situation and the situation in our electorates. I resent the fact that tuy time was wasted. I resent the fact that we have not tackled the  Teal  problems of our community as they exist  at  the present time. The problem of the unemployed is not a passing one. The problem is not one that we can laugh at, joke about or pass off with little smart comments about what we may have done or we may not have done. I may say that this amendment was not introduced  in  a sense of carping criticism of the Government- </para>

              <para>-Order! That is not a basis on which to raise a point of order. The honourable member for Mallee has been here long enough to know that. I consider that his action was a deliberate attempt to run out the time of the honourable member for Riverina. It was totally irresponsible. - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr GRASSBY- Mr Deputy Speaker--</inline></para>

            <para>- .1 congratulate the honourable member for Mallee <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Turnbull)</inline> for the charity that he has shown in putting up for as long as he did with the speech of the honourable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Grassby).</inline> While the honourable member for Mallee was speaking the honourable member for Riverina took several spurious points of order as to whether the honourable member was debating the motion or the amendment. I fail to remember any real point in the speech of the honourable member for Riverina that was on this subject at all.  His  speech certainly had nothing to do with the motion or the statement delivered by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> which is what we are really debating. It would appear to me that Opposition members are acting like a Jot of spoilt children who have just had their ice creams taken away from them. This subject was to be their calamity howler when they returned home at Christmas time, so that they could really spread the muck around the country areas. </para>

              <para>- The Prime Minister came in and presented this most welcome and timely announcement which has been very well received right throughout Australia and has taken from Opposition members their opportunity to create this nice little calamity situation. We have all heard the term &#39;Calamity Jane&#39;. I could suggest an alternative, but I will not, with respect to the way in which the honourable member for Riverina spoke this afternoon. It would appear, if we listened -to honourable members opposite, that somehow or other they initiated this action. They have had nothing to do with it. The Prime Minister presented this statement. The debate this afternoon is a result of definite Government policy. To show how ill prepared Opposition members are really to grapple with this situation, one has only to listen to the absurd statements that have been made and that have nothing to do with the ministerial statement and the motion. The amendment certainly has nothing to do with the situation. </para>

          <para>I wish now to look in detail at some of the points mentioned in the amendment moved by the Australian Labor Party, which is supposed to have some knowledge of the situation. The amendment:   . . urges  the  Government to initiate immediate discussions with the States so that the first grants under this programme can be made before Christmas. ... </para>
          <para class="block">Do not members of the Opposition read their newspapers? Cannot what they are told sink into their heads? They have been told several times that the discussions on this matter were held yesterday. Representatives of each of the States were here yesterday to discuss this situation. I understand that the Prime Minister has written to each State Premier setting out definitely ways in which this programme can bc commenced before Christmas. No need exists for any legislative machinery to lie established before this programme can commence. </para>
          <para>Anyone who reads in detail the statement which has been made by the Prime Minister will see that the programme and the whole system used in respect of drought relief measures throughout the States some years ago will be followed here. The same principles and procedure will be adopted. One has only to look at the procedures that were used during that drought relief programme to see how the present programme can be initiated and commenced immediately. For example this means that in Victoria an interdepartmental committee will co-ordinate these grants and work out which local government, which State government and which semi government authorities can spend this money in the most useful way in the areas where it is most needed.

              <para>- That is up to the States. The Commonwealth has the whole scheme under way now. There is no reason why, from the Commonwealth&#39;s point of view, this programme cannot commence before Christmas. There is no need to wait for any legislation to be introduced in February. If Opposition members only bothered to read the Prime Minister&#39;s statement, the newspapers and the reports of the procedures to be followed, this amendment would have been unnecessary. </para>

          <para class="block">This part of the amendment is most curious. In speaking to this amendment, the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Barnard)</inline> gave the reasons why it is alleged that not sufficient finance has been provided under the rural reconstruction scheme for the debt reconstruction programme. Yet. a week ago, when the Bill providing for the loan of S30m to the Australian Wool Commission was being debated, the proposal was criticised by the Opposition for the same reason that it has now incorporated in its amendment to support its case. The money that is being provided through the Australian Wool Commission will alleviate the need for much of the debt reconstruction programme. Surely it is better to alleviate the problems so that huge amounts of funds are not spent on debt reconstruction. This has been done in rural areas through the buying policy of the Australian Wool Commission and the wool deficiency payments scheme. Payments which would have been necessary under the debt reconstruction scheme have been avoided. Last week the Labor Party in criticising this Government initiative for the wool growers said that- </para>

              <para>- That is right. The Opposition argues that some of the money will go to the brokers, that it will not stay in the electorates. Now, I make 2 points on this argument: What difference is there between that proposal and the Opposition&#39;s amendment which seeks more money for debt reconstruction? If a debt is to be reconstructed, somebody has to be paid off. That &#39;somebody&#39; is still the same bodies - the banks and the finance companies - that the Opposition criticised one week ago. If one is at all close to the country people and the problem of debt reconstruction one may bc aware of the fact that if we can lower the level of debt payments made by a farmer, whether in respect of wool or in any other way, we will be helping him because a lesser percentage of his net income will be required to service his debts. </para>

          <para>When Opposition members were offering criticism and making their point about rural reconstruction they were talking about the farmers. Surely the whole purpose of this grant of $2m a month, approximately, is not to help the farming people alone but to help all people in rural areas, cities and towns who may have been affected by the rural crisis because of the drop in purchasing power of farming people. Yet the Labor Party criticised several times the rural reconstruction scheme because it is for farmers only. Here we have something which is for people other than farmers and all they can do is turn around, reverse their tired old argument and say it is wrong because it is for people other than farmers. The Opposition has also mentioned that it would do this and do that. If the Opposition had its way it would cut off these grants designed to assist the many people who work in country cities and towns. </para>

          <para class="block">It has also been stated that this money is not enough. If honourable members opposite read the Prime Minister&#39;s statement they will see that it is an approximate amount. It is flexible and it can be increased if necessary. If the Government listened to all the statements of the Labor Party that not enough money has been provided for certain projects, and if it were to finance what the Opposition said it would do, the biggest industry in this country would be the money printing industry because of all that would be needed to finance the Opposition&#39;s schemes. Honourable members want to look at these matters a little more objectively, decide on their priorities and how they would implement their proposals. It has also been suggested that the allocation of 75 per cent of this money to labour costs and 25 per cent for materials is wrong. This is the same arrangement that was adopted for the drought relief programmes which have proved most successful. </para>
          <para>If we are to employ people we have to employ them gainfully so that what they do is worthwhile, not only for them but also for the community. And, of course, we will need materials. If the States believe that 75 per cent of the grant is not sufficient to meet the labour costs it is open to the States to provide the materials and to allocate 100 per cent of the funds to the employment of labour. But there is another factor here. It has been stated that this grant will not cover the employment of everybody in the country who is unemployed. This is agreed but the point is that the amount is flexible and can be increased. One of the things needed in country cities and towns and business areas is a boost of confidence and this grant provides just the boost of confidence that is needed. </para>

              <para>- The people of Australia have shown for 22 years that they do not share your point of view. The Opposition&#39;s amendment states that we should be looking also to provide employment assistance in metropolitan areas. This -would mean that there would be less of the $2m  a  month for the benefit of the people in rural areas. We have 2 types of unemployment; we have metropolitan unemployment which is certainly growing much more rap idly now, but it is not of the same nature or proportion as it is in rural areas where there is large long-term hard-core unemployment brought about by the structural changes in the rural community which have been caused by the crisis in rural industries. In New South Wales the October unemployment figures show that 43 per cent of those registered as unemployed were in metropolitan areas and 56 per cent were in country areas. There is an even more startling figure in Queensland where 35 per cent of unemployed are in metropolitan areas and 64 per cent in non metropolitan areas. I think honourable members would find that the number of job vacancies is 3 times as high in the metropolitan areas as it is in the non metropolitan areas. This grant of $2m a month will give a much needed shot in the arm to employment and confidence in country cities and towns. It is a step in the right direction which has been initiated by the Government, and the Opposition has had nothing to do with it at all. It will do many good things. </para>

          <para>I would like to make a few points in conclusion. If we are to continue to spur employment in non-metropolitan areas we need a lead at Commonwealth level in the provision of more long-term and definite proposals to assist decentralisation, regional development or whatever we like to call it. The last thing we want is another committee. We have had committees dealing with these matters for 7 years and we have all the knowledge we need on the question of what is required to spur, with incentives, manufacturing and other industry in country towns. I urge the Government to continue with this good work that it has started so that we will have very soon a policy from the Government that will provide real incentives, real initiatives and real long term proposals to assist regional development. This would be to the benefit of both those who live in urban Australia and those who live in non-urban Australia about whom we are now talking: </para>

          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>The House regrets that the Government has not made provision to extend unemployment assistance to alleviate problems of growing unemployment in metropolitan areas with particular emphasis on the problems and placement of school leavers which can be accentuated as  a  result of poor employment conditions in the country areas.  1 am particularly concerned that the present measure, which admittedly is better than many of its type,, is based on an inaccurate diagnosis. The treatment is wrong, it is inadequate and the funds will be inappropriately applied. I would like to see a comprehensive programme extending over the whole economy because the problem in cities is a very great one, not just in terms of straight-out unemployment but in terms of under-employment. This is a particular problem in my electorate and in many electorates within the Adelaide metropolitan area where tradesmen in the motor vehicle industry and subsidiary industries have been retrenched. Many of them have got jobs back but they are now on the production line, which means a considerable reduction in their earnings. A great deal needs to be done in the metropolitan areas as well as in the rural areas. One instance which supports this view was brought to my attention only fairly recently. I have heard it mentioned by a fairly reliable source in South Australia that next year the engagement of apprentices will be down by about 33&#163; per cent on the usual intake. This will be due to the stagnation in economy which is the result, of course, of the economic policies of this Government. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The Government has made a completely erroneous diagnosis of the causes of the present trouble with the economy. Tt believed that after the 6 per cent wage increase which was granted last year there would be an increase in demand from which we might get a demand inflation superimposed on a cost-push inflation. It was this potential or latent excessive demand which had to be controlled and the measures to do so were contained in this year&#39;s Budget. However, its assessment of the likely situation was completely wrong. The Government is now trying to say that the increase in savings and the fall in demand will be followed by an increase in demand and that this will happen spontaneously. I do not think this is so. I do not think the fall in demand is an accident. It was brought about by inflationary psychology. </para>
          <para>Business thinks it has to increase prices because it does not know how it will cover costs. So what do business people do? They do not engage people and this particularly affects, as I say, apprentices. This is creating a very serious situation. At the same time consumers are frightened about their future employment prospects and so they tend not to spend and everybody tightens up. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden)</inline> thinks everybody is going to overspend because of cost inflation. Perhaps that might be the logical thing to do because at a time of inflation the value of goods increases relative to the value of money, but the instinctive behaviour of people is not always in their own long term interests. What people are doing as an instinctive reaction is not to spend. As a result we have this stagnation in the economy. It is this psychology that is producing this great increase in savings, and for that reason I believe that the reduction in demand is no accident. I believe that the Government&#39;s assessment of the economy was completely incorrect. </para>
          <para>We might ask what needs to he done in the present context, and 1 certainly would agree with those people who say we need the introduction of a supplementary Budget. But at the same time I think we must remember that this does not necessarily mean that we are going to restore full confidence in the economy. We have to remember that economics is not a precise mathematical science. It is really nothing more than an empirical study of past human group behaviour. I do not think we can predict exactly what is going to happen. But my feeling is that this reduction in confidence and in consumer demand might continue even if the economy is given a stimulus by the Government. I think the same thing has happened in the United Kingdom where the government is not applying particularly tight monetary or fiscal policies at the moment. In spite of that people are tightening up and nobody is spending. People are hanging on to their money and there is a rise in savings. I think we have to get right to the root of the problem and that is to control prices. I do not know why the Government backs away from this. </para>
          <para>The Government cannot get at the problem unless it controls prices. If prices are not controlled this allows the Government and the employers to say that wage increases will affect the exporter, the farmer, the pensioner and so on and so forth. The Government is playing the farmer and the pensioner off against the wage earner. But if we have a context of fixed prices I believe that this playing off will not occur. What the wage earner is really seeking is to improve his lot against that of the employer - the profit earner. As far as I and the Labor Party are concerned, that is a highly desirable thing. We will not control the trouble with the economy, nor will we control unemployment until we get down and control prices because it is this inflationary psychology which is resulting not only in great inflation but also ultimately will increase unemployment. I have mentioned the problem of apprenticeships.  I think that perhaps as an emergency measure we might have to do something to assist the intake of apprentices in the forthcoming year, because if the economy does improve for some reason in the near future we might find that apprentices will still not be taken in. The reason for this is that there have been retrenchments of tradesmen in the vehicle building industry in South Australia, and if the industry in up it will be those tradesmen who are taken on first because the apprentices are not immediately productive in the first couple of years of their indentures. So I would think that the chances are that if many of these boys are not taken on as apprentices in the next couple of months they will lose their opportunity of having a skilled occupation throughout their adult  life. I think some emergency programme should be started to help the intake of apprentices. </para>
          <para>But we must look at the whole cause of the trouble and set about controlling prices because this is what really matters. One other example of this psychology is to look at what people feel about the current wave of school leavers and how they are going to find jobs. About a month ago I visited a technical high school in my electorate. The headmaster said to me: &#39;How am I going to advise parents who are asking whether they should take their children away from school now?&#39; He also said that everybody is so frightened about whether their sons or daughters are going to find employment in December and January that many of them are foregoing the final important part of their secondary education and leaving school in mid-term so that they can get in on the ground floor of the job market before the new year starts. I think this is a very sad state of affairs, but it is a pretty accurate account of how people feel about the state of the economy. </para>
          <para>The main point I want to make is that it is just not sufficient - although I acknowledge that relatively speaking the problem of unemployment in rural areas is very great, it is still very great in the cities - to say that it is not just a matter of unemployment. There is also under employment, with people not working in the skills for which they have been trained. But these are the things that need to be done: Apart from the control of commodities and the control of prices, interest rates must be looked at quickly by the Government. I believe that in the present context high interest rates are not deflationary at all - that is if the Government is trying to bring about deflationary policies. I am not sure what the Government is doing at the moment because all that is happening is that high interest rates are being passed on as another cost, and this helps build up the inflationary psychology. </para>
          <para>The final thing that really must be done- I might perhaps even have put this first - is to increase social service benefits, particularly unemployment benefits which are disgracefully low at the present time. I have said that consumer spending is low and this is one of the. things that has caused the Government worry. Surely these are the people who will increase their expenditure if we increase unemployment benefits because it is obligatory for them to spend the increased money that is made available. Many of them are living below the poverty line at the moment and if we give them extra money it will not only help them but also will give a fillip to the economy. I know that there are other honourable members who want to enter this debate so I will conclude by saying that I think some emergency assistance needs to be given to the State governments by the Department of Labour and National Service to assist with this great flow of school leavers who will enter the work force in the next couple of months. But most fundamentally we have to control the whole source of the trouble which is inflation. A Labor government will not shrink from the implementation of a system of Commonwealth price control, which is something that the Government has backed away from. We will give it the highest possible priority. </para>

            <para>- I rise to support the measure introduced by the Government and I oppose most bitterly the amendment which has been moved by the Opposition. I oppose the amendment because yesterday here in Canberra the representatives of the various State Treasuries met officials from the Commonwealth Government to set up an immediate scheme for the implementation of the funds that have been made available by the Commonwealth. The business of the meeting yesterday was to discuss such questions as the distribution of the Commonwealth grants between the States, the nature of the activities to which they will be applied for employment-giving purposes, the speed with which the arrangements can be brought into operation and the various administrative aspects of the scheme. These officials have now returned to their various States and will bring the matters discussed to the notice of their Ministers. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I say that this Government has acted speedily in bringing this matter to a head so that the various State governments can bring in and implement the scheme in the country districts under their control. There has been no delay at all on the par i of the Federal Government in this very important matter. Unemployment figures have been mentioned by the various speakers who have taken part in this debate. I have here the various unemployment figures for New South Wales. I will not say that , they do not give cause for concern, but at the same time they are not of an alarming nature. But they are of such a nature that the Government has decided to give assistance not only in New South Wales but also throughout Australia. When we look at the centres that have been most affected we find that they are centres where the wool and wheat industries are prominent, particularly the wool industry. This is one of the serious situations which this Government has to face. We are al) agreed on this. So I feel that this legislation is most worth while. Although of a temporary nature, it will mean that the unemployment pools that have been created in the wool areas will be overcome for the time being. </para>
          <para>I was very interested in the speech made in this House last Thursday by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> on this very important facet. He said that, in broad terms, the Government envisages an arrangement providing for grants for employment-creating activities to be made to the States for the period up to 30th June 1973, subject to review after 30th June 1972 in the light of the then prevailing conditions. I think this is a very fair statement and one that indicates to people in these affected areas that they can expect assistance right up to that time but if there have been changed conditions in the meantime of a beneficial nature financially, this assistance will be tapered off. The objective of the scheme is to make a sign i cant impact on the level of unemployment in the non-metropolitan areas. Grants will be made for the purpose of reimbursing expenditure on additional labour intensive activities of a production kind. This is a wise policy; otherwise, if the money were to be expended on maintenance ventures and undertakings of this nature it would lose ils real significance. </para>
          <para>Recent grants made lo some States under drought relief arrangements to enable the employment of persons who are unemployed as a result of drought might be taken as a broad indication of the type of scheme thai the Federal Government has in mind. We all know that the amount of money that has been mentioned is about $2m a month, spread right throughout Australia. I have been very disappointed with the honourable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Grassby)</inline> because of the calamitous statements that he so frequently makes in this House. Here today this honourable member said that we were going back to the depression days. What sheer and utter nonsense. He spoke about refugee camps in the cities to take care of the people from these areas. Talk of this nature does not do his Party, the Government or the nation any good. </para>
          <para class="block">The economy of this country is very sound, particularly when compared with that of overseas countries, lt is sound because we have overseas balances of S2,600m. our exports have never been better, deposits in savings banks are at an all time high, and unemployment in this country - at 1.1 per cent of our work force - is the lowest of any country in the world. In the United Kingdom 3.4 per cent of the work force is unemployed, and over 6 per cent of the work force in the United States of America. These figures indicate that despite problems that we have in this country our economy is sound. Our economy is viable. Statements made by any member of the House along the lines of those made by the honourable member for Riverina are most damaging to everybody concerned. </para>
          <para>The rural reconstruction scheme has been mentioned. It has, in the main, been most successful. The Commonwealth Government has made money available to the States to assist farmers who are viable and who with financial assistance can get out of any troubles that they may be in. But when we analyse the rural reconstruction scheme we find that most of the States prior to receiving this grant from the Commonwealth Government did not have the machinery to implement the rural reconstruction scheme throughout their primary producer areas. I have no doubt that this is one of the reasons why in many instances there has been delay in getting this finance out to the farmers who have been affected. New South Wales was one of the States that had a rural reconstruction department set up. I believe that it has been able to get its money out more quickly than any of the other States. Many statements have been made to the effect that the States have run out of money. The Federal Government has made it quite clear in its rural reconstruction legislation that when any of the States have allocated the funds which were made available to them and have made application to the Federal Government, further consideration will be given to the allocation of additional funds. I have heard that New South Wales and some other States have allocated all their money and are short of funds. I do not know whether the Ministers in those States have made application to the Federal Government for more funds, but if they do I feel sure that they will receive every consideration and every assistance. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Kingston <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Gun)</inline> mentioned that there is a high level of unemployment in the metropolitan areas. From my observation of the various cities throughout Australia, and particularly Sydney, there is an adjustment of employment from one industry to another. There certainly are some unemployed. I feel quite sure that, when the necessity arrives for the Government to give assistance in this field, it will do so. But 1 have no hesitation whatsoever in saying that the greatest problems have been in the wool and wheat growing areas. That is why this Government has given those areas assistance along the lines of the measure that we are debating here today. One of the most important aspects of this legislation is that this money will be channelled out in the States through the various local governing authorities. This will ensure that the money is spent wisely, that it is spent on projects which are worthy ones and not of a temporary nature and that it will bring great benefit to those local governing areas as well as providing employment for the people who have been affected by the rural recession in that particular sector. </para>
          <para>I know that local government throughout Australia will welcome these funds, which will alleviate a great problem that is on their hands. At the same time the money will enable them to carry out work which will be of everlasting benefit to the municipalities and the shire areas wherever those funds are expended on worthwhile projects. So I have very much pleasure indeed in supporting the measure brought down by the Government. For the reasons which I have very clearly set out, I am certainly disappointed with the amendment moved by the Opposition. </para>

But the honourable member cannot obtain the figures of unemployment in his own electorate, at the direction, as I understand it, of the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> who is not even in the chamber at the moment. Let me deal with the amendment that has been moved by the Opposition in this regard. Let us get away from the divisions and the discriminations of this Government in a measure such as this. One would have thought that if the Government had a derrick of sincerity in its body or a sincere thought in ils mind the Prime Minister would not, as he did a couple of days ago, have hastened into the chamber in the midst of a debate, interrupted the debate and made a statement, which I hold aloft here, of a page and a half about what the Government intends to do about the very serious unemployment problem within the rural sector. </para>

          <para>The Prime Minister, having just returned from overseas, could do no better on a television programme than sit and say that he knew where he was going. He even had to borrow that phrase. Whilst he was overseas he learnt from the &#39;Economist&#39; newspaper in Great Britain that that was the theme that the Prime Minister of Great Britain had used in a talk to a Conservative Party rally. If honourable members do not believe me let them go into the Library and look up one of the September editions of the &#39;Economist&#39;. They will see &#39;This is where we are going&#39;, ls this the type of thing we expect from the Government in the national Parliament of this country, facing the problem of an unemployment figure that can reach in excess of 150,000 in the next 3 or 4 months? The Prime Minister comes into the chamber with a scrap of paper. Has he not sufficient parliamentary draftsmen to draft a Bill so that the Opposition can see what is provided, where the money is. going and what the money is to do? The Government should be condemned forever. </para>
          <para>The honourable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Giles),</inline> who spoke initially in this debate on behalf of the Government, pointed out - and correctly so - the unemployment figure for the metropolitan area of Adelaide.

              <para>- They were somewhat conservative because the official figures are more than conservative. What can be expected of a Government . that has been in office for 22 years which has created this monster and which has erected the tombstones of unemployment throughout the length and breadth of this country? What can one expect of it when it comes in with a measure .without any degree of seriousness about it but on which it must stand condemned because the problem it seeks to solve is of its own creation? The Government now has to tell the world how ineffective it has been. The few honourable members opposite who are in the chamber ought to be reminded of the statement on full employment that was made by Robert Gordon Menzies back in 1949 when he conned everybody. I have a copy of it here if they want to read it. How can we expect anything from a Government that has been so long in office? The Country Party, which receives only 8 per cent of the votes across the nation, has in this Parliament a number of seats quite out of balance with the number of people who support it. This comes about because of the weighted advantage that the Country Party has in country electorates. </para>

The newspapers are saying that Billy McMahon says: &#39;You will be all right. Australia can take the lead&#39;. It is enough to make anybody with any sense of responsibility in this place shudder. The Prime Minister sneaks into the chamber - and I say it to him while he is sitting in the chamber - interrupts the debate and makes a snap statement. Somebody winds him up, he unwinds in this House for 10 or 15 minutes on a. statement such as the one he made a while ago, and then he clears off again until somebody else winds him up by mentioning trade unions or something of that nature. </para>

There the matter has rested. Not one word has been said about this document that was presented to this House on 10th September. The Prime Minister does not want to discuss it.

              <para>- I thank you. I come to the amendment. Why does the Government want to oppose the amendment? Is it because it does not want anything done before Christmas? What does the amendment say? We are saying in the amendment that a person in the city who is unemployed has a damned equal right in this country, as he should have. Does the honourable member for Angas realise that the figure he gave for the high percentage of unemployed for the metropolitan area of Adelaide is brought about by the fact that people have flocked to the metropolitan area because their positions in the country have become redundant? So the honourable member has denied his own people that the Government has sacked. The people who have moved into the metropolitan area are being denied their right. What else do we say in our amendment? The amendment urges the Government to initiate immediate discussion. Why not? </para>

I am told that we can read about these things in the &#39;Daily Mirror&#39;. I can read in the daily papers also some things that have been said about the Prime Minister. If I wanted to do so 1 could pick out one from amongst all the gear I have here. Here is one which says: &#39;You&#39;ll be all right&#39;. The &#39;Australian&#39; sets out what ought to be done as far as the leadership of the nation is concerned. A Melbourne newspaper talks about Billy McMahon having big ears, short arms and big pockets. But I do not want to do this. </para>

              <para>- I had overlooked the fact that I have not really any proof that the honourable member can read at all, but I have seen him look at a piece of paper when he has been reading speeches in this place. So let us not be hoodwinked. We have seen reports in newspapers, have we not, that this Government said before the last Senate election that it was going to build a string of child minding centres across the metropolitan areas of the Commonwealth. We read this in the newspapers. We did not believe it. It has never come to fruition. So what is wrong in applying that argument on this occasion? The Government has a responsibility to remove the tombstones of unemployment in this country. I do not think there is anything that hurts a person more than to be told, not directly on some occasions by his employer but by finding in his pay envelope  a  slip that tells him his services are no longer required. I doubt very much whether any honourable member on the Government side has suffered this indignity. There are some very wealthy people on the front bench and they have probably never given this matter any thought. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Another matter I want to refer to is a point made by the honourable member for Kingston <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Gun)</inline> who said that the Government has given no thought to unemployment relief for those who are unemployed as a result of Government inaction in this field. The Government ought to consider that it does a disservice to the nation.  1  believe and 1 am quite certain that there are older members on the other side who believe that the Government should recognise that it has run its race, it has run its time and it ought to vacate office in the interests of the people of this country generally. Finally &#91; want to say that there is nothing in the amendment moved by the Opposition which, if there is anything at all contained in the measure- </para>

            <para>- by leave - I wish to inform the House of decisions the Government has taken to provide additional assistance to both Government and independent schools in areas of special need. Decisions taken in association with Commonwealth and State conferences over the last 18 months or so have resulted in a significant increase in the level and rate of growth of genera! revenue assistance from the Commonwealth to the States. The current expenditure on primary and secondary education in State schools has benefited significantly from these arrangements and the Government is convinced that additional assistance iri that area would not be justified. However, the States have not been able to allocate as much as they would have liked from their available capital funds for primary and secondary school buildings: They speak of problems including the provision ot additional&#39; classrooms and &#39; associated facilities and the replacement of outmoded and cramped accommodation. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>We. have decided that it would be desirable to assist the States to increase their capital expenditure in respect of primary and . secondary schools. We have given very careful thought to the form in which we should provide this assistance and we have decided that the best approach would be to provide this assistance . by way of additions to the interest-free capital grants which the Commonwealth is making to the States as part of their annual works and housing programmes, and as a substitute for loan raisings. These capital grants arc being paid for the purpose of assisting the States to finance non-productive capital works, without incurring debt charges on the funds used. However, as these grants arc being made in recognition of the need expressed by the States for additional capital expenditure in primary and secondary schools, we would expect them to be yo used by the States. We would prefer ;ha science laboratories and libraries in secondary schools, for which there are existing special purpose grants, be excluded from these grants. </para>
          <para>The additional grants will also be paid entirely without any matching conditions attached to them. 1 should add that the Commonwealth expects that the States will continue with their own planned levels of expenditure in this area so that these grants will represent a net addition to the facilities in government schools. The amount of the additional grants will be S20m of which part will be paid in the remainder of this financial year and part in 1972-73. They will be distributed between the States in proportion to the capital grants presently being received by them, which in turn are distributed in the same way as the States&#39; Loan Council borrowing programmes for works and housing. The additional grants will be amalgamated into the basic capital grants for the purpose of determining the proportion of the works and housing programme that the grants will represent in future years. The amount that each State will receive on the basis indicated is as follows: New South Wales, $6. 36m; Victoria, $5. 10m; Queensland, $2.53m: South Australia, $2.74m; Western Australia, $1.87m; and Tasmania, $ 1.40m - a total of $20m. I have written to the Premiers inviting them to agree to accept these grants on the basis I have outlined. </para>
          <para>Since 1969 running costs of government schools have risen by at least 30 per cent to 40 per cent and even more in some cases and it is now costing over $300 a year to educate a child in a government primary school and over $500 a year to educate a child in a government secondary school. The general financial assistance grants from the Commonwealth represent about one half of the State&#39;s current Budget expenditure and on this basis it can be said that the Commonwealth is supporting approximately one half of the increased expenditure by the States on primary and secondary schools. The independent schools have received additional assistance from the States, but they are facing increasing difficulties in then efforts to provide adequate facilities for a reasonable proportion of the school-going population. Many of the independent schools have been paying their teachers salaries at rates significantly lower than those paid in government schools. However, there is now a number of awards which require these salaries to be increased to full parity with the operative rates in government schools over a short period. This development has resulted in relatively greater increases in costs in the independent schools than in the government schools. The independent schools have limited capacity to charge higher fees and collect other income, and for boarding schools there are additional difficulties arising from the downturn in rural activity. The combination of these factors has resulted in a continued drift in enrolments to government schools. </para>
          <para>The need for immediate additional assistance to independent schools is emphasised by the following current developments. The Roman Catholic authorities in Melbourne are considering seriously a proposal not to expand secondary schools but to concentrate resources in primary schools. In Tasmania a number of Roman Catholic and other independent schools are faced with the prospect of having to cease operations. The Government hopes that a contraction would not be necessary in either area. </para>
          <para>As a further measure of assistance to the independent schools, the Government has decided to increase the rates of the annual per capita grants to both primary and secondary independent schools throughout Australia. These grants were first made available from the beginning of 1970 at annual rates of $35 per head in primary schools and $50 per head in secondary schools. These rates will be increased to $50 per head in primary schools and $68 per head in secondary schools from the beginning of 1972. These additional per capita grants to independent schools in the States are expected to cost $9. 7m in 1972 of which half, that is $4,850,000 will be payable during the financial year 1971-72. The amount in each State will be approximately: New South Wales, $3.58m; Victoria, $3. 14m; Queensland, $ 1.46m; South Australia, $600,000; Western Austraiia, $700,000; and Tasmania, $220,000- a total of $9.7m. </para>
          <para>Independent schools in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory share in the per capita grants which the Commonwealth makes available to independent schools in the States. They also receive a local component in their per capita grants broadly equivalent to those paid by the State governments to independent schools in the States. In addition to the increases I have already mentioned, the local component in the annual per capita grants to independent schools in the 2 Territories will be increased from the beginning of 1972. The increases will be from $20 to $35 per head in primary schools and in secondary schools from $30 to $45 in forms 1 and 2; from $40 to $45 in forms 3 and 4, and from $45 to $50 in forms 5 and 6. The increased grants to independent schools in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory are expected to cost $347,000 in 1972 of which $173,000 will be payable during the financial year 1971-72. The Government will introduce appropriate legislation covering these measures during the autumn session of the Parliament next year. </para>
          <para>My Government will continue to cooperate with the States in measures both direct and indirect to expand and improve education services in government schools. Our policy for the independent schools is that, relying on their own efforts and with assistance from governments, they should be able to continue to provide places at a reasonable standard for that proportion of the school population which in- the past has Sought education in non-government schools. The action we are now taking is a further . indication of our determination to assist those directly concerned to improve the standards in all types of schools.

            <para>- The Opposition welcomes an increase of expenditure on education of $29.7m. We are, unfortunately, not in a position to assess exactly how this will meet the needs in certain key States because the Nationwide Survey of Educational Needs of May 1970 has not yet been conveyed to us in the sense that the 2 biggest States, New South Wales and Victoria, have not tabled their findings. So, we do not know what these additional grants mean in terms of adequacy in relation to the needs of New South Wales and Victoria. The second thing that the Opposition would like to say about this is that it hopes that the States have been sufficiently consulted to be in a position readily to use this money. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>If honourable members look at the history of science laboratories, of library grants and of the finance for teachers colleges, it will be seen that the Commonwealth&#39;s action in these respects was quite precipitate. It was highly beneficial to those who actually had a plan to build science laboratories or actually had a plan to build libraries but there were many who, not knowing that this was going to be available, had no plan and did not receive the benefit and States, not knowing that the grant for teachers colleges was to be available, had no plan and were unable to spend money. The expenditure of these sorts of sums of money requires a degree of preparation. I presume however that if this is just a straightout grant, the State authorities and the private authorities will be able to adjust their systems to use the money to the optimum. </para>
          <para>However, I want to say something about this system of making per capita grants to private schools. Surely it is not beyond the wit of man to devise in each State a Catholic education authority and an education authority for the other independent schools, to make a grant to them which may be calculated on a per capita basis and for them to be given the right to spend the money according to need. The Government may lay down guidelines of need, but a Catholic education authority in- Western Australia, shall we say, would get approximately $4.37m - I think that is what the grant will be - and that Catholic education authority could spend the $4. 37m according to need. It would be a better system than the system of making grants tied to specific schools which may not have a need. </para>
          <para>The second weakness in the grants system is that it is geared to schools in being, whereas the great problem for independent or church schools, and especially those of the Catholic Church where it tries to provide schools in parishes regardless of their wealth or poverty, is that there is constant development in new areas but a school has to be in being before it can attract a grant. There must be some means of assisting these church; authorities to bring a school into being, for which this present system does not . adequately allow. We should remember that expenditure on education is economically valid expenditure. I do not believe that there is any economist who seriously regards expenditure in this direction where there are such needs as being inflationary in its effect. Expenditure on schools and hospitals is not inflationary expenditure. The Government already is putting money into areas where there is a great need, and it is not getting a luxury surplus to chase scar se goods or scar se materials. This action which the Government has taken in providing $29.7m is really a token addition. </para>
          <para class="block">It may keep the wolf from the door. I have a feeling, at least so far as Catholic parish schools are concerned, that the money which the Commonwealth provides is always just enough to stop them from sinking under, but not enough to enable them to organise an effective school system. </para>
          <para>I do not imagine that increasing the grant from &#167;35 to $50 for a primary school pupil and from $50 to $68 for a secondary school pupil will solve the problems that were indicated to the country by Archbishop Guildford Young in his television programme, nor will it relieve from bankruptcy the 20 schools to which he referred. The making of a straightout grant of an adequate amount to a Catholic education authority in Tasmania which had a discretionary power to assign this sum of money according to need and which was able to make a greater grant to the most necessitous schools, seems to us to be a better system. But having said that, we consider that the position of education is so parlous that we are not prepared to cavil at additional expenditure of $20m in the State school sector or $9. 7m in the private school sector, although we do protest about the failure of the 2 great States to publicise what are their educational needs. We believe that there is no provision for real alleviation of the poverty of some of the private schools and no provision for real capital advances to enable private schools of the Catholic nature to be built in new parishes. The present system puts a premium on a school being in existence and makes a grant that is just enough to keep the wolf from the door without there being much discretion to apply the money to the areas of greatest need. Having said that, I stress again that we welcome any such increase in expenditure on education. </para>

The discussion on the establishment of the national film and television school, during this session, was initiated by a question asked by the honourable member for Chisholm <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Staley).</inline> In reply the Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howson)</inline> made a statement which was in part an answer to that question and in part a statement to the Parliament. This happened on 8th September, and the answer statement said to the House that the cost of establishing the school would be over $7m - spread over 5 years. On 10th September the Minister informed the House, in answer to a question, that this expenditure of over $7m would result in the school providing to the industry 12 graduates a year. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>The Parliament is entitled, when a matter of this kind is to be decided by it, to be provided with accurate facts on which the Parliament can base its judgment. If inaccurate information, for whatever reason, is provided to members of Parliament by a Minister the Parliament has no chance of reaching a proper conclusion as to what should be done for it would be acting without full information. I, therefore, on 16th September questioned the Minister on these matters. In reply the Minister reasserted that the cost of the school would be over $7m though he did not at that stage repeat the allegation that this sum would result irian output of 12 graduates a year, nor did he correct his former statement as to this. I believed the facts given to the House to be wrong or mistaken, or whatever it is, and on 13th October I said so in the Parliament. I said that the sum quoted by the Minister was not in fact the sum required for the film and television school alone but included an amount of $2m, in round figures, which was required not for the film and television school alone but for a number of other schools which might, in the future, be associated with it. </para>
          <para>I also said that the figures given to us included $1.8m, again in round figures, which was not in any way a part of the capital cost of establishing the school but a sum representing recurrent expenditure over a period of years. I interpolate that it was made clear by the Minister that this was a recurrent cost, but it was incorporated in the total cost given to us. I know of no other instance, in the establishment of a university, a college of advanced education, an institute of marine biology, or anything of that kind, when recurrent expenditure for 5 years has been added into the ostensible capital cost of establishing such an institution. It was, I think, an extraordinary thing to do. In fact, if the capital required for establishments other than the film school and the first 5 years running expenses are taken out, as they should be, the cost of establishing the school is to be not in excess of $7.6m but $3.8m. </para>
          <para>Subsequently, on 26th October, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> made a statement in which he supported the Minister&#39;s estimate of a cost in excess of $7m but corrected the estimate of the output of graduates from 12 to IS graduates  a  year. The Prime Minister had, perhaps, been misled since he justified his statement by asserting that the Council had not recommended that the film school should be established on an area of 8 acres. In fact, the Interim Council had so recommended. It was not the Council&#39;s preference; it was not its prime recommendation or first recommendation. But the Council did recommend in paragraph 4.5 of its second report that the school should be established according to a timetable which was applicable whether the Government bought 60 acres for a number of schools or whether it decided to purchase the smaller area of 8 acres for the film and television school. </para>
          <para>The actual wording of paragraph 4.5 of the second report, after setting out the programme and timetable, is: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The programme as set out in. the timetable is applicable whether the Government  accepts  the recommendation to purchase the larger area required for a Centre- </para>
          </quote>
          <para>That is, a number of other schools: </para>
          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
            <item label=".">
              <para>. or a lesser area sufficient for the film and television school alone. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>That surely makes that matter clear. It is made clear also in the first report of the Interim Council where in paragraph 11.7, all of which I will not read, but none of import of which I will exclude, the Council concludes by saying: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">The Interim Council recommends therefore that the establishment of a film and television school should not be delayed pending its incorporation in the larger area. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The Council suggests the school itself should go ahead at once. So, I suggest that it is clearly shown by the first and second reports of the Interim Council, which were tabled in this House, that although the Council would have preferred a larger area, most of which was for other than the film and television school and, therefore, the cost of which should not have been debited to the film and television school, nevertheless it wished the establishment of the school to go ahead even if the larger area were not bought. </para>
          <para>This conclusion is borne out by the papers subsequently tabled on 10th November in this House which make it quite clear that the Minister had been presented with 2 costings by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Coleman</inline> of the Interim Council - one for 60 acres and one for 8 acres - as early, as 1 understand the papers, as June this year. The papers also made it clear beyond doubt that only 8 acres would be required for the film and television school alone. That appears in the second lot of papers laid on the table of this House. </para>
          <para>The Council still urged that the best course was to purchase land for a number of schools but that only 8 acres was required for the film and television school itself. If that was all that was required for that school and that school were to go ahead, the cost of that area, 1 suggest, is all that should have been charged to that school. Nowhere does it appear that the Council is saying in any way that unless an area of 60 acres is bought the film and television school should not be proceeded with. </para>
          <para>The second lot of papers also shows that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Coleman</inline> is advising the Minister, in paragraph 11.7 of the first report which 1 have already quoted, that the Council - and 1 quote from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Coleman&#39;s</inline> communication to the Minister tabled in the second group of papers: </para>
          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
            <item label=".">
              <para>. specifically recommends going ahead with the film and television school even before a decision on the centre - that is the 60 acres - has been made. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">The second group of papers also shows that the estimate of 12 graduates a year made by the Minister was incorrect and that the estimate of 15 graduates a year given by the Prime Minister in his statement was incorrect also. This is brought out clearly in the record of discussion between the P.A. Management Consultants Pty Ltd and the Interim Council. The paper is too long to go through in detail. But in this discussion <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ian</inline> Wark points out that the analysis of the position gives a figure of 50 graduates rather than the figure of 15 graduates required each year. It is a pity that this second lot of papers was not tabled on 26th October. They had then recently come to the Minister&#39;s possession, as I understand it, and their existence, and I believe their contents, were known to the Prime Minister. </para>
          <para>They give us additional information which it would have been useful to know earlier. But at least their contents are now known, and I submit to the House that they clearly show that the capital cost of establishing the school is, as I said, not $7. 6m but $3. 8m and that the number of graduates for whom places can be found is not 12 or 15 but something at least between 40 and 50 a year. If that has been established - and I submit that the papers before us do establish that - at least the Parliament has proper facts on which to base its judgments, whatever those judgments might turn out to be. 1 consider the eventual establishment of this school as being most important. It is part of a 3-pronged programme to improve the capacity of the Australian film and television industry to produce films of high standard or a standard at least equal to the best world standards. That 3-pronged programme consisted in the establishment of an experimental film division, in the establishment of the Australian Film Development Corporation to finance Australian productions of merit and in the establishment of the school to give us better producers, better directors, better writers and better technicians so that the films financed by the Corporation would incorporate the highest standard of skills in their production. That ought still to be the objective of the Government. </para>
          <para>I am disturbed at developments which now seem to be taking place. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hector</inline> Crawford and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mauger</inline> of Consolidated Press Ltd have been added to the Interim Council. It appears that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crawford</inline> at least is more interested in delaying or sabotaging the establishment of the school than in acting to establish it. The arguments advanced for this course are apparently that a school to produce excellence is not needed - at any rate, at present. The argument is that there will not be employment for the graduates. What is suggested is that, instead of a school - I emphasise instead of a school - what is needed is tariffs on imported films and, presumably, television productions and for the holders of television licences and, I presume, the distributors of films, to be forced to include in their programmes a larger quota of Australian made drama and for the distributors to be forced to provide proper outlets for Australian made drama and perhaps, though this is not clear, for subventions to be made to established television producers. It is suggested that this is more important than the setting up of a school. </para>
          <para>I do not quarrel with those propositions per se. I do not say that actions of this kind are wrong. They will, if implemented, or they should, if implemented, provide more opportunity and more employment for Australians engaged in the television industry and in the film making industry, whether as actors or as producers or as writers or as technicians. But whether or not this is done there will still be an overriding need for us to train to and above world standard our own Australians. If the proposal for tariffs and quotas and for making distributors do something results in an Australian television industry which calls for more actors, gives more opportunity for producers, directors and writers, surely that in itself means that there is a greater need for graduates of excellence of the kind of school we are discussing. If we do not set out to provide this standard of skill and excellence then taking merely the steps proposed on tariffs and quotas could well condemn Australians either to paying much more to see a film or to watch a television programme or to watching second rate productions. And unless we do this we will not get that world wide distribution which we can only expect to get if wc turn out first rate productions. </para>
          <para>When we do have first rate productions we can justifiably require that distributors use them both in Australia and overseas. We can say to overseas distributors: &#39;If you will not show our productions we will use tariffs and other weapons to stop your productions from coming into our country&#39;. But this can only be properly done if our productions are of a standard equal to or better than those produced abroad. If we do this we will be in a position of strength. (Extension of time granted). I thank the House; I will not trespass upon its patience. If we did this we would be in a position of strength but we will only attain this position of strength by attaining excellence and we are most likely to attain excellence from the establishment of a proper school. &#39;Make it Australia&#39; is a slogan with which I agree. Make it Australia, yes, but only if it is also made excellent, because it is in that way alone that Australia will be able properly to get into overseas markets and properly to disseminate throughout the world, as films so perfectly do, a picture of Australian life at the same time as we build up what is a necessary Australian industry. </para>

            <para>- by leaveThe right honourable member for Higgins <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> has touched upon the relevant statistics with regard to the cost of the school and the number of graduates that would ultimately emerge when the school is established. Time, and indeed patience, might well be taxed if I repeated them. I find myself in some difficulty in speaking in this debate and in a state of perplexity and doubt as to the person to whom one should direct one&#39;s remarks. Is it to the Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howson)?</inline> Is it to the council of Ministers headed by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden)?</inline> Is it to the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Greenwood),</inline> that sensitive gentleman who resides in another place? fs it to the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth),</inline> a radical and sensitive man so close to the contemporary trends in our society? This is no easy assignment. This debate has all the ingredients of a second rate film because the question at the moment is: Who really is responsible for this complex and fragmented portfolio? On 24th November the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> said: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>The simple fact is that, because this matter was so sensitive, I thought it was desirable to appoint a group of Ministers lo handle it and to receive letters and correspondence direct . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para>A very arduous task -  so that they would be able to prepare a speech for me and advise me as to the action that should be taken. They did this. Consequently, i divorced myself from the details as completely as <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> could. 1 wanted to rely upon the ministerial commif.ee which, i think- </para>
          <para class="block">And 1 repeat for honourable members, T think&#39;-  is under the chairmanship of my colleague, the Treasurer, and also has the Attorney-General on it. </para>
          <para class="block">That was the Prime Minister&#39;s statement on 24th November. What an extraordinarily simplistic statement it was. This prodigious revelation was made by the right honourable gentleman, but what does it mean? What is the significance of it? It means that the Minister has been eclipsed. The Minister, appointed only a few months before, was deposed from his own environment by a group of Ministers. This was surely a massive humiliation and I extend my sympathy to the Minister for the invidious position in which he now finds himself. A Minister with a portfolio, but a Minister without authority; a Minister without direction, humiliated and humbled by his own Prime Minister. This is a ministry dismantled by a Prime Minister who has the creative vision of a computer. This, then, is the current situation, a situation almost without precedent, in which we find a council of Ministers supervising the Minister for the Arts in his first turbulent and confusing months of stewardship. </para>
          <para>Since 8th September when the Minister made a statement in the House - indeed, one of the few that he has made on this matter - the whole issue has been clouded in secrecy. In that statement the Minister outlined his reasons for the Government&#39;s deferment of the film and television project. It was because of the costs involved, that is, $7&#189;m over the next 5 years. Even if one accepts this figure, it would cost 11c or 12c per head of population per annum. This is the nub of the argument: Whether this school is worth while, whether it will be established on 60 acres or 8 acres, whether the consultants were right in their recommendation, and whether the Interim Council for a national film and television training school was satisfied with those recommendations. This is nothing but humbug. One cannot blame the consultants and one should not blame the Interim Council; certainly they have been constricted and inhibited to a very great degree by the shifts and in decisions by the Prime Minister who suddenly emerged on taking office earlier this year as the economic overlord of the arts in this country. </para>
          <para>One must confess to having some doubts as to the Minister&#39;s grasp of the situation which has been outlined precisely and most accurately by the right honourable member for Higgins. On 10th September in answer to a question from the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> about the possibility of losing the services of the eminent Professor Toeplitz, the Minister said, and it is recorded at page 1 112 of Hansard: </para>

              <para>- Yes. I suppose one has to be generous in these matters. The professor was employed at the Latrobe University. On another occasion, in answer to a question I asked, the Minister said he did not know of the opposition of the Federation of Commercial Television Stations to the project. On yet another occasion he did not know the number of graduates which the school would produce. It must be admitted that the Minister was appointed to this portfolio only on 3 1st May, but even in a moment of excessive charity it could not be said that he has displayed an intimate knowledge or a comprehensive grasp of this portfolio. In response to my quest ion on 28th October a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Peter</inline> Coleman to the Minister was at last tabled. It was not tabled on 26th October when the Prime Minister made his statement in this House. The letter clearly indicates the Council&#39;s unhappiness - indeed, its very justifiable suspicion. To use a colloquialism, it was getting the run around. This then is the brief narrative of the Minister&#39;s involvement in his needlessly protracted dialogue. What does one hope to achieve? What do we anticipate will be the benefits that will flow from the establishment of the school? The right honourable member for Higgins has already touched briefly on this essential point. We would hope that an expertise, a technical excellence and, above all, a continuity of that excellence would be available for the nation to project its own image and the cultural energies of our own indigenous talent. </para>

          <para>Some 70 years after the emergence of this revolutionary art form - perhaps it would be conceded that the cinema is the only true art form of the twentieth century - we in this country are arguing whether this is an investment which is worth while, which will enrich our society and stretch and exercise the minds of our creative people. In a copy of the British Cinema, Sound and Television&#39; of April this year, during the discussion with various members of the Film Training School in London, it was pointed out that in 5 years&#39; time teenagers will have their own television sets and will play programmes as they play long playing records today. As a consequence the density of information and entertainment will have to be much higher and we will need new talent from established film schools to supply this demand. One dominant theme that emerges is that a film school can provide an environment for experimentation, development and a society of its own which does not conform to the society outside. Within this environment the boundaries of film and television communication or experience can be pushed forward and this to me seems an excellent idea. </para>
          <para>I want to touch very briefly on the concept that has been developed at the University of California in Los Angeles. At this University they have a total concept film and television school for teaching motion picture and television which was opened in 1967. This whole concept is established under one roof. There are sound studios, editing rooms, standard 16 mm and 35 mm projectors, and included in this pre-production school are halls, theatres, facilities for scenic design, presentation of music and sound effects, and complete libraries. The post-production facilities include 26 film editing rooms, 10 video tape editing rooms and sound transfer rooms. This school, which is probably the finest of its type in the world, even goes into the highly difficult and technical field of animated production. The recording studios are equipped for double system projection and the area will allow multiple track microphone recording of voice, music and sound effects. I wonder whether this Government has examined this project which is already a living entity in the United States. </para>
          <para>This is a very vital and creative industry. It is a dependent and thoughtful industry. It is from such a film and television school as the right honourable member for Higgins envisages and I support, that the creative talent will emerge and it is from the encouragement and stimulation of this creative activity that I suggest our society will bc enriched. Yet when this opportunity is presented to us we quibble on the cost of an acre here or an acre there, a graduate here or a graduate there. The communication of ideas through the medium of television and film is the most comprehensive means of communication available to man. I want to turn now to some areas that are specifically embraced here. The Australian Film Development Corporation must be seen as the final creative entity that is so dependent upon the Australian film and television school. In the Budget this year, there was no further addition to the initial allocation of Sim made. when this Corporation was set up. One of the very great difficulties facing film makers in this country is that of distribution. For example, the producers of &#39;Stockade&#39; which, incidentally, was backed by the Corporation, now find themselves in the extraordinary position of being offered uneconomic distribution deals by distributors. One can only conclude that distributors are not interested in the indigenous product and they are, in the main, controlled by overseas interests. </para>
          <para>I want to turn specifically to the statement made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> on 26th October when he announced on page 6 of that statement that the Government had decided to add 2 new members to the Interim Council, namely, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hector</inline> Crawford and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Len</inline> Mauger. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crawford&#39;s</inline> reputation is well known and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mauger&#39;s</inline> reputation is equally well known. But for the life of me I cannot imagine - in fact it defies any logical explanation - why the Prime Minister should appoint these 2 men to the Interim Council when in point of fact both of them may well be opposed to the entire concept. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crawford</inline> is on public record as saying that he considers the establishment of such a school an extravagance and unnecessary. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mauger,</inline> as a senior executive of the Packer group of companies and the Channel 9 network, has never, as far as I am aware, expressed any warm enthusiasm about this project. Time simply will not allow me to pursue all of the statistical details at any great length, but I would like to suggest in conclusion that through this film and television training school we will create a professional talent and a creative ability. We have every opportunity to do so. </para>
          <para>We are one of the few nations in the world which do not do so. If we accept this challenge then we can emerge as a beacon of creative originality in this part of the world, for if this school is established it will be the only one of its kind in the Pacific area and will therefore be making a vital contribution to our own industry and our own people. It also will provide an opportunity for so many of our near neighbours and it will allow for the dissemination of our particular talents. I am appalled and ashamed that in this, the last half of the twentieth century, we are still confused and totally uncertain and unconvinced that we can project a maturity and a sophistication through this incredibly persuasive medium that can and will shape our attitudes. If this film and television school is scrapped or is emasculated because it was given birth by the right honourable member for Higgins it will be to this Government&#39;s eternal shame. Let us have an end to this indecision and uncertainty and create a worth while, tangible and productive stage for our artistic and creative talents. </para>

It is felt that perhaps the best way to deal with the situation today is to provide a statement to the House of a survey which had been provided to the committee of Ministers giving the historical background of the Interim Council for the national film and television training school and related matters.

          <para>The Australian Council for the Arts appointed a Film Committee in November 1968 to examine the future of the film industry. It made 4 recommendations: Firstly, that a policy of protection for the film industry was essential, and recommended that the Tariff Board look into the matter fully; secondly, the establishment of a national film and television training school; thirdly, the establishment of an Australian film and television corporation; and fourthly, the establishment of an experimental film and television fund. This report went to the then Prime Minister in May 1969. In a Press statement in August of that year, the then Prime Minister announced that the Government had adopted the second, third and fourth recommendations. According to this earlier report, the proposal for a film school arose from a national conference organised by the United Nations Education, Science and Cultural Organisation. The only estimate of costs that was available at that time was a report to the British Government suggesting that the cost of technical facilities, excluding buildings, would be of the order of $400,000 and the annual running cost would be $200,000. It was on the basis of this report that the Prime Minister established the Interim Council for the film school. </para>
          <para>The final paragraph of the report at that time read: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The first function of the Interim Council will be to confer with appropriate representatives of the educational and film fields and to recommend to the Government an appropriate location for the School. The Council will then consider the matters necessary to bring the School up to the point of an actual operation. </para>

          <para class="block">Those honourable members who have read the first report of the Interim Council will see that the Council took this paragraph as its first term of reference. The second term of reference was taken from the previous Prime Minister&#39;s statement in his speech at the presentation of the Australian Film Institute Awards on 2nd December 1969. In the course of this speech the then Prime Minister raised the question as to whether the national film and television training school should be part of a university or whether it should be associated with other institutions. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Should it, as another alternative, and perhaps the best of the lot, should it be a part of some entirely new - not college of education, not university - some entirely new centre where not only the national film and television school sets up for its purposes, but where the National Institute of Dramatic Art might perhaps set up for its purposes instead of in the University of New South Wales, where possibly the School of Opera or Ballet might also set up for its purposes, and where all these art forms which have so much in common could perhaps cross-fertilise each other . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">There is no doubt of the importance these proposals had for the Interim Council. For, in its covering letter of 5th November 1970 forwarding the first report of the Interim Council, the  Chairman  said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>You will see that the Interim Council has accepted the suggestion you made in your speech at  the  presentation  of the  Australian Film Institute Awards  last year, that the  Film  and  Television School  be part of a  larger Centre embracing a number  of  Schools  of  associated studies. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Interim Council has forwarded 2 reports to the Government - the first in November 1970 and the second in March, 1971. The first report recommends, inter alia: </para>
          <list type="loweralpha">
            <item label="(b)">
              <para>That the School be established as a College of Advanced Education with its own Governing Council . . . </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(c)">
              <para>That the Film and Television School be regarded as the first major School of a Centre  to be  established in a group of associated studies. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">From this  it  will be seen that the national film and television school should have the status of a college of advanced education. In paragraph 12.3, the report goes on to say: &#39;Past experience in establishing other Colleges of Advanced Education indicates that some 60 acres may well be required.&#39; Taken in conjunction, these 2 statements would seem to indicate that 60 acres was a requirement for a national film and television training school. However, it is necessary also to take into consideration paragraph 1 1.4, which says: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Interim Council realises that it is not a viable proposition  to  set up the National Film and Television School on its own, with a student body of only limited numbers. In economic terms, this would be unsound . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">And again, in paragraph l l.S it says: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Therefore, the idea suggested by die Prime Minister of a larger Centre, in which the independent Film and Television School would share the common facilities and services with other similarly oriented Schools, is supported by the Interim Council. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">These were the major recommendations in the 2 reports of the Interim Council, the second of which was received by the Government on 25th March 1971. </para>
          <para>It will be noticed that there is no reference to the estimate of the cost of these proposals in either of the two Reports. The first time that the costs of these proposals were examined was on 22nd June, when the Minister for the Environment met the  Chairman  of the Interim Council in Sydney. For this meeting, the  Chairman  had asked the executive officer to prepare some draft estimates of costs. This was the first time, apparently, on which the Council had made any attempt to look at the financial implications of their reports, for the  Chairman  has said: T stressed at the same time that they had not yet been considered by the Council&#39;. It was at this meeting that the Minister suggested that the Council should prepare for his consideration a less ambitious programme involving the recommendation to proceed immediately with the least expensive steps and approach the more costly steps over a period of time. It was at this interview that the first mention of an 8-acre site occurred. Nowhere in the first or second reports can there be found any reference to 8 acres. </para>
          <para>Following these discussions, the  Chairman  submitted draft estimates of costs to the Interim Council and then forwarded them to the Minister on 30th June. An examination of these estimates shows that the cost of land for 60 acres would be $2.4m and for 8 acres $350,000; the cost of buildings $1,750,000; capital costs (excluding the cost of land and buildings) $1,69 1,000; and running costs for the first 5 years $1,807,000. The total costs, based on the 60 acre site, were of the order of S7.6m based on a 5-year period, lt will be seen from this report that the Minister had endeavoured to ask the Council to recommend a less ambitious programme. The Government was facing a period of financial stringency and all recommendations for increased Government expenditure were being examined carefully. However, in smile of these discussions, the  Chairman  of the Council wrote on 28th July 1971, saying: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Council also is anxious to make perfectly clear that its recommendation on the purchase of the land, now available in a non-intensive subdivision, is based on the belief that the site should not be confined to the area needed solely for a Film and Television School. Other Schools in associated studies are under active consideration, and their eventual close association and physical location alongside the Film School is considered of great importance to its long-term success. The opportunity to acquire the full site so advantageously will never re-occur. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>From this letter, it is clear that the Interim Council&#39;s proposals involved the purchase of a 60 acre site, together with the other recommendations contained in the estimates of costs referred to above. This was the basis of the statement that the Minister made on this matter in the House on 8th September. It was the first occasion on which the matter had been raised in the House, and, in the course of his statement, the Minister said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Whilst the Council&#39;s enthusiasm for the project is fully apparent, the continuing economic stringencies and the substantial cost, which is estimated to be over $7m during the first S years, have led to consideration of their proposals being deferred for 12 months. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It is clear from the documents that have been tabled that, if the Government had endorsed  the  reports and proposals of the Council, its recommendations would have involved the Government in an expenditure of over $7. 6m over the next 5 years. These recommendations were endorsed by the  Chairman  of the Interim Council as recently as 25th October 1971, for in his message at that time be said:   . . lt is the continued view of the Interim Council that the School would succeed best, and some say only succeed, if it were part of a consortium of Schools. The School should not exist in isolation but should be part of a Centre of Schools of related activities. In other words, the Interim Council has never recommended the Film School being established on  8  acres, although this is the area of land suggested if the School were established in isolation. </para>
          <para>However, the recommendation of the Council always has been, and remains, that the best interests of the School would be to establish it in conjunction with other Schools in related subjects, upon when basis  the  recommendation was made for the purchase now, at an advantageous price, of the full area of sixty acres. . . . </para>
          <para>So far I have dealt with the details of costs of the proposals of the Interim Council. I now turn to examine briefly the estimate of the number of graduates who should be trained at the film school for employment in the industry in Australia. There is no indication in the original report of the film committee that there had been consultation with the industry in Australia or any estimate of the likely requirements of graduates, lt is also clear from the first report of the Interim Council that it did not consider itself able to estimate the requirement for graduates. In paragraph 9.3 it states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Because of the difficulties involved in the Council itself making a thorough analysis of the industrial opportunities, as distinct from those in education, P.A. Management Consultants Pty Ltd have been engaged to conduct a survey of employment prospects in the film and television industry. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In fact, at this stage the Interim Council had put in a report recommending the establishment of a film and television school and the purchase of land before it obtained any estimate of the required number of people to be trained in the school. The consultants, P.A. Management Consultants Pty Ltd, then produced a report in which they say categorically &#39;the School should plan for an initial output to the industry of a maximum of 15 graduates per year&#39;. The 15 graduates would be the total requirement of the following categories: producer-director, editor, script writer, film cameraman, and art director. </para>
          <para>The Interim Council was now in the position of having suggested a large complex of schools including the film school only to find that the experts concluded that the immediate need is for only 15 graduates per year, lt was at this stage, that the Council proceeded to examine and evaluate the conclusions of the report. The dialogue that ensued is reported in the attachment to the letter that the  Chairman  of the Council sent to the Minister on 25th October and which was tabled by the Minister on 10th November. </para>
          <para>Examination of this discussion shows that a number of estimates were made as to the requirements of graduates - some relating to a period 20 years hence - yet there is still only one concrete recommendation available, and that is the conclusion of P.A. Management Consultants Pty Ltd. </para>
          <para>At this stage, the matters that have been considered relate to the means by which the Interim Council was established and the reports that the Council has made up to this moment. However, it is now necessary to examine the future of this important industry. It will be seen that there are a number of questions to which complete answers have not yet been given. The first refers to the relationship of the proposed film and television school to the film and television industry as a whole, lt is important that every effort be made to ensure that the film and television industry is prepared to co-operate with the proposed film and television training school so as to ensure that the graduates emerging from the school would be employed, especially as at present there is some degree of unemployment in the industry in Australia. In order to ensure this co-operation between the industry and the Interim Council of the Film and Television School, the Government has agreed to the appointment to the Interim Council of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hector</inline></para>
          <para class="block">Crawford and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Len</inline> Maugher, 2 experienced men recommended to the Government by the Interim Council. The terms of reference for the Interim Council have also been widened. They have been asked to review the relationship of the training already undertaken by the ABC, the commercial television organisations and the film industry to the programme of the proposed school. The Council will now seek the co-operation of those interested in connection with this review, and, as soon as the Government receives its report, it will consider the most appropriate way in which it might act to assist the industry in this important area. </para>
          <para>The next question relates to the proposal for a multi-school centre, which some members of the Council refer to as a polytechnic of associate disciplines. It has been suggested that this polytechnic could include the Australian Ballet School, the Australian Opera School, the National Institute of Dramatic Art, a post-graduate school of industrial design, a post-graduate Australian conservatorium, and a school of communications. Consideration is being given to asking the Australian Council for the Arts to examine these proposals in greater detail. </para>
          <para>Finally, however, it is necessary to return to the first report of the Film Committee of the Australian Council for the Arts, and to the recommendation made at that time. This was that a policy of protection for the Australian film industry in some form would seem essential in the long-term, and the Committee recommended that the Tariff Board, or some specially constituted body, look into this matter for it. The Prime Minister has announced that this recommendation is now to be implemented. (Extension of time granted). I thank the House. Recent reports on the Australian film and television industry indicate that there is probably no other country in which English is the common tongue which is so poorly protected against American and British imports of film as is Australia. Within these conditions of unequal opportunity and what can, from many points of view, be called unequal competition, it is hardly surprising that Australia has had such trouble in creating a viable communications industry of international quality. Foreign television producers can afford to sell their programmes at &#39;dump&#39; prices to </para>
          <para class="block">Australian stations, having spent perhaps 10 times on a programme what an Australian company could afford to spend, and selling it for about a quarter of what it would cost to make in Australia, lt can be seen that many people believe that this is the first problem that needs to be solved. Until a solution has been found, the Australian film and television industry will not expand. When a solution has been found, expansion will take place. The decision of the Government to refer the industry to the Tariff Board shows that it now sees the whole problem, and that it is determined to assist the industry to expand and to relate all the proposals so that they fit in to this objective. </para>

            <para>- The thing I find depressing&#39; in this discussion is the timidity of the approach of the Government, lt seems that it needs cut and dried answers to every conceivable question; there is not much room for imagination or enthusiasm. If I may refer to the report by the consultants who drew up all this verbiage, in a summary of their findings they indicate, in discussing the needs of a national film and television training school, that &#39;there are certain problems. They concede this. They feel that the industry believes it suffers from 2 major drawbacaks. There are insufficient volumes of work due to a small home market and its inability to supplement this sufficiently in export markets. The next problem is that there is a great shortage of top class people to handle the key functions, namely, producer-directors, editors, script writers, film cameramen and art directors. They then say: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>These two factors are seen by the industry to be self-perpetuating. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The report continues: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The key to greater volume of work can never be more than partially solved by any government action in the form of increased quotas, subsidies or the like as the home market is just too small. The greater volume must come from export markets which are seen to require higher standards. Higher standards, in turn, depend on having the necessary top class key people. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Of course the top class key people depend on a greater volume, and so it chases its tail and will never get anywhere. The point is that the whole concept seems to be related to the needs of an industry seen in far too narrow a sense, as far as I am concerned. </para>
          <para class="block">For instance, this survey indicates that it did not include an assessment of employment opportunity for graduates of the school in educational institutions. It did not consider the possible desire of some graduates for self-employment or to work on a free-lance basis. It did not consider students from overseas who might attend the school and then return to their home countries. In other words, the whole concept appears to be seen in terms of the needs of the film industry, the people who make films that are shown on the commercial screen; but I suggest that there is much more to it than that. T would like to quote from an article written by Phillip Adams in a well known national newspaper recently commenting on the views expressed by the man who took his place when he resigned from the Interim Council, namely, Hector Crawford. Adams says: </para>
          <para>Hector&#39;s gloomy attitude to the employment prospects of graduates- </para>
          <para class="block">The Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Swartz)</inline> mentioned this. He said there is not much scope, there is not much room for people. That is the view of Hector Crawford who it seems is one of the men who has been given the prime responsibility of reviewing the whole thing. Adams article continues:  . . (who wouldn&#39;t make their debut until ground  1975)  is just as baffling. For a start, film and television are meritocracies - forms of expression that need new people as surely as agriculture need new crops or Parliament needs new members. Perhaps he is being prophetic. He goes on: </para>
          <para>Does society stop producing painters, novelists or musicians to protect the employment prospects pf middle-aged practitioners? Of course not. And it would be just as absurd (and cruel) to prevent talented young film-makers studying their craft because of the shadows Hector sees in his crystal. Adams continues: </para>
          <para>In any case, the Interim Council had carefully researched employment prospects and found that the industry needed more graduates than the school could realistically provide. For that reason we had always thought in quantitative rather than qualitative terms. </para>
          <para class="block">To get confirmation of that we turn to the first report of the Interim Council. In paragraph 9.2 it states: </para>
          <para>Graduates can be expected to find employment in film and television production, whether in government and national agencies or in the private and commercial sector. A limited number might also find jobs with advertising agencies or in other branches of the communications media. In addition the Interim Council has constantly been made aware that there is a growing demand fo.r graduates- </para>
          <para class="block">This is where a bit of inspiration comes into it - of a Film and Television School in education. Universities, Colleges of Advanced Education, Teachers Colleges&#39; and Technical Colleges . . . </para>
          <para class="block">Let us consider what Professor Toeplitz said about the whole thing - someone who has world stature as a film maker. He said: </para>
          <list type="upperalpha-dotted">
            <item label="I.">
              <para>notice from your Report that the Interim Council has said that graduates of the School will find employment not only in film production but also in educational fields;- </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">There were no estimates made as to the demands in these fields - in the universities, colleges of advanced education,  . . and so on. Tt is of course unlikely that the supply of experts in educational film and television will ever satisfy the demand. </para>
          <para class="block">In view of all the pessimistic views that have been expressed by the Government I would like to repeat that. Professor Toeplitz concluded: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">It is of course unlikely that the supply of experts in educational film and television will ever satisfy the demand. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">He continues with another bright idea, not that he is just trying to be bright but because he perceives a need in human terms for the community. He said:  . . I think that the National School should be prepared to organise courses of limited duration for scientists and their counterparts in other disciplines, who might wish to use film as an aid to their own research, as a medium for training other people or, perhaps, as a vehicle for the popularisation of their life&#39;s work. For such people courses in the fundamentals of film technique would be of immense value. 1 should stress that such courses would be of more value if they were made available to scientists and others at the outset of their careers, rather than to their more senior colleagues. </para>
          <para class="block">This is a case for having the school near another tertiary institution where these people could be produced so that we can get some cross fertilisation as has been mentioned before. In other words, I think the whole brouhaha about the enormous cost - which I think is nonsense as it is really a drop in the bucket in terms of the gross national product of this country- on the ground that there really is not a need because after all it will produce only 15 graduates and they will not find work anyway is sheer nonsense. It is narrow and it is looking with blinkers over your eyes. </para>
          <para class="block">That would be a minimum. There are many more avenues of possible employment for these people. Adams continues: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Recently Fred Eng, les, , the American producer . . . said that Australia needs cameramen, editors and technicians of international standard if we are lo persuade overseas interests to film more features here. But, more importantly, Australia needs these people itself - along with writers, directors and producers - if it is to develop a truly indigenous industry. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In fact Adams quotes, very interestingly, from a letter written by Hector Crawford to the Interim Council just 12 months ago in which he said:   . . since the purpose of the school is to foster the growth of Australian-produced television programmes and feature films, I consider that it should train directors and writers. Courses should also be available in the technical aspects of film-making, but it is the lack of creative personnel (ie, directors and writers) which is holding the industry back. An essential part of a student&#39;s training would be the widening of his horizons in a variety of fields other than simply motion pictures or television . . .&#39;&#34; </para>
          <para class="block">Crawford continues:   . . it is suggested that the school&#39;s curriculum should include lecturers on a variety of subjects allied to the arts.&#39; </para>
          <para class="block">That is another good reason for having it in a larger area associated with other schools and next to a university. Adams continues: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>And I would ask both the Prime Minister and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Howson</inline> to zoom in and take a big close-up of this sentence: &#39;Ideally, there should be one school established in Melbourne and another in Sydney.&#39; </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">So much for the poppycock about the one we are proposing being too much for Australia already. Crawford himself feels there ought to be 2 envisaged even at this stage. Phillip Adams goes on to indicate how film schools have been around since 1918 in various countries in the world. It is not a novel idea. He suggests that many leading film makers of Russia, Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia have all been graduates of film schools. He indicates that currently in America 100,000 Americans are studying film or television at the tertiary level. The equivalent for Australia would be something like 25,000 and here we are quibbling about whether we can afford to build a school to turn out about 15 people. What utter humbug and nonsense. I would suggest that it is time we recognised that this community is rich enough to afford a little bit of adventure, a little bit of inspiration and a little bit of courage in grappling with something that is new, some thing that we have not tried before. In any case for the future health and welfare of this community in terms of its intellectual and emotional development it is vital that we should develop this new form of communication. It is new compared to writing and other forms such as music, painting, and so on. Film and television are new. They are new mediums of communication. But just because they are young and a bit smart does not mean that they arc any less important as means of communication. In fact there are some who feel that probably film and of course television because of their capacity for immediacy and their scope in combining many of the other art forms ali together clearly visual, auditory and so on, are in a way potentially more important to the human race than all our previous art forms. It does not mean that film will displace these things, lt clearly builds on these other things. After all we cannot have films without writers. I am not suggesting it displaces anything. It builds upon these things but it is an integral part of the expanding necessity that we have for improving communication and understanding between peoples. After all, what else can exceed the capacity of a film to communicate beyond language barriers because one may not understand the language but whatever one&#39;s language one can understand the image. </para>
          <para>For these reasons I feel that the Government is betraying itself and the whole community is being so timid and so reluctant to proceed with what was in my view a very modest proposal put forward by the Interim Council. When the Council proposed 60 acres of land as against the 8 acres or whatever piddling area it was for just a simple film school, the Council was looking ahead to a broad concept. I think we should accept the recommendation of the Council. We should not at this stage ruin the chances of the whole proposal just because we do not feel we can afford S7m at this stage over 5 years. Of course we can. My guess is that the way the economy is going some time next year the Government will embrace the opportunity to expend the extra money to encourage or to prime the pump of the flagging economy. So let us stop the nonsense about we cannot afford it. Let us stop being frightened. Let us be a bit adventurous. Let us drag ourselves into the latter half of the 20th century. </para>

Earlier in the day it was pointed out that the motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders does not cover the subject matter which the mover will seek to discuss but relates to the reason for suspending the Standing Orders. The only subject matter that can be discussed is that relating to the suspension of Standing Orders. </para>

            <para>- 1 second the motion to suspend the Standing Orders. I do so for this reason. The House is about to go into recess for 7 or 8 weeks. We have mct for, 1 think, 150 days in the last 780 days. There have been continuous misuses of the majority control of this Parliament by the Ministry on every significant issue over the last few months, and one of the significant issues is the establishment of the national film and television training school. This debate has now been pushed right into limbo so that it will never be raised again. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> the situation is this: This Parliament is the forum of the nation. It can operate as a forum only if there is public debate on public issues. One of the important public issues of the moment is the film school. We have heard continual remarks from the other side of the House. There has been a misuse of question time. The only way in which the Opposition can put its point of view and the only way in which the honourable member for Oxley can put his point of view is to speak in this House and therefore it is essential that he be permitted to speak. The only way he can be permitted to speak now is to suspend the Standing Orders. The only machinery available to the Opposition in this context is to suspend the Standing Orders - these Standing Orders which have been misused continuously by honourable members on the other side, particularly today, so that the Government can have its say and the Opposition can be silenced. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>We must suspend the Standing Orders so that the most suppressed Opposition in a comparable parliament anywhere in what one might call the Western or parliamentary world can be heard. The honourable member for Oxley, in this instance, represents 50 per cent of the people of Australia and therefore he should be heard. We want to know whether the Minister is afraid to speak. Why is it that be has not been heard in this instance? However, the essential question is whether the Opposition voice is to be heard or whether it is to be silenced, and the only way it can be heard is through suspension of the Standing Orders. It is a disgrace to the parliamentary system that the honourable member for Angas <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Giles)</inline> and the Ministry, particularly the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Swartz),</inline> should continually misuse their majority control to silence us, and we must take every opportunity to ensure that our voice is heard, lt is important that the honourable member Ibr Oxley be heard. I do not know why the honourable members opposite, in particular the Minister, arc continually scuttling for cover. </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to amendments to the income tax law foreshadowed in 2 separate announcements I made earlier this year. Each announcement followed a decision of the High Court which showed a weakness in the present law of which taxpayers were taking advantage to avoid - quite legally - large amounts of tax which, in accordance with the policy of the legislation as approved by the Parliament, it was intended they should pay. </para>
          <para>The Bill is therefore one directed wholly against legal tax avoidance. This is a subject about which the Government is generally concerned at the present time and which it is closely examining in various aspects. The Bill is an important one, dealing in part with the most difficult question of providing effective legislative tests which separate the genuine public company from the ostensible public company for taxation purposes. It will not be practicable to debate the Bill in these sittings but the Government considered it should nevertheless be introduced now. There will thus be provided a full opportunity for the terms of the Bill to be considered within the Parliament and outside it before the debate takes place. </para>
          <para>Before the amending legislation of 1964, based on the recommendations of the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation 1959-1961, there had been considerable legal tax avoidance through essentially private companies masquerading as public companies. The 1964 legislation was intended to put an end to this. Unfortunately, as the High Court has pointed out, the 1964 amendments left a real gap. This gap has been used to obtain the same sort of unintended tax advantages for private companies as were available before the 1964 amending legislation. In broad terms, the general aim of the arrangements is to ensure that the trading profits of private companies remain taxed at the lower rate applicable to those companies but that the profits are distributed as dividends to companies that are public in a narrowly technical sense so that there is no incidence of undistributed profits tax or personal tax on shareholders in respect of the dividends. The arrangements strike at the very basis of our company tax system as it was intended by the legislature to apply. Moreover, they are highly artificial and serve no purpose other than tax avoidance. </para>
          <para>One type of scheme was dealt with by the High Court in the case of Casuarina Pty Ltd and ruled legally effective. Another type is known as the &#39;chain-of-ten&#34; scheme and is equally effective. Each type requires co-operation between genuine public companies and private companies so that, with the help of the public companies, the private companies can pay dividends to a company which is technically a subsidiary of a public company - and therefore itself a public company - for tax purposes. Of course the arrangements also ensure that the dividends effectively remain the exclusive property of the private company interests, except, perhaps, to a very small extent which is a recompense or fee to the public company for its assistance. </para>
          <para>In the Casuarina arrangement, the whole essence of the matter is that at the end of the year of income the company receiving private company dividends meets all the technical tests of a subsidiary of a public company. That is to say, at that time more than 50 per cent of the capital, voting power and the rights to dividends and other distributions are in the hands of a public company shareholder. There co-exist, however, countervailing devices which ensure that any attempt by the public company shareholder to exercise its ostensible rights can easily be defeated by the private company interests so that the public company rights are, in fact, worthless. These devices include such things as the use of shares redeemable at the instance of the private company interests only, but there are many ways in which the desired effects can be achieved. </para>
          <para>The &#39;chain-of-ten&#39; scheme takes advantage of the fact that under the present law a sub-subsidiary of a public company, no matter how remote from the head or parent company, must be treated as a public company. If a company is owned as to more than 50 per cent by a public company, and its voting power is controlled by the same company, it is treated as a subsidiary of that public company. If it, in turn, has the same measure of ownership and control in another company, that other company is also treated as a subsidiary and so on. Tn a typical chain a public company listed on the stock exchange provides a specially set up company with subsidiary status and this subsidiary sets up a chain of ten other sub subsidiaries below it. The tenth and last sub-subsidiary is the company to which the private company profits are distributed as dividends. The public company interests could force redistribution of these dividends along the chain - against the wishes of the private company interests. This is unlikely, however, because there is a 49 per cent private company ownership of each link in the chain which would result, for example, in only $119 out of $100,000 of private company profits finding its way to the listed public company at the top of the chain. The balance would all go to the private company interests. </para>
          <para>The Government has decided that, in the face of these arrangements, in all their complexity and their shades of organisational and factual differences one from the other, the best plan was to define primarily as a subsidiary of a public company one that is, at all times during the year of income, beneficially owned, in the fullest sense of those words, as to 100 per cent by a genuine public company, including a subsidiary which, on these tests, is itself a public company. This the Bill proposes to do. The Bill also proposes that a company which does not meet the 100 per cent test will not be treated as a subsidiary of a public company unless, at all times during the year of income, it is owned as to more than 50 per cent and its voting power is controlled, again in the fullest sense, by a public company listed on the stock exchange. Both direct and indirect interests will be taken into account for these purposes. </para>
          <para>These are necessarily stringent tests. As a safety valve against their applying inappropriately, the dispensing discretion vested in the Commissioner by the present law to treat a company as public when, for one reason or another, it fails to meet all the technical tests but should reasonably be treated as public, will remain. This is not a new administrative discretion, but one that has operated satisfactorily for some years now. </para>
          <para>The tests - stringent as they are on the face of it - could still be met and provide no more than a facade behind which the company is managed or conducted so as to render the public shareholding worthless or virtually so. Directors representing private interests, for example, could have the power to do this. This is a substantial difficulty which it has not been found possible to overcome both positively and comprehensively. The legislation therefore permits the Commissioner to deny public status lo a company when, having regard to specified matters relevant to the determination and set out in some detail, he is satisfied that the company&#39;s affairs are being conducted to this end. </para>
          <para>It is proposed by the Bill that the amendments I have so far described should basically apply so that, if the company structure had been fully established by the necessary issue of shares, etc., before 29th April 1971, the relevant company will remain a public company for the 1970-71 income year by satisfying the existing tests of a public company subsidiary. For subsequent years, however, the company will need to comply with the tests that are proposed in this Bill. Where the structure had not been established until after 28th April 1971, it is proposed that the company be treated as a private company for 1970-71 and later income years unless, of course, it meets the new tests in relation to the later years. These commencement provisions are consistent with what I said In my announcement on the matter on 28th April 1971. </para>
          <para>The income year 1971-72 is, therefore, the year for which, in the generality of cases, the new tests, required to be met at all times during the year, will apply. A good deal of that year has already elapsed and more will have passed before, if Parliament approves the Bill, royal assent is given to it. In recognition of this, a special transitional provision is proposed whereby a company will, with an exception I shall shortly mention, be taken to have met the tests at all times during 1971-72 if it meets them at all times during the part of that year commencing no later than one month after the date of royal assent. The exception is the case of the company which has performed the public company part in a tax avoidance arrangement of the kind against which the legislation is directed and which received private company dividends in the period of 1971-72 prior to its comp i lance with the new tests. </para>
          <para>Where a company remains a public company for the income year 1970-71, distributions made to it by a private company up <inline font-style="italic">to the</inline> end of that year will be treated as dividends paid to a public company. However, it is proposed by the Bill that any such distributions made after 28th April 1971, and before the end of the recipient company&#39;s 1970-71 income year, will not be capable of giving rise to an excess distribution to be carried forward by the private company into future years. In other words, a company will not be permitted to generate an excess distribution through excessive dividends declared under the tax avoiding arrangement in the closing stages of 1970-71, and after my announcement of the proposed amendments. </para>
          <para>The Bill also proposes an amendment to deal with another and different arrangement which involves avoidance of undistributed profits tax without actual distribution of profits. Under this scheme a private company issues shares to a genuine public company in return for a premium equal to the dividends the private company is able to declare. It is proposed that a dividend paid in these circumstances is not to be taken into account in determining whether the paying company has made a sufficient distribution of its profits. This amendment will apply in relation to dividends paid after today. </para>
          <para>As foreshadowed by my announcement of 31st August 1971, the Bill also proposes amendments to deal with dividend stripping arrangements which take advantage of the way in which the law at present requires the tax rebate on inter-company dividends to be calculated, lt is proposed that the amendments will operate in relation to dividends arising out of an arrangement which the Commissioner of Taxation is satisfied is by way of dividend-stripping. The term &#39;dividend-strippng&#39; has been employed in the courts here and in the United Kingdom and has come to have a widely understood connotation in professional and financial circles. This amendment will apply to dividends paid after 31st August 1971 and, in broad terms, will permit the amount of dividends subject to rebate to be ascertained by reference to all losses and outgoings incurred in relation to the dividend-stripping arrangement as a whole. in my announcement of 31st August 1971 1 pointed out that, because of the dividend rebate provisions, a company can effectively receive other kinds of income tax-free. In addition to the dividend stripping arrangement, a recognised way of doing this is for a share trading company to take advantage of the trading stock and dividend rebate provisions of the income tax law, operating in combination, so as to reduce tax on share trading profits. The Bill proposes that where the purpose of a valuation of trading stock is to obtain this tax advantage the rebate allowable to the company is to be calculated as though, instead of the valuation of stock adopted by it, the lowest valuation that it could lawfully have chosen had been adopted. This amendment will apply in relation to assessments for the income year 1971-72 and subsequent years. </para>
          <para>In my announcement of 31st August 1971 1 also mentioned that the rebate is required to be calculated on a basis that can be unduly advantageous to companies not involved in any arrangement for legal lax avoidance. On this aspect of the matter the Government has received a large volume of representations and it has become quite clear that there is no simple way of altering the basis of the rebate without giving rise lo serious anomalies between different company structures. For this reason the Government has considered that it should confine the proposals of this Bill to measures directed against legal tax avoidance. An examination of the other matter will continue, paying particular regard to the exigencies of company organisation. If it is found appropriate, amending legislation to deal with the matter will be brought forward at a later time. </para>
          <para>A number of the provisions - unavoidably and, I think, quite appropriately - turn primarily upon the Commissioner of Taxation being satisfied as to certain matters. If the taxpayer disputes the opinion formed by the Commissioner on the facts of a particular case, the usual rights of objection and appeal against the Commissioner&#39;s decision will, of course, be open to him. A memorandum explaining technical features of the Bill is being made available for the use of honourable members. I commend the Bill to the House. </para>

            <para>- I must say that 1 concur with my friend, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden),</inline> in his view that we are entitled to take the utmost steps that we wish to take with respect to what appears to be an intent to subvert the provisions of the Act by what might be called legal contrivances. The Casuarina case which the Treasurer mentioned is an instance of what I mean. I take the firm view that most people in the community cannot avoid the legal obligation to pay taxation and that those who try to be clever about the inadequacies of the law deserve to be met with the harshest consequences if it is felt that they are subverting the principle of an Act. </para>

          <para class="block">Early in his speech, the Minister said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>There will thus be provided a full opportunity for the terms of the Bill to be considered within the Parliament and outside it before the debate takes place. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">No opportunity will be provided within the Parliament to debate this matter until we resume in February. I hope that an opportunity will be given early in the next sessional period, before the Bill comes on for debate, lo discuss some of the principles involved. I must say that I am at one with the Treasurer on this issue. Legal gentlemen try to draw very fine distinctions between the evading of taxation and the avoiding of taxation. They become rather sensitive when one term rather than another is used. Candidly, J find it a bit difficult at times to know what is the difference between &#39;evading&#39; and &#39;avoiding&#39;. Legally there are some distinctions. 1 hope that we will be given some kind of opportunity to debate this matter and i hope that those people who are affected by matters of this type will make their representations. </para>
          <para>I suppose that the proposition that I am about to put is implicit in the whole taxation structure. I take as an example the manufacture of boot polish. If a company is unsuccessful in making boot polish - most boot polish manufacturers in Australia have been quite successful; the Kiwi company is a good example, but my remarks refer to any company that is unsuccessful in prosecuting a particular endeavour - and it has capital resources, that company then can go backwards, if you like, from boot polish manufacture to making boots. On the other hand, if a company is successful in manufacturing tobacco should it be able to move forward into the manufacture of, say, lemonade or wine? These are some of the matters that we have to face up to and this leads me to deal now with loss companies. This is a curious device. It involves firms which, if they were individuals, would be declared bankrupt, but which, because of the provisions of the law, may be bought as loss companies, as they are called, and there is a tax value in such companies to the buyer. Candidly, I would like to remove that kind of opportunity. In my view if one has been unsuccessful in one endeavour that may be a tragedy to him. but his business should not be available as a grab for someone else who is successful in another endeavour. I would like to see these matters contemplated in some detail before the House considers them. The Treasurer and I are at one on these issues. Part of this legislation deals with the ability of a private company to become a public company simply to accept the taxation advantage involved. The law should not allow such an opportunity. I was interested the other night to hear the honourable member for Wentworth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bury)</inline> ask a question about this matter. I suppose there are some disadvantages as well as advantages in dividend stripping, as it is described. But to most people it is an occult science, lt. has overtones of mystery and so on. The Treasurer on occasions has apparently felt that I was hostile, rather than sympathetic, towards him. On this issue 1 am at one with him and I acknowledge the practical difficulties involved when the law takes a certain view. The law tries to set out a code of behaviour. I have often quoted the view of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Mansfield of the British courts that an individual is entitled, if he wants to, to drive a coach and horses through the law, but the law is also entitled to block such people. I am on the side of the law in blocking these activities 1 have been speaking about. </para>
          <para>One of the difficulties in our system is that the majority of people who are described as taxpayers have no ability whatever to evade their proper and legal responsibilities. But there is the clever group who, by one means or another, within or without the law, or by means of the interpretation of the law, reduce the tax payable by them and this short fall in revenue has to be made up by those who have no legitimate device by which they can reduce their taxes. I and my Party are with the Treasurer on any legitimate attempt to close these loopholes to those who might be described as the shrewd lawyers in the community; alt praise to their professional ability but no praise to their zeal as far as bending the law is concerned. </para>

          <para>That the Bill be now read a second time. This Bill is complementary to the Income Tax Assessment Bil&#93; 1972 and will effect minor technical amendments to section 15 of the Income Tax (International Agreements) Act. For the purpose of implementing provisions of double taxation agreements which require us to allow tax credits, it is necessary to ascertain the amount of Australian tax payable on the relevant part of a taxpayer&#39;s income. Section 15 spells out the method by which this is to be done and refers, among other things, to rebate entitlements under section 46 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. </para>
          <para>As a consequence of the proposal to have an extra provision - section 46a  -  in that Act to govern rebates on dividends arising from dividend stripping operations, references to the new provision will need to be incorporated in section 15 of the Income Tax (International Agreements) Act in contexts where references to section 46 currently appear. The amendments proposed by this Bill will effect the necessary variations in this regard. They are described in more detail in an explanatory memorandum being made available for the use of honourable members which also explains the technical features of the Income Tax Assessment Bill.

            <para>- by leave - I wish to inform honourable members of the provisions which the. Government is considering including in the legislation being prepared for the supervision of general insurance companies in Australia. As I have stated previously in the House, it is not possible to introduce the proposed legislation in this session. A vast amount of ground has been covered, but a number of details have yet to be settled. In the meantime it will be helpful to all concerned if I outline in some detail the scheme of legislation which the Government has in mind. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The essential elements can be summarised quite briefly. General insurance companies would be brought under supervision by requiring them to obtain authorities to carry on general insurance business. By &#39;general insurance&#39; I mean all classes of insurance other than life insurance, which is subject to the Life Insurance Act. To obtain an authority, a company would be required to satisfy standards of financial soundness prescribed in the legislation. After receiving an authority, the company would be obliged to maintain the prescribed standards and would be subject to continuous supervision to ensure that it did so. An authorised insurer who failed to maintain the standards, or who appeared to be in danger -of falling below the standards, could be subject to inquiry and investigation, which could lead to the company being issued with such directions as were necessary to deal with the situation and, if those measures were unsuccessful, to the withdrawal of the authority. These are the basic features of the proposed scheme of legislation as it would apply permanently to companies wishing to begin insurance business after the commencement date. Existing insurers carrying on business at present would be brought under the same system of supervision by means of transitional provisions in the legislation. </para>
          <para>Before describing the proposed system of supervision in more detail, I have some comments to make on the purpose and scope of the scheme. </para>
          <para>Purpose</para>
        <para>Honourable members will recall that the Government&#39;s decision to legislate for the supervision of general insurance companies was prompted by the failure of some insurance companies from mid-1970 onwards, following many years of stability in the insurance industry. The companies which failed were relatively small and of recent origin, but their failure caused some apprehension that other companies may not be financially sound. </para>
        <para>The scheme of legislation proposes to tackle the problem by establishing the minimum standards of financial soundness to which I have referred and by providing a means of identifying and investigating companies which do not measure up to the standards. With a view to their reorganisation or orderly withdrawal from insurance business. In the longer term the scheme aims to prevent weak, inefficient companies from entering the business and by continuing supervision to keep the industry in a healthy condition. </para>
        <para>It must be emphasised that the introduction of legislation could not transform the financial condition of insurance companies overnight. It would lake time for companies which fell below the new requirements to be identified and for their situations to be rectified. The proposals however, open the way for a permanent solution of the problem. Furthermore, regulatory legislation of this kind cannot guarantee that no insolvencies will ever occur. It thus cannot guarantee that claims on insurance companies will always be met in full. If, however, financial stability of general insurance companies is established as a result of the legislation, the public will be given substantial protection in their insurance transactions. </para>
        <para>In the preparation of the scheme of legislation, consideration was given to the possibility of establishing a fidelity or guarantee fund, to which insurers would contribute and which would be available to meet deficiencies arising from liquidations of insurance companies. However, this proposal would present difficulties, at least in present circumstances in Australia. It would require sound insurers to pay for the mistakes of weak insurers and it could be held to be unreasonable to compel sound insurers to do this at the present time, while doubts continue about the financial soundness of some companies. Furthermore, the creation of such a fund in present circumstances could tend to perpetuate weaknesses in the industry, by underwriting the activities of companies engaged in risky insurance practices. </para>
        <para>It must be remembered that general insurance business in Australia is conducted for the most part by companies which are sound and efficiently managed. Only a very small percentage of the business is carried on by companies which could be regarded as financially doubtful. In considering ways pf supervising general insurance companies, the Government wants to avoid giving an impression that many insurance companies are weak and also does not wish to bring down legislation which is so restrictive that it would stultify the business of the great majority of insurance companies. </para>
        <para class="block">Scope of (he Legislation </para>
        <para>The Government&#39;s decision, as announced, was that the Commonwealth should legislate for the supervision of general insurance companies. The scheme of legislation which has been prepared accordingly concentrates on setting up a system of supervision and does not enter into other fields, such as the issue of policies, premium rates, the payment of claims and other contractual relationships between insurance companies and policy owners. </para>
          <para>Insurance Business</para>
        <para>Turning now to the details of the scheme of legislation, insurance business- would be defined as at present in section 3 of the Insurance Act 1932-1966 and would continue to exclude the types of business at present excluded, namely, life insurance business and accident insurance business undertaken solely in connection with life insurance business; benefits provided by a friendly society or a trade union for its members or their dependants; employer and employee superannuation schemes; funeral benefits schemes; and the business of insuring exclusively the property of a religious organisation. In addition, business carried on by medical and hospital benefits organisations registered under the National Health Act would be excluded and also self-insurers at present exempt under section 15 of the Insurance Act. </para>
          <para>Administration</para>
        <para>The legislation would provide for the appointment of a commissioner, who would be responsible for the administration, subject to the directions of the Treasurer. </para>
          <para>Authorisation of Insurers</para>
        <para>The legislation would prohibit the carrying on of insurance business other than by a company authorised to carry on that business under the Act. Applications would be made to the Commissioner, supported by information about the company and its financial position and prospects. The Treasurer would be empowered to grant or refuse to grant an authority and to attach conditions to an authority, but an authority would not be granted where the Treasurer, on receipt of a report from the Commissioner, was not satisfied as to the applicant&#39;s financial soundness as determined by the criteria for financial soundness spelt out in the legislation. Companies would be required to satisfy the following main requirements: A minimum paid-up capital of the order of $200,000, or the equivalent in capital funds in the case of a company not limited by shares; a solvency margin of assets over all liabilities excluding liabilities to shareholders, equal to 15 per cent of annual premium income or a money amount equal to half the minimum paid-up capital requirements whichever is the greater; a margin of assets in Australia over liabilities in Australia, excluding liabilities to shareholders, calculated in accordance with the solvency formula; satisfactory arrangements for reinsurance; reputable and efficient ownership and management; and capacity to meet obligations. </para>
        <para>With regard to the solvency requirement, I should mention that this is a test commonly used in insurance legislation overseas. Its effectiveness depends largely on the assets of the company being valued on a conservative basis and its liabilities being accounted for fully. For this reason, it is proposed that there should be a number of supporting provisions relating to assets and liabilities. It is not proposed that the investment policies of insurance companies should be controlled, but certain assets would be excluded for the purposes of the margin of solvency calculations and provisions in respect of underwriting liabilities would be placed under close supervision. </para>
          <para>Transitional Arrangements</para>
        <para>The transitional arrangements would provide for all insurers who are carrying on business as at the date of this statement and who made application to be authorised to continue to carry on business. Tt is expected that the majority would be able to comply with the financial requirements which I have outlined, but special arrangements would be necessary to deal with those which could not do so. It is envisaged that an exemption would be provided for companies which could not meet the minimum paid-up capital requirement, but could meet the other requirements. Companies which could not meet the other requirements at the time of application, but which demonstrated a capacity to meet the requirements within 2 years would be given time to comply. In the remaining cases, action would be taken to investigate their affairs, under the inquiry and investigation provisions of the legislation. Where appropriate, directions might be issued for the reorganisation of a company, but if no alternative could be found, steps would be put in train to terminate the business. </para>
          <para>Continuous Supervision</para>
        <para>The effectiveness of the proposed system of supervision would depend to a large extent on the range and reliability of the information received by the administration. The information should not only enable the insurer&#39;s compliance with the financial standards to be policed, but also provide an early warning of any tendency for a company&#39;s financial position to weaken. It is proposed that all authorised insurers should be required to furnish annually in respect of their Australian business a balance sheet, a solvency statement, an underwriting account and a profit and loss and appropriation account, all of which would need to be audited by approved auditors. They would also be required to furnish annually statistical returns showing, by class of business, premiums earned, provisions for outstanding claims, claims incurred, underwriting results and reinsurance arrangements, together with a return showing the run-off of claims for selected classes of business. In addition, there would be quarterly returns of selected assets and liabilities and monthly returns of premiums, claims and expenses. </para>
        <para>The Commissioner would be empowered to require explanations of items in any of the accounts and returns and, if not satisfied, to give directions for variation. Members of the public would have access on request to copies of an authorised insurer&#39;s balance sheet, underwriting account, profit and loss and appropriation account as submitted to the Commissioner, either at his office or at the principal office of the company. All other returns would be regarded as confidential. It is proposed, however, that selected information from the returns should be processed and published as aggregates for general statistical purposes. This would be an important by-product of the legislation, providing information which would be valuable to insurers in managing their businesses, as well as being of importance generally within the community. </para>
          <para>Inquiry and Investigation</para>
        <para>The scheme of legislation proposes that, if it appeared to the Commissioner that there was cause for concern about a company&#39;s financial position, he would be empowered to demand additional information about the position. If it appeared that there was a risk of the company not being able to comply with its obligations under the legislation the Commissioner would be empowered to serve a notice on the company to show cause why the company should not be investigated. The possibility is that, on receipt of such a notice, the company would take action lo correct the situation. If the company failed to show cause to the Commissioner&#39;s satisfaction, an investigation could be made. </para>
        <para>Following an investigation, the Commissioner would be required to give the company a summary of the conclusions and he could issue to the company such directions as to its insurance business as he thought necessary and proper to deal with the situation disclosed, including a direction that the company should not issue policies in respect of all or part of its insurance business. The intention would be that every effort should be made to avoid failure. Directions given by the Com moss i oner would be subject to appeal, but it is proposed that, for the protection of the public, a direction not to issue policies should be effective immediately pending completion of the hearing. </para>
          <para>Cancellation of Authority</para>
        <para>Provision would be made for the cancellation of authorities in particular circumstances, including a voluntary termination of an insurance business as well as a termination following an investigation. </para>
        <para class="block">Appeals lt is proposed that a special administrative tribunal should be established under the legislation, with a judge as  chairman  and with 2 members experienced in insurance, but not a director, officer or employee of a company or organisation actively engaged in insurance business. The tribunal would hear appeals on administrative decisions under the legislation which would be largely of a technical nature. Provision would be made for appeal to a court of appropriate jurisdiction on matters involving questions of law in the legislation. The outline I have given summarises in broad terms the provisions which the Government has in mind in respect of the authorisation and continuous supervision of general insurance companies. There arc, however, many other matters that would need to be provided for. </para>
          <para>Deposit Requirement</para>
        <para>The deposit requirement is not expected to serve a useful purpose after the proposed system of supervision has become fully established and insurance companies come under continuous observation. Increases in deposits which were large enough to give policy owners a high degree of protection in the event of a company&#39;s failure could put some companies out of business, including some small, but sound companies. A large deposit requirement could have the effect of weakening a company&#39;s financial position by limiting the availability of its assets for use in its business. Under the proposed new system of supervision there would be no need for large deposits to keep excessively small companies from entering into insurance business. That would be done by the minimum paid-up capital requirement and the solvency margin. It is accordingly proposed that the deposit requirement would carry on under the Insurance Act 1932-1966 until the new system is fully established and that the deposits would be released 2 years after the commencement of the new legislation, or such later date as may be proclaimed. The Insurance Act 1932-1966 contains no provision for a release of deposits of this kind and a legislative amendment would be necessary to implement the proposal. </para>
          <para>Lloyd&#39;s Underwriters</para>
        <para>The system of supervision which I have outlined relates to companies incorporated in the usual way. Lloyd&#39;s of London, who have carried on insurance business in Australia for many years, do not fit easily into that kind of legislation, because Lloyd&#39;s underwriters are individuals with unlimited personal liability who form syndicates of varying numbers to undertake insurance transactions in many parts of the world. Discussions are in progress with Lloyd&#39;s through the general counsel in Australia for Lloyd&#39;s on ways in which Lloyd&#39;s underwriters could be brought within the scope of the proposed legislation. </para>
          <para>State and Territory Legislation</para>
        <para>There is a wide variety of legislation relating to general insurance in the States and the Commonwealth Territories. Some of it is of a supervisory kind, under which licences are issued for companies to carry on general insurance business, or certain classes of general insurance business. The remainder is for various purposes, such as payment of stamp duties and fire brigade levies, and the insurance provisions in a variety of laws on subjects such as hire purchase, housing and local government. With regard to the supervisory legislation, such as the Queensland Insurance Act, which exercises control over the whole field of general insurance, and legislation in the States and Territories for the supervision of companies carrying on workers&#39; compensation and compulsory third party insurance, the State governments are anxious to keep their controls in being for a period after the proposed Commonwealth legislation came into force. </para>
        <para class="block">External Territories lt is proposed that the legislation should be capable of extension to the external Territories of the Commonwealth by proclamation, but that provision would he made for exemption, on the advice of the Minister for External Territories, of substantially indigenous insurers in the Territory of Papua New Guinea, undertaking insurance business only in the Territory, from some or all of the provisions of the legislation. This is reasonable, because it would take time for the Commonwealth administration to identify companies which are financially unsound and to take whatever action might be needed to rectify matters. The scheme of legislation envisages appropriate provisions being made to safeguard the supervisory legislation in the States and Territories for an interim period. Provisions would also be included to safeguard the remaining State legislation on general insurance. Similar exemption would also be allowed for certain insurance schemes involving some administration sponsorship. </para>
        <para class="block">Stale Insurance insurance business conducted by State governments and their instrumentalities falls largely outside the Commonwealth&#39;s constitutional powers, and in any event there is no question of the financial soundness of the State Government Insurance Offices. However, those Offices form a large part - about 20 per cent - of the Australian insurance market. Discussions are going on with the State governments as to the extent to which they would be prepared to cooperate voluntarily in the spirit of the legislation, particularly in matters such as the furnishing of information without which Australian insurance statistics would be seriously incomplete. </para>
          <para>Insurance Brokers</para>
        <para>Following representations on the need to bring insurance brokers under supervision, it is proposed that the Commonwealth should legislate for that purpose. As honourable members know, the role of brokers in insurance transactions is to advise members of the public and to negotiate on their behalf with insurance companies. Many complaints have been received of abuses of this function and  a  broad measure of agreement exists that brokers should be brought under supervision. There is also wide support among the State governments, the insurance companies and representatives of insurance brokers that the supervision should be conducted by the Commonwealth. The main essentials of  a  system of licensing insurance brokers, on the basis of prescribed standards of character, education, experience and financial trustworthiness, are already fairly clear from investigations and discussions which have been going on during the year. The Government will be pressing on with the completion of this work in conjunction with the completion of the proposed legislation for the supervision of the general insurance companies. </para>
          <para>Conclusion</para>
        <para>I should like to conclude by thanking all the representatives of the State governments and members of the insurance industry who have assisted in various ways in the development of the proposals which I have outlined. It would not have been possible to reach the present stage without the information and advice which they have freely provided, lt is a good example of co-operation between government and industry towards a common objective of raising the financial standards of all engaged in the large and important business of general insurance. It will be evident to honourable members from the summary I have given of the main provisions which are under consideration that the preparation of this legislation is a substantial task. We shall be going ahead with the work with all possible speed and I hope that the legislation will be ready for introduction early in the next session. I present the following: paper- </para>

            <para>- The Opposition welcomes the intent of this legislation which at least spells out for the future a code of behaviour as far as what is described as general insurance is concerned. I think that the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden)</inline> described it as a large and important business. I do not think it is always realised that in aggregate the premiums of what are described as general insurance - covering such things as fire, marine, workers compensation and housing insurance - amount to over $ 1,000m annually. The amount of premiums is getting pretty close to the amount which the Government spends annually on defence. </para>

              <para>- Government defence expenditure is about $l,200m. It is not half. The Treasurer will have to learn his arithmetic a little bit better than that. This amount is getting close to the magnitude of defence expenditure, but nevertheless up to date it has not been subject to any overall regulation. 1 shall quote section 51 of the Constitution, that great section which delineates the fields in which the Commonwealth may make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth.

          <para class="block">At least we entered into the field of life assurance and were quite successful in carrying out that responsibility. Many years ago when the Treasurer was in a less distinguished position - I think that he may just have emerged as the Attorney-General - I asked why the Government did not appoint a Commissioner to be responsible for this type of insurance. If he looks back in the Hansard I think he will find that in the early 1960s or the late 1950s I asked why the Government did not appoint in the field of insurance other than life assurance a commissioner similar to the one who operates in the life assurance field, and I think the Treasurer suggested to me in reply that he did not think it was necessary. At least he has now acknowledged this need. I pay tribute also to one of my colleagues, one of the new members, the honourable member for Hawker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Jacobi),</inline> who has had some experience in this field. He has raised this kind of matter also. As recently as the last debate on the Treasury Estimates only a few weeks ago I suggested - I appreciate the difficulties in legislating in this field - that we have somebody to examine general insurance; that the Government should appoint a Commissioner who could at least explore the field in advance and indicate the scope of the legislation required. It seems to me that the Treasurer has at least now indicated a code. </para>
          <para>The need for this kind of legislation has been brought home to us recently by the experience of the sort of straw companies that have operated particularly in the field of motor insurance. I think it is a terrible thing in the community when literally anybody with virtually no capital, and not having even to indicate any provision in relation to the policies he writes or in relation to the risk that may be incurred, does not have to spell out any kind of ratio. At least the Treasurer has now indicated that legislative action will be taken in this field and 1 commend him for it. Again I thank him for indicating in advance the nature of the proposed legislation. I think we appreciate the difficulties that are involved in bringing this legislation forward, but I hope it will be introduced early in the next session. When the honourable member for Berowra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hughes),</inline> who was in the chamber at the beginning of the debate but who is not here now, was Attorney-General I asked him a question at least 12 months ago about whether certain straw companies were using the facilities of registration in Canberra when in fact they were operating in other States. I must say that I was assailed by all sorts of telegrams the day after I raised this matter with the Treasurer&#39;s colleague. AH the companies that protested their innocence have since gone broke. At least it was indicative that there was at least a smell in that field. </para>
          <para>Motor insurance is one type of general insurance. In this country something like 500,000 new motor cars are bought each year. Apart from America and Canada we have almost the highest ratio of motor cars to population of any place in the world. So motor insurance is an important field of insurance. Other types are workers&#39; compensation and fire insurance. Premiums for all these types of insurance add up to something like $ 1,000m annually. At least J welcome the proposition that now, belatedly, the Commonwealth is moving into the general insurance field. The Government having acknowledged the need to go into this field I hope that it will move as quickly as is possible, and I would hope that when we come back, discounting for the moment all the talk about an election later next year, we will be able to consider this legislation on insurance with some degree of tranquillity and some degree of detail. I hope that the Treasurer and his advisers will press on in the next 2 or 3 months and have the Bill ready for us when we resume next year. </para>
          <para>I hope that the Treasurer will lay the Bill on the table for a few weeks so that those who are involved can give us the benefit of their expertise. I had to take part in a broadcast today, and someone said: There is a lack of expertise on the Opposition side&#39;. I said: &#39; &#34;Expertise&#34; is an awful word&#39;. I think there is a place for expertise, but once we start talking about expertise it gets  a  bit tedious. But at least the expert can tell the not-so-well advised in a field what he thinks should be done, but ultimately it is up to the Ministers to determine the code of operation. At least the Treasurer tonight has spelt out a code in some detail, and I thank him for it. My only regret is that the Commonwealth did not decide to enter into this field much earlier. I am directing my remarks not so much to the Treasurer as to his predecessors. </para>
          <para>I  hope that when we come back here in February ari*d early March this will be one of the first Bills placed before us and that we will have time to look at it in detail and have a proper committee debate on it. Committee debates where we can get down to details are lacking in this House. I would hope that the Treasurer will not think that the only expertise or the only expert information available is on the Government side and that he will give kindly consideration to sympathetic amendments moved from the Opposition side in this field. </para>

            <para>- by leave - The Government has decided to accept the recommendation of the Australian Wool Industry Conference that the partial relaxation of the embargo on the export of merino rams be extended for a further 3 years. The limited relaxation will be subject to the same conditions which applied in the past 2 years. On this occasion, however, the Wool Industry Conference has recommended that the partial relaxation be for a period of 3 years instead of being reviewed annually as in the past. The conditions which apply to the 3-year partial relaxation which will commence on 1st February 1972 are: </para>

        <para>The current period of relaxation of the embargo does not expire until 31st January 1972. It has been necessary, however, to make an early decision regarding the continuation of the relaxation so that potential overseas buyers would have adequate time to make arrangements to operate at the next Sydney ram sales which will be held early in February 1972. The merino export embargo has been a controversial subject since it was imposed in 1929. Over the years conflicting views have been held on this subject in the wool growing industry. </para>
        <para>In November 1968 the Australian Wool Industry Conference, after obtaining expert advice on all aspects of the embargo and after thoroughly considering the matter, recommended a limited relaxation of the embargo initially for one year. This recommendation was adopted by the Government but was not implemented until 1st February 1970. The reason for the delay in implementing the recommendation was to give the opponents of the relaxation full opportunity to make representations to the Conference. In the event, however, the Conference reaffirmed its original recommendation. Again, on the recommendation of the Conference the limited relaxation of the embargo was extended for another year as from 1st February 1971. The present decision will extend the limited relaxation until 31st December 1975. Of the 300 rams authorised for sale for export in the first year of the relaxation, 222 were sold to various overseas countries. In the second year the number sold to overseas buyers was only 50. For growers there has been some uncertainty and considerable argument on the effects of the partial relaxation of the merino export embargo. There are some important issues which should be kept in mind in any examination of these arguments. Significantly there is the serious financial plight in which many and indeed most merino studs now find themselves. Ram sales have slipped alarmingly in the last 2 years and these sales constitute a major part of the income of these studs. it is important for the maintenance of the Australian wool industry that in particular the parent studs should not suffer such a contraction of income that they should move out of ram breeding altogether. Already most have been forced to diversify where this is possible. Indeed, it is claimed that through the application of the embargo on exports these studs have made a significant contribution to other sections of the wool industry in accepting that there should not be overseas competition for their rams. In the present economic circumstances of of the wool industry and of the ram breeders, it is important that no undue barrier be placed on providing some increased competition at auctions when because of slackness in demand so many of the rams have had to be sold for slaughter instead of breeding purposes. It is often forgotten that Australian merino breeders have been denied for many years the right to export their produce like most other Australians. This has deprived them of a useful source of additional income. Such income has never been needed more by our merino studs than it is today when the critical situation of the wool growing industry has drastically reduced the demand for their rams. The loss of this income plus the depressed wool prices have placed our studs in a very precarious position. </para>
        <para>It is not my intention to canvass arguments for and against the lifting of the merino export embargo. The arguments have been examined critically by the Australian Wool Industry Conference and it is on its advice that the Government is acting. Since the decisions in February 1970, delivery of the rams has been severely disrupted by the &#39;black ban* imposed by the Australian Council of Trade Unions on the handling of merino rams sold for export with a view to preventing their export from Australia. This &#39;black ban&#39; is still maintained by the ACTU and has a demonstrable effect on the confidence with which overseas buyers have operated at auction sales. Indeed, the action of the ACTU has caused great difficulties, expense and inconvenience to both the buyers and sellers of the rams. They have been forced to resort to making private arrangements in order to export the rams and these have been very costly. No doubt the action taken by the ACTU has also discouraged overseas buyers from purchasing rams. </para>

            <para>- The honourable gentleman might be interested to know that while I was at a meeting of the Food and Agriculture Organisation I was told that a profit of several thousand per cent was made on the sale of a ram in South America, the ram having been purchased at a sale here, but because of the uncertainty of delivery the buyers were not prepared to operate in Sydney but they were prepared to operate in South America. </para>

          <para>Such advantage as stud merino breeders could derive under the present partial relaxation of the embargo is thus largely frustrated by the action of the ACTU. The intervention of the unions is all the more deplorable as the export of merino rams is in no sense an industrial issue. This is clearly a case of the ACTU interfering for political reasons in a field which is outside its area of industrial responsibility. In doing so it has frustrated legitimate commercial transactions and interfered with Australia&#39;s meeting its obligation to overseas trading partners. I sincerely hope that the ACTU will now reconsider its position. I present the following paper: </para>

            <para>- 1 cannot speak on behalf of the Australian Council of Trade Unions but I can assure the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> that the Australian Labor Party has not in any way changed its opposition to the relaxation or the partial relaxation of the merino ram embargo. The views of the Opposition are exactly as they were before and they will stay that way until the Government presents evidence in this Parliament, allows it to be debated and a vote taken both in this House and in the Senate to support the relaxation of the ban. The last time that a vote was taken in the Parliament was in the Senate and the Senate rejected the Government&#39;s recommendations. As the Government was not bound by the decision of the Senate, its action being taken by regulation and not by an Act of Parliament or an amendment to an Act, the Government contemptuously ignored the decision of the Senate and despite repeated efforts by the Opposition the Government refused to have the matter debated and a vote taken. I would remind the Parliament that the Government is not consistent in this matter. We recall that when the reserve price scheme for wool was being mooted approximately 6 or 7 years ago - and this was a controversial issue just as the merino embargo is a controversial issue and it has been since 1929  - the Government did not act as it has now acted. It put this controversial issue to the wool growers of Australia to make a decision. The same preamble was applicable in that the Australian Wool Industry Conference had in fact recommended in favour of a reserve price scheme. I want to make it quite clear that the Opposition completely supports a reserve price scheme. A referendum was held but unfortunately, because of tremendous confusion throughout the industry, caused by intensive lobbying and misunderstanding, the wool growers voted against the scheme. This was, I believe, perhaps the biggest blow to the wool growers in financial terms, in organisation, etc., for a very long time. But we cannot look back. We must look forward. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>If this Government is to be consistent over this controversial issue of the merino embargo it should allow a referendum to be held, but it has not allowed a referendum. The Opposition has not changed its view. As 1 have already said, I am unable to speak on behalf of the ACTU. It is entirely a matter for the ACTU to make up its own mind on this issue. However the ALP is still opposed to any relaxation of the embargo on the export of merino rams until, I repeat, there is a debate in this Parliament and until a vote is taken. In that debate the Government should put forward its evidence, scientific, economic and otherwise, to enable all members of this House to debate it, to weigh it up and to vote upon it. This, I believe, is only fair. It is of no use the Government saying the Opposition can raise it. We cannot raise it. We can raise it as a matter of urgency; we can raise it by way of a notice of motion. But as the Government well knows we cannot bring the matter to a vote unless the Government wants a vote on it. We know from experience that we have never been able to get a vote on matters of this kind. </para>

              <para>- It is not a question of having the vote on the statement. We want a full scale debate on the issue. We have been told tonight that we can have only a limited number of speakers in this debate. The fact is that if the Government had allowed a full scale debate on this matter we would have been ready for it, as is the Government. I am quite certain that there are no members on the Government side other than the Minister ready to debate this question at length tonight. Therefore until we can have a full scale debate and until the views of the large number of small producers throughout </para>

          <para class="block">Australia are taken into account the Opposition has no alternative to questioning the Government and opposing the Minister&#39;s statement. It is our job to do so. </para>
          <para>It is all very well to say that the Government is putting forward a case on behalf of the stud breeders. I will not decry the stud breeders in any way. What the Minister has said about the parlous financial position of stud breeders is entirely correct. There is no question of that. But this is irrelevant in terms of the overall question of the wool industry itself. </para>
          <para>Another point I want to make is that we do not know what the last vote taken by the Australian Wool Industry Conference was. I have no doubt that I could find out what the vote was if I wanted to do so. However, at the moment I do not know what the vote was. But certainly the first vote on the AWIC decision was by no means unanimous. In fact, there was considerable opposition from very powerful wool organisations. I notice that the Minister for Primary Industry, who is at the table, gave no indication of what the composition of the vote of the AWIC was at this time.I can only assume that the result was the same as last time. I could be wrong and it could have been unanimous but I do not think it was. I do not think it was unanimous judging by the number of letters that members of the Opposition are still getting from organisations and growers and particularly, I might say, from many growers in electorates around the area represented by the honourable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Pettitt).</inline></para>

              <para>- I am doing my very best to do that. 1 shall conclude by saying that, to my knowledge, none of the arguments which has been advanced against the ban has been in any way changed by the Minister&#39;s statement tonight and, therefore, it is the more important that this House should be given an opportunity now of debating and voting upon the issue when, I believe, such arguments would be produced and such a vote would be taken as would prevent the carrying on with this iniquitous proposal. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline>1 rise to second the motion for the suspension ot Standing Orders and 1 shall speak to that motion now. I do not intend to canvass the question of whether the ban should be raised or retained. I think I can put my case rather well as more than 50 per cent of all merino studs in the nation are located in the Riverina and 1 want specifically to bring to the attention of the House the dilemma which this Parliament should resolve by agreeing to the suspension of Standing Orders and by the debate which would then ensue. Tn the Riverina there are many great stud breeders. They face the dilemma of this Parliament, and the dilemma can be resolved only by the adoption of this motion to suspend Standing Orders to give Parliament the opportunity to debate this matter thoroughly, adequately and in depth. 1 draw attention to one facet of this problem, apart from my own involvement in representing half of all of the merino studs in Australia and namely, to the importance of this motion of the suspension of Standing Orders in relation to the position of stud breeders. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> many months ago said in this Parliament that it is important for the House of Representatives to come to a resolution on this matter. He said this against a background that the Australian Senate - the other half of this sovereign Parliament of the nation - had voted against the lifting of the ban on the export of merino rams. The Leader of the Opposition on that occasion said that it was the prerogative of the House of Representatives to debate this matter and to come to a resolution. He said that whatever was the resolution by a majority of the members of this House, of course he would be bound by it as would all other honourable members. I hope that that is clearly understood by all honourable members. What the Leader of the Opposition was saying and what I reiterate and what all members of the Opposition reiterate tonight is that the decision to rescind this ban which was imposed a generation ago was made administratively by the Government. It was rejected by one half of the sovereign Parliament of the nation. This half of the Parliament has not yet had an opportunity to debate it or to vote upon it. This is the essential issue as has been pointed out by the distinguished and honourable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Allan Fraser)</inline> who, like myself, has a deep and vested interest in the welfare of studs and the people who arc associated with them. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline>I did not hear the interjection of the honourable member for Hume <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Pettitt)</inline> but I suggest that if he wants to speak you should give him the opportunity to do so because I should like to hear him on the subject. However I do not want to be misled by interjections at this stage. I simply say very quietly and positively that the members of the Australian Labor Party respect the sovereign right of the Parliament to determine these issues. We maintain that we have not yet been given the opportunity to debate in depth in the House of Representatives the issue of the lifting of the ban on the export of merino rams. What we have said is that we would demand and ask for this right on behalf of all the people we represent. If the matter were resolved by a majority vote of the House of Representatives - gathered, I would hope, as a democratic body, free of petty Party allegiances on such an important matter - to lift the ban, it would be incumbent on all of us to see to it that <inline font-style="italic">\hz</inline> ban was lifted. But of course if it were not the desire of this House - the sovereign House; the House of initiative in the Federal Parliament - to do this, obviously we would all be duty bound to suspend the judgment and to leave things as they are. </para>

I should like to address myself to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> but 1 should also like to tell my honourable friend that my breeders have 2 voices on this issue. The very fine family of Killen has said that in no circumstances should this ban be lifted. On other occasions the management of the Harry stud, which is one of the most distinguished studs in the nation and a very fine stud, said this ban should be lifted. </para>

              <para>-Order! The honourable member for Riverina accepted the interjection with great glee because by replying to it he could transgress the Standing Orders. As he heard the interjection and perhaps now has answered it sufficiently, 1 remind him again of the Standing Orders. I assume that the honourable member hopes that this House will agree to the motion for the suspension of the Standing Orders, in which case I would regret very much to find that by allowing him to transgress the standing order on the motion to suspend Standing Orders I had allowed the situation to develop where the honourable member had nothing left to say when the House agreed to the motion. </para>

That division of opinion has already been enshrined in the resolution of the Senate - one-half of the sovereign Parliament of the nation of Australia. In our House we have not yet been able to reach a substantive decision. Of course, I realise that if honourable members opposite do not want to do anything about it. if they do not want to reach a substantive decision, if they want to hide for reasons best known to themselves, they will not vote for this motion. But the motion before the Parliament is to suspend Standing Orders to enable all of us in this Parliament - whether we happen to be temporarily the Minister for Primary Industry or temporarily the member for Hume or the member for Riverina, it does not really matter-- </para>

              <para>- Order! I suggest that interjections from my right should cease. It does not make it any easier for the Chair in trying to ask the honourable member for Riverina to stay within the Standing Orders to have interjections coming from the right hand side of the Chair, particularly when the interjections are enabling the honourable member for Riverina to come round on the outside of the Standing Orders. I suggest that the honourable member for Riverina might stay within the Standing Orders, and so might honourable members on my right. </para>

As a matter of fact, I accept the opportunity to return to the point at issue. May I sum mate. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro has moved that we should suspend Standing Orders to enable the House of Representatives - at least one-half of the sovereign Parliament of Australia - to come to a resolution on a very important matter. This is the purpose in moving for the suspension of the Standing Orders.

            <para>(9.391  -  Dealing with the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders, whilst I appreciate the position which has been explained by the 2 members of the Opposition who have moved and seconded the motion. I should like to point out to the House that, first of all, this was a ministerial statement. The practice of the House has been that when a ministerial statement is to be made an arrangement is entered into to allow the Opposition an opportunity to respond. The normal practice has been for a copy of the statement to be provided within a period of 2 hours before the debate is to commence so that the opportunity is given to the Opposition to have someone respond on behalf of it immediately the statement is presented. After the response has been made, the practice has been for the debate to be adjourned. The same procedures were followed on this occasion as have been followed with respect to every other ministerial statement that has been made. This is the normal procedure. 1 am sure that it is fully understood by members of the Opposition. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I know that this is an important subject. I know that it is a subject on which there is great anxiety by some honourable members who believe that we should proceed to clear it up as quickly as possible. In view of the circumstances, I think that it would be desirable for a vote to be taken on the issue. I suggest that perhaps the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders might be cleared and that the House should proceed back to the substantive statement by the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sincalir)</inline> and the response which was made by the honourable member for Dawson <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Patterson).</inline> As has been requested by the 2 members of the Opposition who have spoken to this motion, we should then proceed to take the vote that they have sought on this matter. I suggest that, as soon as we clear the matter of the suspension of Standing Orders, we should proceed to the other matter immediately. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline>1  join in the debate on the motion to suspend Standing Orders because the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Swartz)</inline> ha&#62; made one or two points concerning ministerial statements to which I wish to respond. It is not very often that I disagree with the Leader of the House on these matters because it is true that we do have discussions about statements that are to be made in the House. But it is also quite clear to ail honourable members that debates on ministerial statements that are made in the:; Howe are not always confined merely to  2  speakers. There are many occasions when a full scale debate is arranged by agreement. I have no objection to the Leader of the House being adamant about a debate being adjourned after a statement has been delivered and a reply has been made by one member from thes side of the House. But the proposition that the Minister is now proposing is entirely different. The circumstances are completely changed The Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> has suggested that there ought to be a vote on this issue. T thought that this was the attitude which had been expressed very clearly by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Allan Fraser),</inline> lt certainly was clearly expressed by the honourable member for Riverina <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Grassby).</inline></para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>What is the position with regard to a vote on an important issue such as this? I do not want to transgress the rules of the House. But the p&#39;ain fact is that, as J understand the position, the Minister for Primary Industry challenged members of the Opposition to a debate on this issue. If the circumstances are that the Minister has asked for a debate, has suggested that there ought to be a debate and has challenged members on this side of the House to a debate, the motion moved by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro to suspend the Standing Orders for this purpose is a legitimate request. </para>
          <para>I direct attention to those honourable members who sit in that corner of the House and who claim to represent the wool growers of this country. They have made this claim despite the fact that they have failed in this respect. But they claim to repre,sent wool growers. Again  1  know that I might be in difficulty if I refer to the crisis in the wool industry, but members of the Country Party clam to represent those engaged in the wool  industry.  If one of their members, who is the Minister for Primary Industry, has issued a challenge for a debate on this subject with honourable members on this side of the House, this motion presents a clear opportunity for a debate to take place. </para>
          <para>This issue is an important one. The question is whether this ban ought to be applied or whether it ought to be lifted. The opinion of honourable members on this side of the House and. indeed. I think he opinion of some members on the Government side of the House, if not the opinion of those members in the Country Party corner, is that this ban should not be lifted. 1 think tha* this is the general consensus among the wool growers themselves. The Standing Orders do not permit us to debate <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> issue. We are speaking to a motion for the suspension of the Sanding Orders. But the Minister for Primary Industry has had the opportunity to make his statement. </para>
          <para>The Leader of the House has now StIffgested that there ought to be a vote on the issue. If there is to be a vote on this important issue, quite clearly the substance of the argument advanced by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro, very capably supported by the honourable member for Riverina who did not transgress the Standing Orders in the debate but who put his case very clearly that there should b; a suspension of Standing Orders which would enable this matter to be debated fully, leads to the question: What has the Government to hide? Sitting on the front bench now is the  Deputy  Prime Minister and Minister for Trade and Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony).</inline> He is the former Minister for Primary Industry.  1  think that he was glad to hand the portfolio over to his successor. </para>
          <para class="block">But the Deputy Prime Minister is here. Surely he has something to say on the question as to whether this ban ought to be lifted or whether the embargo ought to continue. </para>
          <para>The Minister for Primary Industry has made a statement in relation to this matter. The opportunity now exists for the Minister to accept our challenge. If he issued a challenge to honourable members on this side of the House, we now challenge the Government to allow a full scale debate on this matter. Therefore, I support (he motion for the suspension of Standing Orders. Here is a clear opportunity to undertake a debate in the way proposed. The Leader of the House has acquiesced to the extent that he is now prepared to allow the House to vote on the issue. But surely it is not a proper procedure to allow the House to vote on a most important matter before that matter has been considered fully by honourable members who. wish to express their views one way or the other. </para>
          <para>In these circumstances, if the Leader of the House is prepared to allow a vote, I suggest that he might be prepared to allow a debate. After all, if we are to make a decision in this manner, there are members on this side of the House who would like to express an opinion on it. Therefore, I support the motion moved by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro and seconded by the honourable member for Riverina that the Standing Orders should be suspended to enable a full scale debate to take place in this House. Then this Parliament will be in a position to record a vote and to make a decision. I believe that that decision would be in favour of the proposition that has been put to the House by the honourable member for Dawson <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Patterson).</inline></para>

It has been suggested that, in the course of the debate on the original motion to take note of the paper, I challenged the honourable member for Dawson <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Patterson)</inline> who is, as 1 understand if. the shadow minister for primary industry in the Australian Labor Party. I guess that, with the rivals behind him. he must be a little uncertain as to his present stature. The position is that he, in the course of his speech in reply to my statement, said that he fell that it was necessary for there to be a debate on the question of whether merino rams should be allowed to be exported on the basis that has been recommended now for the third time by the Australian Wool Industry Conference. Certainly, there are differences this time. In essence the Australian Wool Industry Conference has made 3 recommendations and its third recommendation </para>

              <para>-The honourable member for Eden-Monaro will resume his seat. I have not said that that is the attitude that I will adopt. The Chair has been asked to accept a motion for the withdrawal of a previous motion and I am making an endeavour to help the House. The honourable member for Eden-Monaro can shake his head as much as he likes but the fact is that the honourable member for Henty asked for permission to withdraw a motion. An endeavour is being made to arrive at a certain situation, which has been mentioned by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, so that this House can take action. To help the House arrive at such a situation it might be practicable to allow the Minister in charge of the Bill to make some comment on this matter. </para>

              <para>- That is exactly what I was doing. While the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Barnard)</inline> was speaking, I presume to the motion for suspension of Standing Orders, he suggested that I had challenged the shadow Minister for Primary Industry to a debate on the question. In essence what I said - in relation to the suspension of Standing Orders, let me assure you again - is that if we were going to debate the statement it would be necessary to debate the issues. I thought the honourable member for Dawson might well have talked about the issues instead of talking about the fact that he was being denied the right to vote. The point at issue at the moment is whether or not we should suspend Standing Orders in order to allow for those matters which the honourable member for Dawson suggested were necessary, a debate and a vote. </para>

          <para>A debate would originate around the statement made by me relating to a decision taken at the Australian Wool Industry Conference. That statement by me enabled the honourable member for Dawson, representing the Opposition, to make an exposition on what he felt were the issues relative to the statement. If we are going to suspend Standing Orders to allow this House to embark on another debate on the issue, we will be simply extending the debate which has already begun. We had been in the course of  a  debate on  a  motion which was previously moved but which the honourable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fox)</inline> has suggested he ask leave to withdraw, when the honourable member for Eden-Monaro moved the suspension of Standing Orders. In other words, the honourable member for Eden-Monaro moved the suspension of Standing Orders to allow for a debate on the question of the relaxation of the embargo on the export of merino rams, the subject in relation to which I have just made a statement. I set out the decision made by the Australian Wool Industry Conference; I recited the history of the decision. I set down the very grievous circumstances besetting ram breeders in Australia, grievous circumstances which apparently have not been taken account of in the attitude of members of the Opposition in this House. I set out a statement which was the beginning of the debate which the motion moved by the honourable member for Eden-Monaro suggests should be extended. Before this motion was moved we were in the process of debating the very issues on which the honourable member for Eden-Monaro wanted an extended debate. As I understood his remarks, the honourable member for Dawson felt it was necessary for there to be a debate oh these issues. </para>

              <para>- I rise to order. I seek your guidance on this matter. As I understood it, when I seconded the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders to debate the whole of the ramifications of the merino ram embargo, I did this to enable us to discuss the whole of these ramifications. Under the Standing Orders, as I understand it, we are at present discussing only part of this subject and I ask for a ruling from you on this matter. The Minister has said that we can extend the debate which is now in progress, not in relation to the motion for the suspension of Standing Orders but in relation to the previous motion that we take note of the statement. He said that we can extend that despite the limited objectives of the paper and the limited objectives of the Government&#39;s motion on this occasion. According to the Minister we can extend this as far as we like. I ask for your ruling. What the Government has done through the Minister for Primary Industry is to move a motion that would extend the existing ban and the debate under the Standing Orders should be related and in fact confined to that extension. </para>

              <para>-In relation to  the  point of order raised by the honourable member for Riverina, what the Minister for Primary Industry has said is that prior to the moving of the suspension of Standing Orders there was a debate on the statement by the Minister for Primary Industry to which the honourable member for Dawson had made a speech in reply. That question was in the process of being put to the House when the honourable member for Eden-Monaro moved his motion for the suspension of Standing Orders, the reason being, I surmise, that the adjournment of the debate had been agreed to and the honourable member wished  the  debate to continue. In seconding the motion the honourable member for Riverina sought to bring the matter lo a vote and at the time he raised this point of order  the  Minister for Primary Industry was actually saying that it had been suggested by the Opposition that there should be  a  vote on this subject. That is the situation at the moment. </para>

              <para>- The motion before the House is for the suspension of Standing Orders. I believe that the Opposition wants a vote on the suspension of Standing Orders and a vote on the motion that the House take note of the paper. Members of the Opposition could canvass, as I suggested to the honourable member for Dawson when he spoke, the whole range of issues so far as the export of merino rams was concerned. That, of course, was the purpose of the statement. Honourable members could move an amendment to the motion that the House take note of the paper if they wished. Honourable members opposite know their rights under the Standing Orders of this House and frequently exercise them, and in a debate on an amendment to the motion that the House take note of the statement they could, of course, canvass the whole range of issues relating to the export of merino rams. </para>

              <para>-  I rise to order. The Minister has just said that the purpose of the motion that the House take note of the paper is to bring this matter to a resolution. In your remarks, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, you</inline> said that the matter before the Parliament at the present time was a motion for the adjournment of the debate and that we could not make a decision at this time. I want your guidance on this, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Speaker,</inline> because what you say and what the Minister says are two different things. </para>

              <para>- We are talking about the suspension of Standing Orders in order to allow a debate on a motion relating, I presume, to the relaxation of the export ot merino rams. I have suggested that it would be possible, the honourable member for Henty <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fox)</inline> already having given an undertaking that he is prepared to withdraw his motion for the adjournment of the debate, that wc can then have a vole on the motion to take note of the paper. That in fact is the area within which the honourable member for Dawson was able to canvass the full range of issues relating to the export of merino rams. He was able to canvass anything relating to the circumstances of the wool industry, the stud sheep breeders or anyone else affected. He was in no way inhibited in his remarks, and I believe for that reason there is no need to suspend the Standing Orders. Rather, we should get rid of this motion and then take a vote on the original motion that the House take note of the paper. </para>

              <para>- 1 want to make my position perfectly clear. A number of ministerial statements have been listed on the blue working sheet today. It is the usual custom for the Leader of the House to discuss these matters with me. I consult the Leader of my Party, and if we agree that a statement is to be made in the House and give an undertaking to that effect I will keep that undertaking. I am not prepared to break a promise. The Leader of the House has not entered into any arrangements different from those we discussed this morning. The matters we discussed are listed on the blue sheet. The statement that the Minister for Defence wishes to make is a very important statement not only to members in this House but also to people outside this House. I want to make my position perfectly clear. I am not prepared to go back on an undertaking that I made concerning the business of this House. In these ir.cumstances I suggest that the Minister should be granted leave to make his statement. </para>

              <para>- 1 am rising on a point of order. The Standing Orders are such that the Government always wins. No matter what Party  is in  power there is a contingent resolution available and the Minister can move under that contingent resolution that he be given an opportunity to make his statement. The House might have to divide but the Minister can introduce his statement in that way. This is information given without a fee, even if I am only a doctor of law honor is causa. </para>

              <para>-  I make this explanation under standing order 64. I have refused leave to the Minister to make this statement on defence. I read the blue working sheet. I said  to  my colleague, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, this afternoon: &#39;1 want to tell the Minister that if I am permitted to answer the Minister or to speak  to  his statement  if  I feel I should on behalf  of  those people I represent, I will not refuse leave. </para>

However, in these circumstances and without withdrawing from my prerogative at all, I am prepared to withdraw my refusal to grant leave. But I want to say emphatically that nobody  in  this House, the Leader, the Deputy Leader, the Party altogether or the House itself, has any right whats over  to  take away from any member the right to speak when he thinks he ought  to.  I am as important to my constituents as the Minister is to his and if this matter is of some importance to the nation I am entitled to speak and I have a duty to speak. Nobody  -  I do not care what you do, whomever it may be - will take that right from me and none of you will silence me. I withdraw my opposition to the Minister speaking with leave. </para>

              <para>- I wish to inform the House of the arrangements that have been made for Australian military training elements to assist with the training in Vietnam of Vietnamese and Cambodian armed forces personnel. The 2 matters under consideration are: Firstly, the maintenance in Vietnam of a small Australian Army Assistance Group (AAAG) after the withdrawal of the Australian Force Vietnam; and secondly, the provision of Australian military instructors to train Cambodian military personnel at United States training establishments set up with the co-operation of the Vietnamese Government in Phuoc Tuy Province. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>As explained by Ministers earlier in the session, these matters were to be discussed with the other governments concerned. The Army Assistance Group is a matter for Australia and the Republic of Vietnam; the proposals to train Cambodian troops in Vietnam involve the governments of Australia, the Khmer Republic, the Republic of Vietnam and the United States. </para>
          <para>Australian Army Assistance Group</para>
        <para>The House will recall that on 30th March the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon),</inline> when announcing a reduction in Australian combat forces then in South Vietnam, made the observation that: </para>
        <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
          <item label=".">
            <para>. the Australian Government will continue lo assist the Republic of Vietnam, though the character of our assistance will progressively change. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para class="block">The Prime Minister went on to refer to various forms of economic assistance and training assistance. On 18th August the Prime Minister informed the House that the Government was discussing with the Vietnamese Government plans to retain in the Republic some military training and advisory elements if they were wanted and if satisfactory arrangements could be made. The hope was expressed that these elements would continue to work in close association with the United States&#39; effort. </para>
        <para>I am now able to announce the conclusion of our discussions with the Government of the Republic of Vietnam. That Government welcomes the continuation of this form of practical concern for their future, now that Vietnamese forces are carrying most of the burden of combat and Australian combat forces are about to be entirely withdrawn. In consultation with the Vietnamese Government, we are providing an Australian Army Assistance Group which will have a total strength of the order of150, including 30 instructors assigned to the training of Cambodians in Vietnam to which I will refer later. The Group will include elements to assist in training at the Jungle Warfare Training Centre at its new location in Van Kiep in Phuoc Tuy Province, and to assist in advising and training Territorial Forces also in Phuoc Tuy. It will include a small group of engineering personnel, who will be needed at the Jungle Warfare Training Centre at Van Kiep. and a headquarters and supporting element. None of the elements of the Group will have a combatant role. The costs of maintaining the Australian Army Assistant Group will be borne by the Australian Government. The group will remain in Vietnam so long as that is mutually agreed between the 2 governments and as long as it has a contribution to make. </para>
        <para>The Government considers that the small numbers of personnel of the AAAG to assist the Vietnamese in these ways will perform a valuable function. We have previously been engaged in this kind of assistance to the Vietnamese, and Army instructors have won for themselves a fine record. This effort complements the programme of economic and defence aid support to Vietnam, which, as the Prime Minister announced last August, has been increased to $25m over the 3 years from 1971-72. With the withdrawal of our combat contribution to Vietnam it is appropriate that a small group should remain as arranged with the Government of the Republic of Vietnam to continue assistance in the training field. </para>
        <para class="block">Training of Personnel of the Khmer Armed Forces </para>
        <para>Since Cambodia took up arms to resist North Vietnamese aggression, its Government has made both general and specific appeals dating back to April 1970 for assistance, and the Australian Government has given continuing consideration to these needs and to forms of help which would be appropriate and possible for Australia to give. For this purpose we have had a continuing exchange of information and views at the ministerial and official level with Cambodia and other countries interested in helping that country. As was stated in this House in November, Cabinet approved in principle the provision of a small number of Australian instructors to train Cambodian armed forces personnel at United States training establishments in Phuoc Tuy Province, subject to the feasibility of and arrangements for the proposal being established in discussions between the representatives of the governments concerned in Saigon. </para>
        <para>Military representatives of Australia, the Khmer Republic, the Republic of Vietnam and the United States have now recommended practical arrangements for the training of Cambodian personnel in Vietnam, and the suitability of these arrangements has been accepted by the 4 governments. Australia will participate in this scheme with a group of the order of 30 instructors, the exact composition of which will be determined in the light of training requirements. This group of instructors will be included in the total of about150 men in Vietnam referred to above. They will be administered and supported as an integral part of the Australian Army Assistance Group. The costs of this group of instructors will be borne by the Australian Government and they will work within the framework of the United States training establishments in Phuoc Tuy Province. As with the arrangements governing the Australian Army Assistance Group, our participation in the scheme to train Cambodians at United States training establishments in Phuoc Tuy is by mutual arrangement between the governments concerned and will be reviewed according to requirements. </para>
        <para>The Australian Government is firmly of the view that the Australian contribution of instructors. though small in number, to train Cambodians wm provide worthwhile and much needed assistance to meet the critical training requirements of the Cambodian armed forces. The requirements of the Cambodian armed forces for such assistance have long been recognised by the Australian Government, which, as announced earlier, is providing some training in Australia, and it can see added advantages in participating in a scheme for Cambodian training in Vietnam. </para>
        <para>Australia has been giving material assistance to Cambodia, decisions on which have been announced previously. In June 1970 the Government made a special grant of $500,000 to Cambodia to purchase logistic and defence support items and to help with economic aid. In September of the same year the then Minister for Foreign Affairs announced an additional $900,000 for aid to Cambodia including economic and logistic support items and, if necessary, arms and ammunition. This programme of special aid to Cambodia has continued in 1971-72 when $ 1.35m has been provided including $200,000 for the training of Cambodian servicemen in Australia. The Government believes Australians admire the way in which Cambodians are defending themselves against invading forces of North Vietnam. The Cambodian armed forces are small and not highly trained, and the Cambodian people are accustomed to peace rather than to the need now imposed upon them to defend themselves against military attack by the North Vietnamese. The Australian Government is convinced that Australians will consider that the assignment of some Australian instructors to train Cambodians in Vietnam is a most suitable and practical way of supporting the country in concert wilh others who are concerned. </para>
        <para>As I have stated, the instructors will be assisting at training establishments maintained in Phuoc Tuy Province by the United States: there is no intention of sending Australian Service personnel to Cambodia. The Government&#39;s policy of not stationing Service personnel in Cambodia (other than the Service Attache at the Australian Embassy) is a long-standing one, and there will be no departure from this. 1 lay on the table of the House for the information of members 2 Memoranda of Understanding, the first covering the Australian Army Assistance Group in Vietnam, the second on Australian participation in the training of Cambodian military personnel in Vietnam. These documents, signed on behalf of the Governments concerned, set out the agreed arrangements concerning the matters I have just outlined. I present the following paper: </para>

            <para>- The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fairbairn)</inline> has announced the commitment of about 150 Australian soldiers to South Vietnam after the withdrawal of the Task Force. There is little new in the statement that an Army assistance group will be retrained in South Vietnam. This was made clear in the statement by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> on the future of Australian forces in Vietnam in this House on 18th August. Nor is there much novelty in the statement that this assistance group will contain a subgroup of 30 instructors to train Cambodians in South Vietnam. This stems from the extraordinarily ham-handed handling of negotiations with the United States Government before and during the Prime Minister&#39;s recent overseas trip. lt was made clear to the Parliament that this request to train Cambodians had come from the United States Government. The Government went to remarkable lengths to disguise and rationalise this approach. Even staunch supporters of the Government such as the honourable member for Moreton <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen)</inline> queried the Government&#39;s performance. This honourable gentleman has on the notice paper a motion in the following terms: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>That this House is of the opinion that, until such time as evidence of a request from the Cambodian Government to the Australian Gov.ernment to provide instructors to train Cambodian troops in South Vietnam is tabled in this House, no Australian servicemen be ordered to instruct Cambodian servicemen in South Vietnam. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>If the memorandum on the Australian participation in the training of  Bank  personnel in Vietnam is intended to satisfy the demands of the honourable member for Moreton, then 1 suggest that u falls somewhat short of evidence of a request from the Cambodian Government. lt is plain that this arrangement resulted from a direct approach by the United States Government to the Department of Defence, although all sorts of vague proclamations have been used in retrospective justification. </para>
          <para>It is significant that New Zealand is not a signatory to the memorandum nor is there any indication that New Zealand is to participate in the scheme to train Cambodians in Vietnam. The Prime Minister at one stage committed New Zealand to this training scheme along with the United Slates and South Vietnam. This is an example of the sort of bungling and wrong information given by the Government on this extremely important policy issue. In the event the New Zealand Government has shown much more sense than this Government in getting out of Vietnam and staying out. The attitude of the Labor Party to these two announcements can be stated quite simply: We are opposed to the retention of an Australian assistance team in South Vietnam. We are opposed to the use of Australian servicemen to train Cambodians in South Vietnam. The Government supports the administration of General Lon Noe in Cambodia; the Opposition has very grave reservations about it. These are our attitudes and 1 do not want to elaborate them in any detail. - The main dangers of commitments of this sort is that they can be so readily used as the springboard for a massive escalation. An American army of more than half a million flowed on directly from the commitment of a modest number of advisers. Australian advisers have been used in Vietnam for just over nine years. With the Task Force out, there will be very little check on where and how these advisers will operate. </para>
          <para>The Government is quite adamant that it will not commit Australian soldiers to Cambodia, but South Vietnamese units are in and out of Cambodia all the time. No one can say for certain that Australian advisers have not gone into Cambodia or into Laos in the operations earlier this year. These are the 2 dangers of maintaining such a presence; that it can be used as the basis for the re-commitment of Australian units, and it is not possible for proper supervision of their movements and activities. </para>
          <para>Having stressed the Labor Party&#39;s total opposition to the 2 measures contained in the Minister&#39;s statement, 1 want to look at an important matter arising from the Government&#39;s policy of training South Vietnamese and Cambodian troops. This is the fate of the proposed jungle training school at Nui Dat. The Minister referred to the Nui Dat project in an oblique reference to the Jungle Warfare Training Centre at its new location in Van K leI&#93; in Phuoc Tuy Province. When the proposal to establish the school was announced by the right honourable member for Higgins <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Gorton)</inline> in April last year, it was to be in quarters vacated by reduction of the task force from 3 to 2 battalions. In October last year, the former Minister &#39; for Defence, the honourable member for Wannon <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> said that the school at Nui Dat would be training 400 to 500 junior leaders for the South Vietnamese forces by early 1971. On 30th March in this House, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> said the Nui Dat school had just completed its first school. </para>
          <para>A report appeared in the &#39;Australian&#39; on 23rd April, by Barry Wain claiming that a total of $600,000 would be spent on building the permanent training school at Nui Dat. This would include 60 married quarters, 5 student company areas, lecture rooms, a 500-man assembly hail and administration buildings, staff accommodation and mess halls. In his statement on 18th August, the Prime Minister said that the training school at Nui Dat would be retained if wanted and if satisfactory arrangements could be made. On 15th October the Minister announced in the bald est possible terms that the jungle training scheme would be moved to Van Kiep. lt was reported in the &#39;Sydney Morning Herald&#39; of 18rh October that Nui Dat base including the training school was being destroyed by the South Vietnamese as the Task Force withdrew. This switch from Nui Dat to Van Kiep which is a major training camp conducted by the United States Army has never been explained in a satisfactory way. </para>
          <para>The Government intended to maintain a flag force at the traditional Task Force quarters at Nui Dat. This was- made quite clear in successive statements by Prime Ministers and Defence Ministers and in statements given to the Press. Now. Nui Dat has been scrapped completely and the jungle training school dismantled. The Government should outline why it was not possible lo maintain the school at Nui Dat and why the training school had to be swiftly shifted under the American umbrella. It should also outline to the House how much was invested in the jungle training camp at Nui Dat and how much of the capital investment and equipment was destroyed when the camp was moved. A figure of $600,000 was reported in the Press and not refuted by the Government. If a sum of this size has been written off in a futile venture of this sort, then it adds new dimensions to the folly of the Vietnam commitment. </para>
          <para>Another mysterious feature of this announcement is that no reference is made to the formation of the mobile army training teams which were to be formed for service in Vietnam as the Task Force withdrew. This was announced by the Former Prime Minister in his statement in April last year. According to the right honourable member for Higgins, these mobile teams would bear the brunt of Australian participation with 130 men formed into mobile training groups to Ii a se with and train regional and popular forces in the field. The next reference I have been able to find to the mobile training team was in an article in the Melbourne &#39;Age&#39; on 16th October last year when it was claimed that these 130 men would be divided into 15 mobile training teams. There has been no further mention by either Government or Press of these 15 &#39;phantom&#39; mobile training teams. In a total commitment of 150 men with 30 earmarked for training Cambodians, a team at Van Kiep, a cadre providing advisory and training assistance to territorial forces and a number of engineers, it is not possible to get 130 men organised into 15 mobile training teams. </para>
          <para>These are samples of the way in which this Parliament has been misleading repeatedly about the Government&#39;s actions in Vietnam. The history of the jungle training school and the disappearance of the mobile training teams are important matters which the Government is obliged to explain to the Parliament. The Government is practising an act of deception on itself if it believes that these important policy reversals can be allowed to pass without Parliamentary scrutiny. In summing up, I repeat again the Labor Party&#39;s complete opposition to any further military participation of any sort in the Indochina wars. The last vestiges of military assistance will be ended immediately by a future Labor Government. But on this issue and on this note may i indicate at once that while we have consistently stated our opposition in this Parliament to the Government&#39;s decision to have Australian training teams located in South Vietnam for the purpose of training Cambodians, just as we opposed Australian intervention in South Vietnam, and while we welcome the Government&#39;s belated decision to withdraw Australian forces before the end of this year, we do not believe that this should be the end of Australia&#39;s responsibility in Vietnam. 1 am now speaking of the period after the inevitable political settlement, which is the only way in which the war in Vietnam can be completed sal.isfactorily. The Minister and the Government must be fully aware of this. </para>
          <para>This Government and any Australian government - no doubt the next government will be a Labor Government - will have the continuing responsibility of providing the kind of assistance that will mean something to the people in the devastated areas not only of South Vietnam but also North Vietnam, lt is a great pity that, in these ministerial statements which, of necessity, may be confined to one aspect of Government policy, there is too much emphasis on the Government&#39;s attitude in respect of what it will do in relation to its commitments in Vietnam and too little emphasis on the attitude that one would expect the Government to adopt as a humane approach to the problems of the people of South Vietnam. Irrespective of what attitude it may adopt if the Government is to be congratulated on any approach it has made in South Vietnam in the pas:, it should be on the basis of the assistance which it has provided which, J believe, will leave a lasting impression on the people of that country. This is an impression which has been created as a result of the attitude of those who have been in a position to provide projects of a worthwhile nature to the people of South Vietnam. In this way I believe that Australians in South Vietnam - quite apart from their general conduct as soldiers, to which I have referred on many occasions - have made worthwhile contributions. </para>
          <para>I have taken the opportunity to state in this House tonight the Opposition&#39;s continued objection to the Government&#39;s decision to leave troops in South Vietnam, whether for training purposes or as advisers. We believe that the Government is wrong in this decision, lt should adopt the attitude that New Zealand has adopted and which I mentioned earlier. New Zealand has decided that it will no longer retain troops in South Vietnam. It has made a clear decision in this respect and we believe that Australia should have adopted this same attitude. This Government now is prepared to maintain 130 advisers in South Vietnam to train Cambodian and South Vietnamese troops. I do not want to repeat what I have said on other occasions, but this is the way in which a country can become involved in a conflict that is of no concern to it. </para>
          <para>I conclude by saying that while I have slated the Opposition&#39;s objections, I reiterate that there will be a responsibility on any Australian Government to ensure that whatever assistance is required in the rehabilitation of the people of South Vietnam and of North Vietnam when a peaceful settlement to this problem has been found - I hope this will not be in the too distant future - it will be provided. The Australian Government should recognise that, because of the way in which it has been involved as a result of its commitment in that country, it should accept responsibility for the great task of rehabilitation. </para>

            <para>-! should like to emphasise the points that my friend, the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Barnard)</inline> has placed before the House. As I see it, an important principle is involved. It is not just the question that a small number of Australian soldiers are to be left in South Vietnam. Australian soldiers are not for lease, loan or sale. Australian soldiers are not available to carry out other people&#39;s diplomatic or political tasks. That is the principle that is before the House and that is the one which the Government fails to acknowledge. I believe that there is great dissatisfaction in Australia at the continuing location of Australian troops in this area. This has been a long and traumatic experience for the whole nation and one in which the Labor Party was involved right from the beginning in resisting the presence of Australian troops in South Vietnam. The Government has reluctantly at last come to the right decision to withdraw Australian troops from Vietnam but we thought it would be a complete withdrawal from the area. However, that is not to be the case. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It may be said that the people of Cambodia are entitled to the kind of support that the Government&#39;s decision would give them. I believe they are entitled to support as a people. Like my colleague, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, 1 have serious doubts about the Government and I will say a few words about that in a moment. But the facts are that it is only in the diplomatic field that I believe that Australia can effect useful results in this area. I believe that from the very beginning we prejudiced our strongest position in this matter by committing ourselves to military action. While we have any groups in the area, nobody will listen to us as a neutral, impartial and objective country. It will only be by our appearing to be neutral, impartial and objective and on the side of humanity that we will mobilise world public opinion on behalf of the Khmer people. With the accession of the People&#39;s Republic of China to the United Nations, there is a totally different diplomatic scenario. All of the people and all the forces involved are available to discuss the situation around the tabin in the international forum. By failing to use the diplomatic initiative, I think we are abdicating our responsibilities to the Australian public. </para>
          <para>I have a deep feeling for the people of the Khmer Republic - the Cambodian people. They are being overrun in somebody else&#39;s war. and therefore the Opposition resents the continuing commitment of Australian troops to this area. We believe that it removes us from the possibility of effective diplomatic initiative. On the other hand, I think we . should be doing something to relieve the physical suffering of the people in that area. We should be doing more in this regard. I know from my visit last year that the people were suffering severely, the hospitals were overcrowded, there was a shortage of beds, materials and doctors and hundreds of civilians were accommodated on the floors of the hospitals. We are doing very little about this situation in Cambodia. 1 personally hold the view that people have the right to defend themselves, and this was the reason for the position which I took last year and which in general I still sustain. But I believe it is little enough that the people will be able to achieve. By some means or other we have to entice the Vietnamese people, the North Vietnamese and the South Vietnamese and the governments of both countries, to leave Laos and Cambodia, and this will happen only as a result of extraordinary pressure being exerted by the people who support either side. We should be trying to get the South Vietnamese to the conference table. We should be trying to get the Russians to exert what influence they can. We should be trying to get other countries, such as Canada, to influence the Chinese to influence the North Vietnamese, and that is the only answer. 1 just want to place on record my disappointment at the collapse of parliamentary democracy - what there was of it, although it had the basis of a democratic system - in Cambodia. This Government ought to be attempting to convince the Lon Noe Government that it must revert to the democratic procedures which were part of the Cambodian situation. My friend the honourable member for Bendigo <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kennedy)</inline> who visited Cambodia earlier this year has reported to me that the people at that time were becoming deeply concerned about the situation in Cambodia. 1 believe that we have a role to play in this part of the world that has nothing whatsoever to do with a military commitment, lt is with deep despondency that we note the Thai situation and the collapse of the parliamentary system in Thailand, meagre as it was. This Government has been silent about this question. I believe that we should exert all possible pressure and influence on the Thai Government in order to restore the meagre parliamentary system which existed in that country. In this instance I suppose our Vietnam commitment is a symbol of our inadequacy and our false approach. We have always gone for the military commitment when in fact the best that Australia could do would be to help the people themselves. This goes for the people of Pakistan and the suffering refugees who, more than ever, will become the responsibility of the world community. </para>
          <para>Earlier tonight I perhaps put the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fairbairn)</inline> and my colleague the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Barnard)</inline> in an embarrassing position in this discussion. I believe that it is bad parliamentary practice to produce in this House an important document on defence or anything else that has to do with our associations and international commitments in this part of the world in such a way that it cannot be adequately discussed. One of the weaknesses which have appeared in the last few years has been the inadequate time allowed for the discussion of public affairs. Discussion of foreign affairs and defence matters has been most inadequately treated. That was one of the reasons why I put on what might be termed a demonstration in this chamber a little while ago, and I can give honourable members the assurance that while I am in this place I will sustain that view. </para>
          <para>None of us can abdicate his responsibility. Honourable members opposite cannot abdicate their responsibilities by leaving matters to the Ministers. They have very definite personal responsibilities to the people whom they represent, and they have definite personal rep on sib i li ties because they are a part of the Australian community. The continual silence on issues such as this, when ministerial statements are made, I believe, is an abdication of our parliamentary responsibility. So I want to place on record my disapproval of the procedure. I support the view of the Australian Labor Party, that this is a dangerous and unacceptable precedent which we are following in the training of Cambodian troops. I only hope that no Australian life is sacrificed thereby. It is again one of the issues before the public that Australian soldiers are not for sale, lease or loan, and we cannot commit people to war without losing lives. In this instance not one drop of Australian blood should be shed. </para>

            <para>- Having listened with some interest to the \ speeches which have been made from the Opposition benches I cannot restrain myself in silence. Only 3 weeks ago 1&#34; was in Saigon and Phnom Penh, and I must say something from personal observation. Let us have a look for a moment at the history of this Khmer Republic. The Khmer people once had an empire ruled from Angkor-Wat which spread throughout the Indo-China peninsula. It has now been constricted into the small country that we call Cambodia. The Thais ate into it in the west and the Vietnamese coming down from the north ate more and more into it along the coastal rivers. So, compressed into the little State where it now is, it was Anally brought up against its own Munich, as it were. The North Vietnamese entered into it through the collaboration of Sihanouk and took over large areas of the country adjourning South Vietnam for the purpose of prosecuting the war in South Vietnam. Sihanouk collaborated with the North Vietnamese. These people who once had a large empire spreading throughout Indo-China were then forced to decide whether they would see their whole country gobbled up by their traditional enemies or whether they would stand and fight at the last ditch, and this is what happened in the Khmer Republic. The people decided to stand and fight at the last ditch. They had met their Munich. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>So it was that a soldier and a patriot in Lon Noe decided that they had reached this situation. I had the privilege of meeting Lon Noe, and anybody who has met him - and I think that the honourable member for Wills <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Bryant)</inline> has met him - will know that he is a man who lives in a modest little house. It is no palace. He is not a corrupt man; he is a patriot. He is trying, sick man as he is, to preserve what is left of what was once a great empire. These are the facts. I am told, and believe, that 90 per cent of the people in Cambodia own their own little plot of land. Communism has nothing to offer to them. Now we, miserable creatures that we are, say: &#39;No, we will give them no assistance whatever. It might mean the shedding of Australian blood&#39;. The only assistance that we are giving is a small cadre of men, professional soldiers who like that profession, who are giving some training in Vietnam to selected Cambodians. We say: &#39;No, we should have nothing to do with them&#39;. Are we providing them with any equipment? I saw there boys, who I would say were 15 years of age, in a platoon who had been enlisted to fight against their hereditary enemies, the North Vietnamese who are spreading their empire throughout IndoChina. I feel ashamed to think that Australians would say: &#39;We must extend no help to these people in these circumstances&#39;. </para>

We will give no help to these people. We will give no equipment. Not a drop of Australian blood will be shed. We will wash our hands of it&#39;. This is what the honourable member for Wills said. He also referred to the Thais. May I say a word about them? He regretted the perishing of Thai democracy. I do not know whether there ever was Thai democracy. All countries have democracy. Forms of government go by many names. But it happened that I was also in Bangkok and I spoke with people who knew the situation, and what was the situation? The honourable member for Wills says that the Government has not told him what the situation is. Well, I will tell him. What happened was that the members of the Thai Parliament wanted to lay their bands on a very substantial sum of money - what I think would be called in America a pork barrel - and to spend that money in the electorates in order to win their seats at the forthcoming elections. The terrible General Kittikachorn said: &#39;We will not put up with millions being spent in the pork barrel to enable members to get back in their seats&#39;.

            </talker>
            <para>- by leave - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> in May 1969, I announced the Government&#39;s plans for the seventh stage of television development, involving the establishment of 38 low-power stations at relatively remote centres throughout the Commonwealth, at a cost of almost $5m. It was generally accepted that the stations would be provided by mid-1973 although it was realised at the time that, in view of the .great amount of work involved, this goal might be difficult of achievement. As honourable members may recall, the stations were to be established on the basis that programmes would be provided by stations utilising, wherever practicable, Post Office broad-band communications systems, either existing or proposed, and that where such links were not available, special minimum- type micro-wave links would be specially provided to carry programmes to the areas concerned. It will be appreciated that the task of establishing the 38 stations concerned in widely separated areas throughout the Commonwealth is one of considerable magnitude, involving not only the planning and establishment of the television stations themselves, but the construction of the various programme relay links required over long distances. In fact, this project virtually doubles the number of stations in the national network bringing the total to 82. The project has involved the carrying out of extensive engineering surveys by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board in conjunction with my Department in each of the 38 areas concerned, in order to obtain the basic information for determining technical operating conditions. In addition, it has been necessary for my Department to conduct detailed field surveys along the lengthy routes over which the micro-wave links are to be established. lt has, however, already been possible to bring 5 of the 38 stations into operation, namely those at Cloncurry, Julia Creek, Richmond and Hughenden in Queensland, and Norseman in Western Australia. The Mary Kathleen station will commence service shortly. The earlier establishment of these stations was made possible by the fact that these centres were situated along existing Post Office communication links with television programme relay capabilities. The present position with regard to the remaining 33 stations is that most of the technical specifications for the stations have now been determined by the Board and action is being taken by the Post Office towards obtaining the equipment for the establishment of the stations and associated micro-wave links. It must bc pointed out, however, that some of the specialised equipment required for the project must be obtained from overseas. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Due to the complexity and great extent of the work involved, together with shortages of key staff, it became apparent earlier this year that the project could not possibly be completed by mid-1973 and that unless special procedures were adopted, a delay of some 2 years on the originally expected completion date for the project might be involved. Accordingly, I directed my Department which, as I have indicated, is responsible for the actual establishment of the stations following receipt of the technical specifications from the Board, to examine the possibilities of reducing any delays to the minimum practicable. The Post Office has now completed its studies and I have received from the Australian Broadcasting Control Board a revised timetable showing the dates by which the various stations are expected to be completed. I seek leave to incorporate the detailed schedule in Hansard. i\fr Speakers leave granted? There being no objection, leave is granted. (The document read as follows)- </para>

              <para>- In summary, and providing no unforeseen difficulties arise, particularly in relation to overseas equipment, it is expected that all of the Queensland stations will be completed by the end of 1973 and that the Western Australian stations will be established progressively up to July 1974. If should be noted that a special trunk line and television relay system must be provided for the Esperance station, hence the expected completion date for this station is July 1974. The 2 South Australian stations, namely at Woomera and Ceduna, will be completed by October 1973. The Alice Springs (NT) station will operate with the use of taped programmes because of the lack of a Post Office broadband communications link to the area, and will be completed by December 1972. The King Island (Tasmania) station will commence operations in February next year. </para>

          <para>Honourable members may be assured that the Government, the Board and <inline font-style="italic">my</inline> Department all fully appreciate the desire of residents of relatively remote areas to have television available to them as early as practicable. The time-table which has now been determined is the most expeditious that can be arranged on the basis of present expectations. 1 would point out that it has only been possible to achieve these targets by the adoption of certain special procedures which, although involving some additional expenditure, will enable earlier establishment of the stations. 1 have, in addition, asked my Department to remain alert to take advantage of any possibilities which may arise that could lead to earlier completion dates, especially for these Western Australian stations presently scheduled for completion in 1974.

            <para>- I wish to make a few comments in relation to the seventh stage television development programme in what the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Alan Hulme)</inline> referred to as relatively remote areas of the Commonwealth. Naturally I am mainly concerned with the programme as it applies to Western </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Australia and, more particularly, to my electorate of Kalgoorlie. I do not consider some of the Western Australian areas in the programme to be relatively remote and this is one of the reasons why I am critical of the delay that is being experienced in the provision of a television service in those areas. I must express my disappointment and concern that, with the exception of Carnarvon, the Western Australian stations in the seventh stage will not come into operation until June 1973 in the case of the first station to be completed and until July 1974 in the case of the last station to be completed, that is, at Esperance. The Postmaster-General has informed the House that in regard to Esperance it has been found necessary&#39; to provide a special trunk line and television relay system which has meant a delay well beyond the date first expected. </para>
          <para>The people at Esperance have become completely confused about what are the real causes of the delays and how far the delays will eventually extend. A public meeting in Esperance in February 1969, if my memory serves me correctly, was told by representatives of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board that a service should be available during 1972. Since that meeting many representations and inquiries have been made to both the Postmaster-General and the Control Board in an effort to obtain a firm completion date. The early answers we received soon made it quite clear that the date given in the first instance as a probability was in fact never even a possibility and should never have been suggested as such, lt was quite unfair and rather cruel to build up the hopes of the people in that way on something which could not be achieved in the time and which, it would now appear, was never intended to be achieved in the time. Subsequently, further inquiries were made and 1973 was given as the year in which the station could be expected to commence operations. Then at about the middle of this year we were told that it was unlikely that a service would be available before early 1974. Now we are told by the Postmaster-General that the target date is to be July 1974, almost 3 years away. Is it any wonder that the people of Esperance are expressing concern and resentment at the continual extension of the completion date? lt is no wonder that they see them selves no closer to a service today than they were led to believe they were over 2 years ago. 1 am far from satisfied that the station will be on the air by July 1974. J hope 1 am wrong. 1 am not satisfied because I have been told by both the Postmaster-General and the Control Board that the main delay in the establishment of this station results from the delay in obtaining broad band equipment from overseas. This delay is claimed to be 2 years. While the delay in the construction is blamed on the 2 year lag between ordering and delivery of equipment, the fact is that the equipment has not yet been ordered and, according to the information I have received, an order will not bc placed until early next year at the very best. I have been informed also that there is a 1-year delay in the importation of television station equipment which in tura, I understand, cannot be ordered until it is quite certain what is actually required following the establishment or receipt of the special trunk line or broad band equipment. If this is correct, and 1 have no reason to believe it is not, we have the following situation in relation to Esperance: If the broad band equipment is not ordered until early next year, say March, then delivery cannot be expected until at least March 1974. </para>
          <para>The distance between the existing microwave link at Norseman and the station site at Esperance is approximately 120 miles, and therefore quite a bit of work will be entailed in covering that distance with the building of towers or the laying of cables as required. From what I have noted in relation to other extensions it will take much longer than 3 months to carry out that work. Therefore, because of the continual changes in estimating the completion date and the advice in relation to delays in delivery of equipment, and the fact that that equipment will not be ordered before early next year, I still remain to be convinced that the date given by the Postmaster-General tonight will be met. </para>
          <para>With regard to the line to which the Minister referred as necessary to serve Esperence, I had hoped he would have given us something definite in regard to what is intended towards providing a television service to those centres along the line between Norseman and Esperance; places such as Salmon Gums and Grass Patch. I had hoped to hear whether the line could or would carry the facilities or equipment required whereby the centres referred to could be connected directly to the line or whereby a separate service could be provided. The station at Esperance will, I understand, be of very low power sufficient only to serve the town area. If this is so, it is a great pity and something needs to be done immediately in the planning stage at least to ensure that outlying areas will not suffer the same delays and frustrations as experienced at Esperance itself. I notice in the statement that Mingenew will not gain a service before May 1974. This seems to be rather ridiculous, as I see it, because Mingenew is situated right alongside the coaxial cable carrying television to Geraldton which has been in operation now for several months. </para>
          <para>Surely there can be no good reason why a service cannot be established reasonably quickly. We were told 3 or 4 years ago that places like Mingenew, Mullewa and Morawa would have to wait until an experience was gained as to the extent of the signal from the Geraldton station. This was fair enough, but surely it does not take 5 years to gain that experience. If the Postmaster-General, the Australian Broadcasting Control Board or the Government - whichever is responsible- really wished to establish these stations as quickly as practicable, as the Postmaster-General has told us, they could have done so in a much shorter time than the statement proposes. Wc were told that Morawa, which is approximately 35 miles from Mingenew, would have to await the experience of the Mingenew service in relation to radius. Does this mean that Morawa will have to wait at least 3 or 4 years beyond the middle of 1974? That certainly seems to be the pattern which the Government is following. We were told a booster station would be provided for Mullewa as soon as the Geraldton area of service was known, and yet the Postmaster-General makes no mention of Mullewa at all. Does this mean that Mullewa is to be disregarded until after 1974? </para>
          <para>These delays are just not good enough. In addition, insufficient information is given to us in relation to the real causes of the delay. </para>
          <para>I notice that the Moora and Carnamah services are also in the 1974 period and yet they, as with Mingenew, are situated close by the coaxial cable. Three Springs, which is also on the cable route, will be a 1974 model. I would like to know whether this delay is also due to the delay in delivery following the ordering of equipment. Is that the reason? If so, it would be interesting to know whether, as with Esperance, the necessary equipment has not yet been ordered. Dampier and Port Hedland are not to be served before the middle of 1973, and most likely the end of 1973. I understand that the coaxial cable is all right, and if this is correct, why must there be a 2-year delay in establishing the stations? ls it again because the equipment has not been ordered? If this is so, we are entitled to know why it has not been ordered. </para>
          <para>I note also that the Southern Cross Bullfinch station completion target is not until lune 1973. Because that centre is right on the link between Perth and Kalgoorlie it seems quite unreasonable that whatever is required to connect Southern Cross cannot be quickly carried out. Kollyanobbing, an iron ore town some 30 miles from Southern Cross, can apparently, on the information I have received from the Postmaster-General, forget all about television unless its population, presently about 350, is substantially increased. It is only 30 miles from where a station will be set up, but there is no chance of a service in the foreseeable future under the approach of the present Government. According to what the Postmaster-General told me just recently, no plans, no surveys and no investigations have been made beyond this seventh stage programme, so therefore it is pretty clear that any area which will not be served by this seventh stage can forget its chances for several years to come, and at least until the very late 1970s. Naturally enough, I am delighted that such centres as Kalgoorlie, Kambalda, Norseman and Geraldton now have a station, and that Carnarvon will be serviced by the middle of next year. </para>
          <para>I know from my own experience that until a person has a television service he does not realise what he is missing in relation to the several programmes and the information contained in some of them. Because of this, every possible action should be taken to extend the service as quickly and as widely as possible. I notice that the Postmaster-General does say that he has asked his Department to remain alert to any possibilities of advancing the completion dates of these other stations, and I sincerely hope that this can be attained and that in fact the dates will be advanced very considerably. As I sec it, they should have been and would have been advanced had not it been for the fact that in February this year the Government instructed all departments substantially to reduce their expenditure. 1 believe this was the real cause of the delay and the real reason why orders were not placed. </para>
          <para>In conclusion, I take the opportunity of pointing out to the Minister that the service which Merredin people receive from Mawson is far from satisfactory resulting, I believe, from a weak signal. T hope that the Postmaster-General will take up this matter in the appropriate quarter to try to bring about a very quick improvement. It may be that the signal from Mawson could be strengthened, but this would perhaps only improve the picture at Merredin and do nothing to extend a satisfactory service east and north of Merredin. Therefore, as Southern Cross is to have a station at some time in 1973, if I remember correctly, and as it is 70 miles from Merredin it could well mean that the area between a few miles west of Southern Cross and a few miles east of Merredin would be no man&#39;s land. If this is so, then the proper thing to do would be to establish a station at or near Merredin. As I have just said, I hope the Postmaster-General will take some heed of what I have said in this respect and that in addition he will let me know as early as possible what is intended so that I can pass on the information to those people who at present are ruining their eyes trying to look at a picture on a snowed up screen. </para>

            <para>- 1 do not think that anybody will argue with the tremendous benefits which have accrued to those fortunate areas in the country with the advent of television. I can only <inline font-style="italic">endorse</inline> the remarks made by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Collard)</inline> and try to emphasise to the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Alan Hulme)</inline> that the various problems associated with delays should bc solved because there are still many areas in Australia that deserve, qualify for and should get television as soon as possible. In regard to the 38 stations of which the Postmaster-General has given details tonight, 23 of them are in Queensland. I am sure that my colleague the honourable member for Oxley <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hayden)</inline> would agree that that is a very good proportion. On the other hand there is a great need for television in the areas of Western Australia to which the honourable member for Kalgoorlie referred. While I am on my feet I would like to pay a tribute to the work force of engineers and other staff of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department who have worked continuously, one might say, over the years on the installation of television stations in the remote areas of Australia. These men are a dedicated band. I have met many of them in the north. I think they deserve commendation. 1 know that these men, particularly the engineers working in remote areas, are often frustrated by the lack of services and the delays in providing equipment from overseas. It is not the work force that is the problem, but the delays in providing equipment. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Let me refer to the target completion dates mentioned by the Postmaster-General. 1 assume that the list of television facilities he mentioned is not the complete list. 1 want to refer specifically to Queensland and to those areas in central Queensland that J would call the missing link. AH of the areas mentioned by the Postmaster-General follow railway lines, such as the Townsville-Mount Isa line, the Toowoomba Charleville Cunnamulla line with links to Goondiwindi, Dirranbandi and St George, and the Rockhampton-Longreach line. I want to refer to the area north of Clermont, which is one of the stations mentioned. The area between Clermont and Charters Towers is what one might call a missing link. A lot of people - small cattle producers, big cattle producers and coal miners - live in this area. It is an area which is growing with tremendous rapidity. </para>
          <para>I want to ask the Postmaster-General when the latest settlement in the Go on yell a area can expect to get a booster station or translator service. There is a town growing rapidly there. I believe that there is a need to give television to the people in these areas as quickly as possible. I would like to ask the Postmaster-General about the standard of television services in the remote areas. As he well knows, many of the existing stations are not satisfactory. There are still bugs in them. I hope that some consideration will be given to ironing out these bugs. </para>
          <para>The Postmaster-General will recall that on several occasions 1 have written to him about the Proserpine area. There seems to be some technical problem in that area which is causing very poor reception. 1 think that the Australian Broadcasting Control Board carried out a survey there approximately 12 months ago to try to iron out the technicalities that were causing the rather poor reception, particularly in places like Shute Harbour, Airlie Beach, Bloomsbury and Proserpine. The question is one not only of continuous construction to provide these facilities for people in the remoter areas of Australia but also of improving the existing facilities. I hope that consideration is given in the works programme to some , of these missing links and particularly lo the area, between Clermont and Charters Towers, in Area 3 of the Brigalow and in the Belyando-Suttor area. 1 hope that the programme will really concentrate on the new area of Go on yell a and on the problems with the existing television stations. </para>

            <para>- I want lo make some comments on the statement made by the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Alan Hulme).</inline> I was one of those who pressed him very strongly into endeavouring to provide television for the western areas at the earliest possible moment. The honourable member for Dawson <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr Patterson)</inline> said that he had made representations to the Postmaster-General in this connection. If everyone had made representations to him on these matters as often as I have, his life would have been a pretty hard one. The honourable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Katter)</inline> and I really did press to get some statement from the Minister on this matter. 1 draw attention to the fact that he could have made these investigations and not made the statement that the stations&#39; were to be provided until the investigation were more advanced. He would have been under less criticism for the delay that has apparently occurred as a result of his having made early the announcement that these 38 low-power stations at relatively remote centres will be provided. I give the Minister credit for having given us this information as early as it was possible for him to do so, under the pressure that was put on him for the statement to be made. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I for one will give him credit for that. I have heard very little credit given to the Government for the fact that these 38 stations are to be provided. As the Minister said, this virtually doubles the number of stations in the national network, bringing the total to 82. It is a very big step forward. I appreciate very much, and I am sure that those people who have been advocating this have appreciated the fact that these stations are to be provided in those areas where television is very sorely needed, and where this benefit will be of much more importance than it is in areas which are provided with a number of channels and which have alternative means of entertainment and education. I will continue to ask the Postmaster-General to expedite this programme. I was pleased to note that in the last paragraph of his statement he said that he has, in addition to the programme mentioned there, asked the Department to remain alert to take advantage of any possibilities which may arise that could lead to earlier completion dates. </para>
          <para>One of the reasons why this is important and why we appreciate it is that there are still some areas which have not been provided for or which are not in the programme and which deserve to have television. Let rae mention Quilpie, a town of some size in my area, which is so far west that it is not able to be included in this programme. No doubt television for that area will be provided only when this programme is completed. The statement of the Postmaster-General gives an indication of his anxiety and that of the Government to expedite the provision of the stations that are to be provided under this programme. Already, as he stated, there are five which have come into operation. He gave the reasons for this. </para>
          <para>The need for television is very great. I have mentioned the different way of life of people living in remote areas and people living in the metropolitan areas, in regard to the amenities that are available and particularly education. Television helps to bridge this gap. The Government is to be very warmly commended. I appreciate the fact that the Postmaster-General has taken this step to promote this programme and to do all in his power and that of the Government to bring it to a conclusion and to provide these stations. In my area there has been agitation for a high-power station at Roma. Quite a number of representations have been made to the Minister along these lines. But the argument has been the cost related to the number of people that would be served. These 38 low-power stations are to be provided at a cost of some S5m. The cost per person has been pointed out by the Postmaster-General to be relatively high in comparison with the cost of providing television in the more closely settled areas and in the provincial and capital cities of the Commonwealth. At the same time I believe that there is a responsibility which the Government and the Postmaster-General have accepted, to carry that cost and to bring television to all towns of reasonable size right throughout this country. This is a very big step forward. </para>
          <para>The thing that was worrying us was the amount of delay that could occur. I think it can be understood that because of the difficulty of surveying and the amount of time that was taken a delay would have been possible, and that with the manpower problems that have been met with it would be quite understandable that a programme could get a bit behind. Those of us concerned with this matter have been striving very hard to get a programme completion date. Once again 1 express my appreciation for the fact that a target completion date has now been provided, and we will look forward to seeing that that target completion date is met if possible. The honourable member for Kalgoorlie suggested that he had some doubts about whether this would be met. I think all the Postmaster-General can do in this direction is set a programme and endeavour to do the best he can to expedite it. It is true that the honourable member for Dawson and I mentioned places that do not have television reception, but we know that the percentage of people who are being served by television Commonwealth-wide is very high. </para>
          <para>I welcome the statement by the Postmaster-General. I am sure it will be welcomed by all those people who will benefit, and I hope that we will see a further pro gramme on the completion of this one to provide those services which are not included in this programme. I congratulate the Postmaster-General and the Government on the steps that they have made, and I trust that the programme completion date se! out by the Postmaster-General now will be achieved. </para>

            <para>-  I do not wish to keep the House for very long, but as the 2 stations that are proposed to be erected in South Australia are both in my electorate there are a few words 1 would like to say. Unfortunately, when the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Alan Hulme)</inline> made a statement about the Ceduna area in 1969 the statement was in some way distorted and the people in the area were informed by the local Press that they were getting a powerful station which was to serve a pretty wide radius. Of course this was not the effect of the statement at all. A lot of people bought television sets because they expected that in the near future they would have a strong television station. Of course that was not so. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Since that statement 1 have asked the Postmaster-General on a number of occasions when we can expect the station to come into operation. It is good to know that at least a completion date has been set which the people in this area can be told. When it was discovered that the announcement by the Postmaster-General, to the effect that there was to be a large station in this area, was not correct, there was extreme disappointment. It is still a very hot question in this area and it is one on which I receive numerous letters. Everytime I visited the area I am approached by various people to see what can be done about it. A reply I received about providing a larger station in this area to cover a wider radius indicated that there were no suitable topographical features from which a high power station could operate. People at places such as Ell est on, Streaky Bay and towns on the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia will still be without television. If this programme finishes in 1974 it will probably be 1976 or 1977 before those people can hope to get television in this area. Although it has been stated that the stations at Ceduna and Woomera will be in operation in October 1973, some further thinking and planning should be done on the pretty vast areas on the Eyre Peninsula of South Australia which still do not receive any television reception. 1 hope that this plan can be brought to fruition within the next few years. </para>

We are agreed it will be appropriate that 1 use the reserve powers of the Customs Tariff and make such work books a substitute for ordinary text books and thus free of import duty.

            <para>- by leave - I would like to draw honourable members&#39; attention to the report tabled recently by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works dealing with the proposed construction of the central zone sewerage scheme at Darwin, Northern Territory. Honourable members will recall that the proposal was examined and endorsed by the Committee in mid 1969. Subsequently there was particularly strong public criticism qf the scheme and I felt it would be helpful for the people concerned to be given a further opportunity of putting forward their views and being questioned by members of this Parliament. The Parliament decided on 25th August, 1971 to refer the proposal back to the Committee for further investigation and report. After extensive inquiries involving the taking of lengthy submissions and evidence from government officers and private organisation and individuals, the Committee has concluded that it is not expedient to proceed with the proposal as submitted and has recommended to Parliament accordingly, with the further recommendation that the Government should reconsider the means of heating and disposing of sewage from the central zone. Several possible alternatives were suggested as warranting consideration. In accordance with the Committee&#39;s recommendation that alternative schemes be looked at the Department of Works is now proceeding with further investigation. When these are completed the Government will again refer the matter io the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works for investigation and report. Present indications are that this will be proposed during the 1972 autumn session of Parliament. </para>

            <para>- by leaveThis project has been one which 1 suppose can best be described as a most unfortunate one. It has a relatively long history. As the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt)</inline> has stated, after the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works had made the decision to accept the proposal put forward to it originally there was in effect some strong criticism by people living in Darwin. They had every justification for making that criticism because not enough attention was given to the actual treatment and disposal of the effluent. Subsequently, as we know, as the Minister said, the matter was referred to in the Parliament, it was sent back to the Committee and the Committee after lengthy evidence rejected the proposal. It is obvious that something has to be done. It is essential to provide a plant which will satisfactorily treat and dispose of the sewage from the central zone. This is of the utmost importance particularly in a Federal Territory where it is essential thai every detail in relation to pollution control and with respect to sewage is given priority. I am pleased to say that the Opposition supports the decision of the Government to give this project the priority which it deserves to enable the construction of a first class treatment and disposal plant. </para>

            <para>- by leave - 1 also support the proposal to refer this proposed scheme to the Department of Works so that it can produce a new plan. As one who originally had been concerned to a considerable degree in having this matter referred to the Department I feel I should say something on this subject. It was the <inline font-style="italic">opinion</inline> of the Darwin Port Authority, the opinion of some 30-odd doctors as well as the towns people which convinced me that the Government should have another look at this project. In regard to future schemes of this sort, I would urge the planners to look very carefully into the possible effects of effluent being discharged into tropical waters because we really do not know very much about this. I think that this is something which should be very carefully studied. It is suggested the outflow from this sewage plant will go into the Leander Swamp area situated on the north side of Darwin. This area at present is an open swamp but later it may well become a residential area. So I warn the Government against taking what could be an easy way out of this problem; it may find itself in quite a lot of trouble later on. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The only other matter I would urge the Government to look at is the venting system which may be put in. In tropical areas we get very heavy pollution out of these vents which I think were included in one of the original proposals for this project. They are the points I wanted to refer to the Government. </para>

          <para>- Honourable members will be aware that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Alan</inline> Turner, the  Clerk  of the House, will retire today and that this is the last sitting of the House at which he will be officiating at the table. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner&#39;s</inline> retirement will bring to a close a notable and lengthy career associated with the working of the Commonwealth Parliament and particularly with this House. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> joined the staff of the House as a young man in Melbourne in 1924 and early in his career was Speaker&#39;s Secretary, having served Speakers Watt, Groom and Makin in that capacity. Apart from a period of secondment to the Department of Supply and Shipping between 1942 and 1945 during the War years. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> has served the House continuously over a period of 47 years. He has been a Chamber officer since 1946, having been Serjeant-at-Arms and  Clerk  of Committees from 1946 to 1949, Second  Clerk  Assistant from 1949 to 1955,  Clerk  Assistant from 1955 to 1958, and  Clerk  of the House from 1st January 1959.  His  Clerkship has been a notable one. Features of it were the major revision of the Standing Orders of the House which was undertaken between 1960 and 1963 and the re-organization of the staff of the House of Representatives to meet the greatly expanded and developing requirements of the House. He was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire by  Her  Majesty the Queen in 1965. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>As  Clerk  of the House, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> has on 3 occasions accompanied Speakers of the House lo conferences of Presiding Officers and Clerks of the Parliaments of the Commonwealth of Nations, and has also accompanied me to, and participated in, each of the 4 conferences of Presiding Officers and Clerks of the Australasian/ Pacific Area. Honourable members would wish me to refer to the extra-parliamentary services which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> has rendered to this Parliament. In 1958 he was the Secretary of the Australian delegation which attended the Inter-Parliamentary Union conference held in Rio de Janeiro. From 1958 to 1971 he has been the Honorary Secretary/Treasurer of the Commonwealth of Australia Branch of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and in that capacity has served the Branch with great dedication and has achieved much in furthering Australia&#39;s interests and reputation in the affairs of that Association. As Secretary of the Commonwealth Branch delegation he has attended many Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conferences. As Branch Secretary he played a major role in the organisation of the highly successful conferences which were held in Australia in 1959 and 1970. Also as Secretary of the Commonwealth Branch delegation he has attended Australian Area Conferences of the Association which are held every second year. </para>
        <para>No tribute to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner&#39;s</inline> services would be complete without reference to the wonderful support he has received from his wife, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Turner. Mrs Turner,</inline> herself the daughter of a former member of this House, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr G.</inline> A. Maxwell, K.C., has on many occasions over the years spared no effort in graciously receiving and entertaining visiting parliamentarians and Clerks and their wives and for so doing deserves our very warm and grateful appreciation. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> has served this House and this Parliament with great distinction. A great many members over a very lengthy period will recall with gratitude his courteous help and assistance, not only as  Clerk  of the House, but also as honorary secretary of the Commonwealth Branch of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. May I as  Speaker  say that I have greatly appreciated working with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner,</inline> that I have always respected his wise judgment and experienced counsel, and I thank him very sincerely for the ready assistance and support which he has always given me and all members of this House. In saying our official farewell to Alan Turner after a lifetime of service to this House, I assure him that he leaves with our sincere respect and gratitude and we wish him and <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Turner</inline> health and happiness for the future. </para>

We have great personal regard for him, for his integrity and for the fact that he is a person that is so easily liked and continuously courteous. He is always willing to give us assistance no matter what time of the day or night we approach him and he always gives us the right sort of information and keeps us on the right track. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline>as you have so well said, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> has bad a long and distinguished association with this Parliament. Incredible though it may seem, his parliamentary experience extends over 47 years. During that time he has served the House as you have so well said, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> in many capacities and has been involved in many, many areas of its operations. When there. fore he attained his present position some 12 years ago, he brought as we all know a wealth of experience which has proved invaluable in the exercise of his duties and enabled him to exert a considerable degree of influence on the workings of the House. </para>
        <para>The role of the  Clerk  of the House has always been a key one in our parliamentary system of government because upon it devolves responsibilities for the procedures that enable Parliament as an institution to function efficiently and smoothly. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> has upheld the finest traditions of his office.  His  wise and friendly counsel has been availed of by both sides - Government and Opposition alike. He has also made an outstanding contribution in the sphere of interparliamentary relationships. For many years now <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> has taken a keen interest in the activities of the Interparliamentary Union and the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and has represented this Parliament at many conferences of these bodies. I therefore want to place on record our appreciation of his services and wish him many years of his well-deserved retirement. </para>
        <para>May &#91; join with you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> in saying that we are sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> is for the time being leaving the precincts of the House and that his wife also will not be with us on so many occasions in future as she has in the past when we have been delighted to talk to her and to share the companionship of both of them. We wish them both many, many years of happy retirement and we certainly wish that they will come back frequently and see us again. </para>

          <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> as the Presiding Officer of the House you have admirably expressed the views which every honourable member feels for the retiring  Clerk.  You have acknowledged the services that he has rendered to Parliament as a world institution. In several countries the view has been volunteered, to me by members and officers of the Parliament there that they know, respect and like our <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner.</inline> In this Parliament we are greatly in his debt - all of us are. He is a most competent and thoroughly professional servant of the institution. He has ever been a student of politics but never a practitioner of politics. He knows the history of the institution, the practice of the institution and the worth of the institution as few people can. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>For 13 years <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> has served the House as its  Clerk.  There are scarcely SO members of the House today who were members of it when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> became  Clerk.  For 11 years, during which I have been  Deputy  Leader or Leader of the Opposition, I would have visited <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> in his room at least once a week. I have never failed to come away from those calls better informed; I have often come away wiser. On every occasion I have felt appreciation for the expert, appropriate advice he has given. In an intensely political institution he is a man who earns and receives the respect, the confidence and the trust of every honourable member. My colleagues and I are particularly in his debt, not because he favours us politically - I do not know what his political beliefs are - but because we have to depend on officers of the House so much more. I hope the House will pardon me a little sentiment. I first became aware of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> possibly before any member of the House. I came to live in Canberra at the beginning of 1928 and at that time he had already been here for almost a year. Whilst I was in the secondary classes at Telopea Park School a new female kindergarten teacher came to the school - a very vision of delight, all we secondary students felt. </para>

On behalf of the Australian Country Party I should like to pay our tribute for his long and distinguished career in this Parliament and congratulate him for the respect that he has earned for himself and the very high standard that he has set for any future  Clerk  of this Parliament. He is a most unobtrusive man. He is probably heard over the air regularly as being the only person who speaks without emotion, either reading petitions or announcing the introduction of Bills. But he is a tremendously important person here. In fact, it is the  Clerk  and those who serve underneath him who provide continuity for the most important institution in this country. We thank <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> for the really outstanding and excellent job he has done. </para>

I am glad, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> that you also made reference to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Turner.</inline> Most of us know her well. Both <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Turner</inline> are extremely friendly, pleasant and happy people.

Probably we should have gone more often. However, being one of the  deputy  chairmen, I appreciate the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> has always exhibited complete non-partisanship in his position. When one is in the Chair, of course it is an onerous job. We have to keep our eyes on fellows like Winton Turnbull and others in the House to see that they do not play up. However, I can assure you <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> that on all occasions, irrespective of who breaks a standing order, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> has always advised the occupant of the Chair of the standing order, whether he be a Government member or a member of the Opposition. </para>

There would not be a member of this chamber who is not indebted to him and I am sure that I speak for all present when I say &#39;Thank you very much indeed for your work. You have contributed great service to the Parliament and added much to the history of this country&#39;. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner&#39;s</inline> career has indeed been a magnificent one, reaching back to his appointment as an officer of the House of Representatives 47 years ago and, finally, recognised by  Her  Majesty the Queen. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> retires tomorrow. He leaves a service that he has worked for since he was 18 except for 4 years during the war. He can look back on a great career ranging through various offices in the House. He can also look back on his work in revising the Standing Orders, in the Inter-Parliamentary Union conferences, Commonwealth Parliamentary Association meetings and conferences of presiding officers and clerks. It has been a magnificent career forged in the only place where the essential specialised knowledge can be gained - that is, the Parliament itself. Add to this a personal good humour and an innate friendliness and we have Alan Turner the professional and Alan Turner the man. I can assure <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> that each and every honourable member of this House has the greatest admiration for him. We have a great appreciation of the 12 years valuable service he has rendered to this Parliament and we express the hope that he and <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Turner</inline> will be long spared to enjoy the happiness that their retirement will bring. </para>

          <para>- As one who came into the Parliament at the same time as the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon),</inline> and the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Swartz)</inline> and as one who has enjoyed the help which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> has given me from time to time, I should like to say something about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner.</inline> One thing about him that 1 think should be placed on record is that at no time would any member of the Parliament from either side have cause to feel that a conversation in confidence with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> as to tactics - since 1 have been here my tactics have been devoted entirely towards defeating the Government - would ever reach the ears of the other side. This was proved on many occasions by the fact that the Prime Minister was so often taken by surprise when clever moves by myself and my colleagues were implemented as a consequence not of partisan advice but of straight advice from the  Clerk  as to what the law was and what the Standing Orders provided. 1 will never forget the look of amazement on the face of the present Prime Minister once when I moved a motion that was designed to throw him off guard. He has not really recovered from it. I do not think the Prime Minister should blame <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> for this because I was the one who originated the idea. He simply low me how to do it. In any event, there is nothing much that the Prime Minister can do about the matter now. </para>

        <para>I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> will feel free to visit the House and to be in the precincts of the House as often as he likes - not to come occasionally or in the distant future, as somebody suggested we might be fortunate enough to see him. I hope that his good lady will come here quite often and not fec i that she has to wait to be asked to visit us as was suggested, not by intent, by some <inline font-weight="bold">speaker. Mr Turner</inline> looks very young because he only has to count votes and does not have to win them. I congratulate him for succeeding in getting in on the salary rises before the rises start to go down.  His  timing was excellent. 1 cannot think of a better way of doing it . than the way he has done it. I am sure that he will be the envy of many First Division officers in the future. Of course, as an honourable member interjects, he will be the envy of many back benchers. </para>
        <para>I am pleased that we have following <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> our good friend <inline font-weight="bold">Mr</inline> Parkes.

        <para class="block">Cope has reached but he, of course, being a  Deputy Chairman  of Committees has an advantage over we lesser mortals. But I am pleased that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> is being succeeded by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Parkes</inline> because I will feel free to go to him with clever little plans to deal with the Government, just as 1 felt free to go to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner.</inline> I know that next year when the Opposition tries to put clever little plans over the Government we on the Government side will not have been given the slightest inkling of the plans that are afoot. But that will not worry us because most of us have been brought up in the hard school of union politics, and plans which appear to be clever to the present Government will not appear to be clever to the future Government. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> will have a happy retirement. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> hope that he will come along here often and that he will be as free with his advice in the future as he has been in the past because I will be ready to accept it. </para>

          <para>-!. should like to be associated with the remarks that have been made this evening by the various speakers before me, and should also like to associate with my remarks my  Deputy  Chairmen. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> I am delighted, as I am sure you are, to be forewarned by the honourable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Clyde Cameron)</inline> of his plans for next year. We will really appreciate that innocent look that he sometimes has on his face when we, with the advice of the  Clerk,  give certain rulings and he looks as though it is not possible that we could give such rulings against him. I should like to say how greatly indebted 1 am for the advice, assistance and friendship that have been given to me and to all members by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner.</inline> In the period that it has been my privilege to be a  Deputy Chairman  and now  Chairman  of Committees and  Deputy Speaker  I have always found that the advice given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> has been in the best interest of this House of Parliament. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Mention has been made of the contribution that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> has made both to this House and to the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. I think we can say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> has made his mark on this Parliament and in world affairs. He is known and appreciated at conferences of parliamentarians everywhere, and his contribution in that regard has been to the honour and uplifting of this institution of ours and to our parliamentary way of life. I do not want to repeat many of the things that have been said by other speakers regarding <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner&#39;s</inline> capacity and ability. All I can say is that I hearty endorse those remarks. I believe that the remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> about the early days and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner&#39;s</inline> capacity and ability indicate why <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> was able to face with equanimity some of the things which he had to face in this House, particularly in the early hours of the morning. 1 think that one thing should be mentioned which reveals the character, the sense of tradition and the ability of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> perhaps above all else, and that is the respect and affection in which he is held by the members of his staff. This is so because of his honesty of purpose and the contribution he has made by the work he has performed. It became no longer work but a service to the Parliament and to the community. We appreciate also that it has been said, and said truly, that no man can make a contribution that is accepted and remarked upon by all unless he has been supported by a wife who gives him support in every sphere and in every way. Those of us who have had an association with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> in both this Parliament and the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association know the assistance and the value of the assistance given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Turner.</inline> As we pay a tribute to him we also pay tribute to her. I join with all those who have wished them both well in their retirement. I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> thinks of us kindly. If ever he is awake at 2 or 3 o&#39;clock in the morning he will think with joy that he is in peace and quiet while we are trying to legislate the business of the country. </para>
        <para>May I briefly add my congratulations and best wishes to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Parkes</inline> as he comes in and takes over the duties that have been performed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner.</inline> We know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Parkes</inline> wil follow the tradition, the example and the standard set by the one whom we honour and respect this evening. </para>

          <para>Very briefly though nonetheless sincerely I desire to associate myself with the sentiments which have been so nicely expressed about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> and his good wife tonight. When one remembers that he has given almost 50 years of service to the Parliament, that in itself is a remarkable record. In that time he has built up a personal record of friendship with those who have been associated with him. He has lived in some very notable periods in the history of this country. He has seen some good days and some bad days. He has seen in every way in this Parliament the progress of the nation. That he has rendered service in such a way as to bring forth the tributes which have been paid to him tonight shows that he has a commendable record in the public life of this country. 1 think that there is always something sad or sentimental at a time when a man&#39;s career is ending, and this must be a somewhat sad moment for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner.</inline> We have our parting with him, but tonight he walks out of this place and away from surroundings which no doubt are known to him like his home. He commences a new life after almost i alf a century of work in this place. I think that the greatest things he will remember from his service in this Parliament - I hope he does - are the tributes paid to him tonight for the record of service which he has given, a record which is appreciated by those of us who are here now and by many who possibly are no longer wilh us. The voices of the various leaders in this Parliament and of various members were raised tonight, and I hope that down through the happy years ahead they will ring out and bring back to him constant and happy memories of our association with him and his good wife. 1 wish <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> very good luck and good health in his retirement. 1 hope that occasionally if he does not listen to other members he will tune in to me now and again. If I really know that he is listening I will disobey the Standing Orders and possibly give him a cheerio call. Might I say also that after 50 years in the service of anyone I should like to look as young as he does and have as much hair on my head as I see on his tonight. I wish him and his good wife <inline font-style="italic">very</inline> good luck and a very merry Christmas. We know he will have it but, as he knows, some of us will not. </para>

          <para>- I too would like briefly to convey my very warm and sincere best wishes to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr and Mrs Turner</inline> on this occasion. 1 owe a debt of gratitude to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> for many courtesies and for the many occasions on which he has been helpful to me, but most of all, for his discretion and confidence. As other honourable members have observed, he has given long and loyal service and, more particularly, he has left his mark here because as  Clerk  of the House he has given a particular style of service. It is difficult to define,, to explain or discuss. But, nevertheless, it is obvious to all of us who have watched him- in the Chair. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I have been a member of this Parliament for 10 years now, and the time seems to go very fast. 1 note that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> has been here for nearly  half a century. But 1 recollect that in the first week I was here I was invited round to his office with quite a number of new members to share a convivial drink. In those days 1 was rather insufferable with my political prejudices and probably I was becoming somewhat intolerable to him in explaining and trying to impress upon him how heaven resided on this side of the chamber alone and how all biases, unfairness and so on existed on the other side of the chamber, especially on the part of a certain burly member named Menzies who was around here in those days. Rather discreetly - and I have always appreciated this because it helped to give me some balance - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> retold to me a story about Ben Chifley who, of course, is quite revered in my Party. He told me of an occasion when Ben Chifley was having difficulty at a Premiers Conference. The 6 Premiers were disagreeing strongly with him. Ben Chifley said: &#39;All right. We will put it to the vote&#39;. After the vote had been counted, Ben Chifley said: &#39;Six ayes and one no - the noes have it&#39;. That was a small lesson to me. </para>
        <para>T often sit in this House and wonder what goes through the mind of the  Clerk  of the House. This thought has occurred to other people. That member of whom 1 spoke earlier, who has now quite an illustrious position of Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports, once wrote this poem about the role of the  Clerk  of the House: </para>

        <para class="block">It all sounds very dreadful and makes these people look as though they are men of extreme dedication in the face of what must be great trials and tribulations and not a little bit of distress. Frank Green, as  Clerk  of the House, put the position nicely in perspective when he wrote in retort: </para>

For  if  some thoughts we dark repeat, We&#39;d find ourselves out in the street.  1 think that that is an eminently practical expression of feeling.

          <para>- As a member of the lower deck, I wish to say a few words of appreciation and thanks to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> on my own behalf and, I am certain, on behalf of those new members of the Parliament who came here in October 1969. The aspect that impressed me when I came into the Parliament was its extreme efficiency. It is a saying - and I think a true saying - that it is the captain who runs the ship, lt is true to say also that any ship will founder when going through troubled waters unless it has good and skilled captain. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>In my experience in the Parliament since 1 have been here - it is only a short time - I have noticed that the parliamentary institution itself has had a few holes put in it but that they seemed to have been plugged effectively, no doubt because of the skill of the captain. By captain&#39; I refer to the <inline font-weight="bold">Clerk, Mr Alan</inline> Turner. On behalf of the newer members of the Parliament,I express appreciation to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> for the courtesies that he extended to us when we arrived here as raw recruits. He organised training classes for us. He organised classes of instruction on how the Parliament operates. I can truly say that, without that training and without that assistance, we could not possibly have done the job for which we were elected. On behalf of the newer members of the Parliament,I say thank you. </para>
        <para>I think that I can also say thank you on behalf of the often unsung section of the parliamentary staff, that is, the attendants and the other lower ranked members of the staff of this Parliament. I had fairly close association with these people when I discussedwith <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> some problems relating to the wages and conditions of House attendants. I received very good advice from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> in this regard, and I appreciate it. As a result of that advice, certain action was taken. The attendants of this House and the lower paid section of the staff of this House did receive justified salary increases. On their behalf, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner,</inline> I say thank you. </para>
        <para>I also express appreciation for a few well chosen words of advice that I received from <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Turner</inline> very early in the piece, during a function when  Her  Majesty the Queen was here. <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Turner</inline> told me that if I followed her husband&#39;s advice I would not go very far wrong. I think that we would all doubt whether anybody in the House could go wrong if he followed <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner&#39;s</inline> advice. I wish you a very well earned retirement and a happy and holy Christmas for yourself, your wife and family. I wish you a prosperous New Year. </para>

Those salaries have been rejected overwhelmingly and decisively. Unless these amendments are adopted, certain statutory officers will not receive even the salaries that they were receiving previously. They will receive no salary at all. For that reason, we accept and agree with the motion moved by the Leader of the House. </para>

          <para>- There are a couple of matters that I wish to raise on this Bill. Firstly, the &#39;Canberra News&#39; this afternoon states:   . . Labor Caucus decided to try to cancel increases recently granted to Second Division officers of the Commonwealth Public Service, but is still considering how to go about this unprecedented move. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para class="block">I can only presume that the author of this report has misunderstood what the Labor caucus did decide on this matter last Wednesday evening. The Opposition decided to reconsider its attitude to this Bill in the light of the comments which the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> made about salary and wage restraint. It decided that it would now oppose the increases in this Bill when it was considered in the Senate. As we know, the Senate has accepted the Opposition&#39;s attitude. At no time did the Opposition consider the position of second division officers of the Commonwealth Public Service; in any case, increases in their salaries do not come before the Parliament by way of legislation. There was no reference made to their situation at all by caucus. The only reference made was to the holders of statutory offices. </para>
        <para>The remaining matter I want to state is this: Of all the Bills dealing with salaries of the highest paid persons in Commonwealth employment, this is the only one which has proceeded. Since there have been remarks outside the House as to the attitude that the House should take on such matters, I recall - and it is appropriate that I should because the author of the recommendations, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frank</inline> Richardson, was in the Speaker&#39;s Gallery earlier - that there was an occasion in 1959 when a committee made recommendations concerning&#39; increases in salaries, allowances and pensions for everybody in the Parliament and also for persons who hold better remunerated positions in the Parliament. On that occasion the Government abandoned some of the recommendations with regard to the better remunerated persons in the Parliament. It has not been the unvarying practice to take recommendations as a whole and accept them as a whole. In the only conversation I have had on this matter with the Prime Minister I pointed out this precedent. Relying on his memory-- </para>

            <para>- Everybody in the House saw us go behind the Speaker&#39;s chair with the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Swartz)</inline> so everybody here has, from his own observation, an instance of the Prime Minister&#39;s accuracy or his phenomenal memory. I quoted this precedent and the right honourable gentleman, relying on his memory, doubted it. I checked and my memory was accurate. I merely point this out. There have been previous reports where the more highly remunerated people have not got the amounts recommended. We are not going to discuss any of the other Bills; it might be out of order. But the altitude of my Party is, I should tell the Parliament, that the amounts accepted by the Government in respect of all members of Parliament we thought were proper. Those which were accepted by the Government for the more highly remunerated persons in the Parliament were regarded as inappropriate. I take it that that is why the Salaries Bill for first division people has been abandoned and why, of course, the Senate accepted the attitude of the Opposition in respect of the holders of statutory offices. The Opposition thought it singularly inappropriate that on Tuesday night we should all be abjured to show restraint and that before dinner the following night there should be very large increases proposed for the persons who are most highly remunerated by the Commonwealth. </para>

          <para>- We on this side of the House feel that it is regrettable that in another place some of the salaries of statutory offices should be reduced. They were legitimately granted in accordance with proper work value appreciations. However, we feel that the Bill should go through because unless it becomes law the officers will not be entitled to the salaries that are presently payable to them. The Australian Labor Party must, of course, take responsibility for the failure to permit these people to obtain the money to which they are justly entitled. I now refer to what has been said by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam).</inline> What he has said about speaking to me behind the Speaker&#39;s chair is totally untrue, and this can be verified by my colleague, the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Swartz).</inline> It so happened that I spoke to him immediately before question time and not in the evening. I never feel it is appropriate to refer to what has happened behind the Speaker&#39;s chair- </para>

          <para>- 1 want to say something about the remarks made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> w&#39;.-.en he sought to defend the extraordinarily high salaries that had been set for certain statutory officers at a time when the Government was calling upon the ordinary wage plug in the community for restraint. Here we have a government which is telling the man getting $50, $60 or $70 a week that he has to be content to accept that wage and no more and telling the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Commission that it cannot increase the minimum national wage of $47 a week because the country cannot afford it, while at the same time he is recommending increases in salaries amounting to several thousand dollars a year. This is just the kind of thing that this county is complaining about. The Government has no right to stand up in this place and fix salaries as high as $29,000 a year for certain statutory officers and certain other people employed by the Commonwealth who are indicated in this Bill, with increases ranging as high as $6,000 a year or $120 a week, and then have the check to tell the Arbitral on Commission that the ordinary family man has to try to maintain a wife and family on a miserable $47 a week. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Why, the average weekly earnings in Australia over the last quarter were only $89 a week. That is an average arrived at by lumping together the salary thai lnc Prime Minister himself gets, about 88UU a week, plus the salaries of the people he is now proposing to increase to $29,000 a year with the salaries of the poor de.. ls who have to try to maintain a family on $50 or $60 a week. It is a disgrace. I he Government has no right to come into misplace and talk about restraint on the part of the poor devil getting $50 or St.O a week with a family to maintain, educate, feed and clothe while in the same breath it has the hide to come into this place and ask us to approve of salaries as high as $29,000 a year for other people. These people who are already getting $22,000 a year are well able to meet the Government&#39;s demand for restraint. They are hatter able to respond to the Government&#39;s call for restraint than are the poor devi&#39;s on $50 or $60 a week. It is the height of hypocrisy for the Prime Minister to sit there and grin - </para>

No wonder the 3 million people who arc getting less than the average weekly wage are feed up with this Government. No wonder we have reached the stage where people arc beginning to question the Government&#39;s sincerity when in one breath it asks the man on $50 or $60 a week to exercise restraint and then gives other people $29,000 a year.

          <para>- The attitude of the Opposition to this particular Bill is quite extraordinary. This Bill was introduced to give increases of salary to those statutory officers who are equated with the Second Division of the Commonwealth Public Service. A month or so ago the Commonwealth Public Service Arbitrator considered the matter and granted a 15 per cent wage increase to Second Division officers, all of whom are members of unions. At the time that increase was granted the spokesman for the Opposition on industrial matters the honourable member for Hindmarsh <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Clyde Cameron)</inline> who has just finished his contribution, welcomed that decision by the Arbitrator. That decision was then applied by the Government by way of regulation, which is the normal way in which it is done, because the Government accepted the Arbitrator&#39;s decision on the matter. As a consequence the increased wage flowed to Second Division officers. The Government decided that it was incumbent upon it, out of justice to these statutory officers who are equated with Second Division officers, to give them the same increases. The Bill passed this House. lt went to the Senate, and in the Senate there was a discrimination against members of the wage earning sector of the community who are equated with the Second Division and who historically have received the same increase as was awarded by the Arbitrator to the Second Division. Tonight, by . an extraordinary course of events, the Opposition in the Senate decided to reject something which it has consistently supported in the past. It is open to any observer to conclude why that was done. There could be only 2 alternatives. One alternative is that Opposition members acted out of pique because they tried to play politics on a matter of parliamentary salaries which has historically been approached in a bipartisan attitude. In playing politics they found that the Government was not prepared to subordinate this matter to party politics. It had to be above that. And that has been the Government&#39;s action in relation to this matter. It could only be one of two choices. The Government has been saying that the present problems of economic management in the country today are inflationary pressures which arise out of wage-push pressures mainly - not wholly I have never said wholly, but I have said mainly. That is the principal cause of it. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The Opposition, up to this day, in deference to its relationship with the unions which have been relentlessly pushing wage claims, has been unwilling to acknowledge the fact that the inflationary pressures&#39; flow from these ruthlessly, relentlessly pushed wage claims. Tonight we have heard the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam),</inline> supported by the Opposition&#39;s spokesman on industrial matters, the honourable member for Hindmarsh acknowledged for the first time the reality of the Government&#39;s constantly asserted claim that the economic management problem today of inflationary pressures is the wage-push pressure. The Opposition has adopted the truth of that assertion. 1 welcome that. If the Opposition wishes to choose restraint I congratulate it for doing so and 1 can assure honourable members of the Opposition that if it comes to a competition in restraint the Government will be more successful and will have more to offer than they have. </para>
        <para>The honourable member for Hindmarsh, in a characteristic distortion of arguments speaks of the poor devils, as he described them, on S50 to $60 a week. There can be no doubt that a person receiving an income of&#39; $50 or $60 a week is in a much less advantageous position than a person who is, for instance, a member of Parliament. </para>

            <para>- Or on $29,000 like myself. One does not need to be a Rhodes scholar to know the difference between $50 or $60 a week and $9,500 and $29,000 a year. What the Government needs is to have compassion for the man on the small income and do what it can as a government to adopt policies which will benefit him. The Government is adopting policies to benefit him, because the person who is the most defenceless against inflation is the very poor devil of whom the honourable member talks. What can he do to defend himself when inflation is forced by relentlessly pursued wage claims by those who possess power? Those who possess power are the ones who are able to protect themselves against inflation. The people who cannot do so are the poor devils on $50 to $60 a week, more especially if their $50 or $60 a week comes from a fixed income. So the Government will pursue its policy of economic management directed towards arresting the inflationary pressures. The Government will continue to assert as strongly as it can, and give what leadership it can, in exercising restraint in this field. For by so doing it will be serving the interests of the people of Australia. </para>

Le i me tell . the Treasurer, who has already served one term at least as Minister for Labour and National Service, that no law requires the Government to bring in a regulation !o give effect to a determination of the Public Service Arbitrator. He ought to read his books. At no time - never since this Parliament has been assembled - has it been necessary for a government to bring in a regulation to give effect to the Public Service Arbitrator&#39;s determination. A determination is issued by the Arbitrator in the form of a determination, and it becomes operative in that form. I repeat, no regulation is needed. </para>

          <para>- We have just listened to a remarkable speech from the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Snedden),</inline> the man who lectures on wage restraint and arbitration. J have here a report on the Parliamentary Salaries and Allowances Act. lt shows that the Treasurer receives $29,100 per annum. It was recommended to be increased, in the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Kerr, to $34,650, $5,550 extra. The Leader of the Opposition thought that the man who preaches wage restraint would have given up that $5,550 and struggled along on his $29,100. We thought he might have had a little compassion. But, no. He is one of the men who said: &#39;I want my extra $5,550. I cannot live on my $29,100.&#39; Next year he will be going into the national wage case to argue against the workers receiving any increase. What hypocrisy at the highest level. What contemptible conduct by the Treasurer of this country. </para>

            <para>- I withdraw the remark. The Treasurer speaks of wage restraint and of arbitration. Let us look at this Government&#39;s approach to arbitration and at the conduct of the Treasurer on the matter he raised a few moments ago in relation to the Opposition. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Kerr brought down a report. This arbitration was emasculated by a slight majority of a docile Cabinet, of which the Treasurer is one. Then, after not accepting the report of the Treasurer, without bringing anything to the notice of the Opposition whilst it was deliberating, not knowing any of the details, the Treasurer almost hammered down the door of the room of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> and said: Take it or leave it.&#39; He said: Tn 5 minutes time the Prime Minister is to introduce the Bill. Take it or leave it, or he will not introduce it.&#39; </para>

            <para>- I will just make passing reference to it. The Treasurer and the Deputy Prime Minister of this country threatened 3 members of the Opposition and said: &#39;Take it or leave it&#39; in relation to an arbitration report that they had emasculated and sought to ram down our necks. But look at them struggling along on their $29,000 and $30,000. They are the wage restraint party. They say that the worker on his $50 is disturbing the economy. But these great men, these mcn of high principle - the Treasurer who lectures us will lead the Government into the courts to argue against the national wage case for workers - these are the men who refuse to give up a few thousand dollars and live on their $30,000 and yet they clamour for people in this country to accept wage restraint. The very day that they refused people in this country wage increases, in another place they introduced  a  measure to give $6,000 and $7,000 per annum increase in salaries to people who are struggling along on $22,000 and $23,000. This is the situation we face today and this is the Government that seeks to lead this country. 1 have never seen in all my years in this Parliament such a docile and incompetent Prime Minister, a hand picked Ministry, yes men to the core, prepared to sacrifice completely all the interests of the people of this country. </para>

          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline>few will deny that this last year has been both turbulent and exciting. Few will deny that we have lived in times which have been changing constantly and which have been a challenge to the intelligence and ability of all members of the House. Few will deny that the members of this House have, in their own ways and according to their own fashions, made their contribution to parliamentary democracy. I think they all have to be credited with doing their best in the interests of this country and of the people of this country. We are indebted not only to the members of the House but also to the people inside and outside it who play an active part in the operations of the House for their patience, hard work and continued courtesy. First of all, I believe that our thanks should go to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> for the manner in which you have managed the affairs of the House. I believe it is true to say that you are respected, that you arc unfailingly courteous in your attitude to all members and that whenever we feel that it is necessary or desirable to come to you to seek your advice you are only too willing to give it. We always find that the advice you give us turns out to be right. Above all, I believe that every one of us can credit you with living up to the highest traditions of your office with both integrity and with dignity. Before I move oh to mention members of the House, may I mention how fortunate we are that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Norm</inline> Parkes will succeed the present  Clerk  of the House. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Parkes</inline> has had a lifetime of experience in the House and we hope that he will be a very worthy successor to the present  Clerk  and will serve just as long as he has and in just as pleasant &#60;t capacity. </para>
          <para>I now refer to the  Chairman  of Committees, a man well known and favourably regarded by all of us. He is always couteous, affable and, again, a person who is only too willing to give advice of the very best kind. If I can make one personal comment - I do not like making too many on an occasion such as this - on many of the occasions when I have felt that help was desirable, I found that instead of having to go to him, he was only too happy to come to me and I have been able to publish what he felt was not only in my interest but in the best interests of the Parliament as well. I say a word of appreciation loo for the assistance rendered by the Clerks Assistant and the officers of the House. I also want to refer to the large quantity of work that has been done. over the course of the last year. About 134 Bills have been passed by the House. Therefore, I think that a great degree of credit must be given for the very arduous work that has been done by the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Swartz)</inline> and the  Deputy  Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Chipp),</inline> and for the work that has been done by their opposite numbers on the other side of the House. I think that we can reflect with some degree of satisfaction on the improved working of the legislative programme. It will be remembered that not so long ago we had a great deal of difficulty because of the pileup of Bills at the end of the session. I then advised the House that the Government had appointed a legislative programming committee of the Cabinet, headed by my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr N. H. Bowen).</inline> It had the task not only of sensible programming but also of preventing a banking up of work at the end of the session, with the consequent rush and all of the difficulties that this creates. I think, therefore, that we should congratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs on the work that he has done and for the success that has been achieved, particularly in regard to the objectives of the Government. </para>
          <para>In my first year as the Prime Minister I should like to thank especially my ministerial and parliamentary colleagues for their support and co-operation. Also I should like to record my appreciation for the way in which the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam),</inline> the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Barnard)</inline> and their parliamentary colleagues have frequently discharged their obligations and helped to maintain an efficient and dignified working of the institution of Parliament.&#39; I pay a tribute also to the Whips who are here to keep us in order and who also have made their contribution towards the efficient functioning of Parliament. </para>
          <para>I now turn to those who are behind the scenes and to whom we are indebted. I refer to the Hansard writers, members of research services of the Parliamentary Library, the telephonists and the general office staffs as well as the attendants and amenities staff who put in such long hours when the House is sitting. 1 should also like to make special mention of members of the Press who in their own fashion contribute to the democratic processes of Parliament. We may not always agree with what they say or how they interpret our remarks, but I respect their right to do so. Finally, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, I</inline> wish you and all other members of the House, the staffs and those people who have given assistance in the running of the House, a very very happy Christmas and a succesful year. Above all, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, I</inline> say that honourable members on this side of the House who make up the Government will do all that we can to make certain that the Government is successful whenever an election might be held. </para>

I would like to comment first on the amount of business with which we have dealt this session. I have taken a quick look at the figures and I do not think that there has been a sessional period in which the Hansard record has had so many pages. The number of pages for this session is nearer 5,000 than 4,000. 1 just went out of the chamber to look at the Hansard records on my shelves and found that the number of pages (his session is about 1,000 more than the number for previous sessions. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir. -nay</inline> I acknowledge your services to the House. You have to bc here when we see! and you have to he here when we rise. </para>

I must concede that my colleagues and I try your patience at times, but I hope that you will not mind if I say that I believe your patience is tried on  a  bipartisan basis, lt is unfortunate that in your position the more you are tried on your right the more you have to take it out on your left. </para>

          <para>In this Parliament the  Speaker  is not immune from opposition in his electorate. You. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, have</inline> to tread a very difficult path. You have to try to keep your electorate and at the same time to preside over the House. I am not ready to assert that any member of the House would be willing to take your job who could do it better. There are many personal reasons why, whilst we disagree politically with vigour, we do respect each other as men. Your  deputy  has great experience. He has had to preside over, I think, probably an exceptionally great number of debates. There have been some occasions, as you know, when we have preferred his rulings even to yours. </para>
          <para>May  1  specify also what the House owes - I certainly feel that I owe a great deal - to the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Swartz)</inline> and to my  Deputy.  Each has to do all he can to see that the business of the House - the legitimate business raised on each side - is given a satisfactory debate and resolution. It is impossible to reconcile all the pressures in this way. I am certain that there are no 2 men in this place who could so well resolve those differences, and this applies to both. I have never had a closer association in any activity in my life than I have had with my  Deputy  and I know that he appreciates the way that the Leader of the House works with him. As I have said before, the Leader of the House has an extraordinary capacity to take the heat out of any situation. </para>

              <para>- Even on that point, we all, I suppose, mock his prolixity. There is, in fact, no Minister who does give more information than the Leader of the House in his capacity as Minister for National Development. I have never known him to give an inaccurate reply and there is always as least some information in his replies. At any rate, this is not the occasion to specify any other persons. </para>

          <para>However, from my side we extend in a personal sense to all those who sit on the other side the season&#39;s greetings. Members of Parliament, whatever else may be said about them, do, ex officio, see less of their families than anybody else and it is impossible really to carry on in this occupation unless one has a fairly tolerant wife. Their patience is sorely tried by our occupation. I think I know most of the wives of members of the Government parties and without exception they are of great assistance to their husbands. However we may find our opponents from time to time politically obnoxious, their wives are very gracious, nice women and that applies to the Prime Minister, to his Ministry and to those who sit behind him. </para>
          <para>A great number of people in this place work with us. I do not know the population of this building. It is many hundreds - several times as many as there are who sit in the 2 chambers. We must be extraordinarily difficult people to work with due to the times and the tempo at which we work and we really are very well served by the men and women who work in this building and who work beside the members of Parliament. To them, in particular, Christmas must be a very welcome respite. We wish them too, as well as our opponents, happiness at this time with their families and their relatives. </para>

            <para>- I would like to join with the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon)</inline> and the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> in making a few seasonal remarks. It has not been a dull year. There has been sufficient activity in the Parliament to allow our feature writers to fill more than a few columns with news. I am not sure which side of the House has provided the more arresting news, but this side has certainly provided quite a bit. One of the most unusual features of the year - it was an experience I had never had before nor had any present member of this Parliament - was the counting out of the Parliament. Nobody would think it was funny. In fact most of us feel a little ashamed that it happened. I hope we never see it again, but it was an unusual feature of the year. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I would like to say to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> how much I. appreciate the way in which you have carried out your most onerous job. You have performed it in a very effective way and with a great deal of dignity. I pay a similar tribute to the people who support you, particularly my colleague the  Chairman  of Committees <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lucock).</inline> I am very proud of the way he fills that office. I think he does an excellent job and has great command when he is in the chair. He has had to take control of this House on many occasions when you have been away, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, either</inline> overseas or through ill health. On those occasions he has certainly done an excellent job. </para>
          <para>Many people provide the services in the Parliament. I would not like to run through them all because I might fail to mention one or two of them. I have in mind all the people who work behind the Clerks of the House; the staff of Hansard and the Library staff; the attendants and the door staff. I have not had an opportunity before to mention Gordon Pike. He is an exceptional person. I have no doubt that he has been mentioned on previous occasions but I wish to mention him now because I remember very clearly how important he was when I was a private member, in getting me to Canberra and away again. He is a man who never complains, no matter what is asked of him. </para>
          <para>I wish to mention another person. I do not know whether it is appropriate on this occasion, but he was associated with this Parliament for a very long time in connection with the Cabinet Secretariat. I refer to the late Les McSpeerin who died during the week. Les McSpeerin was in the Office of the Cabinet for a period of 21 years. He retired a fortnight ago and died a week after retiring. He was a most courteous and attentive man. Anybody who was associated with him will feel very sad at his passing and because he was robbed of the opportunity of a happy retirement. </para>
          <para>I would also like to thank the Leader of the Opposition for mentioning the wives of members of Parliament. It is terribly important that they are never forgotten because they do have a burden to carry as wives of members. I wish all members of this Parliament a happy Christmas. I hope that they get some relief from the pressures under which they live. The outside world does not really appreciate the amount of time taken by a member of Parliament in serving his electorate, his constituents, his party and the Parliament. I hope that all get a chance to relax. I wish you all well for 1972. </para>

Once again this Parliament is to receive the benefit of a lifetime of training in the Parliament itself. Also I would like to say a personal &#39;thank you&#39; to the Parliamentary Liaison Officer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr George</inline> Brownbill, who is just completing a most efficient term of office, and to welcome his successor, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Giff</inline> Jones, who I am sure will continue those harmonious relationships that make for the smooth running and functioning of the House. I should like also to thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker,</inline> the  Deputy Speaker  and  Chairman  of Committees and all those who assist you in those various capacities. I should like to thank the Whips and the Hansard staff - in fact all the parliamentary staff whether they be in this chamber or in the dining room or on the transport side: all those who during the year help to make life bearable and who assist in the work that goes on here. </para>

          <para>I should like also to thank the  Deputy  Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Chipp)</inline> who has been assisting with the work in this field.

I feel that we should remember also the members of the Press who look down on us most of the time but who, on occasions such as this, we remember most kindly. I believe that we can look back on a session productive of legislation and keen debate, and it is my hope that the festive season will bring happiness and contentment to all members and to their families. </para>

            <para>- As the Leader of the House <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Swartz)</inline> has already pointed out, the hour is late, but I think I would be lacking in common courtesy if I did not take the opportunity to express one or two views on this very important occasion. First of all, I should like to join with those who earlier this evening expressed good wishes to the  Clerk  of the House. I did not join in the discussion at that time for obvious reasons. There were a number of speakers, and I knew that there would be an opportunity to speak later before the House adjourned. Although I did not speak at that time, I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Turner</inline> would realise that my tribute is just as sincere. He has assisted me, just as he has assisted every other member of this House whenever the occasion has arisen. In more recent years, since it has been my responsibility to approach him on a great number of occasions, I have always found him to be a man who was helpful, considerate and courteous. He certainly was of great assistance to me personally. So I wish both <inline font-weight="bold">Mr and Mrs Turner</inline> a very happy, pleasant, long and enjoyable retirement together. I also join in congratulating <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Parkes</inline> on his appointment to this very high and distinguished office. I know that he will give the same kind of service as we have grown accustomed to receive from Alan Turner. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Next I should like to refer to you <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Speaker.</inline> I have to work very closely with you in some ways. I have appreciated your courtesy and assistance, and I am sure that although honourable members in this House, when matters are under discussion and controversies arise from time to time may not always agree with your decisions, I know that you act impartially, fairly and in the way in which you believe your high office should be discharged. </para>
          <para>I should also like to join the Leader of the House in paying a very well deserved tribute to the members of the Hansard staff, to the attendants and indeed to all those people who assist in the running of this Parliament. I believe that we are very fortunate in the House of Representatives and, I suppose too, in the Senate - of course, one can speak sincerely about the House of Representatives - for the high standard of service that all honourable members have received and acknowledged from the staff that very effectively helps in the running of this Parliament. I join with those who have paid a tribute to the Hansard reporters, to the attendants, to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pike</inline> and indeed to may people who assist in making our duties less difficult and the standard of the Parliament much higher than it would otherwise be. </para>
          <para>I suppose at a time like this there are a great many people to whom one could pay tribute. At this stage I wish to express my gratitude not only to those who have assisted in this way but particularly to the staff of the Leader of the House. I am referring now to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr George</inline> Brownbill who will be retiring from his position. I thank him for his co-operation and assistance over a very long period. I would like also to welcome his successor. I know that we will be able to work together in the same way that I have been able to work with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Brownbill.</inline> So I look forward to a happy association with him. It is not always an easy task for the Leader of the House or for his opposite number on this side of the House. Of course, this has been demonstrated on a number of occasions. I suppose this is because there are some members of the House of Representatives - both on the Government side and on the Opposition side - who are not always aware of the arrangements that must be made if the business of the House is to be dealt with effectively and expeditiously. In this respect I have endeavoured to work with the Leader of the House as he has endeavoured to work with me to achieve this objective. I believe that it has been done during this session reasonably well. Therefore I join wilh the Leader of the Opposition and those who have spoken tonight to express my own personal good wishes to all those people who have contributed in this way, and to wish all members of the House of Representatives the compliments of the season. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Speaker,</inline>I will make my comments brief. I wished to speak through you to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McMahon).</inline> Since he is not here I do so through the  Deputy  Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Anthony)</inline> and I hope that he will give my remarks some consideration. In this gentle season when men remember they are brothers I want to make a request that we give special consideration to that young man, Geoffrey Mullen who is at present in Emu Plains. Geoff Mullen is a young man who has defied the National Service Act. He is due to be released from prison in February. I am asking the Government to give special consideration to releasing him by Christ mans. I do this because he is a man of great moral courage. He has made his stand and I think he is prepared to take his medicine. He would not want me to make any special request on his behalf alone, but I think that he is an only son and that we should give some consideration to his mother. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block"> Geoffrey Mullen is a young man who defied the National Service Act. He has been in many gaols in the State of New South Wales. He has been in Long Bay Gaol. He was transferred from Long Bay Gaol to Berrima. I visited him in Berrima last Easter Saturday. He was transferred from there to Newnes at a later stage. From there he went to Silver water. He was then transferred from Silver water to Cooma. Recently, upon representations being made by myself and other honourable members he was transferred to Emu </para>
          <para class="block">Plains. I might say in fairness to the New South Wales authorities that it is a far better prison for him to be in than Cooma. This is a special problem. </para>
          <para>The Government is bringing home from Vietnam its combat troops by Christmas. I wish it was bringing all its troops home. I will not make any criticism of past policy. This is not the time to crit is ice the Government. I am putting a special case to the Government and I hope that it will give it special consideration. Election policies are being talked about. The Government should treat this case sympathetically. It has been said that the Government may introduce its election policy by next March. If special consideration is given to Mullen, J will be grateful. At least I will see evidence of some human blood running through the veins of politicians. </para>
          <para>Anyone, who knows Mullen recognises that he is a boy with great moral courage. I admire him personally. We all know that mothers fee&#93; for their sons and I want to see the boy home. I hope that not only will the Government give special consideration to Mullen but also that it will give special consideration to the others - there are not a great many because it is not the Government&#39;s policy to arrest many of these young people - who are in gaol. I hope that the Government will give special consideration to them too. But I ask particularly in respect of Mullen. I have kept a close eye on him. I have kept in touch with him and with his mother. I will not detain the House. I thank the Prime Minister for coming into the House. </para>

            <para>Many members have said many things for many hours. I hope that I will not be begrudged 10 minutes to raise a serious matter. It is not a matter of interest, probably, to the Press or to many members in this House. But it is a human tragedy and I wish to have it recorded in the pages of Hansard, even if it stains the pages of our history. I said that it was a human tragedy. Let me read this article as an indication of what it is about. This is not the exact case but it is an analogous one. In the &#39;Sydney Morning Herald&#39; of 18th September 1971 there appeared this article: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>An Aboriginal tribe on a Northern Territory mission station was slowly being &#39;massacred&#39; by liquor, a Professor of anthropology claimed yesterday. </para>
            <para>Professor Ronald Berndt, of the University of Western Australia, said in the three years since he last visited the mission the Aborigines had become apathetic and disillusioned. </para>
            <para>During these three years - in late 1969  -  a liquor store was set up on a mining lease at the edge of the reserve, he said. </para>
            <para>Unles action was taken immediately, the 500 or so Aborigines on the mission would be destroyed. </para>
            <para>Professor Bend was talking about the Oenpelli Mission, about 150 miles east of Darwin. </para>
            <para>Before the coming of the store, the Aborigines - primarily from the Gunwinggu tribe - were well on their way to adapting themselves to the &#39;tremendous changes&#39; going on around them; at the same time retaining something of their cultural heritage, he said. </para>
            <para>A good school was available at Oenpelli - and so was employment. </para>
            <para>Mining in the area, with potential for greater Aboriginal participation, heralded a new economy. </para>
            <para>But, under present conditions, the bright prospects would not be realised. </para>
            <para>Professor Bend claimed almost half of Aboriginal wages, pensions, endowment and trainee payments passed into the hands of the store&#39;s proprietor. </para>
            <para>Family life was disrupted, children neglected, ther was an emotional vacuum and many of the adults were well on their way to becoming alcoholics. </para>
            <para>The continuation of the present state of affairs spells genocide - just as surely as if the people were being massacred,&#39; he said. </para>
            <para>The only difference is that, in this case, it will be slower - but it will have the same result.&#39; </para>
            <para>The Aborigines did not know how to cope with the problem. </para>
            <para>They had no tradition of drinking; it was not part of their culture. </para>
            <para>Most of the people were powerless to react against it themselves because they did not see the implications. </para>
            <para>In his statement, Professor Bend spoke of Aboriginal men and women &#39;dazed and staggering, lying inert, yelling, quarrelling and fighting.&#39; </para>
            <para>The scene at the East Alligator Crossing almost defied description - with about half the adult male population of the mission in various stages of drunkenness. </para>
            <para>The secretary for Aborigines of the Church Missionary Society, the Rev. Stanley Gil trap, said in Sydney that the liquor Licence was granted by the Northern Territory licensing authority over the objections of both the mission and the Aborigines themselves.  1 said that this was not the case that I wished to raise, but it is precisely analogous. lt refers to an area on one side of Arnhem Land. The case about which I am concerned is on the other side of Arnhem Land. If that is what happened in the area just described, this is what will happen in the other case to which I refer specifically. </para>
            <para>I raised this matter in the House. It is recorded in Hansard of 6th and 7th May 1971 at page 2839. The Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt),</inline> in reply to what I had to say, said: </para>
            <para>Is it realistic that the Nhulunbuy community should not have access to the same social amenities as other Northern Territory towns of the same size? There is a need for public accommodation for business and other visitors to the Gove project. The Aboriginals&#39; preference for a club licence would not be appropriate as it would undoubtedly limit the availability of the facilities to club members. Residents and visitors to the town would be excluded unless they joined the club. Unless a discriminatory club rule prevent it, Aboriginals would be able to join the club and have access to liquor. Moreover, restricted availability of liquor through the club would lead to black marketing, especially in respect to Aboriginal drinkers not wishing to join the club. </para>
            <para class="block">Those are very cool words when one considers that the issue of this licence is the prelude to precisely what 1 have read about having already happened in the last couple of years on the other side of Arnhem Land. I shall ask, before I sit down, that the transcript of the case before the licensing magistrate be laid on the table. I would anticipate no objection to that as the trans script was given to me by the Minister himself. This will allow members of this House or of the public to refer to it themselves. </para>
            <para>In the brief amount of time I have at my disposal I want to refer to one or two of the points raised in the transcript. First of all, an officer of the Welfare Department of the NT Administration is responsible to decide whether liquor shall or shall not come onto an Aboriginal reserve. That is his duty. 1 would like to quote part of the transcript relating to the officer who has this responsibility. His name is Cyril Cecil  Allom,  a Regional Welfare Officer with the NT Administration. This witness was the person who, following the earlier application by Walkabout Holdings which was refused on the basis that the company did not have a permit to take liquor into Arnhem Land, issued such a permit. Cross examined by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Elliott,</inline> counsel for the Aborigines, he was asked: Did you understand that this discretion - </para>
            <para class="block">That is, to issue a permit for the purpose of allowing liquor to be taken into Arnhem Land -  was vested in you primarily as a protection for the Aboriginal people? </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">He answered: &#39;Yes, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir&#39;. On</inline> the same page of the transcript the witness also admitted that on the earlier application he had stated that before issuing a permit he would consult all parties concerned. The witness was asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Elliott</inline> whether or not he should have consulted the Aborigines before issuing the permit, He replied: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">I have  not  consulted them,  sir.  I would have considered it an  impertinence  to consult them because their views are being expressed before this Court. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In relation to his earlier statement that he would have consulted all parties before issuing a permit, the witness stated in relation to the Aborigines: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>They are parties, sir, but as I say they are already represented. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">When asked a question in relation to his powers to issue a permit under section 140E of the Licensing Ordinance, specifically having regard to the interests of the Aborigines, the witness replied: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>No, I think I have to have regard to the interests of other people as well. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I will not read any more of his evidence. This man was supposed to be looking after the interests of the Aborigines but he did not consult them because they were before the court. The court might have liked to hear from somebody who had expertise in this field and whose duty it was to look after them what was his attitude, being presumably also the attitude of the Government. But I do not have time to go into this matter in detail. </para>
          <para>Let me pass on the attitude of Walkabout to the club licence. Evidence was given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Graeme</inline> James Robertson,  Chairman  of Walkabout Hotel. He was asked whether he had considered the disadvantages of a club licence as opposed to hotel licence.  His  answer was: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>We would have to break the law; that was the only disadvantage. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That indicates that the witness supposed a club licence could not be enforced. The witness said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>We are not  looking  for a way over it. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">He was referring to the disadvantages of a club licence. They were interested only in an hotel licence. So the question of a club licence was never before the court. Walkabout was not interested in it and it never came before the court as to whether a club licence might be the right answer. </para>
          <para>Evidence as to the provision of amenities such as a canteen and provision for the families there in a community centre was given by the Site Administration Officer at Nab al co. This was highly satisfactory. I cannot go into all this but there was talk about a need to accommodate visitors. Yet when one reads on through the evidence one finds it admitted that the mining company does not encourage visitors. Of course it does not. It wants to get on with mining. Nevertheless there was talk before the magistrate about the accommodation of visitors. Even a trade union organiser said that the union wanted a hotel so that the workers in the mine could have their families there. It came out in evidence that this would cost about $20 a night exclusive, of course, of the costs of flying the families to this place and back home again. </para>
          <para>I have not time to go into all these matters and I will lay on the table the transcript of evidence. It disclosed a disgraceful situation where the welfare officer gave no evidence to assist the court, where the applicant had no concern whatsoever for the Aborigines - he merely wanted a hotel licence to do what a storekeeper did on the other side of Arnhem Land - where there was talk about the accommodation of visitors whereas the mine discourages visitors and where every point of view was taken into account except the interests of the Aborigines. This is a human tragedy and T want it recorded in Hansard. </para>

            <para>- 1 heartily congratulate the honourable member for Bradfield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Turner)</inline> on what he has said. Honourable members know that I am a member of the Joint Committee on Public Works which has visited the Northern Territory on at least 5 or 6 occasions this year under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Wakefield <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Kelly).</inline> I can assure this Parliament that what the honourable member for Bradfield said about the liquor store near Oenpelli is correct. I had the privilege of talking to the manager of the liquor store near Oenpelli not very long ago and what he told me without hesitation confirms that the facts quoted by the honourable member for Bradfield from the newspaper articles are true. Our country would  be richer if there were more speeches of the type made by the honourable member for Bradfield regarding the peoples of the Northern Territory and particularly the Aborigines It is true that the Aborigines trudge for days after they get their social service cheques. I am not trying to denigrate the administration of Aboriginal affairs. This is a problem with which all of us should be concerned. Without mentioning socialism or nationalism, if ever there was an industry that needed Government control to remove the profit motive it is the liquor industry in the Northern Territory, so that no more would a person selling intoxicating liquor be able to enrich himself through the intoxication of Aborigines. It would be to the credit of this Government if it were to do something in that regard. The Public Works Committee will be visiting the Oenpelli Mission next week in its investigation of the beef roads project. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>What the honourable member for Bradfield has said is true and I hope the Parliament and the Minister for the Environment, Aborigines and the Arts <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Howson)</inline> will read what he said and do something about the intoxication of Aborigines and the profit motive behind the sale of liquor to Aborigines. The Marys, wives or gins and their children remain outside the liquor store while the men in ignorance exhaust the social service payments that the Government makes to them. I will not detain the Parliament any longer and I conclude by again congratulating the honourable member for Bradfield for bringing this matter forward. </para>

            <para>In Darwin to buy stores yesterday, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Thorpe</inline> said he was &#39;quite disillusioned&#39; about the unions which has sponsored him, and about &#39;several other organisations&#39; which claimed to be helping the Gurindjis. </para>
            <para>Most of them are simply using the situation for political gain, without any real knowledge of the situation, or any real regard for the real wishes of the Gurindjis,&#39; he said. </para>
            <para>I have no political affiliations at all. </para>
            <para>I wanted to come to the Territory to help Aboriginals, and the National Union of Australian University Students offered to sponsor a two weeks visit to Hattie Creek through its Aboriginal Scholarship Scheme (Abschol) </para>
            <para>This would not have Deen long enough to even get to know the people. </para>
            <para>Then the Australian Meat Industry Employee&#39;s Union, through organiser <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jack</inline> OToole, arranged for a 30 weeks stay to be sponsored by a group of 10 unions. wages </para>
            <para>Each union donated $150 to help meet my agreed wages of $50 a week. </para>
            <para>When I got to Darwin the North Australian Workers&#39; Union appointed me an honorary organiser to ensure award conditions for Aboriginal station hands in the Victoria River District. </para>
            <para>There have been a lot of problems, and 1 have been attempting to solve them in what seems the best way for the Gurindjis and other Aboriginals in the area. </para>
            <para>But it seem I have not been sufficiently militant enough for the unions. </para>
            <para>For this or some other reason I don&#39;t know, they have not paid me since the end of April, despite requests for payment, or official notification that I will not be paid. </para>
            <para>Despite this I have continued to use my abilities as a mechanic, bricklayer and agriculturist to help the Gurindjis as much as I can. </para>
            <para>Quite a lot is being accomplished, without much fuss, along the lines which the Gurindjis themselves want. </para>
            <para>NOT SUITABLE</para>
            <para class="block">At one stage <inline font-weight="bold">Mr OToole</inline> said I should resign from the honorary job with the NAWU because he did not think I was a suitable man to be a union organiser. </para>
            <para>I discussed the request with the Gurindjis themselves, and at their request decided to retain the post so I would have authority to speak on union matters with employers. </para>
            <para>The NAWU has not made any move to withdraw its support. </para>
            <para>One of the problems we have is the number of so-called experts on the Gurindji question. </para>
            <para>Most of them are 10-day wonders - people who have made brief visits to Hattie Creek and think they know all the answers - or just distant wonders - people who have never been in the NT. </para>
            <para>They are agitating for what the Gurindjis want - or what they believe the Gudindjis should want. </para>
            <para>They have no knowledge of what the Gudindjis themselves want </para>
            <para>DECISION</para>
            <para>Recently the Gurindjis, at a long meeting, decided they should seek a lease over the So square miles they are claiming as tribal land around Hattie Creek. </para>
            <para>This is on Wave Hill station, and Vestey&#39;s, the controlling company, has said lt would not resist any Government move to excise the area and give it to the Gurindjis. </para>
            <para>The Gurindjis decided they could gain control over the land within existing laws, by seeking the lease, while leaving their application for the land to be granted to them for future consideration. </para>
            <para>But Eschol and the other organisations decided the lease application should not bc made. </para>
            <para>They say it would admit Government ownership of the land claimed by the Aboriginals. </para>
            <para>They believe the lease application would cut across the principle of Aboriginal land rights. </para>
            <para>The Gurindjis themselves do not admit this&#39; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Thorpe</inline> said. </para>
            <para>They regard the lease as a first step and one which would give them undisputed control of the land now, while the principle is still being argued. </para>
            <para>Yet the southern organisations are attempting to dictate what the Gurindjis should do. </para>
            <para>They are refusing to let the people think or speak for themselves. </para>
            <para>Right now, the Gurindjis want to seek a lease for the land 1 believe the Government will quite soon agree to grant them a small sit-down area at Hattie Creek, but they still want a lease over the whole 500 square miles. </para>
            <para>They want permission and help to establish a small cattle station operation on the land. This would not be to supply all the Gurindjis - just some of the older people. </para>
            <para>The others could work on other stations, or form a series of contract mustering teams. </para>
            <para>Contract mustering is hard work - but these people can do it, and do it well. </para>
            <para>NEED HELP</para>
            <para class="block">Al least initially they would need someone to help wilh the business organisation and paperwork.  &#34;This is what all the interested organisations should be doing. </para>
            <para>Working directly to help the Gurindjis to achieve their real aims. </para>
            <para>Instead they are following pre-conceived ideas, usually based on political grounds, and expecting the Gurindjis to conform. </para>
            <para>Some of the Territory people who have spoken recently on the question have also shown a complete lack of understanding of the real problem. </para>
            <para>These include <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Goc</inline> Letts (Legislative Council Member for Victoria River) and&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Brian</inline> Manning (Secretary of the Darwin branch of the Waterside Workers&#39; Federation). &#34;Their public argument recently about conditions and leadership at Hattie Creek is based on the situation as it was years ago - not on what is happening now,&#39; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Thorpe</inline> said. </para>
            <para>With <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Thorpe</inline> in Darwin yesterday was Aboriginal <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Panto</inline> Panto, whose mother was a Wailers and whose father is a Gurindji. </para>
            <para>
        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Panto</inline>is living in one of the 20 Housing Commission-type houses built by the Welfare Branch at Wave Hill settlement about five miles from Hattie Creek. </para>
            <para>ONE PEOPLE</para>
            <para>He said the Aboriginals at both centres were all one people&#39;, with a mixture of Gurindji and Wailers descent. </para>

I would also like to thank them for the tributes that they paid to the 2 Clerks and the table officers who work so loyally and so assiduously over long hours on behalf of members and the Parliament itself. I would be remiss if I did not thank the  deputy  speakers and the chairmen of committees for their excellent co-operation during the year. I am extremely thankful for their understanding during my absences. </para>

Thank you very much for the tributes to the attendants and other members of the staff, such as those in the refreshment rooms, and particularly the unnamed people who have not been referred to but who run into many categories both in the chamber and in the House. I assure honourable members that they work loyally and assiduously and that the comfort of and service to the members is their first consideration. I shall have great pleasure in conveying to them the thoughts of the members of the House and shall express your appreciation to them for their services during the year. </para>

Persons moving from the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund to most State Public Service superannuation funds may purchase with the refund of contributions received from the Commonwealth fund, the employees&#39; share of fully paid units of pension in the State fund, and the State accepts responsibility for the employer obligation in re -peel of such units. Where such employees do not have the opportunity of having this type of preservation arrangement applied to them, they have available a deferred benefit under the Superannuation Act 1922-1971. Thus, in either event the employees&#39; benefits are preserved for them. </para>

            <para>No survey has been made of the Hols worthy Ingle burn area. The survey of the Puckapunyal Seymour area, to which the Honourable Leader of the Opposition refers, was undertaken as a special task to provide answers to a question asked by the Member for Bendigo. </para>
            <para>The survey conducted in the Puckapunyal. Seymour area required considerable staffing effort to collect and collate the data, however, because the Seymour-Puckapunyal area is relatively concentrated and the number of servicemen with children of secondary school age comparatively few, it was possible for this survey to be conducted. </para>
            <para>To undertake a similar survey in the Hols worthy Ingle burn area, which is such a large geographic area and where a great number of servicemen are located, would be a very costly exercise and I am not disposed to authorise the necessary expenditure. In addition, the turbulence&#39; arising from the return of servicemen from Vietnam would cast doubt upon the accuracy of any statistics collected at this time. </para>

However, many of these applicants would have been successful in gaining admission lo a faculty of an alternative choice. Moreover, as experience has shown that not all successful applicants take up an offer of a place in a faculty of their first choice, it is likely that many who did not receive such an offer, because they gained insufficient marks at the matriculation examination, would not have accepted an offer had it been made. </para>

          <para>Where overseas-based personnel are introduced under these provisions the policy adopted is that every reasonable opportunity must be given to locally-engaged workers to enjoy the benefits to be derived from work on developmental and other projects carried out in this country. Similarly it is generally a condition of their entry that the employer take steps to ensure that workers recruited in Australia be given an opportunity to learn the specialist skills possessed by the expatriate workers. This envisages the introduction of suitable training arrangements by the employer. Such conditions are directed to ensuring that Australia will not need continually to rely on the importation of short-term labour to obtain the benefit of these skills and so that, in appropriate cases, expatriate personnel may progressively be repatriated as locally-engaged workers become competent to carry out their functions. </para>
          <para>A standard condition of entry is always that the personnel admitted to Australia must receive wages and work under conditions no less favourable than those applying to Australian workers engaged on comparable work and that all relevant Australian industrial laws, awards and agreements apply in respect of the expatriate personnel. </para>

            <para>- The answer to the honourable member&#39;s question is as follows:  (1), (2) and (4) The principle underlying the system of water charging in the Australian Capital Territory is that all consumers should contribute to the cost incurred in providing for the storage of sufficient water to meet all consumers need: and in treating and reticulating it to their properties. The minimum charge (currently $20 per annum) therefore represents a contribution  b}  each consumer towards the capital, maintenance and operating costs of the system. In setting the minimum charge of $20 for 100,000 gallons of water the contribution of consumers to the development of Canberra as a garden city continued to be recognised. Instead of setting 75,000 gallons as the quantity allowable before excess was charged, 25,000 gallons was added to encourage consumers to continue to maintain na&#39;.are strips. Flat dwellers pay only the minimum charge irrespective of the amount of water consumed. </para>

              <para>An article in the Medical Journal of Australia of 23rd October 1971, contributed by the Director of the Intensive Care Unit of the Royal Children&#39;s Hospital, Melbourne, stated that tricyclic anti-depressant over dosage is now the most common cause of admission of children to hospital for drug over dosage and that admissions from that cause have trebled. Information on this aspect from the Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children, Sydney, is not readily available but it is understood that there is an impression that there has been an increase in drug over dosage from anti-depressants among children admitted to that hospital. </para>

In August 1970, the Director-General of Health wrote to all approved chemists, drawing their attention to a statement by the National Health and Medical Research Council at its 70th Session, in April 1970. At that session, Council expressed its concern at the incidence of poisoning in young children and commended the use of tablet containers that cannot readily be opened by young children. The Director-General of Health drew attention to the fact that there are containers of a type which was referred to by Council available in Australia and that, insofar as pharmaceutical benefit prescriptions are concerned, such containers come within the allowance provided by the Commonwealth for reimbursement of container costs. The Director-General urged chemists to give serious consideration to the problem of poisoning in childhood and to the feasibility of implementing the recommendation of the National Health and Medical Research Council concerning the use of safety closures for dispensed medicines. </para>

However, it is assumed that the honourable member is concerned with the situation where, in the course of a consultation, a doctor collects a blood specimen from the patient for forwarding to another doctor for  a  pathology test.

              <para>and (5) When the patient contribution towards the cost of pharmaceutical benefits was introduced in 1960, it was intended that all persons, except pensioners, would pay the 50c charge. However, members of Friendly Societies paying membership contributions to cover the cost of their medicines were allowed to receive a rebate on all or part of the patient contribution, depending upon the particular Society&#39;s rules. Between 1960 and 1964, it became apparent to the Government that its policy of patient participation in the cost of the Scheme was in jeopardy. The Government therefore introduced the 1964 amendments to provide that rebate provisions would be restricted to persons receiving them immediately prior to 24th April 1964. </para>

A complete record of recommendations made by the Council is available in the form of sessional reports, but the magnitude of the task of extracting details of each individual recommendation from these reports makes it impracticable to provide a complete answer to the honourable member&#39;s question. Recent sessional reports of Council are available in the Parliamentary Library. Specific information on any particular subject of the Council&#39;s recommendations could be made available to the honourable member if he so requested. Listed below, under broad headings, are the main subjects on which the Council has considered it necessary or desirable to provide advice or recommendations. controls over the possession, use, storage and labelling of drugs and poisons; industrial hygiene and occupational health; maternal and child health; dental health; environmental factors which may affect health; prevention and control of mental illness, and the care and rehabilitation of patients with menial illness; traffic injuries; health education; recruitment and training of nurses, and the practice of nursing; matters relating to ionising radiation; the promotion and preservation of health in the tropics; and medical statistics on human morbidity and mortality. </para>

The cost of producing each issue of these pamphlets was approximately {2,000. </para>

In July and August 1970, an advertising campaign was carried out through Press, radio and television following the introduction  of  the new Health Benefits Plan. Details of the system  of  graduated eligibility for subsidised benefits were included in this &#39;campaign, the cost of which was $83,000. Similarly, during July and September 1970, 4,500,000 copies of a booklet titled &#39;A Guide to the Health Benefits Plan&#39; were issued and 4.000.000 copies of a pamphlet titled &#39;Your Guide to Medical Insurance&#39; were distributed.

            <para>- The answer to the honourable member&#39;s question is  as  follows:  (1), (2) and (3) Branch delegates on the governing or rule-making body of an organisation under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act are officers of the organisation. The Act does not authorise a branch committee of management to request that an election for an office in the organisation be conducted under section 170. Consequently, the Industrial Registrar cannot grant a request by a branch committee of management for the election of such delegates to be conducted under section 170 and there is no basis for the operation of section 170A(6) of the Act. </para>

              <para>to (5) The difficult accommodation problem of which ali honourable members are aware will not be solved simply by shifting the problem from one place to another. The Government has attempted to provide a partial answer in the extensions to Parliament House that are now under way. When these works were authorised the additional space that was to be provided enabled the then Presiding Officers to say that the reasonable accommodation requirements of Members and Senators would be met. The demands of the Parliament, however, are growing and some further attention to this pressing problem is  clearly necessary. 1 am sure this is engaging the attention of the Presiding Officers. It is also a mailer which is kept under review by the Government. </para>

I am informed that in order to produce the detail for which he has asked, there would need to be an examination of every Commonwealth Act and Territory Ordinance and of the Regulations .made under those Acts and Ordinances. This would involve considerable time and expense and in the circumstances I am reluctant to authorise the research which would be involved. However, if the Honourable Member has any specific statutory bodies in mind on which he requires information then I will examine the matter and see what can be provided. </para>

            <para>The long-standing policy on Commonwealth Government purchasing is that, where overseas goods are in competition with local supplies, ordering authorities are required to add the cost of freight and insurance, and the appropriate amount of any duties and primage which would apply if the goods were being imported commercially. In this way, Australian manufacturers are afforded the protection to which they are normally entitled under the Tariff. (The Australian paper industry is accorded protection under the Tariff.) Exceptions may be made, and higher priced Australian goods favoured, such as when the goods are of strategic importance or the industry is depressed. Consistent with this policy, special consideration may be given to the use of Australian-made paper in private contracts for Government printing work. </para>

              <para>Imports of brandy in the financial years 1968-69, 1969-70 and 1970-71 totalled 665,925 proof gallons. Most imports were in bulk at strengths exceeding proof. </para>

              <para>The excise duty on brandy is $8.00 per proof gallon. The customs duty on most imported brandy is $8.50 per proof gallon. Accordingly, the Australian industry has protection through the Tariff at a level of $0.50 per proof gallon. There are no subsidies or import restrictions applicable to brandy. (3), (4) and - (5) Stocks of Australian grape brandy held in bond increased from 5.3 million gallons at 30th June 1970 to 5.8 million gallons at 30th June 1971. </para>

From July 1968 the benefit scale was aligned with the rates of pensions and benefits paid by the Department of Social Services.

              <para>The Australian Society of Authors has proposed to the Government that a public lending right scheme be introduced in Australia. Schemes that are frequently referred to as public lending right schemes are in operation or under consideration in the countries mentioned in the honourable member&#39;s question. Since there are, however, significant differences between the schemes in operation in the countries mentioned, it cannot be said that the scheme proposed by the Australian Society of Authors is similar to the schemes in all of those countries. One of the alternative proposals put forward by the Australian Society of Authors is for the introduction of a scheme that bears a marked resemblance to the scheme in operation in Denmark. </para>

              <para>The last bound general reprint of Commonwealth Acts was published as at 31st December 1950. Since then, however, reprints in pamphlet form incorporating all amendments to the date of reprinting have been issued from time to time for most Acts in common use. Twenty-eight reprints of Acts have been published so far this year and the total number available is about 170. If a complete set of reprints of Acts is maintained in alphabetical order, there is little occasion to refer to the 1901-1950 bound reprint. It is thought by some members of the legal profession that pamphlet reprints are more useful than complete reprints in the form of bound volumes, since the pamphlet reprints can more easily be kept up-to-date than complete bound reprints, which necessarily can only be produced at intervals. </para>

Such a Bill is usually enacted towards the end of a year&#39;s sittings and becomes the last Act of the year, so that Acts passed earlier in the year can if necessary be dealt with in the Bill. An officer of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel is already engaged in the preparation of a Statute Law Revision Bill, but the drafting and settlement of such a Bill in consultation with the departments that administer Commonwealth Acts will necessarily take a substantial period.&#39; </para>

              <para>The ban which has been placed on cigarette advertising in certain overseas countries appears to vary somewhat from country to country. From information available to me there are currently some 13 countries in which a ban on cigarette advertising has been imposed to some degree; in some cases the ban applies only to television advertising, in other cases to television and radio and in a few cases to all advertising media. Although I am aware of only 13 countries applying a ban, the honourable member has no doublee noticed that the most recent Annual Report of the Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria suggests that cigarette advertising on television is now banned in 17 countries, including Britain, America and Canada; the ban in the case of Canada is, of course, to apply after 1st January, 1972. I am not in a position to provide any accurate information on whether the ban on cigarette advertising in the countries concerned was applied voluntarily or compulsorily, although 1 understand that in the case of Denmark the ban on cigarette advertising on radio, television and in the cinema, was voluntarily applied. </para>

            <item label="(6)">
              <para>This portion of the honourable member&#39;s question presents an opportunity for me to correct a wrong impression which seems to have been gained from an answer I gave recently at Question time on this subject. Initially it muli be understood that the question of any controls on cigarette advertising or distribution is basically one for my colleague, the Minister for Health, and his department. The mailer has been considered several times by the National Health and Medical Research Council, and the implementation of some of the recommendations made by that body is a matter for Slate Government* \s far as the Federal Government is concerned, the Cabinet has carefully considered the submissions made to it, and has firmly decided that the situation is best handled by tin education cam&#62;\ i&#34;n regarding the hazards of smoking, and by a voluntary agreement regarding some forms nf advertising. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>It follows therefore that the production and marketing of cigarettes is an entirely legal operation, and to ban their advertising on radio and television only would be ah act of discrimination against some media, to (he very great advantage of others. In the United Slates, for instance, two surveys have recently been published showing the startling increase in the advertising of cigarettes in magazines since such advertisements were banned in the broadcast media. Such advertising in most leading magazines increased by well over 100 per cent compared with the same period the previous year, and in one case the increase was 533 per cent. </para>
          <para>In the light of this information it is apparent, that any action to ban cigarette advertising on radio and television would only have the effect of very substantially redistributing advertising income among the media, which depend on that revenue for existence, without bringing about any change in the total volume of such advertising 1 should add that the voluntary code governing the advertising of cigarettes, recently revised by the industry, in consultation wilh the Department of Health and the Control Board, appears to have achieved its object in that no advertising of this nature is now broadcast or televised in proximity to programmes which are addressed to young people. </para>
          <para>It is not for me, of course, as Postmaster-General to determine the matter of any health hazards which may accompany the smoking of cigarettes. What I am attempting to do is to put forward the argument that discrimination in respect of one section of the advertising media - because it is one over the which the Federal Government can exercise some controls - cannot bo justified. </para>

            <para>- The answer to the honourable member&#39;s question is as follows:  (!) Because of appreciable time-lags between the production, sale and processing of wool, it is not possible to establish accurately how much of the Australian wool clip in any given year is processed locally. A further difficulty is that statistics of wool used in processing do not distinguish between locally produced and imported wool. Some indication of the volume of locally produced wool which is processed in Australia can be gained, however, from mill consumption statistics adjusted fo rim ports Estimates  far  the last 10 years are a&#62; follows: </para>

                <para>It is not possible to give a definite answer to this question.

The U.N.H.C.R. said that it would and the lice was then formally provided to India through the U.N.H.C.R. Australia is making a cash contribution to the U.N.H.C.R. of $500,000 which is more than sufficient to cover the freight costs on rice estimated at $140,000. Australia has paid the freight costs of all other supplies provided far the refugees. </para>

          <para class="block">The following is the full text of a statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ole</inline> Volfing, Head of Fund-raising Activities of the U.N.H.C.R. on 24th October (forwarded to the Government by the U.N.H.CR. Representative for Australia and New Zealand):  I hereby wish to state that I have not, at any stage of my meetings with journalists during my visits to Australia or New Zealand, criticised the Australian Government for the  size  of its contribution or for the freight arrangements made in connection with their generous gift of $A1m worth of rice. On Thursday, October 21. the &#39;Australian Financial Review&#39; quoted me incorrectly, including quoting me as having said that I am surprised Australia has asked the U.N.H.C.R. to pay the transport costs of the rice. </para>
          <para>On Thursday afternoon, October 21, when 1 arrived in Wellington&#39; I was asked by the Wellington Correspondent of &#39;The Australian&#39; if I would give a statement, in the light of the quotation in the &#39;Australian Financial Review&#39; It was at that moment I learned the quotation in the &#39;Australian Financial Review&#39; of the same day. I dictated a statement to the Welling ton Correspondent of the &#39;Australian&#39; on one condition - namely, that it would be published in the &#39;Australian&#39; in full and without any changes. If this could not be promised I had no comments as I did not want to be misquoted once more. The Wellington Correspondent promised that the statement would either be published in full or not published at all, based on which I then dictated my statement. </para>
          <para>I therefore deeply regret to see on passing through Sydney Airport today. Sunday. October 24, a copy of the &#39;Australian&#39; of Friday, October 22, which does not publish my statement at all but Instead publishes quotations of something I have never said - such as the U.N.H.C.R. has to go to Sweden or some other country for the money. I wish to make it clear that it is the usual privilege of any government to decide if, how and under what conditions it wishes to contribute to the humanitarian programme of the United Nations and that I, as a United Nations civil servant, could not comment on or question the decision of the Australian Government in this respect. And I find it most unfortunate that Australian newspapers have misquoted me as part of their domestic disagreement with the Government.&#34; </para>

              <para>Some limit has to be placed on the distance over which local calls be allowed, having regard to the economics of plant provision and the costs of operating and maintaining the telephone network as a whole. Adoption of the proposal recommended by the Victorian Decentralisation Advisory Committee to include Ballarat, Bendigo. Latrobe Vasey, Portland and Wodonga Albury in the Melbourne metropolitan area for call charging purposes would entail an extension of the limits of the existing Melbourne local call area which simply could not be justified on economic grounds H .would also entail a heavy increase on the rentals for telephone services in those country areas, which, although offset lo some degree- by a reduction in call fees, would be objected to strongly by those subscribers who did not have a marked community of interest with the metropolitan area and therefore did not call Melbourne subscribers very often. Moreover, the granting of any preferential treatment to. the centres mentioned would have far reaching repercussions so far as the Post Office is concerned since 01 ner centres - not only in Victoria,&#39; but also in the other States - would seek similar treatment in respect of telephone calls to their capital city. similiar comments also apply in the case of telex charges except that the charging districts are somewhat larger. Ballarat, Bendigo and Latrobe Valley telex subscribers are already included in the Melbourne charging district and, consequently, calls between these subscribers and Melbourne are at the minimum rate. Calls from Portland and Wodonga.&#39;Albury te&#39;ex subscribers to Melbourne fall within the 101- 200 miles category and because nf the distance involved their inclusion in die Melbourne district could not be justified. In any case, such action hardly be taken without due cognizance being given to the claims of other centres. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>The basic policy of the Government in relation to educational television, following its consideration of the report of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board&#39;s Advisory Committee on Educational Television Services (the Weeded Committee), was outlined in a statement which I made in Parliament on 11th May, 1966. </para>
            <para>Whilst the Government supported the Committee&#39;s views that instructional television programmes ought to be developed as an integral part of the Australian education system, and agreed that education was primarily a matter for State Authorities the Government did not accept the proposal of the advisory Committee that&#39; a separate network of educational television stations was necessary. It considered that the facilities of the Australian Broadcasting Commission and those of commercial stations, if required, were adequate for the forseeable future to provide satisfactory educational television services. lt was considered by the Government, that, as education was a sovereign responsibility of the States, an essential first step in assessing the requirements for educational television was to first obtain from State Governments details of their needs and priorities, and the extent to which they would be prepared to incur expenditure on educational television services. For this purpose, the Government initiated discussions between Commonwealth and State Ministers at a conference held in 1966 and the State Governments have since been examining their individual positions in this matter, bearing in mind&#39; their heavy commitments in the field of education generally. The Commonwealth had previously indicated that it was prepared to provide some additional finance for expanding instructional television programmes if such expansion were desired by the States, and if the States were also prepared to contribute resources for the purpose. </para>
            <para>A further conference took place on 17th November, 1969. by which time it had become apparent that overseas development of new techniques in electronic aids to teaching, particularly advances in television recording and relay requirements, had become a significant consideration in relation to any planning for the future development of educational television services. </para>
            <para>Accordingly, it was agreed at the 1969 Conference that a Special Committee comprising Commonwealth and State representatives should be established for the purpose of investigating technological developments with a view to reporting back to a further meeting of Federal and State Ministers. Whilst the committee&#39;s investigations are still continuing, they have been complicated by the fact hat a system for the recording and replaying of educational television programmes, to be effective, must meet the every-day educational requirements of simplicity in operation, interchangeability between reproducing units and maximum reliability with minimum technical maintenance. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>On present indications, it would seem possible that the use of recorded programmes and playback machines may be the answer rather than the use of a transmitted system of educational television programmes; this bears out the wisdom of the Government&#39;s original decision not to proceed with the establishment of a transmitted system of educational television services. </para>
          <para>Whilst it was recognised that a study of the technology developments would not be a short term project, it is essential, nevertheless, to have an informed view on the various issues relating to educational television prior to any decision being taken as to the manner in which educational television services might most appropriately be developed. </para>
          <para>The position is therefore that the whole question of educational television is still under consideration both from a technological viewpoint and from the aspect of the needs and priorities of State governments in this field. As the Honourable member will be aware, the Australian Broadcasting Commission is* continuing to provide a considerable number of hours of educational television programmes. </para>

              <para>Yes. At 2134:36 hours VH-EWJ was cleared to line-up behind the departing Boeing 727 aircraft, VH-TJA. At that time the aerodrome controller anticipated that there would bc sufficient time between the landing of the Canadian DC8-63 aircraft, CF-CPQ, and that of the succeeding arriving aircraft, a TAA DC9 aircraft VH-TJN, to permit him to clear both VH-TJA and VH-EW.1 for their respective take-offs. Subsequently the aerodrome controller discerned, as a result of the slow movement of CF-CPQ on the runway after landing, that there would not be sufficient time for both of the departing aircraft to safely completed their take-offs prior to the landing of VH-TJN. Thus, at 2135 : 54 hours the aerodrome controller cancelled the line-up clearance previously issued to VH-EWJ and instructed it to remain in ils position on the taxiway leading to the threshold of Runway 16. </para>

              <para>The final paragraph of section 2.1 on page 22 of the Accident Investigation Report described the basic performance calculations which led the Air Safety investigation Branch to conclude that the take-off could have been safely abandoned at least from the point where it has been established that the pilot-in-command of VH-TJA has already recognised the existence of an obstruction on the runway using the data produced under the supervision of the Federal Aviation Administration in the U.S.A. by the aircraft manufacture fort her purpose of proving its performance capacity for certification purposes it has been calculated that, from the point on the runway where the Captain of VH- TJ A said &#39;How far ahead is he&#39; the aircraft could have been brought it a halt at a point some 2,140 feet short of the position on the runway of the nose of CF-CPQ at the time of the collision. This calculation adopts reaction delays proposed by the manufacturer and accepted by F.A.A. as being valid for airline pilots. It also makes due allowance for the conditions of gross weight, air temperature, runway slope and headwind component experienced by VH-TJA on the night of this take-off. Nevertheless, at the time this type of aircraft received its certificate of approval, there was no F.A.A. requirements for evaluation of stopping distance on wet runways and so there is no basic data upon which an entirely reliable allowance for extension of the stopping distance under wet runway conditions could be made. Performance data under wet runway conditions is available however, in respect of the Boeing 727-200 series aircraft recently certificated in the&#39; U.S.A. and for which our domestic airlines are currently seeking Government approval to introduce into this country towards the end of 1972. This data has been studied and. so far as the stopping performance of a Boeing 727-200 series aircraft can be considered relevant to the ability of VH-TJA to stop, if indicates that the extension of stopping distance under wet runway conditions would have been of the order of 1,250 ft. Thus it can be said with confidence that the calculation that the aircraft could have been stopped 2,140 ft short of the obstructing aircraft under dry runway conditions, contains more than an adequate margin to account for any extension of the stopping distance under wet runway conditions. These are the principal grounds on which it was concluded that the take-off could have been safely abandoned. </para>

The United Kingdom intentions are not known at this time. The United States legislation also specifically precludes use of the audio recording in any civil penalty or certificate proceedings initiated by the Federal Aviation Administration against a crew member and limits publication of recorded data to that determined &#39;to be pertinent and relevant to the accident.&#39; It was indicated to the Australian Federation that similar principles would be observed in Australia in the event of access to recordings being otherwise unrestricted. </para>

              <para>lt can be argued that cockpit audio recorders involve, in some measure, considerations such as invasion of privacy and, for these reasons, the Federation was concerned that, in matters such as litigation, their members were exposed beyond the extent of exposure of other members of the community. The Department had some sympathy for the Federation&#39;s views but it was hoped that time would demonstrate that the safety advantage of the equipment far outweighed any other considerations. lt is believed that experience, particularly in the United States of America, has provided this demonstration and has also shown that far more often than not, the audio recording works to the advantage of flight crew. In the light of this experience it is the intention of the Government to re-open this subject with a view to development of appropriate legislation to remove the present limitations while including some provisions which would give recognition to the unusual nature of this equipment. </para>

          <para>President Nixon was declaring United States policy as such on charter services, lt is, therefore, not a question of any adjustment by Australia to it. When appropriate it is a matter for negotiation and reconciliation of the views of each Government as to the conditions, such as pricing and volume, under which charter Mig hts may be operated. Australian policy has for some time recognised the increasing importance of charter services as a component of international air transportation. Qantas earned over S27m from charter operations in its last financial year. The crucial problem for all Governments, of course, is to develop a proper relationship between scheduled and non-scheduled services so that the stability of the former and therefore, in essence, their availability are not prejudiced. </para>
          <para>Regarding methods to resolve the situation as between Governments there has been no acceptance as yet of the United States view that comprehensive bilateral agreements comparable to those regulating scheduled services should be immediately negotiated. These agreements may be achieved in the future but for the moment Governments, including Australia, have been proceeding on the basis of ad hoc arrangements renewable from time to time in the light of experience and including certain basic conditions. This method is, in fact, being adopted in relation to our recently achieved understanding with the United States authorities. The aim to to stimulate additional tourist travel between Australia and the United States through agreement on the conditions tinder which a certain number of charter flights can be operated between the 2 countries by such airlines as the United States and Australian Governments approve as carriers to operate them. </para>

              <para>The requirement for members of friendly society dispensaries to pay the fifty cents patient contribution, in respect of pharmaceutical benefit prescriptions, was introduced with effect from 24th April 1964. Only members who joined friendly society dispensaries after that dale were required to pay the patient contribution, which was then 50 cents. </para>

          </list>
          <para>This requirement was introduced because of the growth in membership of friendly society dispensaries after the implementation of the fifty cents patient contribution from 1st March 1960. The Government was concerned that the intended deterrent effect of the patient contribution was in danger of being nullified, firstly, because of the growth in membership of friendly society dispensaries and secondly, because other organisations were seriously considering entering the field of rebate insurance on the fifty cents, patient contribution. </para>
          <para>During the Government&#39;s recent consideration of the level of patient contribution for general pharmaceutical benefits is also considered the position of members of friendly society dispensaries. In the recent amendment to the National Health Act the rights of persons who joined friendly societies prior to 24th April 1964 to receive rebates up to&#39; the full amount of the new patient contribution, viz., one dollar, have been preserved. </para>

              <para>(i) and (ii) The information in this answer to the honourable member&#39;s question _ relates to the responsibilities of my Department, i.e. government schools and pre-schools in the Australian Capital Territory and community pre-schools and schools in the Northern. Territory. My Department itself does not make any charges for pupils attending pre-schools, primary or secondary schools under its control in either Territory. However, parent and school committees associated with the pre-schools and schools often set  a  level of contribution, or fee which the overwhelming majority of parents pay in. respect of children attending. There is considerable variation in the levels set as between schools and the figures given below represent an estimate of the average contribution per child paid at pre-schools, primary and secondary schools,  (a)  Parents committees of pre-schools seek a contribution from parents which is used mainly to provide and maintain equipment at the pre-school. In the Australian Capital Territory this contribution averages about $8.50 per term for each child; in the Northern Territory the average is a little higher, reflecting the fact that in the Northern Territory most children attending pre-school do so for more sessions per week than do children in the Australian Capita&#39; Territory. </para>

As the honourable member may recall, an increase in the maximum &#39; deduction under section 82j was among the measures which 1 announced in my Budget Speech. There does not appear lobe any call for a further review of either matter so soon after the Budget but both may be expected lobe looked into again in the course of preparing the 1972-73 Budget. </para>

            <para>- The answer to the honourable member&#39;s question is as follows: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(1)">
              <para>The State Governments will receive additional, revenue in 3. ways as a result of the decisions made at the Premiers&#39; Conference on 16th June 1971. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>First, the transfer from the Commonwealth to the Slates of the. right to impose pay-roll tax in the States as from 1st September 1971 is on the basis that there will be offsetting deductions from the Commonwealth&#39;s financial assistance grants to the Slates in 1971-72, but. that these deductions : will be less than the loss to Commonwealth revenue (and the gains to the States&#39; budgets at the previously existing rate of tax of 2.5 per cent) resulting from the transfer by amounts estimated at the time of the Conference at $22.7m and now estimated at $22.4m. </para>
          <para>The distribution between the States of this estimated gain of $22.4m to the States&#39; budgets in 1971-72 is shown in the Budget paper &#39;Commonwealth Payments to or for the States 1971-72 (see the penultimate line in Table 3), in which document full details are given of the arrangements under which pay-roll tax in the States was transferred to the States. </para>
          <para>The reduction  of  an estimated $22.4m in the amounts to  be  deducted from the Commonwealth&#39;s financial assistance grants to the States will also apply to the &#39;base&#39; used to determine the financial assistance grants for 1972-73 and the 3 subsequent years; and the States will therefore continue to benefit, to an increasing degree, from that reduction in those years. The amount of the benefit in years subsequent to 1971-72 cannot be estimated precisely, as it will depend on the annual increase in each State&#39;s population and on the annual increase in average wages in Australia as  a  whole, these being two  of  the elements in the formula under which the financial assistance grants increase each year. As an indication  of  the approximate effect  of  the abovementioned reduced deduction, however, it is estimated that the total benefit  to  the States over the 4 years 1971-72  to  1974-75  could  be  of the order of$100m. </para>
          <para>It should be explained that the figures mentioned above do not include the costs to the Commonwealth, and the gains, to local government authorities, arising from the Commonwealth&#39;s offer to meet the cost of exempting the non-business activities of local government authorities . from payment of pay-roll tax at the 2.5 per cent rate as from the date of transfer of the tax. The cost to the Commonwealth of that offer is estimated to amount to about $6m in 1971-72 something over $8m in 1972-73,and will increase further in subsequent years. </para>
          <para>Secondly, the Commonwealth will pay the States additional, non-recurring . special &#39;revenue assistance of$40m in 1971-72, to be distributed between the States in proportion to their financial assistance grants.The approximate amounts estimated to be payable to each State are shown&#39; in Table 39 in the Budget paperCommonwealth Payments to or for the States 1971-72&#39;. </para>
          <para>Thirdly, following the pay-roll tax transfer decision, all the States acted to increase the rate of the tax by1 per cent from 2&#189; per cent to 3&#189; per cent, as from the transfer date (1st September 1971). Only about three-quarters of the full-year effect of that increase will accrue to the benefit of State Budgets in 1971-72. It is estimated that the benefit to the 1971-72 budgets of the 6 States taken as a whole will be approximately $90m in net terms (that is excluding collections which in some States will be made in respect of wages and salaries met direct from their budgets). </para>
          <para>The benefits to State budgets in subsequent years from this  third factor will depend, obviously, on whether individual States decide to vary the rate of the tax (and if so, by how much and in what direction), as well as on movements in taxable wages and salaries in each State, and cannot, therefore, be predicted. </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>This is a hypothetical question and, if only because of the considerations referred to in the answer to (1), I am in no position to answer it. However, I can inform the honourable member that, on the basis of figures published in the December 1970 Supplement to the Treasury Information Bulletin on National Accounting Estimates of Public Authority Receipts and Expenditures, it has been calculated that recurrent expenditures by the State Governments in 1969-70 on education (comprising net current expenditure on goods and services and transfer payments) represented about 36 per cent of total State budgetary expenditures of a current nature in that year. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>See answer to (2). I add that on 5th October last, in the course of a statement on the Commonwealth Education Programme for 1971- 72, the Minister for Education and Science expressed strong reservations about accepting the figures presented by State Ministers on the needs of government schools. Even if a more precise response were capable of being given to the earlier parts of the question, I would be reluctant to compound the shortcomings to which the Minister referred in that statement by attempting the arithmetical exercises which the honourable member invites me to undertake. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>It is difficult to provide precise &#39; statistics on merchant banking type companies in Australia because of the lack of a standard definition of the&#39; term &#39;merchant bank&#39; and because of the rapid growth in the number of companies operating in this general &#39; area over the last few years. </para>
            <para>These companies usually provide a broad range of financial services including accepting and/or discounting commercial bills, receiving short-term funds and providing or arranging short or medium-term finance. They may also underwrite, sub-underwrite and arrange issues of securities for other clients; they may provide advice to companies on re-organisations, takeovers, and reconstructions; some may also provide portfolio management services. However, it should be noted that some of the companies which provide the full range of activities described above do not call themselves merchant banks and this adds to the difficulty of collecting meaningful statistics. - These problems of definition were outlined by the  Deputy,  Governor of the Reserve Bank in the 1971 G. L. Wood Memorial Lecture given recently, but some attempt was made in that address to indicate in very broad terms the number of merchant banks active in Australia, their total assets and the degree of foreign ownership. </para>

            <para>Commonwealth assistance to Australian industry is provided by way of bounties, subsidies and other payments, and by way of contributions to promotion and research. Details of those payments for 1970-71 and estimates for 1971-72 are set out in statement No. 9 attached to the Budget Speech. Particulars for 1970-71 of Commonwealth assistance to industry through the taxation system, representing for the most part taxation revenue, foregone through concessions in the income tax law, are also set out in statement No. 9. </para>
            <para>A preliminary estimate of subsidies by State Governments in 1970-71 is $18m. Although a detailed break-up of State subsidies is not yet available, the major part would consist of freight concessions. An estimate for  1971-72- is not yet available. Information is not available regarding assistance to - industry through State taxation systems. </para>

Petroleum , exploration companies, however, are paid petroleum search subsidies for certain exploratory surveys and drilling operations.

              <para>The provision of assistance to those adversely affected by natural disasters such as bushfires, floods and droughts is primarily the responsibility of State Governments which are in the best position to assess the need for, and provide, such assistance. However, in the case of major disasters requiring expenditure judged to be beyond the means of a State, the Commonwealth has always been prepared to assist the State concerned in financing relief and restoration measures. In addition, the Commonwealth has always been prepared tq assist, on humanitarian ground, in financing &#39; expenditure on emergency relief of personal hardship and distress even where relatively small .amounts have been involved. Commonwealth assistance to the States for this purpose, which amounted to more than $127m in the 6&#34; years ending 30th June 1971, does not normally extend to the &#39; cost - of restoring private assets damaged by natural disasters, it being regarded as the responsibility of the individual to provide against such losses by way of insurance. These arrangements have worked, and are working, effectively and the Government sees no need to propose a referendum concerning them. </para>

Although the Commonwealth did , not accept the recommendation for the establishment of a statutory authority, it did take note of the representations of the College of&#39; Surgeons and other interested bodies when it sets up an Expert Group on Road Safety in September last year.

Various forms of indirect taxes, while collected on a Stale and Territory basis, may in (act often relate to sales of commodities outside the region from which they are collected and not lo payments made by persons in that region.

In view of a degree of centralisation of such revenue collections, there would be little meaning in a breakdown of these receipts by the States in which the amounts are collected. </para>

In reply to that part of the honourable member&#39;s question, I replied that it was not a function of the Public Service Board to make such a decision on its own. I did not say that I did not consider it appropriate to seek the Board&#39;s advice.   </para>
